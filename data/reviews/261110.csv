Juliet was the dumb blonde cheerleader who had her Chainsaw, Garcia Hotspur the rough tattooed badass had Johnson, and Mondo Zappa is the smooth talking ladiesman who just gets the job done and has his cybernetically modified left arm; Musselback.\n· A simple yet satisfying combat system that gets deeper and more complex as you unlock upgrades and the story progresses.\n· Over-the-top ridiculous story with a wide array of interresting characters you'll already knowa thing or two about due to the stereotypical standards.\n· Special upgrades are aquired through playing gigolo minigames; you buy gifts at the store with money you earned by playing that can then be given to women who, in exchange for a little "tête-a-tête", will give you an upgrade of some sort. Before you can give her a gift, however, you have to build up enough confidence... by peeking at her t**s or legs. If she catches you staring, she'll slap you right the f**k out and leave you with blue balls. Put on your sunglasses to find out what kind of gifts she'd like, give her those gifts to fill the meter even faster, and get rewarded. It sounds silly and sexistic, and that's exactly what it is. Because SUDA51.\n· Everything you love about SUDA51 and it's still not getting old!\n\nThe Cons:\n· The story sort of throws you right in and doesn't explain itself too much. If you really want to know what's going on exactly (if you can handle that), you'll have to do some research outside of the game.\n· The style of the game is sometimes a bit overwhelming. Scenes can get chaotically stylish and colors don't always come over the way they're supposed to.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· Killer is Dead doesn't give you triple-A quality realism, but it clearly doesn't want to. Style just pours out of every single frame of Killer is Dead, giving it the unique SUDA51 feeling you'll want. SUDA51 once more annihilates the limits of style.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· If you're even remotely interrested in Killer is Dead (most likely because of its stylish visuals), don't doubt and pick it up. Killer is Dead gives you ridiculously stylish fun that few other games can live up to. 8,5/10.","May 23, 2014","true","2.9"," 304 of 373 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","304","373","0","11"

However, if you can run this game, it is well worth your time and money despite these two problems.\n\nBe sure to see the guide as well on getting this game to run up to snuff, unless you're one of those people who think a game is enhanced by a subpar framerate.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=262696032\n\ntl;dr? Get this game if you're into the hack and slash genre even slightly, enjoy a moderate amount of difficulty, or appreciate a unique visual style in a video game. (Seriously, some of the frames in some of the cutscenes in this game are wallpaper worthy.)\n\nKiller is Dead is one of the most unique games I have ever played. Perhaps not mechanically; after all, this is at it's core a hack and slash game and it does have many tropes of the genre such as a grading system and guarding/dodging mechanics. As for the mechanics themselves, they're actually very solid if a bit overly simplistic to those who are used to DMC levels of depth. However, everything about it otherwise, from it's beautiful visual style that's reminiscent of 70's esque color pallettes, character, and outdoor design gives this game loads of personality and unique identity among others in the genre. I will forever remember this game because of how unique it is.\n\nOh, and the soundtrack is a beautiful blend of electronic ambient and classical music. Often very dreamlike, much like the game itself.\n\nThis game is not without it's problems though. Sometimes, the camera may not zoom out enough to give you vital information on the next enemy telegraph, leading to mild frustration at times. You will hate the gigolo missions not because they're bad (They lack a lot of depth, though.) but because the people you date will bother you in the middle of a mission to remind you that there are, in fact, gigolo missions and the girls want to see you before their mission gets locked off until you complete a few other missions. A minor inconvenience, of course. But I am of the personal belief that side missions should not detract at all from a main campaign and should be able to be played at your own leisure. I assure you, this is said in the interest of informing about an unsatisfactory gameplay mechanic, not in regard of a controversial subject at the time of this review that I don't want to touch with a 1,000,000 foot pole because I honestly, really, could not give less of a ♥♥♥♥ if I tried, since said subject does not detract from a game for me at all. I only offhandedly mention it because some people do care and they should know it is in the game. There isn't a lot of enemy variety in this game either.\n\nHowever, this game is well worth your time and money, and I would even go as far as to say that it is a must own if you want to experience a game that is unlike most you've played. Expect challenge.","October 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 112 of 138 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","112","138","3","0"

Mondo primarily fights with a katana but also has a cybernetic left arm that can be utilized as a number of weapons.\n\nKiller is Dead displays an orgy of style and attitude that I have not seen in any game that I have played.  The visuals are of an amazing cell-shaded design. The combat is simple but satisfying.  The story is both rediculous and bizarre.  For some reason all of this comes together and mostly works.\n\nFor the most part the story appeared to be without direction.  I executed seemingly random targets and had a small feeling that the writers wanted to get to the point with the story, but it was just not developing.  Not until the last few chapters do things finally start coming together and then the story gets very predictable and cliche.\n\nCombat relied mostly with katana attacks and block/dodge combos.  Mondo does have a cybernetic left arm that has various combat utility such as ranged attacks and other functions to mix things up a little.  Combat was very smooth flowing and relied a lot on use of the blocking and dodging to maintain combos.\n\nThe one part of this game that really shined were the boss battles.  These were some of the best that I have seen in any game that I have ever played.  Bosses had a lot of personality and they were varied and fun to fight.  Especially the final boss encounter which is probably one of the better final bosses I have fought in a game.  I would have to say the bosses were the highlight of the game and everything else in between was simply filler material to make you wait for the next boss.\n\nThe game also had a lot of side activities that could be played to mix things up a little and obtain some needed upgrades to help out with the main story.  These had a lot of variety and were mostly good and were fun distractions.  However the thing that irked me the most were the gigolo side missions.  The gigolo missions were simply a mini-game were Mondo would have to ogle female targets with the goal of them not noticing and scoring a date with them.  Playing these missions were very uncomfortable when the goal of the game is to peer at the lady bits without the lady noticing.  These missions are optional but some of the coolest upgrades for Mondo's cybernetic arm are gated behind these gigolo missions.  The gigolo missions could have been designed so much better, and the idea had a lot of potential, but unfortunately KiD caters to the lowest common denominator with their depiction of women with this feature.\n\nOverall I had some decent fun with this game.  Aside from the horrible gigolo missions and the somewhat bland story, the game was quite entertaining.  The boss fights were worth the price of admission alone and if you enjoy action games with really weird and stylistic narratives then I would recommend giving this one a try.","May 28, 2014","true","16.8"," 130 of 175 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","130","175","0","8"

Killer is Dead."\n\nKiller is Dead is the latest title made by the iconic game creator SUDA51. In it you get to control the newest recruit of a reputable execution agency, Mondo Zappa, as he stalks and beheads a wide variety of criminals all across the world (sometimes even outside of it). As he settles into his new job, he also comes to terms with his own inner demons, balancing his talent for dispensing swift and brutal justice with his fleeting memories of a traumatic past, and peppering it all with his many sensual conquests.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay wise this is an extremely fun game. It is very simplistic and linear, yet you will have a good time slicing through large ammounts of enemies with your katana. Combat consists in lots of button smashing though, which after a while, gets repetitive, but you have a nice diversity of enemies too keep it "fresh". Combat which is in its majority through the game, insanely frenetic and challenging at times, being the boss fights the strongest attribute of it. You also have a nice selection of secondary weapons too once you unlock them through side-missions. Side-missions which are a nice way to offer some diversity to this game, since the main story missions are super linear, with a few collectables here and there, but excepting that, you will be walking around corridors most of the time. Some of these side missions are very fun, others are kinda lame after a while since they get extremely repetitive (gigolo missions), but they help giving the japanese vibe that this game possesses.\nThe game also as a good longetivity, I spent around 12 hours in order to complete it (side missions included).\n\nStory\n\nI found the story to be very weak. It was insanely confusing and awkward with lots of bland dialog and boring cutscenes. The oscillating tone does not work well too, it varies from emotional scenes to lame humor very fast. It has some pretty cool characters though, which help this category of the game.\n\nGraphics and Presentation\n\nGraphically this game is marvellous to look at. Incredibly stylish cel-shadded graphics give life to this incredible world. Most of the levels are gorgeous and well designed. Some are kinda lame though. I remember that one of the chapters was so dark that I had many difficulties to navigate through it, even with the brightness maxed out. Also a minus the lack of graphical options in the menus, since there is only one option to choose that goes from low, medium, high, no other options whatsoever. Despite that, the menus are slick and easy to navigate, loading screens are fast, and the menus also have a nice array of music to complement them.\n\nSound\n\nThe music and sound effects in this game are great. I deeply enjoyed the soundtrack, and the sound effects all felt right too. Voice acting is kinda "meh", nothing special, the story and dialog surely dont help in this case.\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance is great. I played on a considerably weak laptop and almost never dropped from the 30 fps cap on max settings. Unfortunately it is locked at the 30 fps mark but you can change that in the config files by following this guide - here. I also had to change the resolution in the config files since my native one was not available in-game, which is a big minus.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nGreat presentation and japanese vibe\nAmazing graphics and creative art style\nFun and frenetic combat\nGood longetivity\nCons:\nHugely confusing, weak story\nExtremely linear story missions\nLack of use of the PC technical potencial\nMy personal score: 7.0\n\nIf you like Hack 'n' Slash games and games with a japanese vibe, this is a game to get. I would advice to get in on a sale, even though the standard price is not very high, for the mixed experience you get its better to pay a little less. Nevertheless, you will have a good time playing this game, it feels good to slash through hordes of monsters and assassins.","June 20, 2015","true","11.2"," 115 of 155 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","115","155","7","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/recommended/261110/","mysterd","MysterD "The Gaming Toaster"","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/","1429 products in account","Killer is Dead: Nightmare Edition is a crazy hack-n-slash action game that feels similar to games like Devil May Cry 4 (and probably others in the series, which I have not played), in terms of gameplay. But, that's pretty much where the similarities end - KiD: Nightmare is a bat-crap crazy game - which has unique characters, unique look for a cel-shaded games, strange levels, surreal elements that feel right out of a David Lynch film, an over-the-top ridiculous story + plot, satire elements, 4th-wall breaking elements, and God knows what else. That certainly isn't everything, as this is the strangest + most unique game that I've played since Deadly Premonition. Fortunately for us PC gamers, this game actually received a decent PC port...unlike Deadly Premonition.\n\nWithout giving away too much on the story...well, it goes something like this: Mondo, who also has one bionic arm, works for an agency that assassinates people + does odd jobs. The story is just utterly over-the-top and ridiculous from there  so I'll just leave it at that, plot-wise. The game is often very cryptic, not giving you everything in dialogue + in a straight-forward manner. Many of it, is in the visuals. Even if you cannot decipher the surreal + ridiculous story in its entirety, there is something else there that can help quite a bit - which I will get to later.\n\nMondo is a character who seems to have no real attachment to anything - and just does what he has to do, whether in a main-mission or side-mission, not asking many questions and just going full-steam ahead. And once you finally get the full picture (especially if you also check out Theatre Mode - which I will get to), you'll likely understand why Mondo is the way he is, once we are revealed so much about himself & his past. Once you see this all, it'll make more sense: no wonder Mondo is so screwed-up, as he goes about the main-quest and especially the Gigolo missions like he does, with little attachment to anything & just going straight-forward with full-steam ahead.\n\nOnce you finish the game + you want some things to be cleared-up, do yourself a favor: look + read over the unlocked Theatre Mode (which you can access in-game, in The Office). This actually tells the story + each chapter, in all of its ridiculous insanity, in a very straight-forward manner. If there's something that needs to be cleared up, there's a good chance that it's in there. Though, not everything will be revealed - as it's possible some things are meant to be left ambiguous to be interepreted or leave wide-open for (hopefully) a sequel.\n\nThis game ran on Ultra settings at a very consistent + solid 30 frames per second, most of the time. I had very few hitches + slow-downs on my rig (i7 950; 1 GB VRAM GeForce 560 Ti; 16 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit OS) - namely, on one part on the final level for the main-quest, actually. Some PC gamers might complain the game is locked at 30 frames (since many here do prefer 60 frames per second for a frame-cap), but the game runs smooth as silk for the most part & looks really slick. I'd rather have it at a stable 30 frames 99% of the time than say floating anywhere at anytime b/t 30 to 60 frames often, IMHO.\n\nIts art-style oozes nothing but unique-ness. The game has a cel-shaded look, but it still looks much different than other cel-shaded games such as the FPS game XIII + Borderlands series. While it may not be the most technically looking great, its art style is ozzing style, personality, unique-ness - and that style is completely fantastic, with its look, use of colors, and everything. No other cel-shaded games looks like this - period.\n\nThe game offers up main-missions and side-missions, on the game's world-map. You select a mission and then go there. Most missions, they're quite linear - as you'll often wind-up going from point A to point B, in a linear fashion - hacking- slashing, shooting, and chopping your enemies up. Some maps are quite open, as you might have to find a few items in this huge map. Finish a map, you'll be graded - and you'll earn more money for items you can buy + also earn experience as you play to upgrade your character's skills.\n\nAs you do more main missions, you'll often unlock other side-quests. Side-quests can vary in their nature. When you finish an Episode (to the main quest), you'll often unlock other side-quests in which you re-visit areas (from the Main Quest) and have specific challenges to do - which basically have side-quests often acting like challenge-maps that you'd see in other games. It could be a timed-event. It could be finding a specific item in the area and exiting the area. It could be just a specific new side-mission in that area. Who knows, roll the dice - as that is pretty much the kind of variety & insanity that comes with this game.\n\nThere are even side-missions where you play a Gigolo and try to seduce girls, in which they often up certain weapons + upgrades that you can only from doing these missions. As silly & ridiculous as these Gigolo missions are, where you have to check-out the girls, look at them, ogle them, etc..especially when they aren't paying attention - this just enforces plenty of the game's already often 4th wall breaking + satire elements, making Mondo seem like a very flawed James Bond-like type of character - and slickly also being a satire on the world of assassins and spies, as well. Simply put: this game is loaded with over-the-top sex (from the Gigolo missions) and violence (from namely the main-missions).\n\nEven when you finish the game's main quest, you can re-do any missions you've done or not done - and continue in the game-world, which is great for players who want to master the game. Also, when selecting a mission from the world-map - the player can switch the difficulty of the even the level itself at any time. Since each difficulty had your best grade tied to it, people who want to master this game are likely going to replay it.\n\nWith the X360 gamepad (which is how I played the game) - the combat looks + feels absolutely awesome. While it does take a little bit to get going as it eases the player into learning the game early on - once the game gets going, it gets going. The game gets better and better with its combat, once you get more skills + upgrades and more different enemy types to take on. Also throw in some awesome finishing moves (cutting people's heads off & slicing people in half) & incredible boss-fights, the game is nothing short of an action-packed roller-coaster ride.\n\nAfter the 12-13 hours that I appoximately spent with this game (on my 1st run), I was left with an often awesome, unique & crazy game. This over-the-top, utterly ridiculous, hack-n-slash game is an absolute blast, especially in the main missions. While some of the side-missions (challenge style missions + the repetitive nature of the Gigolo missions) are nowhere as great as the main-mission stuff + sometimes leave a little left to be desired here, they're still optional for the player to have things to do + challenges to take on, if you feel inclined. The unique art-style implemented in this cel-shaded game look great and the game runs extremely well (even if it is locked at 30 frames per second). Add onto this all that the game also has unique characters & a bat-crap crazy story + plot, satire elements, and 4th-wall breaking elements - this game is going to have its own cult-following for this stuff alone. Add onto it that gamers who might not care about the story stuff might want awesome combat, excellent boss fights - that is here, as well. Gamers who want it all - action, story, plot, insanity, you're not going to be left behind. There's just too much to like + love here for gamers to ignore; especially hack-n-slash action gamers. Killer Is Dead is the name of the game, but it's more like Killer Is Alive. This game feels alive, thrives (in so many ways) & is an absolutely awesome hack-n-slash action game.\n\nGrade = B.","February 15, 2015","true","11.1"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","56","65","4","0"

I first got introduced to his game with killer 7 on the Nintendo Gamecube. With that being said i truly enjoyed the romp-through of this game, the randomness, the comedy that is normally expected from Suda 51.\n\nThis game i will admit is the reason why i upgrade my PC. Killer is Dead had an error that would cause a event in the game to lock and prevent the player from progressing the story. This error pretty much effected those with dual core processors. Because of the devs reluctance to patch this game i was forced to upgrade since their were no patch in sight.\n\nWhen i finally got back into the game their were put offs about it that prevent me from playing. Bumping into blockage that are boss fights also prevent me from progressing further. I then realize that their were key elements to mastering this game and its enemies. The key element being "Dodging", the main fundamental of this game, the key to your victories. You master this, you master the game.\n\nAnyway this game is pretty much a thrill ride. The lack of complex moves and skill will prevent the most die hard of beat em up fans from enjoying their play-through, but the satisfying feel of taking down enemies will keep your average player hooked.\n\nThe story; though not great, is your semi-cliche anime type of twist, but who is playing for the story? Not me! The game is separated in episodes so you'll feel like you're watching a season of a particular anime series. The presentation is all there for the player to love and enjoy while enemy bashing your way through the end.\n\nI found this game very enjoyable once i mastered dodging into countering and boy is that satisfying. This game is a definite buy for the beat em up crowd and definitely a game one should have in their Steam library. My dream one day is to have even more Japanese beat em ups to choose from in the future but having this game among others on steam is a great start.","October 5, 2015","true","33.3"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","2"

Professional killers hired by the state and high ranked clients to do jobs that no one else should ever know about. Monsters, maniacs and creepy mutants – everything is real in this world and we try to keep it a secret. The ‚Dark Matter‘ curses everything it comes in contact with, transforming it piece by piece into the abominations called 'Wires'. Do you know where this ‚Dark Matter‘ comes from? From the moon! The dark side of the moon to be more precise. It is ruled by a mysterious man and this person gathers the darkness to take over earth. Sounds like solving this problem is the perfect job for you Mondo, isn‘t it?‘\n\nAre you confused? Yes? Then remember this feeling, you’ll get used to it: welcome to the world of ‚Killer is Dead‘ – where everything is possible and possibly wants to kill you. Playing as a professional executioner called Mondo Zappa you start slicing your way through so called ‚Wires‘ to find the truth behind the mysterious ‚Dark Matter‘, a lady in red and the dark ruler of the moon. It’s a typical Suda51 game – at first you don’t understand anything that is happening and after reaching the end you stopped believing that you would ever understand what is going on. However at least you can enjoy some great fighting scenes, some unusual locations and of course… beautiful women.\n\nThe things about 'Killer is Dead' that really stand out from the crowd are the special art style and the visuals: Not only the setting and the atmosphere, but also the fast fights and some really badass scenes create a nice overall picture and hide the fact that e.g. the textures are pretty much just average. Lots and lots of blood, beautiful and stylish fights, fast-paced animations and the usage of different art styles in cutscenes create some amazing scenes and a nice, totally weird atmosphere (and due to all the blood it looks like it's directed by Quentin Tarentino). This atmosphere is also supported by an easy but badass looking fighting system (that unfortunately lacks some depth) and an amazing soundtrack - there are some really entertaining and catchy tracks that keep you pumped up while slicing enemies into itsy-bitsy pieces or blast the right onto the moon. The twelve main missions with a weird but at least solid story will entertain you for approximately 5 or 6 hours in the first run, but to keep the executioner in you entertained there are also five difficulty levels, different side quests and twenty challenges. And of course there are beautiful ladies waiting for our beloved Mondo if he needs to relax after some missions. He’s the real Prince Charming – riding on a shiny unicorn and armed with a katana and a mutated dark arm that can turn into a plasma cannon. Yes he has his own unicorn. Business as usual.\n\nUnfortunately these good points can’t hide some of the problems that the game really suffers from: First the fighting system is ‚easy-to-learn‘, has a nice feedback and looks badass, but unfortunately it has the depth of a small puddle – this professional killer don't really has a huge repertoire of awesome moves, so most fights will feel the same to you. Furthermore some side quests are a real pain and you definitly notice that the game is only a port and has been developed for consoles - few settings, some problems like crashes and there may be even possible game-breaking bugs (fortunately I didn't encounter any problems while playing). Another point is the story itself: it is solid, has some great scenes and introduces interesting characters, but at the same time it holds back with information and tries to throw out some profound quotes and meaningful conversations. They should question moral aspects, actions and behavior of the characters but most of the time it ends with weird sentences that aren’t actually making any sense and leave a quite confused player (to be honest: without reading some background information in the ‚Theater Mode‘ you won’t understand what is actually happing for at least 50% of the time, sitting there and asking yourself why exactly everybody is freaking out, what is actually happening or what the symbols and figures (e.g. the planets) the game uses from time to time actually mean. But hey, at least you can enjoy the nice scenes and beat the crap out of bosses.).\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIn the end this game is a double-edged sword katana – fast and badass fights without much depth meet linear levels without many secrets and an extraordinary story that tries to provide meaningful dialogues but often ends with a confused player just slicing up everything he meets. All this is happening in a weird atmosphere, with special art-style and some really great cutscenes that cover up some 'meh' textures.\n\nOverall this game is special and typically SUDA51: Not for everybody, it would have definitly benefited from some nice polishing, nevertheless it's entertaining enough to maintain your attention and excitement for several hours. I’d call it a solid 6 or 7 out of 10. If you like freaky stuff mixed up with badass scenes focusing on style and even more weird stuff that's happening all over the screen you can add some more points.\n\nAnd after finishing this review I feel like ending it with Mondo‘s words:\n'Killer… Killer is Dead.‘","September 22, 2015","true","35.2"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","33","44","2","0"

It's completely devoid of any kind of developed combo system, you simply have normal attacks and guard breaking punches. It's chock full of quicktime events for finishing bosses, finishing normal enemies, even when you dodge an attack with a specific timing you get a little quicktime event pop-up to mash attack for loads of free damage. Fights very rarely have any fancy tactics involved, just mash attack with occasional guard breaks and dodge or block when an enemy flashes red. There are subweapons, but using them puts you into an over the shoulder shooter aiming mode which completely kills the flow of gameplay and controls really sluggishly. For some reason Grasshoper also didn't see fit to put in a lock on function so when you're fighting multiple enemies and you want to target a specific one you have to just push the stick/wasd towards them and hope the game picks the right enemy out of the horde. In normal play this isn't a huge problem but it makes some of the optional challenges a nightmare.\n\nMechanically this game also has a whole lot of problems. There's a lot of hitbox and collision bugs, I've witnessed more than a few enemies and items spazzing all over the place because they intersected each other and the game didn't know where to put them. Sometimes these collision issues result in you dodging from enemies and getting stuck on other enemies that visually you have plenty of space to pass by making you take unneccesary damage. The game also has issues distinguishing priority between block and dodge which are bound to the same button and you'll end up doing a parry when you're trying to dodge. Again this is more of an issue with the challenges because when you're doing a timed mission you don't want to waste seconds in fancy parry animations when you're trying to roll over to where you want to be. These mechanic issues are all minor compared to the actually game breaking ones, like softlocks when the options disappear from the menu or the audio cuts out in bossfights, and plenty of people have issues with the game completely crashing in the third chapter which as of yet there are no reliable fixes for.\n\nPretty much the only positive thing I can say about the game is it has a nice visual aesthetic, but even that only carries as far as its cutscenes. The cel shaded visuals look great in the carefully crafted cutscenes but in gameplay the high contrast lighting makes colorful items look plastic and darker areas look muddled and confusing.\n\nWatch it on youtube, you'll get all of the visuals with none of the frustrating bugs and poor game design. If you really want an action game go play DMC4, that's a much better port with a much better combat system.","July 1, 2014","false","9.1"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","1"

However, neither of these describe the game.\nIt certainly has many "wtf"-moments, and at the beginning it even seems like it would deliver both of these expectations instead of just one. The art style is superb, the mood combined with the OST fascinating and yet you keep wondering "what the hell is just happening?". However, it just doesn't develop at all from that point on.\n\nThe first and probably the main problem is the gameplay. Most of the time you have to fight your way through maybe 10 different types of enemies in total. Almost all of them can easily be defeated by stupid button smashing of your standard attack with some evasions thrown in at random. There is a mechanic to press your evasion button just as enemies attack to counter them with a "smash x!"-multiattack, but the cue and time window for these is so small that I found myself ignoring it completely and just pressing the evasion whenever I felt like it. Many times you even trigger the event with this playstyle. Enemies in the air can only be killed with ranged combat, which basically means holding a single button down for 10+ seconds while aiming at them. In the end, every stage just felt like mindless button smashing to victory. And believe me, the stages sometimes feel like an eternity. There is absolutely nothing interesting happening within them at all. Defeat five enemies, go to the next room, defeat ten enemies, go to the next room, repeat until boss fight starts.\nWhile the bosses all have different patterns how to defeat them, they are not that much fun either. The whole combat system is just too simplistic to have any entertainment value.\n\nApart from the main missions there is also the possibility to do sidemissions at any point: These are either more of the dull combat system (challenges for time or similar stuff) or the absolutely ridiculous "Gigolo Missions". I'm not kidding right now: In each of these missions, you sit somewhere with a woman and have to look at their body without them noticing. They say like 5 phrases again and again and either look at you or awkwardly somewhere else. While they look away, you stare at their breasts or legs and gain "guts". You also have glasses that let you see these women in underwear and what kind of presents they like, which further increases these guts. Once you have enough, you can give them a present, ultimately getting them into bed that way (and getting a new weapon). I have absolutely no idea what the developers of this game were thinking implementing this. It's the most awkward and stupid thing I've ever seen in any game, even the gameplay during that is ridiculously monotone. Seeing this feels like an insult.\n\nSo, what's left? Ah right, the story. Before and after each mission, we get sequences usually between five and ten minutes. These are most of the time completely based on the mission at hand, but all refer somehow to the moon that makes the "mysterious main theme". However, the story isn't really developing in any way. Most of the time there are just a few sentences that leave more questions than they answer. Not in a good "put the pieces together" way though. Some missions are also dream sequences from the main character which seem to point to personal conflicts of him, but they are delivered so flat that there's absolutely no emotional impact at all.\nIn the end, it feels like the writers just added everything that came into their mind on a whim. The story development is minmal at best and can be summarized with a few sentences. Nevertheless it always feels like the story wants to be poetic and open to interpretation, which makes this even worse. There's even a great story twist that didn't feel like a twist at all due to the way the story is delivered. And while there are many "wtf" moments, including unicorns, vampires, aliens, ghosts and whatnot, the game takes itself too serious to be enjoyable in that way.\n\nSummary: Don't waste your time on this. It looks cool, that's about everything good there is to say.","August 15, 2014","false","10.7"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","45","66","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/261110/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When Killer is Dead was released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2013, it made waves for its striking art style and controversial gigolo side missions, but PC gamers didn’t want to sit idly by while they missed out on Suda 51’s latest surreal experience. Thus, Deep Silver and Kadokawa Games have teamed up to bring the sword swinging hack and slasher to Steam at an affordable, and very reasonable price. With even more refined visuals, keyboard and mouse controls, and a new difficulty mode, considering this is a new territory for the developer, they seem to have made out very well, all things considered.\n\nKiller is Dead stars an executioner named Mondo Zappa who has recently become a major cog at Bryan’s Executioner Office. The Executioner Office is the country’s first line of defense, banked on tax dollars and serving the state. Well, in theory at least, as most of its clients are individual citizens who come to the firm with a unique problem. There’s the man with a giant spider monster terrorizing his house, a musician who had her ears stolen and a woman in crisis from the dark side of the moon just to name a few. There’s never a job the office doesn’t take, and while Mondo is sent out on the bulk of them, he has assistance in the form of Bryan, Vivienne and Mika. Vivienne is a femme fatale with a dozen arms that shoot out of her back and fire guns, Bryan is the head of the operation who is one cybernetic implant away from becoming a robot and Mika is a young runaway that Mondo takes in because she’s good at making soft-boiled eggs. All the characters in the game are interesting, from the major players to the bit ones, with Bryan a standout outside of the protagonist. His cryptic messages and nonchalance helps elevate the surrealism of the situations.\n\nI’d go deeper into the plot, but find that difficult for two reasons: it would spoil the fun of unraveling the story and it’s incredibly abstract and difficult to put into words. Killer is Dead has a narrative that plops you into the middle of a mysterious world playing as a character you know little about. It takes place in the distant future as evidenced by Mondo’s cybernetic arm and the moon being inhabited. Indeed, the cover art is not just for show and the moon plays a significant part in the game. As the plot progresses, more is revealed about the characters and just what the hell is happening, rewarding those who stick with it and attempt to piece it all together.\n\nMatching the idiosyncrasy of the plot are the bizarre level designs. There’s a stage reminiscent of an M.C. Escher painting as imagined by Lewis Carroll, complete with stairs on the walls, and one that takes place in a thousand-story building. This is a game that literally goes straight to the moon within the first few hours, so except anything and everything. The unique setting of areas helps the game from feeling repetitive, although they aren’t always the most inspired, with more indoor corridors than I would have liked. The boss designs are some of the strangest in recent memories, rivaling even the Slurm Queen in DmC.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a hack and slash and somewhat reminiscent of Devil May Cry. Mondo’s main weapon is his beloved katana, Gekkou, which absorbs blood and boosts his fighting ability. Blood can be used for multiple things, the most notable being the “Adrenaline Burst.” An enemy can be cut in half (usually right down the middle) upon being stunned, destroying them in one hit. The most important use of blood is to grant the ability to harness the power of Mondo’s cybernetic left arm, which is called the “Musselback.” Multiple (some unlockable) sub-weapons can be loaded into the Musselback, including the Bullet Shot, Freeze Shooter and Drill. The Bullet Shot is basically a gun and can be charged for more damage, the Freeze Shooter fires frozen bullets to slow enemies down and the Drill is a giant drill. The Bullet Shot is the most practical out of the three, although each has its own advantage.\n\nMost of the time, however, expect to be hacking and slashing. Most of the action happens by the way of the square button, which creates lighting quick combos. Holding down the same button does a circular “Moon Slash,” while hitting triangle breaks guard. On the defensive side of things, holding circle brings Mondo into a guard, while tapping it makes him dodge. If an attack is successfully dodged, it brings up a prompt to counter-attack, which allows the enemy to be sliced and diced in slow-motion. While it’s a wholly satisfying combat system, it does feel a bit outdated after the smoothness of both DmC and Metal Gear Rising.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking feature about the game is that of the “Gigolo Missions,” which is surprising in a game that has a character sprout legs out of her back and crawl around the ceiling. These are mini-games that can be completed in-between missions, with the ultimate goal being to seduce a woman for pleasure and weapons. Every mission has Mondo approach an attractive woman and begin seducing her the “Gigolo Vision” and sneaking a peak of her private areas when she’s not looking. You can look at her face too, but as the tutorial states, “staring at her face won’t increase your Guts, go for the sexy shots!” Mondo can restore the mood by looking in her eyes, however, which is necessary as she’ll ditch you if it cools off enough. Once you’ve gained enough guts by staring at her, you give her presents until she falls in love with you and gives you a weapon. It’s hard to predict how people will react to this mode, and I’m not touching that with a ten foot poll, but it’s surprisingly entertaining and all in good fun.\n\nIt’s surprising Killer is Dead has received a PC port, especially considering we’ve only seen one other game from Grasshopper Manufacture breech the open ended barrier. Unfortunately, Nightmare Edition is a little below expectations. There’s a lack of options when it comes to visuals as it’s summed up in a single quality meter ranging from high to low. That’s not the concerning matter – it’s actually more stunning a nine month old console port of this caliber had any graphical selections at all – but it’s the five supported resolutions and limited frame rate that’s worrisome. It’s only disappointing because the game actually supports more than 30fps and any resolution possible, but to unlock these, players will have to go into ini file and manually change the settings themselves.\n\nBesides that, though, the Killer is Dead really shines on PC, showcasing the studio’s beautiful artwork.Killer is Dead is not everybody’s cup of tea. It’s avant-garde, darkly humorous, hyper-violent and different from most every game out there. It’s like the weirdness of Killer 7, Lollipop Chainsaw, Anarchy Reigns and Catherine rolled into one game, but narratively removed from anything that’s come before it. Out of the box, the Nightmare Edition is a baffling package.","April 11, 2015","true","106.3"," 59 of 97 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","59","97","4","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/261110/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Killer is Dead is a Hack and Slash game that has you playing as a katana wielding ladies’ man named Mondo. He works as an assassin for a secret agency and is accompanied by his assistant called Mika, who he mostly keeps around because she is good at making half boiled eggs. Right from the get go you will have no idea what is going on as this game relishes on its weirdness and it isn't even mentioned what the enemies you are fighting actually are until rather late in the game. This game doesn't take itself seriously at all and will often break the fourth wall. The voice acting is sub-par but it fits in with the wacky B rated theme it has going on. The characters are consistently interacting with each other and are all memorable. Killer is Dead is very cut-scene and doesn't really tell anything resembling a story until later on, as Mondo gets some character development and evolves from being a bland forgettable character into something more interesting that makes you question who your allies are.\n\nTo get this out of the way I must mention that the game is locked at 30fps. In this type of genre that is a big negative against it as it effects the fluidity and responsiveness of the combat which is most of what you'll be doing most. Another negative is that the game's highest resolution is 1080p. Both of these issues can be fixed by tweaking certain config files, though raising the frame rate over 30 does make menus harder to navigate due to being running far too fast. It is manageable going through the menus at 60fps but raising it to 144 makes it near unusable. Expect plenty of framerate dips as well. I do find it rather odd that it is even 30fps to begin with as it is by no means looks like a game that the seventh gen consoles would have trouble running. It is by no means unplayable but it is unfortunately a pretty bad PC port. With that out of the way the game features 5 difficulty modes to choose from and 12 main missions. One mission is entirely a cutscene, another has a bit of combat but is mostly a cutscene as well and the final mission is actually the same map from earlier in the game.\n\nAll main missions called “Contracts” are pretty memorable and vary wildly from one another. One may have you searching through a dollhouse and in another you may be fighting off giant aliens. The wackiness helps keeps you wanting to play the game and knowing that there is a giant bizarre boss to fight at the end of each mission keeps you going forward. Common enemies are called Wires and are the creatures you will be slaughtering throughout the game. They come in different sizes and can wield guns, riot shields and various melee weapons. While they have bland appearances they are still quickly recognizable, so you will know how to handle that fight as soon as you lay eyes on them. In addition to Mondo's katana he has a robotic left arm that can fire bullets and is powered by the blood of his enemies. Unlike most games of this genre your ranged weapon is surprisingly powerful and can kill the weaker enemies with a single head shot, though due to it being powered by blood you will need to go face to face with your enemies to refill it. The only way to regenerate your health is to consume the blood stored in your synthetic arm to restore your health causing you to find a balance between ranged offense and emergency health.\n\nYou will not be able to restore your health from the get go and must collect yellow gems that defeated enemies drop to unlock that ability. In fact you can't do much at the start other than mash the attack button and occasionally use your power attack to break through some enemies guards. It does get very repetitive if you don't upgrade your melee skills early on and would not be unthinkable if someone played the first few levels, saw the nonsensical story and bare-bones gameplay then never gave the game another shot. Even with maxed out skills, combat doesn't really get much deeper than launching an enemy up with a strike or being able to charge up your power attack. What made the combat more enjoyable was an upgrade that made your katana glow blue and strike much faster the higher your combo count goes, giving you a good reason not to get hit and makes you feel skilled. Not getting hit is easier said than done as the camera is less than stellar. It is surprisingly bad and will often get you in trouble. It is bad to the point that I would rather have my thumb on the right stick that controls the camera instead of the attack button.\n\nBlocking and dodging is rather important here since enemies will not stay stun locked for long and will attack you mid combo. Blocking in just the right moment will cause you to parry and allow you to mash the attack button in a black and white quick time event that causes serious damage to that enemy. Get your combo meter high enough and you can start to execute wounded enemies in a style of your choice. There are four ways to execute a foe and each grant you a certain item like crystals for health, roses for blood and the yellow gems you need to upgrade. Collecting enough crystals or roses will slightly increase the amount of health you have or the amount of blood you can store. Bosses are where you will want a good defense as they will smack you around the arena and often have a form of homing attack that is hard to dodge. Attacking bosses with your katana also fills up your blood meter but using your regenerating ability is a good way to get yourself even more wounded as there is quite a delay from letting go of the button and being able to move again. That is not a flaw and feels like a good way to keep you from cheesing through the game or what is supposed to be an epic life or death boss fight. All bosses have three different forms that change once you deplete their life bar and become more dangerous the closer they are to being defeated.\n\nAs said before the story is very weird and gets interesting towards the middle half. It's not a particularly good story and is too open for interpretation, making it feel disjointed but you can't help but worry about the fun cast of characters. Along with the main missions there is this odd mini game in where you go on a date with a woman of your choice and try to sneak a peek at her with your X-ray glasses. Once enough blood goes to your head from sufficient ogling you will be able to give her gifts until she comes back to your place. It is odd to say the least. They are necessary if you want all the sub-weapons however. Challenges are a bunch of small missions that have you doing stuff like shooting down barrels with a turret or playing through small sections of a level and are mostly throw away filler. They do give you money like real missions however so that's a bit of an incentive. Money is used to buy the aforementioned gifts and can also be used to buy extra costumes that characters can wear. Even after completing the game you can still play through any mission and earn up extra cash for those expensive new costumes that are unlocked once you finish the story. It's a good way to motivate you to replay missions and maybe try them on a higher difficulty mode.\n\nGraphics have a nice, stylish comic book vibe to them and can feel like a cartoon at times due to its silliness. Music is pretty good as well and is used in great conjunction to what is going on. Killer is Dead is a game that oozes charm and style but has a lot of flaws that really drag it down. It is no doubt a memorable game, though it is not that fun to play due to the terrible camera. I'm not a fan of there being no jump button so you could juggle enemies or be able to jump out of the way of attacks instead of relying on the short dash. This is the kind of game I would only recommend to those searching for a weird, unique and outlandish experience if they think they can deal with the camera, the PC port issues and some pretty run of the mill combat.","December 8, 2015","true","8.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Killer is Dead.\n\nThis game is a hyper stylized anime. I highly recommend using the Japanese voice over rather than the English.\n\nYou play as Mondo Zappa. A hired Killer or Executioner as far as I understand. I'm not entirely sure if this game was made by Suda51 or just inspired however its extremely in Suda51 style regardless. Additionally is not a successor to Killer7 to the best of my knowledge despite the obvious comparison.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive. There were only occasional sections were I felt the game was being cheap. Mostly the sections where flying enemies were being spawned behind you. However overall anytime I was failing a mission. It felt like it was me being impatient with the game. There are leveling mechanics; Health bar, blood bar (special bar). As well as Carnage that can be spent on upgrading your abilities such as combos.\n\nThe story is told through chapters and each one completed opens up additional side missions. Which initially seems great. Who doesn't want more videogame to play. They just feel tacked on. Some are fun, some are even challenging. The game isn't long by any stretch but with underwhelming side missions, personally, I found my interest was waning near the end game. Though it does have a nice climatic ending, Its very well done. Almost made me go back and complete the side missions I had not already completed.\n\nThere are some technical issues\nThe game after setup is locked at 720p @ 31fps. Which is very strange. A simple .ini file edit can fix the fps to your refresh rate or desired one as well as the resolution. But beware, should you desire to complete the Gigolo side missions, you'll need to change the fps back to 31 (I believe its the max smooth rate line you need to edit) Otherwise the game will hard lock.\n\nThere is a lot of extra stuff despite the main campaign being about 7 hours. Desire to complete them all will vary from person to person.","May 5, 2015","true","8.0"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

Suda51 goes for a more darker, noir-like tone, as opposed to his more brighter games such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. Despite the darker tone, it's still one of those games that doesn't take it's self too seriously, yet still offers an interesting story; albeit a slightly incoherent one. This is probably one of Suda51's most cryptic games in terms of story, it has an open ended ending which can allow for multiple interpretations and many questions are left unanswered by the end of the game.\n\n\nThe game mechanics for the most part are simple, attack, guard break/circle around the enemies when they block attacks, and counter/parry enemy attacks. Despite the simple mechanics I never felt the game got repetitive. Every mission had a distinct design with it's own unique boss. And to break the monotony there are sub-missions and Gigolo missions you can perform in between the main story.\n\nPros:\nUnique setting dripping in Suda51's style.\nLots of variety in missions.\nNice amounts of side content.\nSimple yet still engaging fighting system.\n\nCons:\nIssues with Dual Core CPUS.\nSomewhat incoherent story, maybe to lead towards a sequel.\nOccasional slowdown, didn't happen too often but at random times the FPS would dip.\n\n9/10","December 26, 2014","true","37.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Dante Mondo fights using a sword and a gun against a variety of enemies to try to stop Vergil David, who uses a sword as well but does not use a gun and has more fully embraced the dark power they both wield.\n\nJokes aside, Killer is Dead is very much "what if Suda 51 did Devil May Cry". The game absolutely oozes Suda 51 style, from the art style to the completely ridiculous and over the top characters and bosses. The combat is quite a bit simpler than DMC, revolving (mostly) around a single attack button and a block/dodge button, but is quite enjoyable and fast-paced nonetheless. The plot of the game isn't much to speak of, it only really picks up during the last few chapters. Overall, KiD, while having very obvious influences, is a very fun game with that marvelous Suda 51 style.","March 7, 2015","true","14.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","9","11","5","2"

The storyline also does not shout out loud saying that "I'M PART OF THE STORY!". It is very subtle that is broken up into sections of the game that needs to be connected per section, from start to the end, to understand the full story.\n\nWithout the high expectations of strong graphics and putting aside the rated content and sexism, this game is defnitely underated and is worth the buy.

Crashes, bugs that cause your unavoidable death, terrible controls and terrible camera. Not all issues are because it's a bad port, but most of them and it doesn't look like the developer cares at all. Avoid paying more than $5 for this. The dating-sim mini game would be fun, if the game didn't just randomly crash. The combat would be nice, if you could actually see your enemy without having to turn the camera manually by 180 degrees every 5 seconds. The graphics are obviously stylized, but that doesn't explain the 30 fps cap (which can luckily be fixed, the complete lack of anti-aliasing (good luck modding that without breaking the game even more) and ridiculous loading times even on a high-end system with SSD. An AI basically doesn't exist. Monsters will just rush at you and attack from time to time. Extremely easy to predict. And way too much button-smashing. I understand that this is somehow supposed to be a main feature of the game (can destrying fingers and buttons be considered a feature?), but it's just way too much. Is there a story? Not sure. The game crashed again before I could find out. But so far it doesn't seem like there is any story that makes sense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Milesaru/recommended/261110/","Milesaru","Milesaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Milesaru/","287 products in account","6 hours in and I've found this game to be a bit of a disappointment so far. Being a huge Killer 7 fan, I was really hoping Killer Is Dead would grab me for more than just its bizarre visuals but unfortunately I have to say that it's failed in achieving that so far. 5/10.\n\nWhilst the game does have the unique, trippy visuals that scream Suda51, the combat feels somewhat lack luster and lazy in some aspects but mediocore in general, whilst the cutscenes and dialogue had me facepalming on the regular due to non-sensical ramblings or tired one-liners used by the odd and partially irritating cast.\n\nFor an action game, there felt like there wasn't quite enough of it at near the start and when there was, it was a case of the player being forced to walk down long stretching alleyways against gunfire or whaling on groups of enemies instructed to stop you but instead passively stand and stare, waiting to be kill off. It wouldn't be so bad if the main bread and butter attacks weren't disabled until you get to arbitrary points of a level but because of this, it felt like a slow, restrictive start.  There were also a few times where I wondered whether the dev team thought that certain parts of the game were actually of any fun; like having the ability to run disabled and forced to mindlessly walk through areas. Puzzles have been thrown in throughout the levels to mix it up a bit but from what I've seen so far, there's nothing really smart that stood out.\n\nThe combat is probably the main reason I got Killer Is Dead and it's the game's saving grace. It handles like your typical, modern combat-orintated action title but doesn't really innovate on any of the main aspects of the genre. The parrying and dodge mechanics works as you'd expect, with Mondo performing special attacks if incoming attacks are parried or dodged at the last moment. Successfully dodging a string of attacks and following each one up with a flurry of slow-lo slashes feels good, even if executing these kind of attacks are quite QTE based. Because of the artstyle though, it can sometimes be hard to tell foes apart or see attacks coming if there's a large skirmish.\n\nOne combat system I wasn't keen on was the fact that, to finish off a boss, Mondo would need to have at least 1 bar filled on the Blood Gauge. Considering that some enemies have to be weakened and stunned before they can be killed, getting one into a stunned state only to find that you just about lack the blood needed to land that fatal blow gets annoying pretty quick, especially when that boss snaps out of stun, they'll regain a sizeable chunk of their health back. It's reminds me of the hassle that came with using the melee takedowns in Deus-Ex: HR and the frustration of being just a fraction of battery power off doing what you need to do at a crucial time. Even though adds are usually there for you to kill and accumulate blood with, it's easy to want to spend that blood on much needed health or to instinctively use the moves that help make the combat fun.\n\nSome of the inputs for the special moves felt a tad counter intuitive too. For example,  the uppercut slash (Down+Up+X) felt right in Devil May Cry because of the auto-lock system KID lacks. Having your character run away from the enemy your trying to launch makes you second-guess whether you'll execute the move in the right direction or not. Not only that, you can't combo into this move either, so having to make the effort of halting your offensive to accommodate for it is a little jarring to the flow of combat. It does leave me wondering why there isn't any form of aerial combat, even more so when you consider that your ranged weapons run off the same resource needed to finish off enemies or regenerate health, feeding back into the issue raised earlier when fighting flying or wallcrawling enemies or bosses.\n\nI find all of the main characters hard to love. I'd be able to tolerate Mondo if it wasn't for the ridiculous sweep of his hair he does whilst stating "Killer is Dead" at the beginning of nearly every main mission, it makes me cringe every time I see and/or hear it. Mondo's sidekick, Mika, is some teenage girl whose constant whinings and dizziness seem archetypical of some of the characters found in stereotypical anime and is the kind of character that's bound to send Anita Sarkeesian fans into an unbridled fit of rage. Almost every time she appeared the thought "I hope she dies at some point" entered my head. As for the other characters, well, there's Cyborg from the Teen Titans and Eva from the Metal Gear Solid series essentially, or at least that's what I thought the instant I seen them.\n\nAnother seemingly important and equally questionable part of the game are the "Gigalo" missions. These consist of havng Mondo take some chick on a date and then having him stare at their ♥♥♥♥ for as long as possible without being caught, culminating in a showering of stupidly expensive gifts you had to buy beforehand, oh, and this is all done so they give you a new weapon as a token of their affection, you know, like in real life. I mean, if dating sims are your thing, great, go for it, but it feels a little unnecessary andbut paradoxically not out of place in Killer Is Dead. Either way, I wasn't a fan.\n\nAll in all, Killer Is Dead certainly isn't a bad game as such but I wouldn't say it's a great game either. You can tell a lot of work's gone into it and I haven't encounter any of the bugs that other people seem to be getting. If you're a Suda51 fan then it'll be right up your street but don't expect anything from the combat that you haven't seen from other quick-paced recent action titles like Devil May Cry or MGS:Revengeance. Actually, even if you've never played a Suda51 game before, Killer Is Dead could still be an alright introduction into the kind of bat-♥♥♥♥ craziness he's renowned for.","May 24, 2014","false","6.8"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","30","52","0","0"

If you're willing to give the Hack and Slash sub-genre a chance, you'll witness a very stylish cell-shaded game with challenging gameplay and hot chicks.\n\nThe premise is similar to Suda51's No More Heroes and Killer7 in that you work as a hitman or "executioner" (in this game's terms) named Mondo Zappa. You're given contracts that serve as the game's main story mode, as well as side missions like dates and challenges. After every completed contract, you're paid an amount based on the difficulty and can unlock new missions, challenges, costumes, gear, and even gifts for you to use on dates.\n\nMondo's main weapon is a sword, it's upgradable via the Moon Crystals that drop after killing enemies. You're also able to upgrade a sidearm, literally. You're entire left arm is 4-in-1 weapon that is upgradable in the same way as your sword. You're also able to upgrade Mondo with new abilities such health recovery via blood and an upgraded dash.\n\nDodging and dealing consecutive damage is important in this game. You're rewarded for dodging enemy attacks at the last second with a counter attack called "dodge burst" with turns you into Kenshiro with a sword. This also becomes essential in later boss fights, where survival is key. Increasing your combo duration can also land you bonus drops from enemies like extra moon crystals for your upgrades. Overall, it becomes important to learn the enemy's movements.\n\nLet's not forget that this game is a port. It runs at 30fps by default, but with a few guides in the game's hub, you'll be able to run it at 60fps or higher. The game also fails to provide a decent amount of video settings at all. If you have a computer that runs most games pretty well, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nFor $20, is a good deal. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge or to any fan of Hack and Slash games in general. If the dating sim is your thing, just think: A delicious brown woman, a cute Japanese girl, a vampire lady, and a healthy nurse that speaks in sexual innuendos are waiting to be picked up by you right now!","November 16, 2014","true","24.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The final result of this is an outstanding port (thank you unreal engine) from the "how well it runs" section. Unfortunetly the options leave much to be desired giving you only low, medium, and high options for visuals.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is as predictibly unpredictable and crazy as every Suda51 game is. Essentially you play Mondo Zappa who is a badass. He does badass things with a badass katana and the government pays him millions just so he can upkeep that hair. There's also something about him being an assassin and killing things but really the game is all about that hair. If you have never played a Suda51 game expect to be confused at first, but things fall into place and it all (mostly?) makes sense by the end. Expect to learn and discover many things you missed if you ever give it a second go through.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis is an action game not a world conquering simulator just as a warning for anyone who may be confused. The combat is very simple yet incredibly well done. From the start there is an attack button, a block/dodge button, a guard-break button, and a sub-weapon you may use. There are also alternate context-specific buttons and an upgrade tree that allows for progression as you play granting you new moves. Through the simple attack and blocks you will be pulling off incredibly satisfying combos of over 100 hits in just a matter of seconds. The better your combo the faster you attack. These mechanics all come together to create a deep engaging experience that leaves very little left to be wanted. I do suggest you play on hard your first go-round as (with most action games) the mechanics do not shine on lower difficulties. While not being a badass your main character is busy sexing it up with a woman. Of course by sexing it up I mean staring at a woman's chest and thighs while throwing presents he discovers they like (by putting "gigalo" glasses on) and then throwing said presents at them until they throw their bodies on top of him (like I said that hair is irresistable.) "Why is this under the gameplay section?" I'm sure you're asking. Well I'll tell you why! You have to control these actions and MUST do them if you want to acquire all weapons and if you want to get the cheevie for it then you will have to do it a number of times with the scenes getting more graphic with the amount of sexing they show of course! Did I mention Suda51 is a Japanese developer?\n\nVISUALS:\nThe graphics are wonderful. Also, no. That isn't your LCD moniter. The game does indeed look like that. You can stop rotating it up and down now.\n\nSOUNDS:\nAt the end of the sexing it up missions the main character screams really loudly 10/10\n\nYOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME IF:\nThe PC doesn't have too many spectacle fighters/hack and slash games so if you want one of those then yes. Get it. If you like Anime then get this. If you like Action games then get this. If you like confusion (usually goes along with anime) get this. If you like to have fun get this. If you have ever played and enjoyed a Suda51 game before (e.g. No More Heroes 1/2, Killer7, Shadows of the Damned, and Lollypop Chainsaw) then get this game.\n\nYOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME IF:\nYou have played a Suda51 game and did not like it. His style remains imprinted everywhere here and it will not make you like something if you already don't. You enjoy not having fun. If staring through a woman's (read: empty vessels filled of nothing but giggling and sexdollism in this game) clothes is offensive to you. You don't like asian things.","September 6, 2014","true","11.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So how does it compare to it? Ehhhhh.....\n\nThe game is repetitive, with environments and enemy types being quite samey. There were sections in the game were I immediately noticed how unnecessarily drawn out they were. Seemed just there to pad the game time. Surprisingly enough, even though many sections of the game felt drawn out it still as a whole was too short. The combat is quite basic, but serviceable. Most of the time you will be mashing on the X/Square/attack button, with dodging at the right time nets you bonus hits where you can wail on the enemy. The sub weapons of Mondo's arm a bit too situational, and feel kind of unnecessary, which doesn't speak well on a game that's main backbone is the combat.  But maybe the story is great.\n\nNah, it was probably the worst part of the game. Suda games are rarely straight forward, but at least with a bit of pondering they can easily make sense. This game seems to be trying to be all philosophical without any substance to pull it off. Most of the main characters of the series don't really get much screen time or insight, and many of the missions and mechanics of the game feel...disjointed. The gigolo missions especially add nothing to the narrative and feel out of place. Not to mention the flowery dialogue that is utilized in the game. Even I couldn't tell you what the game was about outside the general premise. Hell, I doubt the game could either.\n\nThere are things to like. The cell shaded aesthetic suit the game well, and look gorgeous at 1440p (However the dream sections add an annoying blur filter which I could do without.) The characters and bosses, while not much are done with them, are visually interesting and stimulating. Special props go to the fights with David, as I feel the game is worth playing through just for them.\n\nIn terms of the quality of the port, it's pretty bare bones but runs pretty well. It has a 30FPS cap, but it can easily be raised with some ini tweaking. There aren't any detailed graphics options and the game seems to cap at 1080p without ini tweaking.\n\nAll in all, I can't say I absolutely resent my time with it, but I doubt I would play it again.","January 8","true","11.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Up to the moment where you crashed and I re-launched to find you crashing right before selection screen (after logo intro).\n\nThen I saw under Steam\SteamApps\common\KillerIsDead\KidGame\SaveData, you got a 0-byte KID.sav file. Guess this is one of those "Do not turn off your game during save" moment. Except you bailed instead of me.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt me as much, if you chose to bail around Ep.3, where many other players were having loading problems. But you ended up corrupting my save after Ep.10, when my endgame was in-sight.\n\nSo you left me with 2 choices: delete that empty save file then start the game anew, or walk away. After all these upgrades, all these challenges, all these girl dating with blurred out scenes?\n\nThis is Nightmare Edition indeed, but probably not the nightmare originally intended.\n\nUpdated: I ended up getting someone else's midgame save file and finished this game.\n\nTo sum up my opinion:\n\n- K.I.D's plotline is somewhat arbitrary at the end and leaves too many room for player's interpretation. Background for main characters, such as Mika and Moon River, are not well-explained. They could be intentionally left out for future DLC or sequel's sake, but I have a hard time imagine them coming.\n\n- This game does have pretty good japanese voice acting (from notable seiyuu no less), but it also happens to have the worst lip-sync cutscenes in years. Not surprising as characters are voiced by english actors first, but what a shame.\n\n- As for the action part of the game, they do feel adequately designed, even for a less action-oriented player like me. Destroying enemies are satisfying enough for general hack-n-slash fans, and for more hardcore players, attack chaining and dodging should be interesting to tackle on higher difficulty.\n\n- Speaking of actions, the most annoying control mapping award goes to "middle-click + right-click" to crouch, but fortunately only for about 2-3 occasions. By the way there are no options to remap keys in the game, I didn't find a guide for .ini tweak neither.\n\nGiven Killer is Dead's numerous technical issues and lacking story, I find it hard to recommend this game wholeheartedly. If you are fans of action games, enjoy nonsensical dialogs and staring at sexy ladies (literally), then maybe give it a try.","September 14, 2014","false","15.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There are 'gigolo' missions where the object is to snap 'sexy shots' of women when they're not looking, which are bloody hillarious; there are minor bounty missions, where you have to kill so many of a certain enemy; there are story missions that are equal parts odd and engaging; Nightmare Mode is a balls-to-the-wall challenge with only three attacks being able to kill enemies (Adrenaline Burst, Dodge Burst and Headshots).\n\nIf you're a fan of Lollipop Chainsaw, Killer 7, No More Heroes and Cowboy Bebop, pick this up when it's on sale. Until the developers start releasing more bug fixes, however, this game is not worth full price.","January 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apertureinc/recommended/261110/","apertureinc","Brilliant Whistler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apertureinc/","357 products in account","Grasshopper Manufacture is one of the more interesting developers on the market. Spearheaded by a japanese auteur Goichi Suda51 their games could be characterized by a very strong and unique style that more than made up for, at times, lackluster gameplay and outdated technology.\n\nGrasshopper's latest intallment - Killer is Dead is a Hack'n'Slash game in the vain of their previous work such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. If you are a PC gamer, you probably haven't played those titles, so allow me to elaborate. Imagine a combat system that sits somewhere in-between Platinum's games/DMC and the Batman games. That is, parrying at the right moment is key and even though you are ubable to jump and your juggling abilities are limited, there is a heavy emphasis on combos.\n\nIn Layman's terms - it's a button masher.\n\nOverall, the combat is functional, yet shallow compared to other games of its genre. Considering that you will be in combat for 80% of the game, that isn't a good sign.\n\nLet's discuss the story, shall we.\n\nThe story centers around the tittular government assassin Mondo Zappa. He seems to be a Moon Cyborg Vampire Nymphomaniac brought to Earth on a magical unicorn. Quite unfortunate that even with all of those characteristics, the man has the personality of plain bread.\n\nIt seems that the game is attempting to stylize itself as an anime/manga series, where every chapter starts out as an episode of a television show. First, showing a crime being commited, then showing the victim sending a commission to the execution office, then a brief dialog between the main cast, followed by the level itself. After completing the level itself, you are given a short epilogue. Though after a few hours of playing they do begin to grind on one's nerves, the strong cast of characters carried me though.\n\nA burly cyborg in an ugly hawaii shirt, a blonde sidekick with 8 arms and a high pitched anime girl who violently punches you in the chest if you fall in battle in an attempt to revive you. As typical as they are, they begin to grow on you after a while.\n\nJust like any episode of a long running anime, every story centered episode is followed by a few filler ones. Some of the more interesting filler segments have to be the "Gigolo missions" in which the player has to seduce one of Mondo's many girlfriends in order to get a bonus item. As much as I dislike to bring up identity politics in a game review, that segment really rubbed me the wrong way. I don't mind looking at a woman's breasts to get enough points to aqquire a new weapon, yet the whole think felt like cheap tittlation, which could've been handled way more tastefully.\n\nOut of place fanservice, one more thing the game has with mainstream japanese animation.\n\nNow is a good time to talk about performance. No use in beating around the bush - the port if ♥♥♥♥. It took me a while to fix the infinite loading screens and even then I would get frame dips from time to time. It's odd, since the game performs adequadely in crowded areas, but freezes in empty rooms.\n\nSpeaking of irrational decisions, the style is a bit of a pain. Basically, the game takes certain values and replaces them with a thick gradient, which gives an ink shaded feel. Think of Sin City for reference, if you are unfamiliar with eastern comics. Which is fine and dandy in earlier missions and during cutscenes. However, your view gets frequently abstructed by flashy visual effects and even other enemies, which can be a pretty big problem on higher difficulties.\n\nAfter a while the game gets grindy with tedious minigames, such as turret sections and territory control. Thankfully, those are skippable.\n\nRemember when I said that Mondo has the personality of a wet napkin? Well that is one of the reasons why this game begins to fall appart after a while. Grasshopper games ride the post-punk aestetic and since the lead lacks any emotion and is unable to react to what's going on around him, the colourful shell crumbles. Playing the game further feels like staying in the circus after the roof cought fire. Yes, there are colourful clowns running for their lives is fun to look that, though it is becoming progressively difficult to observe past the thick layer of smoke.\n\nIn the end, you feel a tad burned out. Like a standup comedian who told all of his best material in his first 20 minutes and is trying to fill time before he can leave.\n\nAll in all, enjoyable romp while it lasts. A good sale pickup. Go in with low expectations and leave with lower ones.","January 12","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If your looking for something that makes some kind of sense or an FPS of sorts go somewhere else cause its definately not here, so shop elsewhere.\n\nThis dark gigalo with a badass attitude and crazy sword fighting techinques is something special.

Me too...)\n\nIts simple straight forward and to the point you'll figure out the story (if you care) at your own leisure. Most of the time you'll spend time doing missions at your choosing of order. You'll also take time to do some dating in order to unlock techniques, gear (or my favorite) achievements. Its a SUDA51 game so this is expected. The gameplay mech is simple, if your a keyboard & mouse user just click....alot. Controller user just mash...alot.  (this may feel somwhat similar to "God Hand"...) of course not every enemy will let you beat them to a pulp, so yes there is some technique involved on how you can pull off your kills, your graded so it matters. Almost every kill will end (if you do correctly) in a flashy blood splattered explosion, which looks pretty epic.

While a small handful would be more interesting than just beat-off material, nobody (not even the men) really talk with any sort of natural language. It'd all be stilted and while poetic: odd and unnatural.\n\nKiller is Dead doesn't really explain what it's about, even 4 missions into the game.

Again, it's stilted and poetic, but I feel that someone cut out some major scenes sot hat the main character can feel artificially badass with his growly, gravelly, Christian Bale voice while his female sidekick is aggravating to the point of making me want to stab her in the eye just so she'll shut.

Her voice is squeaky and high pitched and she's supposed to be 'cute' but it's so forced and contrived that it stops being cute and simply becomes aggravating. A cardboard cut-out of a cliche, somehow making something that's already vapid appear even more 2 dimensional.\n\nI'm somewhat interested in where the game is taking this train wreck but I'm not sure i'm going to be chugging along eagerly to see it.\n\nBe aware, this is NOT my first Suda51 game.

I'd recommend getting the console version over this if that's a reasonable option.

Killer is Dead is surreal, stylish, and a whole lot of fun. The gameplay is challenging without being overwhelming, and definitely rewards skill; when you're doing well, you'll feel it. The story, while not the most sensical thing out there, was consistently entertaining; it didn't take long for me to grow attached to these characters, even if I didn't always understand what was going on, and it went a whole lot of places I didn't expect.

Killer is Dead."\n\nWell... there is actually a lot to say about this game but I'll spare you the details. If there's one thing about this game that I want to mention, it’s that I absolutely do NOT want this review to give away the content of this game. This game is rare gem.\n\nKID is a very interesting game where you play as a guy named Mondo who works as an 'assassin' for a particular agency. There is a very set and precise storyline to the whole game, and you progress through it via various missions. The story isn't slow, nor is it very fast paced and the various 'quirks' in the missions make the game overall extremely hilarious and fun to get through.\n\nLet me explain the basics:\n\nThe missions begin with an introduction of the agency's 'client' and who he/she wants eliminated. Oddly enough, each 'target' connects perfectly through the main storyline so there isn't much to stray from. The missions are recorded as 'Episodes' like a show, so it’s quite easy to follow. Normally the 'targets' are main bosses found at the end of each mission, and let me tell you this: DEM BOSSES THO. Each boss is entirely unique in its own way and trust me, you will continuously look forward to the next boss after finishing every mission.\n\nUpon completion of each mission, you get rewards based on a grade (A-C, depending on how quickly and well you finish each mission) as well as side quests. These are actually quite fun as well. When you play through the story, you meet certain women in a few missions, and after completion, you get to do a side quest with these women. Basically, you're a playboy who’s trying to win over these women through the most... Jeebus, this game so clichéd that it’s an obvious joke. Win over their heart and mind, and please,  do not get slapped , it’s a huge damper on Mondo's clichéd bad boy image.\n\nThe storyline in itself begins from the very first episode, and often you find the connection until after completing a mission or two. So if you're feeling dumbfounded in the beginning, it’s alright, the answers will come to you in time.\n\nBefore you complete the story, you'll find that you've unlocked  'Episode 51' , I'd ask you to refrain from doing this mission until you've finished the game, or are on your final episode. The reason behind it is simple, this episode gives away a little too much if you complete it in advance, but that's just a suggestion.\n\nThe game also allows you to change the difficulty of the game at will. So you could start off on Hard, but switch to Easy without losing progress or having to start a new game all over.\n\nOne thing I found troublesome about this game was that the controls were weird. It’s not difficult at all (I've played this game on my laptop on a touchpad) but it takes a little bit of time to get used to. However, the camera control can become a little annoying sometimes, and that’s the only problem I found with the game.\n\nAnother thing I found odd, not particularly troublesome, was the women in this game. While your colleagues are... interesting (to say the least) the other women you come across in this game are just so bad. Let me be real, I saw their underwear. I saw the nicest underwear ever and I'm not sure I should be this pleased. Creators! Y U DO DIS? Personally, I DID NOT like or appreciate the way this game portrayed female characters, however this is probably because the game is heavily based on a lot of hilarious and untrue stereotypes.\n\nOverall, KID is an extremely exciting and fun Hack 'N Slash game which I highly recommend. Even if it’s not a genre you'd normally be interested in, I still suggest picking up this gem because it’s literally very fun. You will not regret it. However, I do suggest picking up this game while it’s on sale because personally, I found this to be on the short end.\n\nRATE: 8.5/10","October 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","19"

You have your katana attacks, and a guard breaking punch. You can't combo them together. In fact, there are no combos at all besides spamming the katana attack.\nBut don't run away, because the game doesn't need combos. It bases itself almost entirely on timing. Using the B button you can parry, do a just parry, or dodge.\nA just parry makes your enemy vulnerable, and allows you to start attacking him.\nDodging an attack at the last possible moment freezes the time, and you have to mash X to spam your enemy with your katana.\n\nThe more you attack your enemies, the more you fill up your blood gauge. Blood is used as ammo for your robotic arm, which can act as a gun, a freeze thingy,  and a ♥♥♥♥ing drill. The drill is used to break shields, and find secrets behind breakable walls. The gun is a gun, and the freeze gun slows down enemies (I never used it).\n\nBlood is also used to regenerate your health, and more interestingly, to  one hit kill enemies. You have different blood levels, and every time you use your one hit kill attack it uses one level of your blood. This mechanic proves to be very interesting in difficult moments, and having to judge what to do with your blood is pretty cool.\n\nThe longer your katana combo is, the faster you hit. You have different combo levels, and after a certain level, you get to execute your enemies by choosing what they'll drop. Either blood exp. to increase your blood gauge, health exp., moon crystals, used to unlock upgrades, or straight up health.\n\nIt's competent at what it does, and there are quite a few different enemies. Also there are gigolo missions where you have to stare at women's private parts while they're not looking, inorder to build confidence to give them gifts. When a gifts particularly appeals to her a little voice says "Magnifico!" , and when you give her enough stuff, you see Mondo walking away, holding her, the screen goes white, and you can hear "YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH". The whole thing is incredibly silly and ridiculous. Some ♥♥♥♥♥ called it sexist, but you're not meant to take it seriously, it's a joke. Your rewards are different sub weapons, like the drill.\n\nYou can find Scarlett the nurse by breaking items in levels, and in return you'll get challenge levels. If you complete enough of them you can have sex with her (yes).\n\nThe storyline is a mess. Even if the main storyline does make sense, the ending ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, and there's a myriad of things that are never explained and don't make a lot of sense.\n\nFor instance : "Giant Head (ジャイアントヘッド, Jaiantoheddo) is a character in Killer Is Dead. He was originally a human researcher at Area 151, but was transformed as a result of the experiments being conducted there. A colossal, seemingly alien life-form several hundred metres tall, Giant Head is woken from its sleep "a bit too early"[1] and subsequently goes on a rampage, apparently stealing the Earth in the process. Mondo Zappa must eradicate it in order to protect the world[2]."\n\nI still have no idea what stealing the earth means, but when you kill him an alien shows up, takes a small sized earth the boss dropped, and gives you a sun instead.\n\nIf you can get past a slightly nonsensical and batshit insane storyline, you'll find an enjoyable, even if a little simplistic beat'em up with bunch of silly characters and dialog.","July 28, 2014","true","15.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

Each mission results in you killing a certain boss character. The story becomes clearer the further you get into the game, obviously.\n\nThe action is generic, and consists of mostly pressing (mashing) buttons. But it looks glorious and stylish in action and partially because of that makes it more fun. However, the camera frequently gets in the way of the action.\nThere are new moves to unlock, as well as skills and new weapons. Some of these can also be upgraded. Each defeated enemy will give you moon stones which in turn can be used to upgrade your arsenal. They will also drop stones that help you upgrade your health and blood meters.\n\nVisually the game is astounding. No lack of style here. It has a dark look, with lots of shadows but there's still plenty of color to be found in the weird enemy and level designs. I did notice that blacks got crushed entirely however and it's especially noticeable when walking through some of the levels. It has less of an impact on the characters themselves, though.\nKiller Is Dead also runs at 31fps, which can be edited in an .ini file to make it run at 60fps, but this might freeze your game from time to time and therefore isn't recommended.\nUnfortunately, the game also suffers from performance issues. There were plenty of times where the framerate just dropped completely, slowing the game down for several seconds. This shouldn't happen on current PC's, because the game isn't all that demanding visually. It's inexcusable.\n\nThe game is completed once you finish the 12 main chapters of the game, which will take you around 6-7 hours max. After that, there are still plenty of sidequests to finish and girls to impress. Which brings me to my other point:\nThe mini-game for impressing girls is just weird (and also hot, in a weird kind of way). You have to look a girl right in the eyes, and when she's looking away you have to look at her female parts to fill a bar. This can also be done with some glasses; these glasses will show you their underwear. You can then decide to give the girl a present and get her into bed, after which the girl can choose to give you a gift as well. The more you play the game the more presents you will unlock and later on you can even give them some new lingerie. Sexy times indeed. Like I said, weird, but like nothing I've ever seen before in a game and because of that an interesting gameplay mechanic... ;)\nThese presents are bought with money earned by playing missions, by the way. I don't think I've seen a different purpose for using money, except to maybe buy items that aid you when times are difficult, or to buy new outfits later on.\n\nKiller Is Dead is pretty cool, and weird like Deadly Premonition (but not that weird). But, I enjoyed this one more.\nIt's not perfect, but grab it if you like good action games. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","June 5, 2014","true","7.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

Take a standard third person action game, strip it down to the core and fill it up with over-the-top weirdness and cartoon violence shown through a cel-shaded lense. There is beauty in simplicity and even though Suda 51 is only credited for the story here, Killer Is Dead follows this formula down to a tee.\n\nKiller Is Dead is your average fast-paced slash-athon. Where other hack & slash games attempt to keep things interesting by introducing new weapons, combos and abilities at a steady rate, Killer Is Dead keeps it simple: Mondo's sub weapons can all be acquired very early into the game and even though there are upgrades, they are few and far between. The game's main selling point is its ferocious combat, which feels as weightless as it feels fast. As a result, it flows quite nicely. I've lost count of how many times I got carried away and received a blow to the back simply because I wanted to keep the combo going for as long as possible. Apart from the mashing, the game also features dodge moves, counters and bloody finishers, which are all very typical for the genre.\n\nIn case you really need to spice things up, there are a couple of optional side missions waiting for you. They range from defeating enemies by counter moves exclusively to scavenger hunting. There's also a mini-game where you seduce women by staring at their goods for as long as possible. Just like in real life.\n\nAll of this wouldn't necessarily warrant a thumbs up if it wasn't for the presentation. Killer Is Dead oozes style like nothing else and keeps your attention up by showing you things you probably haven't seen before in a videogame, be it two guys in suits having a swordfight on the moon or a boss fight against a twisted version of Thomas the Tank Engine. The special brand of Suda 51 craziness is arguably lower compared to Killer7, for instance, and the overall mood is rather cold, but it's still present and unlike most things you see in videogames nowadays. For that alone, Killer Is Dead is worth the purchase.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't come without its share of problems, most of which are the result of shoddy porting. The PC version of Killer Is Dead certainly won't satisfy those who insist on high customizability, although it does look better than its console counterpart and even allows for bypassing its 30 FPS cap with little effort. Apart from the occasional crash, there is one particularly nasty bug that prevents players from progressing past mission 3 with no known workaround at this moment, so buying the game right now is a bit of a gamble.\n\nStill, Killer Is Dead the weird, stylish maim-'em-all you wouldn't want to miss out on.","May 26, 2014","true","25.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Also one of the craziest. The enemies, characters, and environments are crazy. Everything about it is good and I haven't really found any negatives yet. After fixing it to run at 60 fps it looks superb and plays perfectly. Great controls and super hot big breasted women make this game highly enjoyable. Hot chicks with massive knockers is never a bad thing no matter who you are. All games should have big knockered women in them. It is designed for a controller so I use a wired xbox 360 controller and the game plays flawlessly. One of my all-time favorite games. The sounds are great, the music awesome, and the graphics are pretty good. Combat flows smoothly with easy to perform dodges and moves and in some levels provides a good challenge. The side missions where you are on a date with a chick and have to give her the right gifts and not let her catch you staring at her crotch or boobs is pretty unique gameplay and pretty hilarious. The other side missions are all fun too. Overall it is one of the best looking games I've ever seen in terms of effects and art design. I did not make a very long review because I feel like if you are reading this you should just buy the game and let it speak for itself because it is such a cool game that I can't imagine any action game fan not liking it. I didn't give it a 10/10 only because the chicks aren't naked.\n\n9/10 badass","May 30, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Steam controller is good, but sucks at aiming, mouse is good at aiming, but sucks at everything else.\nI essentially had to use both devices and one of the profiles I found for the controller.\nThe game is somewhat anime-like. The story is not bad, but shallow due to the way it's rushed out. Many interesting things were tried here and while not everything was pulled off, it's still a great game. Breaking the 4th wall without breaking immersion is cool... But, well, it did break immersion.\nThere is some skill to this game, but it is not that hard on normall. With little bit of grinding, the game took me about 11-12 hours, so I assume between 8 and 10 hours is how long the content lasts.\nClearly you can pull way more than that after achieving end-game. Unless you hate replays that offer nothing new.\n\nThe only other issue I might have are FPS (thankfully there is a fix for that in guides) and sub-weapons.\nThere are 4 weapons beside the sword and they are all not that great. The starter one is a pea shooter, also the only one you really need, than you have the drill that can help you gain access to some hidden areas and break armors (easier? but with blood cost) and... that's it. There are 2 other weapons that are just weak and not needed at all. Charged version of the pea shooter doing AoE damage and freeze gun, which hardly does anything.\n\nAnyway, the game is enjoyable, story is ok - if you don't minde it beeing very cheesy, rushed and anime-like.\nMost important thing is, that it feels rather unique. I find myself to be bored by a lot of modern games.

While not perfect, I really found this to be a beautiful game that left me highly impressed. The game stars Mondo Zappa, a hired executioner and certified lady killer, who battles "wires" (metal monsters) while seeking assassination targets. The gameplay is all hack and slash with a little bit of fps mixed in via Mondo's gun, which serves as a secondary weapon.\n\nPros:\n+Absolutely beautiful and unique art. Everything about the game is stylish, from the menus, to the unique cell-shaded graphics, to the overall flashy look. The game is worth playing just to admire how amazing it looks.\n+Great soundtrack that fits the game.\n+A totally unique, multi-stage boss battle at the end of every single mission.\n+Good hack and slash gameplay. I don't play many games in this genre, but I found the gameplay to be quite entertaining. The combat layout is an attack button, a block, a dodge, and a guard break, and some other things mixed in. As a secondary weapon you have Mondo's gun, which is fired in first person. Using the gun, or special attacks, consumes a secondary meter. There is a large handful of upgrades available to be bought throughout the game.\n+The player can choose between the English and Japanese dubs.\n\nNeutral:\n+/-Fanservice.\n+/-The game actually has a great story, but it's a little hard to understand as shown in the game. You have to put the pieces together or it just looks like a totally random mess. I had to read a plot summary after finishing to fully understand, although I don't think this should be necessary if you stay sharp and pay attention.\n\nCons:\n-Too short. The main story only took me around 11 hours, although there is an abundance of side missions aside from the main story.\n-The level design is fairly linear. It didn't really bother me because the combat was good enough to keep me entertained, but it's worth noting.\n-The English dubs were a little overacted in my opinion, particularly Mondo. I tried to play English and ended up switching to the Japanese, which was much better.\n-The character models look fantastic, but they are not animated well. You can tell watching the cutscenes that their faces have very little joints, which causes their range of expressions to be overly limited.\n\nI am pretty surprised at the hate for this game. Yes it has its flaws, but it's such a unique and worthwhile game in so many ways. The art is beautiful and the kind of thing you won't see in any other game. The story is on one hand an interesting, somewhat light hearted sci-fi story, and on the other hand a clever satire on classic lady killing male heroes like James Bond. The gameplay is not revolutionary but it was definitely entertaining. All in all I found this to be a simply fantastic and totally worthwhile game. It comes with my highest recommendation.\n\nTL;DR:\nStunningly gorgeous art. Good hack and slash gameplay. Level design is linear. Game is short (~11 hours). The game's high artistic value lends it my highest recommendation.","February 18","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Played a few Suda51 games\n\nSetting Note:  Framerate is capped to 30FPS.  You can do a workaround to play it in 60FPS or 120+ at http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Killer_Is_Dead#High_frame_rate\n\nWARNING:  Dual/Quad core PC owners out there beware.  I’ve read of crash issues after chapters 3.  See if a fix is available.  FPS workaround may cause crashes during “Koharu” Gigolo missions\n\n\nStory 5/10\n- The story is divided into chapters/episodes that you select.  Each section feels new but it doesn’t really tell the story fluidly\n\n- The story and characters aren’t very captivating\n\n- Lots of sexy scenes (Not too excessive though).  Stare at boobies and panties for upgrades.  Don’t  pick this up if you are a sexist.\n\n\nControls 6.5/10\n- Lots of hack and slash elements and first-person shooter\n\n- The tutorials are screen prompts and easy to understand.  Timings for skill perfect actions feels off\n\n- There are no controller, keyboard & mouse, or camera options in-game to change button layout or sensitivity\n\nYou would expect a lock-on camera from a hack and slash but it’s all automatic or manual\n\nGraphics 7/10\n- The game was initially capped to 30FPS with no advanced settings.  Only “High”, “Medium”, “Low”.  Workaround available.  Random framerate stutters too.\n\n- There’s something about the art style that makes shadows mimic IPS backlight bleed.  I was extremely bothered by this (plays on IPS monitor)\n\n- The art style is unique but the lack of advanced graphic settings gimped it.  Lacks AA\n\n\nSound 6/10\n- The music didn’t leave any memorable impression on me.  In fact I’m 25 hours in and I don’t even recall a single soundtrack (maybe only the main menu music)\n\n- There is dual audio [English/Japanese].  Although the mouth didn’t always sync with the voices (possibly due to FPS workaround)\n\n\nGameplay 6.5/10\n- For a hack-and-slash it feels somewhat slow-paced/clunky and not as fun and adrenaline pumping compared to other titles like “No More Heroes”.  Feels like I’m always waiting or searching for a fight.  Although it does hit the right notes sometimes\n\n-  There isn’t anything too unique that that has never been done before.  The Gigolo mini-game where you stare at a girl’s rack for upgrades was initially amusing but quickly got awkward.\n\n- Combat AI is all over the place.  On low difficulties, there is a lot of flinching when you hit.  Sometimes this disrupts an enemy from attacking, sometimes they just continue through their attack animation.\n\nAnother good example is “Just Guard” which is basically pressing block right before an enemy attack.  I’ve found the timing to be so unreliable that I get a higher success rate spamming block rather than timing it.\n\nWeighted Score 6.5/10\nA good hack-and-slash is a game with amazing gameplay and controls.  Story is always secondary and the graphics/music creates the atmosphere.  Killer Is Dead  fails to excel in any of the aforementioned categories.\n\nI can’t recommend this game to everyone out there.  The initial combat is super boring but it gets better as you upgrade techniques, although it felt like I was in the menu and watching cutscenes more than I was playing.\n\nGenerally it’s B rated game.  For Suda51 / hack-and-slash fans, I wouldn’t hesitate to pick it up. However, I wouldn’t recommend it at full price but it is worth the pick-up if it’s discounted to $5 – 7.\n\nSide Notes:\n- Console DLC is included","March 25, 2015","true","33.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You get mika's ticket before the start of the mission it allows you to respawn straight from the place you died , if you don't have any of them left it get you back to the last checkpoint which makes her tickets not that affective ( unless you're against a boss )\n\nKiller is dead is a weird game filled  with confusing story and weird awkward mini games (which you can ignore and finish the game without np ) , the sound track is amazing at times and i am loving it my final verdict for killer is dead is a 6/10 it is a good game but it is only worth getting if it is on sale .","November 18, 2015","true","12.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/recommended/261110/","jtarlton","jt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/","1404 products in account","At the time of this review I've played this for 2 hours, and completed 5 missions.\nHere's what I think you should know going in to this game:\nIt's basically a hack-and-slash game that's pretty story-heavy.\nThe story makes literally no sense so far. Maybe it comes together but I really doubt it.\nThe levels so far look like the weird room at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey\nThe enemies you fight are for the most part inexplicable. They make no attempt to explain what they are or why they are even in these places.\nHere's the big issue: Gigolo Missions.\nIf you want to get to pretty much any of the unlockable content you're going to have to go through "Gigolo missions" which are essentially long drawn out scenes in which you try to stare at a woman's cleavage without getting caught, while she repeats the same three dialogue clips over and over. Playing these missions will make you feel like a massive creep, and I imagine if you're not into women it's even more distasteful. Not only is the concept offensive, but the women are vapid, terribly voiced, and frankly embarassing charicatures of what an immature sex-obsessed 13 year old thinks an attractive woman is.\nHonestly I have never seen a more over-sexualized portrayal of women in a video game. So unless you're a fedora-wearing men's rights activist neckbeard with a view of women from the 1300s you're probably not going to enjoy the gigolo missions.\n\nThe actual hack-and-slash gameplay is reasonably enjoyable, and the environments are interesting and surreal. Even the graphic style of the game contributes to an interesting visual experience. That would all be a lot better if the frequent cutscenes contributed to some sort of plot that you could make sense of, but as of chapter 5 that's not the case.\n\nI've heard a lot about Suda51, this game's developer. This is the first game of his I've played, and I'm pretty sure it'll be the last. Unless you're in the aforementioned neckbeard/fedora category I recommend avoiding this game entirely. Anything you'll be interested in you can get from watching Let's Play videos. Even significantly on sale I still can't recommend buying this just to have a bunch of content locked behind a bad dating sim.","July 21, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The Story is kinda sketchy, i mean is not bad but sometimes is boring or just too dull and short. Plus the ending in my opinion is disappointing. And the secondary missions are pretty useless, unless you want some extra items or some costumes. Ignoring that i think the characters are AMAZING, each and one of them are fun kinda clichée but still good. I was surprised when i played my first Gigolo Mission (Basically stare at girls ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥ to get courage to give them gifts) but after you get the hang of it was pretty easy and repetitive (All the girls like perfume and the lunar Necklace).\n\nNow in Graphic options i was pretty disappointed, the only options were Textures (From low to high), Resolution,  Brightness and a 30 fps Lock. But still The cellshading was pretty good to cover all of this so i'll give a point for the effort. Now. The controllers are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the menus, not going to lie, i hated a lot going back to the main menu because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controllers. BUT the controllers in-game are actually pretty good, everything feels smooth in mid-combat. Specially with an Xbox Controller.\n\nAs a final veredict i give this game a 7/10.\n\nCan't ignore the fact of the low graphic options available, the controllers and the fact that the secondary missions are just useless and the story gave a lot to wish from it, still can't ignore the Story of Mondo Zappa. I tell you to give it a try, you might enjoy this game even more than i did (And that's saying a lot).","September 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is a game i will remember, truly.\n\nSTORY\nThe story isn't very good when you look at it in retrospect, it is full of plotholes and goes nowhere. I'd compare it to the TV show Lost, not thematically but in how it lacks; it's intresting while you're watching it and offers some nice mystery and intrigue, but by the end you'll get much of the same disappointment as you may have gotten from the ending of that show.\nThat said, though, many people still look back on the show Lost and think about how they enjoyed the ride. There was some real memorable moments after all, and the same could be said about Killer Is Dead; It's an enjoyable ride up until the end.\nUnlike Lost however, it doesn't get stale in the middle and the pacing is good and keeps you awake. Not to mention the frequent change of tone and ridiculous nature of the game\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhile perhaps pretty simplistic for a hack'n'slash, it provides with a satisfying power-fantasy. You dash around fast as lightning and it all feels like something out of an over the top shonen anime. The enviroments are varied and the upgrades truly feel like upgrades, instead of boring things like "25% damage resistance" you can unlock new moves and make yourself significantly faster and stronger.\n\n\nNOTE:\n30 FPS lock\nCan be unlocked in .ini files. However, this causes some issues:\nWhen you run out of health in the game, there's a revival QTE, If you succeed with this QTE you will be brought back into the game, But if you fail, you must restart the level from the beginning. Tampering with the framerate makes this QTE (humanly) impossible to complete as it doubles the amount of button presses required, Fortunately you don't have to become a cyborg to complete this as this can also be fixed in the .ini files. There are some good guides on how to do this in the steam community 'Guide' section\n\nMakes the game crash when you try to play the side mission 'Mondo Girls 3', This mission is not necessary to do in order to complete the game. It does, however, feature a sex scene with a qt azn grill, so if you really want to experience that, you'll have to go into the .ini files and lock the game to 30 fps again, for the duration of that mission that is.\n\nMakes boss battle QTEs significantly harder as they will require double the amount of button presses. Unlike the revival QTE, they are still beatable, but you may or may not have mash the button until you get blisters. If you have too much trouble with it you can always set the game back to 30 fps for the duration of the boss battles.","October 3, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Main buttons consist of slash, secondary fire, dodge, and instant kill mode aside from the changing controls in minigames. This makes for an easy system to pick up for those who want to enter a game and immediately receive some of that quick murderous satisfaction these types of games provide, yet the system does still contain a bit of complexity with meter management to dish out special abilities at the right time as well as an upgrade system for special combos that when mastered prove efficient.\n\nLeaving spoilers of the main story aside, the setup of playing the role of mondo the assassin makes for a convenient setting that allows the player to visit a variety of diverse environments which all look fantastic as far as I'm concerned. The story remains interesting enough if you know what to expect from Suda51's other games such as No More Heroes which is basically violence and eroticism to a surrealistic extent.\n\nThe game also provides a variety of side objectives after clearing a main mission which mainly amount to kill said number of enemies or collect a certain item by killing enemies which become enjoyable enough. Other side objectives include scarlet challenges for the masocistic and a simplistic dating simulation reminding me of Dream Club except these women did not steal nearly as much of my money. In short, if you enjoy the genre you should buy this game.","December 14, 2015","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Cool and badass is how the game seems to be designed to make you feel; with gameplay being full of over the top power moves and dodges. The swordplay is a bit lacking in variety since you only have 1 sword the entire game, and it has few combos. I never found it boring because you can mix it up with dodges, gun, punches and finishing moves. There are also side missions that often have different gameplay.\n\nThe story is crazy and over the top, you will see and hear the craziest things all accompanied with humor making you chuckle. The game feels very Japanese and it drips style. One run should take you around 15 hours (main story + extras) but there’s incentive to replay to get a higher rank in missions, along with several difficulty settings. It has a Metacritic score of 71 (critics) and a 8.0 (PlayStation 3 users).\n\nOverall, this is a cool, crazy and over the top game. I would recommend you this game if you like action games, Killer7, No More Heroes, Devil May Cry and/or Bayonetta, although the combat doesn’t reach the heights of the last two, it’s a lot of fun.\n\nMy score: 8/10","December 20, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The absurdity of things happening in the game is something not many may appreciate. For that matter, it helps to be either under influence or a big fan of Japan. I think it's great fun and pretty challenging, especially on Very Hard and above. If you can look past the craziness, the game has great style if not for visuals and art alone.\n\nIt's a port which means it has limited configuration options and is best played with a controller. Aside from that, the only minor downside I could think of is that character lips are synced to the English audio.. and even if the English voices weren't so horrid, the Japanese voices just sound so much more fitting and better with the characters. But I may be biased in that regard.\n\nThe game is as fun as any other spectacle fighter really. But because of it's oddities it can be considered a niche category as you may need a certain taste to like a lot of this stuff. It's worth it if you're a fan of the setting or weirdness in general.

I am a big fan of hack and slash games. Hack and slash is actually my favorite genre. So I was pumped to play this game.\nThe first things that caught my attention when I first saw the game is the outstanding artstyle. This artstyle works great for fighting games and the blue explosions that appear when you kill an enemy are just amazing. Another thing that I noticed when I only watched videos and trailers of the game was that it really looked like you as a player really didnt have much control, it looks like everything is super hard and everything just bounces here and there. But I got that feeling the first time I saw videos on other hack and slash games like bayonetta. However when you actually play the game it feels super smooth and I always feel like I have control. Speaking of controls the keyboard controls in this game are great. I love them, I thought that playing this game with a keyboard was suicide. But I actually really liked it. Then I tried playing it with a xbox controller, and it worked good and all but I really prefered the keyboard controls. So I played the game with those.\nBefore I want to go deeper into the game I want to say one thing. This game is automaticly locked at 30 fps. And 30 fps is horrible for this game, and for many hack and slash games I will say. However you can modify the files to get over 120 fps. This is really simple and its really not a huge waste of time so please dont let this scare you away from buying this amazing game.\nWhen I picked up the game I was hooked, its hitting all the good points on me, good graphics, outstanding gameplay, few but sometimes hilarious scenes and jokes (Many 4th wall breakings) and many more things.\nMy biggest problem with this game is that from what I have seen so far is that the game is very short. Even if you want to 100 % it. Belive it or not but im not done with this game yet. I prefer 100 %ing these types of games but this game really dosent encourage you do play it more when you are done with the story. When you finished the game all that happens is that you can buy some new costumes for Mondo (The main character) for a big price but even that isnt really that fun to work to. I also already have all upgrades so thats nothing.\nThe story of this game is pretty rad, its nothing outstanding but its cool and interesting at the very least. I think that this game has too many cutscenes tho.\nThe protagonist of the game Mondo is badass, cool, funny and interesting at the very least. His robot arm does look a little out of place (I wish it was a bit smaller, its all fat n ♥♥♥♥) but I like him as a character. However the villain is very lame, he is uninteresting and just a wimp. There are many side characters like the annoying Mika. Who will always yell ♥♥♥♥ at you. And the mysterious woman in your dreams. But none else are really that outstanding either, except for some of the other bad guys that you kill there arent really any characers that made me feel for them.\nSometimes the game buggs out and this is really annoying, the port is not terrible yet its not amazing either. However this isnt a big deal most of the times.\n\nI really liked this game. And its one of the first games that I ever actually wrote an actual review for.\nI rate this game 9/10.","May 31","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumaxe/recommended/261110/","jumaxe","Slowbro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumaxe/","343 products in account","It is clearly a game of style over substance but I actually had quite a lot of fun with it. This sort-of suda51 game has the incredibly unique style that you come to expect from his work. With such a awesome visual style it is kind of a shame that the combat is merely just servicable. That's not to say I didn't have a lot of fun playing the game, which I did, it was just largely due to great animations, interesting enemy design, a great soundtrack, and so on. The actual game systems are, unfortunatley, not the best in the spectle fighting genre. It's a button masher, which is fine, but I would have like to have seen some sort of combo system. That isn't to say the gameplay was terribly designed in any way. It's just good that the game was rather short or otherwise I feel the gameplay would have gotten fairly repetitive.\n\nAnother sticking point is a bit of a contentious one. The game has problems with its portrayal of women that made me feel a bit uncomfortable. There are these side missions where you "date" women to gain weapons and other items. This might be a cool feature if there were any depth there in characterization and actually fit into the overall narative of the game. Instead, the mission is literally you as the player objectifying a sexily designed woman, lacking in any agency, by staring at her boobs and crotch until you build up the courage to give her present to which she will instantly fall in love with you. At it's best, it's kind of creepy and at its worst it is sexist or even mysogonistic. And, even outside of these missions the portrayal of women is on the cringeworthy side. Vivian and Mika, the two female characters in the game with any kind of agency, though that's debatable, have optional sexy lingere outfits for the player to gaze at. And they aren't exactly the most well designed, well written female characters to begin with. Ultimately, I can look past these parts of the game I find kind of weird and terrible because the rest of the package makes up for it.\n\nSo despite having a few misgivings about some aspects of the game, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit for some really strong elements. I'll have to recomend it for the most part because I think this will be a game that will stick with me for awhile.\n\nAlso I should note. I didn't have many technical problems with this game aside from a few framerate dips randomly. I did have to edit the .ini file to get the resolution I wanted which isn't a huge deal. There isn't really many graphical options or resolutions to choose from. Also, I hear that if you only have a dual core processor the game is literally unplayable at a point. Maybe someone has created a work around for that but I don't know. So yean, not the best port.","October 30, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And then he hired a bunch of crazylikes supporters, they drew really crazy manga, spilled oiled-paint all over it and BAM: Killler is Dead was born.\n\nWhile a decent enough slasher, the real charm of KiD comes from refrences upon refrences upon refrences from Space Odyssey and Devil May Cry to Sailor Moon and Alice in Wonderland.\n\nBasically what you're going to do in this game is hack, slash and shoot everything that stands in your way. While usuall enemies are not a big problem, Boss fights sure pack a punch and style! It worth to play if only to check out those. The combat system is not that complex as in DMC but neither is simplified, it is fun to pull off lengthly combos combining sword, punches and sub-weapons (There are a few of those).\n\nPlot is... ehm... well... It's there; Protagonist travels around world making a living as Executioner (Assassin), while game sure is short. Screw this, no spoilers just see for yourself.\n\nGraphics. Bah it's all right. Art Style however outshines graphic in every regard. Really I can't say if graphics bad or good, but art style sure is something (good).\n\nNow the game also does contain diffrent sub-missions (that are frankly just rip-offs of main story locations with a diffrent objective), that will help you to earn money and experience. Speaking of money, there are also so called Gigolo Missions:  Main goal in those is to seduce a woman, by staring at her and showing presents in her face.\n\nYou know what, I thought of writing a complete and full rewiew with complex details, but to hell with it. I'll just give an honest opinion. Is KiD is a fun game? For me it is! It does contain a good balance between coocoo crazy humor and action packed adventure. Is it worth full price? Nah, but I bought it on discount price, and not regreting it.\n\nSo final thoughts. If you like slashers then Killer is Dead won't dissapoint you. But you should probably buy it when price dropes.","February 9","true","18.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

There's too much business involved this days, too much fear in creating something new and different.\nIts always good to see more titles like this in contrast to the predictability of the gaming industry, thankfully knowing what to expect from a game before even playing it, makes it easier for certain games to stand out and create massive fan bases, Killer is Dead is one of those games.\n\nFirst things first, SUDA games are often controversial, and Killer is Dead sure is a good example of that. There's a certain silliness that usually finds its way onto his games, in this case the controversy was around the Gigolo missions.\n\nWhat about them Gigolo missions?\nthis is one of the dumbest and yet strangely hilarious ideas ive seen in a game, even for SUDA. This are just a few extremely out of place non mandatory sub missions that serve no real purpose to the game.\nif you choose to do them,you will find nothing more than a dating simulator, where you must give presents to a girl at the bar so that she will sleep with you, but for that you'll need some confidence, how does one do that? Simple, just look at the girl while shes distracted to build up your confidence meter.\n\nit's understandable if someone chooses to stay way from playing solely based on the gigolo missions, thankfully there's more to KID than just a stripped down dating sim\nlike some other grasshopper titles KID as a high contrast shader art style, due to that and its gameplay it looks like it could be a spiritual successor to No More Heroes, but this time we got a rather short game with only 13 episodes if you count episode 51.\n\nStoryline\ni dont want to spoil to much, as i find the story presentation to be quite interesting.\nYou take control of Mondo Zappa, an executioner that works for the state, Your job?

As long as the PC port of a console game works well, plays well, and I can play it with a controller (which is how the game is intended to be played anyways) then I think it's a good port, not great, but good.\n\nThere are some game-breaking bugs though, the most known one being the never ending phone call on episode 3 if you have a dual-core CPU. People that are affected by this bug has every right to post a negative review. Fotunately for me, I don't have a dual-core CPU and I am able to play the game just fine.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is really good. It's a Suda 51 game, so if you're familiar with his games, it still has the same amount of personality in it like all the others. The game isn't even hard to run which is really cool.\n\nDid you accept the game?

And then he hired a bunch of crazylikes supporters, they drew really crazy manga, spilled oiled-paint all over it and BAM: Killler is Dead was born.\n\nWhile a decent enough slasher, the real charm of KiD comes from refrences upon refrences upon refrences from Space Odyssey and Devil May Cry to Sailor Moon and Alice in Wonderland.\n\nBasically what you're going to do in this game is hack, slash and shoot everything that stands in your way. While usuall enemies are not a big problem, Boss fights sure pack a punch and style! It worth to play if only to check out those. The combat system is not that complex as in DMC but neither is simplified, it is fun to pull off lengthly combos combining sword, punches and sub-weapons (There are a few of those).\n\nPlot is... ehm... well... It's there; Protagonist travels around world making a living as Executioner (Assassin), while game sure is short. Screw this, no spoilers just see for yourself.\n\nGraphics. Bah it's all right. Art Style however outshines graphic in every regard. Really I can't say if graphics bad or good, but art style sure is something (good).\n\nNow the game also does contain diffrent sub-missions (that are frankly just rip-offs of main story locations with a diffrent objective), that will help you to earn money and experience. Speaking of money, there are also so called Gigolo Missions:  Main goal in those is to seduce a woman, by staring at her and showing presents in her face.\n\nYou know what, I thought of writing a complete and full rewiew with complex details, but to hell with it. I'll just give an honest opinion. Is KiD is a fun game? For me it is! It does contain a good balance between coocoo crazy humor and action packed adventure. Is it worth full price? Nah, but I bought it on discount price, and not regreting it.\n\nSo final thoughts. If you like slashers then Killer is Dead won't dissapoint you. But you should probably buy it when price dropes.","February 9","true","18.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

There's too much business involved this days, too much fear in creating something new and different.\nIts always good to see more titles like this in contrast to the predictability of the gaming industry, thankfully knowing what to expect from a game before even playing it, makes it easier for certain games to stand out and create massive fan bases, Killer is Dead is one of those games.\n\nFirst things first, SUDA games are often controversial, and Killer is Dead sure is a good example of that. There's a certain silliness that usually finds its way onto his games, in this case the controversy was around the Gigolo missions.\n\nWhat about them Gigolo missions?\nthis is one of the dumbest and yet strangely hilarious ideas ive seen in a game, even for SUDA. This are just a few extremely out of place non mandatory sub missions that serve no real purpose to the game.\nif you choose to do them,you will find nothing more than a dating simulator, where you must give presents to a girl at the bar so that she will sleep with you, but for that you'll need some confidence, how does one do that? Simple, just look at the girl while shes distracted to build up your confidence meter.\n\nit's understandable if someone chooses to stay way from playing solely based on the gigolo missions, thankfully there's more to KID than just a stripped down dating sim\nlike some other grasshopper titles KID as a high contrast shader art style, due to that and its gameplay it looks like it could be a spiritual successor to No More Heroes, but this time we got a rather short game with only 13 episodes if you count episode 51.\n\nStoryline\ni dont want to spoil to much, as i find the story presentation to be quite interesting.\nYou take control of Mondo Zappa, an executioner that works for the state, Your job?

It's a button masher, and I couldn't make it into anything more, no matter how much I tried to use special abilities and attacks, (and I have plenty of experience with action games.) Controls were fine with a controller, (I can't speak for M&B - i didn't try), but it was just boring.\nAs far as art assets and story go... Someone compared this to Lynch.. This is NOT Lynch. Lynch has a soul, and a certain depth... This just felt like someone found an equation for surreal art and simply followed it without actually believing in it. Random stories, obscure humor, characters that have no explanation of why they are there and who are they really, just a ton of disconnected strings all over that don't make up a cohesive whole. I mean, maybe some people are into that, but I'm not, so I can't recommend this. I love Magritte, and Lynch, and in their surreal there is at least something that ties everything together. This game is more like someone just colored a canvas black, added a big red circle, then decided to add a robot arm, and then thought let's throw a unicorn in there for the hell of it, because why not.\nI guess I'll give this game some points, but only because it's at least something I haven't seen before. And there were some decent comic-book-style cutscene shots that were visually well delivered, I guess. But overall - it was a pretty mediocre ride on most accounts.","November 15, 2015","false","16.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The main character is an executioner named Mondo Zappa who receives jobs from the Bryan Execution Firm. This firm, run by a cyborg named Bryan Roses, tasks Mondo with killing dangerous criminals and assassins from around the world. Mondo wields a sword with his right hand but his cybernetic left arm can be converted into many different weapons, including guns, drills, and other objects. Although Mondo travels the world as part of the game, Suda calls it a "personal story" of "a man who doesn't show himself much in the public world but still worms his way into society and mercilessly eliminates the evil dispersed in it". "Love and execution" and "how far can you protect someone" are also central themes of the story.\n\nKill is Dead - wonderful game.

I have mixed feelings about Killer is Dead. Judging from the games title when i saw trailers of it i thought it was going to be a sequel to Killer 7 but what we got was something completely different.\n\nThe story is essentially cryptic like Killer 7 albeit, without the charm Killer 7 had. It's very hard to follow and alot of things feel thrown in with no explanation. So if your hoping to understand the story your going to be lost. The basic jist is you play as Mondo Zappa, a 35 year old American assassin who travels the globe executing other assassins.\n\nThe gameplay of Killer is Dead focuses on a combination of things. It is hack n slash (much like MGR) but also uses a secondary shooting function via Mondo's cybernetic arm. You play the game from a third person point of view in both using a sword or using the gun portion of your cybernetic arm. The gameplay itself is actually really fluent and stylish. As for the graphics, it follows in its NMH and K7 predecessors, utilizing a cel shading style in unison with the Unreal Engine. Though i do enjoy the style alot, i would have liked to see another approach or an optimization upon the style Suda did with cel shading.\n\nI have mixed views on the music of the game. There are some tracks that standout (main menu music) while alot of the others are not really that memorable. It's kind of dissapointing given Akira Yamaoka composed for Killer is Dead, but im going to assume its not really his fault. Akira was most likely given specific directions on where to take the music. I will say the sound effects and voice acting are top notch though; the voice acting having some familiar english voice actors.\n\nIf you enjoy hack n slash games like Metal Gear Rising Revengeance or any other in the general, you will like Killer is Dead. If your looking for an engaging story to follow your most likely not going to find it here as its very cryptic.","April 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the basis of that, I recommend this game. 10/10\n\nIn all seriousness though, combat's pretty fun, as you get larger combos your attacks come faster and faster until you can execute enemies for extra experience, health upgrade points, blood upgrade points (your special attack ammo), or health restoration. There's some subweapons, most of which were pretty well used in various situations, though I really didn't use the ice cannon ever.\n\nThe chapters vary widely in length, the first few feel really short and empty, but after 3 things start picking up a little more. The point I really started enjoying the game was during the zombie-headphones-dude boss fight. Challenge missions are fun and not overbearing, as they don't distract too much from the main missions, Gigolo missions are... Gigolo missions. You get subweapons and I guess sexy times out of them? They're dumb. Just dumb. But hey whatever you can have offscreen underwear sex with a German vampire lady, and who doesn't want that? Es ist sehr Deutsch.\n\nStory... It's a Grasshopper Manufacture game, it's cryptic and breaks the fourth wall at any point for no particular reason. There's also a dream sequence where a smiley man in golden king's garb slashes through your front door and destroys your table and cuts your breakfast in half and everything is in slow motion and it's so overly dramatic and I love it. Just love it for what it is, a nonsensical thrill ride.\n\nWorst part of the game? Mika's voice. (Though the fact that every other character ignores her for the majority of the game makes it a little better.)\n\nBest part of the game?

The art and music really carry the game, and there are a lot of cutscenes to show off these strengths. With that in mind, I can't help but wonder if it would have been better as an anime. For example, there are parts of the gameplay where you slowly walk through a level and enjoy some story development. I wouldn't mind watching those segments as part of a show or cutscene, but I'm not sure I want my fast-paced gore-filled action game to be slowed to a grinding halt like that.\n\nThe gameplay is good, but nothing makes it stand out in its genre. If this game were sold with the same price tag as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, I would be pretty disappointed. As it is only $20 at full price, however, I think the price is right for the gameplay you get. Add the art and music on top of that, and you're getting more than your money's worth out of this game in my opinion.\n\nFor what's not so great about the game... it's a painfully obvious port. I didn't even want to try playing it without a gamepad, as the default keybindings were plentiful and confusing. Worse yet, the game is littered with loading screens.\n\nLastly, as many reviews complain about, you don't really get sold on the characters. I'm part way through the game, and I'd really like to know more about the story. It is kind of odd that the game is so heavy on cutscenes, but still manages to tell you so little about the protagonists. That's not a major complaint for me, however, as each mission tells a short (VERY short) story about one of the protagonist's clients. I haven't completed the game yet, so I don't know if it all gets tied together in the end. Even if it does, the game really makes you hold out for it, which might be a dealbreaker for some people.\n\nTL;DR: I think this game accomplishes what it set out to do, and I feel that the price is right.","July 6, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its camera is bad, its visual indicators of oncoming enemy strikes is poorly portrayed and the game is only about six hours long or so, not counting the random mini-games and odd dating sim feature where you're a male escort or something like that.\nDespite the games rather egregious (or at least, disappointing) faults, it isn't by any means not fun. The satisfaction of just graphically destroying all the weird moon-robot-things is rad as hell. The visual presentation of the game and sound production only adds to that with the recurring motif of the 4th Movement of Dvorak's "From the New World" haunting you across the weird locales you end up killing people in. As long as you go into this game with the expectation of "Okay, this is another sort of flawed, wacky Suda51 Adventure" and nothing more than that, you're golden. The story absolutely doesn't make any sense and only gets zanier as the realization of "Oh, I know what you're doing, Suda, you tricky one, you." washes over you and you just start to roll with it.\nPlaying with a controller is absolutely mandatory. Not worth it at the $20 price point, but if you're looking for an okay hack 'n slash experience it's worth it at a 50% off sale or something like that.","August 18, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For 8.00$. this game is a big understatement. This is one of the very few games I would actually pay full price to get. I haven't played a full game through in one sitting since ♥♥♥♥ing, I don't know. Punch Out!!. Anyway none the lesss. This game gives you your classiv hack n' slash feel. It's a lot more crisper and fluent than DMC or Ninja Gaiden In my own opinion. The story definitely lacks some answers in it. But the gameplay itself is enough to keep you playing game whether you know what's going on.

The game's mechanics are solid and while not as deep as other games in the genre such as Devil May Cry 4 they are more than serviceable and the addition of mechanics like Burst Rush (similar to Witch Time in the Bayonetta series) and an unlockable counter ability keep combat engaging.\n\nThe game performed well on my (high-end) PC. I didn't encounter any glitches or crashes. I was really happy about not haivng to install any mods or tweak any settings for the game to actually run for once! It's a solid port.\n\nThe game is amazing on an aesthetic level. The black shading that the game makes heavy use of looks great. Screenshots of the game look great but it's another thing to see it in motion. The OST is remarkable as well. Mondo and David's VAs do great jobs. The story is understandable but at the same time abstract like some of Suda51's other games. It never prevented the game from being enjoyable and enabled a lot of cool moments and funny dialogue. The game likes to break the 4th wall and uses it to create a powerful ending.\n\nThe game is short, but still well worth anyone's time, especially if they enjoy action games. I played through without doing any of the Challenges and most of the Gigolo missions (which unlock subweapons). I highly recommend it! Hopefully more of Suda51's games will make their way to Steam as time goes on.","November 2, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its gameplay may be simple, but it's fun.\n\nThe story itself, may not make much sense at some times, but it's not like it's complete trash and horrible, it's a story that it's there, and if you are as clueless as me, you'll even get surprised by it and find it good. Some characters are also very charismatic (or annoying, depending on your taste), and some are just forgetful and are there just for the sake of having someone.\n\nThe gameplay, as fun as it is has some flaws, although some might be my fault, as I suck. Like the spin attack, which is pretty much useless as it leaves you too vulnerable and not once in the game there is enough enemies around you to justify using it. When finishing killing a boss, there is a little QTE where you must hold the F button to raise your sword and release it to cut the enemy. This QTE is used to make the player feel the action was him, it was the player himself killing the person, but the result is not as great, as it is not fun holding down the button. Some upgrades also never appeared for me during my play, which I find it weird (although I think those are unlocked with good score or side missions, which neither I did it).\n\nThe music is gold, ♥♥♥♥ing gold. It makes a very good mood, not mattering the stage.\n\nOne of my main complaints with the game, is that it felt short. I finished it in seven hours, but it definitely felt less and it also felt easy. If you are a experienced gamer or action player, you might want to up the difficult a bit, playing it on Hard or Very Hard, as I felt normal was too easy, especially the bosses (and mainly the final boss). But granted, the game might feel short, but it has side missions and the gigolo missions, which I didn't even try. Although the main story feels short, especially as some chapters are literally 3 minutes of gameplay and 10 of cutscene, the side missions and gigolo missions and even the rating system and leaderboards try to make up for that fact.\n\nAs I bought this game, I was afraid as I heard some comments about the PC port, saying that it crashed a lot and was unstable. I am happy to say that is not true, at least in my case. The PC port is a good port, with good keyboard/mouse controls (although QTEs are kinda annoying to do on the mouse), with, unfortunately, few graphics options.

It has rock solid gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals, but its story and length make it feel underdeveloped.\n\nAs aformentioned, the actual slashing itself is pretty much flawless. The combat has weight to it, and every blow feels powerful and precise. For a character action game, there arn't many button combinations to remember: sword attacks are delegated to one button, and pertain to how long the button is held. Any combos that are present are optional and are used for very specific situations. Besides a sword, the protagonist has an arm cannon which can be used to shoot enemies from afar, and can be upgraded to perform other useful functions as well - the integration feels natural and adds another dimension to the combat.\n\nThe visuals are Suda51's trademark cel-shaded style, perfected with a more technical look. Color palettes are very simple throughout each level. Shadows are sharp, drowning the backdrop in a thick, dimly-tinted glaze; Light sources are harsh and distorting, burning through the mostly-dark environments. A thick layer of bloom compliments the conflicting light and dark, creating an almost dreamlike appearence. Easily some of the most striking visuals ever seen in a video game.\n\nMy main gripes with the game are it's story and overall length; however, I belive it is best to go blind for this kind of game, so I won't mention specific scenes. I'm not usually one to complain about game length, but Killer is Dead's story is much too ambitious for the paltry 7 hour length of the main campaign, although I'm not sure if more time would have helped it. Although I enjoy the "as it happens" storytelling technique that this game utilizes, the story itself becomes convoluted past the point of enjoyable and is full of dead ends. Themes pop up and are quickly discarded, while plot twists are introduced without much buildup and consequentially lose their impact. A story can use vagueness to bolster itself, but when so little is explained of even the most important concepts there's very little incentive to look deeper... if there is even supposed to be depth.\n\nI found myself wanting more out of the actual game as well. The touted "Gigolo" dating minigame is fun and a nice break from combat... why are there only four different dates to play? More side missions wouldn't have hurt either, although there are already a steady amount of activities to get perfect grades on. It feels as though something is missing from KiD to give it an extra hook.\n\nDon't be fooled by most "professional" reviews out there; this game is definitely worth your time. I'd even reccomend it to those who are not accomodated to character action games because of the simple control scheme. What's there is fun and kooky; what isn't feels like a giant hole where it should be. There's a reason why it's only 20 dollars.\n\nI'll see you on the dark side of the moon...\n","May 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","2"

ALSO I HIGHLY SUGGEST USING A CONTROLLER!\n\nI believe it only works if you run something a little more strong than the usual set ups. Mainly because a lot of people seems to keep getting this sound or loading glitch. I never experienced these glitches.\n\nMy specs: Intel i5 4670k 3.4 GHz\n8GBs RAM\nGTX 780 3 GB VRAM\nWindows 7 64 Bit\n\nThe only tech problem I had was that I could not finish the Top Performer gigilo mission without setting the game back to 30fps.\n\nNow onto the actual review:\n\nKiller is Dead is a very very strange game. It's from the mind of Suda51. The man who brought us games like No More Heroes, Lollipop Chainsaw, Killer 7, and loads of other weird stuff. The storys around these games are always so strange too. Lollipop is about a cheerleader who weilds a chainsaw and kills zombies. NMH is about an otaku killing the top hitmen to be the number 1 hitman in the world.\n\nKiD focuses on Mondo Zappa. A man who works for the state to kill criminals and other people when they get contracts. The rest of the story plays out in episodes. It feels kind of like an anime. Every episode starts off with an opening animation to get a feel for what you will do. Then you go off and do the execution. Obviously killing many many people on the way there. The rest opf the story is very very strange and maybe too obscure, but I'm, not really complaining. The rest of the game consist of tiny missions, challenges and gigilo missions. The gigilo missions are the be all end all for some people to buy or not to buy. It consists of the player staring at a woman until she looks away. You then look at her assets and build up a blood rush to your head. Once it's full you give her presents until she falls for you. You then go to her room and yatta yatta. A lot of people will probably be offneded by this and scream misogyny. To be fair it seems Suda was going for a James Bond kind of thing with this game. He wanted Mondo to get the girls in a suave way Bond does. It isn't as suave as James, but hey I don't think this is enough to destroy the buy.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the gameplay itself. It's an action hack and slash with challenge. It revolves aroiund leveling up two bars mainly. Your health bar and your blood bar. Your blood functions in many ways. It lets you heal yourself, use your weapons to their max potential, and using adrenaline burst. The gameplay is fast and fun (when in 60fps). You mainly attack with one buttion, guard break with another, dodge, and repeat. When it all comes together it looks so beautiful.\n\nThe presentation throughout this game is amazing. The cel shaded style almost makes it kind of looks like an anime, but also puts itself out of that circle. It really is it's own thing. I'm actually kind of impressed that this is on an Unreal engine. You know the whole joke "everything on Unreal looks the same". This game is full proolf that you just need creative minds. The music is GODLIKE. Akira Yamaoka did an amazing job with this souindtrack. It has jazzy sounds, hip hop, industrial, etc just all melded together. I totally suggest checking out some of the songs on Youtube. Some suggestions from me would be the main menu theme and a track titled King of Ghost.\n\nIt's great to finally have a Suda51 game on PC. Although KiD isn't his best work (I think it's a tie between NMH and Killer 7) KiD isn't as bad as some people say. The gameplay and presentation alone sell me. The bad parts really only consist of the fact that the game is locked at 30 fps, but that can be changed in the files. Like I said at the start too I could opnly finish one side mission in 30fps. Other than that the game ran very smooth and I experinced no other glitches. Maybe I'm lucky? The only other things that could throw people off would be the giglo missions and the fact that the story doesn't explain itself at all. So much so that I can see people not be interested at all in the story. It really goes far off into weird places.\n","August 9, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

This game gives you all the bizarre ♥♥♥♥ but ties it together so it isn't indecipherable. The graphics are very solid, the boss battles are cleverly made, the length of the game is more than fair for 20 dollars, and the story is funky.\n\nThe swordplay is well refined, definitely deeper than No More Heroes. While I can't say I've played a lot of sword based games. This is by far and away my favourite game for swordplay. It almost feels like Gunz with a K-style feel. As there's a heavy emphasis on dodging and quick movements. I won't get into the specifics about the weird ♥♥♥♥ he puts in, but suffice to say, it won't disappoint and it makes a lot more sense than Killer7. Edit: I've played more fighters/hack'n'slashes since Killer is Dead and this game doesn't seem to add much to the, "Wait for enemy to do an animation, dodge or block, swing sword." Still, it's better than No More Heros and it is well done.\n\nA few things I really don't like. The menu system is a nightmare to navigate with a mouse and keyboard and you can't remap keys from within the game. Albeit the ingame controls are perfect for mouse and keyboard. I wouldn't want to remap them anyway. It's also default set at 30fps which you can change by editing an .ini file.","November 23, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It comes across as a jumbled mess of random ideas and cliches that never bothers to lay down any ground rules on the setting. Immersion was constantly ruined for me because of this and I could not therefore care about the plot and characters.\n\nFor example, I've only played about two hours and I've seen talking unicorns, vampires, morphing robot arms, ghosts, moon travel, horribly annoying energetic ditzy female sidekick, Alice in Wonderland houses, a nurse who rides a floating giant syringe, cringeworthy dialogue, and fourth wall breaking comments. Feels like the game was created by a bunch of middle schoolers and nobody thought to proofread their fan fiction. Just a hot mess of nonsense.\n\nI do dig the art style, it is trippy and that matches the game's sense of style. Additionally, the music is very good with levels having appropriate themes attached to them. I played with a gamepad and found the controls responsive and pretty easy to follow. However, I suspect that as more abilities are unlocked the controls would get too complex for somebody who is not an action gamer (like me).\n\nMy not liking the game could be partially due to Killer is Dead being made for a primarily Japanese audience. Some of the things I find weird and distasteful could be due to cultural differences. Some people might find all the weirdness refreshing and revel in the exotica. Maybe I tried too hard to understand a game that defies being understood and hence my disconnect.\n\nThat being said, I cannot recommend the game. It has definite strengths but its shortcomings are too glaring for me to ignore. All a matter of taste but the spices here don't mix together into a pleasing melange.","March 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

Numerous people (myself included) are having troubles with hard freezes in-game, that will hopefully be worked out.\n\nI'm partial to Suda's bizarre storytelling, mixing mythology, low-brow humor, and a command of pathos to produce an interesting melange that ultimately is strong. Sometimes I wish he'd can some of the T&A and low-brow humor, but I'm actually not so sure if the emotion would hit as hard if it wasn't contrasted with the genuinely silly. And for what it's worth, I've laughed in surprise a couple times.\n\nWhat we have here is a pretty good spectacle fighter. Not as good as anything from Platinum, or Devil May Cry, but quite good nonetheless. I wouldn't recommend it at $60, but at $20 I certainly can.\n\nThe graphics are really great, with a strong pallet and fantastic use of shadow. I could use a little bit less bloom, but it's a strong game visually if you can get past lower-poly models than we're used to in AAA titles. The sound design is fantastic, and varied, matching the atmosphere well.\n\nTake the unique graphics, story, and great sound and match it with a decent brawler and you have a game worth $20. But that's if Grasshopper can patch this up to snuff.

If you've even played the Devil May Cry series or anything that resembles it, you'll pretty much see no difference in this game either. The only real difference in combat is that as you hit enemies with your sword, you'll gain Blood, a resource that you can then use for your special kills, such as range weapons or even executions that will one shot most of the enemies once their guard is down.\n\nAs you kill enemies and complete missions, you'll get both experience points and money, which you can then use later on between missions. With experience points you can buy new skills and upgrade them, and with money you can buy items from the shop. The items that you can buy includes health/recourse upgrades, resurrection cards in case you die during missions and don't want to restart from the last checkpoin, and Gifts for Beauties that you can "date" (I'll tell more about that feature later on).\n\nAs for the content in this game, the main story contains 12 different missions plus one extra DLC mission (episode 51). There here are 12 submissions and 20 challenges, which mainly gives you only money and little bit experience, but they'll also give costumes if you achieve the highest rank in them (achieving them is guite hard if you ask me).\n\nGraphics takes some time to get used to, sounds are doreable and voice acting could be better.\n\nAs for the Story, I'm still trying to grasp it, because it doesn't really make any sense. Nothing is really explained, as the game presumes that you know all the background stories already, and because of that you'll get even more confused as you make progress through missions.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this game also has these Gigolo missions, where you can flirt with the game's Beauties and offer them gifts that you can buy from the Shop. The way you flirt with them is by looking them through these X-ray classes while they're not noticing, which then increases the progress bar. Once the bar is full, you can offer the beauty a gift, and if the gift is their likings, the beauties will reward you with items such as sub-weapons and stuff (and perhaps some night activity). I'm a guy in my late 20's, so this feature didn't really attract me at all. If you ask me, this whole Gigolo feature was implemented to the game only to attract more buyers such as boys in their teens.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty simple battle mechanics, easy to learn\n+ Money's worth of content\n+ Works well with Keyboard and Mouse\n+ Hard boss battles\n+ 2 language options for the voices, English and Japanese (better immersion with japanese voices, because its japanese styled game)\n\nCons:\n- The art style, my eyes started to hurt after playing more than 30 minutes or so, but that's only for me\n- Story is really...really...really hard to grasp of what's going on\n- The game assumes that you know all the background stories\n- Camera angles are sometimes irritating\n- Gigolo feature is out of place and it was probably only added to the game to attrach young customers\n- English voice acting could be better (especially Mika's voice acting is irritating for most of the time)\n\nDo I recommend?\nNot really. Not only I felt naucious because of the art style, but the biggest problem with it was the story. Each time I started to grasp of what's going, the game gave another new information bomb (so to speak) that confused me even more. But if you really wan't buy the game for it's hack&slash style, I would recommend you to go KiD's wiki sites and read all the background stories from there before you start to play it.\n\nVerdict: 3 / 10 - Bad game\n( 1 = do-not-bother game\n5 = Average game\n10 = Must own game )","March 30","false","10.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HIFTD/recommended/261110/","HIFTD","Tabula Rasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HIFTD/","978 products in account","A stylish, over-the-top character action game that's equal parts fun to play and completely freaking mental. It's worth a buy... if you can get the port to work correctly that is.\n\nKiller is Dead - Nightmare Edition, is a straight, balls-to-the-wall port that includes the added difficulty of Nightmare mode, Steam Leaderboards and the Smooth Operator DLC pack. Very little has been changed over all, and the game controls decently with the mouse and keyboard, but a controller is a sound investment if you have one.\n\nThe game is made by developer SUDA51, the only survivor of a series of 51 clones who were put in a room together and told that the last man alive could be a video game developer, so you should expect around that level of sanity going in. The story doesn't explain itself at all, and operates under a weird alternate universe logic where the laws of the universe are very different. Expect to be lost and either have to do research outside of the game or in the game's Theater Mode, unlocked after beating the game once.\n\nYou play as Mondo Zappa, stylish contract killer-for-hire and a new member of Bryan's execution office, an independent, albeit federally managed assassination service. Your job is simple; kill monsters, in whatever horrific shape they may appear, from self-proclaimed gods who wear nothing but gold chains, to an ex-Yakuza member who has been spiritually fused with a murderous tiger, to powerful vampires; there are so many colorful characters that it's hard to name them all, but they all feel special and they're all memorable.\n\nThe gameplay is third person character action, with focus on timing and precision as opposed to brutal and fast combos or moving about the arena very quickly. It's simple but cathartic and satisfying to pull off well, and pulling off a hard fight awesomely is an experience you'll relish. The level design itself, however, leaves a lot to be desired. While there's a great variety of locations, the campaign is rather short, and the arenas feel boring and lifeless, designed to be arenas for combat and little else. And due to how often the game reuses them, you'll become rather familiar with them as well.\n\nIt must be mentioned; the port doesn't always work correctly. It worked perfectly fine for me, but I ran it locked at 30fps on a 64-bit OS, and I've heard that 32-bit OS's don't work at all, and running the game at higher than 30 fps causes serious bugs. I noticed framerate drops at specific parts in the game often led to me taking a few hits, but only occasionally, and it didn't bother me enough that I would want to stop playing.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but style oozes out of every pore of Killer is Dead, and it's worth picking up for the total uniqueness of the experience alone. The Nightmare Edition includes a few extra features, but it's not a whole lot in comparison to the console version you can get for almost the same price and with less issues. Pick the PC version up if the game goes on sale, if you need a mouse and keyboard or you just don't have access to a console.","June 19, 2014","true","31.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phatmillips/recommended/261110/","phatmillips","Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phatmillips/","1993 products in account","This is going to be a long, winded, rant/review so bare with me.  :)\n\nFor the record I want to tell everyone who reads this my backstory/history with this genre and Suda51.  I have played most of his games, well specifically his mainstream ones.  I am fan of the genre; the hack and slash / Devil May Cry'esque games.  It is my firm belief that not only is this the worst Suda51 games I've ever played, it is also the worst hack and slash game I have ever played as well.\n\nLets get the positives out of the way.  At times, the game can look and sound downright gorgeous.  I honestly love the cell shaded graphics and the style.  The combat, for what is it worth - more on this in a moment - is very competent and easy to use and, I guess, master.\n\nI cant think of anything else.\n\nThere is a very long laundry list of bad, a lot which has been mentioned by many a reviewer.  I will just run them down for you in no particular order:\n\n-  Game is extreamly simple, basic.  There are no combos, no moves, no tactics, really no reason to use your alternate weapons - maybe on higher difulculties.  The drill is the only thing I would argue as it would destroy enemies shields but thats it.\n-  The mission menu is extreamly complicated and is needlessly obtuse.  You have to tab through pages and pages just to find the exact mission you want play.\n-  The upgrade sytem is highly exploitable and afterawhile you will have unlocked everything you need to survive.\n-  The friendly NPCs are as bland as you can think of, no depth, no backstory.  I was literally expecting a twist, or a hidden/deeper message when I got to the end but I found none.\n-  Short.  Which is probably a good thing as I wasnt enjoying myself.\n-  Most of the games lore and content you need to extrapolate yourself or its left up to mystery.\n-  The story is probably one of the worst stories I have ever experienced in my list.  This is probably the nail in the coffin for me as I am from a RPG mentality, story is king.\n\nTo put it into perspective without really any spoilers.  You go through 12 missions, all are completed on normal at least in under an hour.  Most are done within 15-20 minutes, some as short as 5.  Mission to mission killing endless robot like enemies (the game calls them Wires) where at the end you fight the area boss.  The boss is independent to that level and has no story outside of that area.  Rinse and repeat about 7-9 times.  The remainder times are your actual core story of the game and let me tell you it's awful.  You dont know who the main villian is or even his motivations are until the 2nd last to very last mission.  There are no collectables to acquire to provide backstory, all you rely on are the esoteric cutscenes.  At the end of the game, really nothing is accomplished even.\n\nA lot of people harp about the Gigolo missions.  In them you need to stare at a girl that you dont learn anything about or see outside of this context.  If you look at her T or A when shes not looking you gain some form of points for some reason.  Earn enough and you can give a present.  Raise the present point up and she will have intercourse with you or something.  The point is these missions are needed to unlock the side weapons, you only need to do one mission per girl to ge the weapon.\n\nThe missions really dont bother me, I only did them once though.  However I do agree that they add nothing to the game and are a waste of time.\n\nSo again, I dont recommend this game at all.  I have personally played, beaten and in love with Lolipop Chainsaw.  This is crap in comparison.  I have played his Shadows of the Damned, another incredible game.  I thorougly enjoyed No More Heroes, I played it to death on my PS3 when it was ported over with the PS Move.  Finally I grew up playing Killer7, as crazy and nonsense as that game is Killer7 has a story and has a point, has meaning at the end.\n\nKiller is Dead has no redeemable value, has one of the worst stories I have ever witness.  It felt like something what going to happen, something to make it all make sense or worth while.  In the end it is just eye candy, and even at times it looks like a turd with the cellshaded graphics working against it.  Theres a scene in the game when the main character is travelling by motocycle but the ground looks distored and purple, another where he enters one of the games very first rooms and the cell shaded graphics go haywire and make it look awful.\n\nI finished the game on normal, I have little to no desire to replay it on a higher difulculty or do the countless challenge/sub missions.  I know a lot of people like it - i think most are liking it because its a Japanese game that want to see more of.  Heed my warning:\n\nTHERE ARE BETTER GAMES OUT THERE!\n\nEven in the same genre.  In fact, I fully reccomend Ninja Blade over this drivel.\n\nI give this game a 2 out of 5.  Would not play again for a very long time...\n\nAgain,\n\nGO PLAY NINJA BLADE INSTEAD","March 30, 2015","false","8.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's weird, but that's not to its detriment.\n\nThe gameplay in K.I.D. is pretty much dodge, counter, slice and dice to victory. It's kind of an easy game, but that shouldn't deter you from experiencing it. You may have to be a bit twitchy to pull off the counters, so it's not completely devoid of skill.\n\nThe real draw of this game is the art. It has colors, which is novel in a world full of game devs that can only concieve of palletes made purely of fecal matter. There are a few hints at other games, which the dev made obvious but you'd have to play them to know what they are.\n\nThe story is good, but when it comes to weird media it falls short. I'm drawing my line at FLCL which made me have the feels by the end because I realized that even though the characters didn't really know each other they really felt genuine feelings for each other. This game had some unique and awesome characters, but I didn't really feel for them as much by the end. This could hav been remedied by making the game a little longer. I felt as though I almost knew the characters.\nIf I did have to compare it to an anime (and this game definitely has that sort of feel) I would say it's sort of like Cowboy Bebop on acid.\n\nAll in all you should probably play this game before you die.

The story makes an attempt at intrigue but ends up going nowhere and being very tedious.\nLike No More Heroes, this is pretty much a boss rush but without any of the goofy charm; unless tasteless, out-of-place meta comments count as charm.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like Suda51 is trying to imitate his own work, or maybe he's just become predictable.","December 29, 2014","false","9.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That gets old pretty quick and there isn't really any logical progression to the story that I could find and they never really explain things so at the end of the day it is fun for a while but ultimately 'just okay'\n\nAlso worth noting is that this is very much a console game, it has a 30fps lock that can only be bypassed by editing config files and rather than have rebindable keys it has two different control layouts (the default one is good enough though in my opinion). The camera movement also feels very 'slide-y' where I wasn't sure if my sensitivity was too high or too low because it basically has something similar to mouse smoothing which I can only assume is coming from the expectation of using a controller where it would move faster when you move the camera for a longer time.\n\nIf you can get it cheap then go ahead, you will more than likely get at least a few hours of fun out of it and maybe even come back from time to time for some 'dumb fun' but I doubt anyone is willing to sit through mission after mission pretty much doing the same thing with no clue why just to see the conclusion if there even is a clear ending that makes sense (this is coming from someone who got 5 hours in before the repetition got to me so take this with a slight grain of salt)\n\nThis game makes me wish we could get a "recommended if 90% off" option when reviewing. At full price however this is not worth it.","May 31","false","5.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you're not sure about your computer's processor, check around the computer, box it came in, the manual, anything to make sure it is not a DUAL CORE Processor.)\n\nI have never been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at buying a game before, mainly because I don't exactly feel it's my fault the game doesn't run. Granted, my computer is probably only as powerful as a toaster, and granted I used a site that only one friend has ever told me about, which he has used before, to check if my computer could run specific games, but to be told that I could run the game, see the game run perfectly at high quality (which is a miracle on this machine), and then for all of that to be taken away because of one HUGE bug that can be fixed (as far as we know) by the developers of the game, "fury" is a word that is lightyears away from the feeling of pure rage that I have in the pit of my stomache. This kind of thing in a game is inexcusable, when the developers should have easy access to the game's data, assets, core programming, and everything else that goes into making a game at their fingertips, to fix if necessary. Yes the developers have been notified of the bug, but the game has been in the steam market place for 7 months, and this bug has been in the game since day one. It should NOT have taken them this long to figure out the cause of the bug. However, I am also NOT a professional programmer and know very little in the ways of programming, but for it to take 7 months to fix sounds unreasonable and amateur-esque. In short, *BUYER BEWARE*, I am a salt factory currently over this issue, the developers don't seem to care about or know how to fix the issue, and I will NOT be buying another computer or another copy of this game; this game is not good enough to spend another 20 or 600 dollars on.","December 24, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are side missions that include staring at a woman's chest while she's looking away, and giving her gifts until you have sex and she gives you a reward. These quests are moderately necessary, as it's how you obtain the other modes for the arm cannon.\n- Some episodes of the story are mostly self contained, and detached from the rest of the game.\n- Forth wall breaking\n- No, David! Put some clothes on!\n\nPros:\n- If you enjoy immature and silly humor, this game will very likely make you laugh a lot.\n- The combat system, though seemingly simple, feels extremely rewarding once you learn to use it well.\n- TALKING UNICORN\n- $20 price tag\n- Though shorter than I had hoped, the game was enjoyable enough to leave me wanting more.\n\n\nUltimately, I would highly recommend this game, even if only on the combat system. It was one of the most fun systems I've used, allowing you to feel immensely powerful when you manage to get in the rythm. For $20, I feel it's definitely worth getting, just to slice and dice some monsters.","July 17, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though KiD at times seems to dangle this action in front of you like a rider dangling a carrot in of a horse. To state this unmetaphoracally, you have to go through some BS to get to the good stuff. I played the side mission for all of 30 seconds finding this part of the game hard to hold my attention though I did get a good 8h 35mins out of completing the game on normal, and with there being some replayability.\n\nI found the art, sounds, and story to be very similar to a mix of Cowboy Beebop, Trigun, and Champloo but also had a lot of its own flavor.\n\nThe sound track to this is absolutely phenominal.\n\nBad\nThe action is so good that the extras seem like BS.\n\nUgly\nThough there were little quirks about the game that bothered me, it was easy to look past the ugly because the gameplay was great. Color scheme kind of bugged because the black coloring would always feel off but was easily looked passed. Story line was all over the place, though did have its good and humorous moments.\n\nAll in all I'd rate this game:\n\n85/100\n\n8 1/2 hours played\n12 missions & normal game mode completed.\n+-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-+\n',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',','|{H}|[ <> ]\n+-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-+\nThird Play\n2 more down = 6 total complete\n3hr+ played\n\nEverything about this game still holds my attention solidly. Sounds just get better, the graphics conttinue to wow, though it still feels like the contrast or gamma is off when playing on my big screen even while I know its the art. The action is epic and at times can feel like you have to go through BS to get to it. Or maybe it's that the action is so epic that everything else feels like BS. We'll see on the fourth play.\n\nAll in all, this game still wows me!\n+-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-+\n',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',',','|{H}|[ <> ]\n+-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-+\nSecond play\n2 more missions = 4 total complete\n2hrs+ played.\n_______________________________________\nI'm continuously amazed by the graphics, and the score is beautifully done. Oddly enough you have this bizzare story that gets soo weird at times, well most of the time, and it keeps you guessing whether or not to take the game serious. Here you have the main charater, the cliche 007 type, who womanizes artfully hot women and destroys demons in 1080p "bad-assery", then you get unicorms and wtf is going on? ...uh...\n\nThough I do get a mild chuckle from a story that is beyond odd and I'm not sure how I feel about it so early in the game.\nArt direction earns an exceptional notation as it is brilliantly done.\nGraphics continue to surprise.\nVoice overs are well done\nMusic is great, original contemporary Bee-Bop-ish acid jazz and really fits the theme.\nControls are great. I thought I'd hate them at first because they couldn't be adjusted (except for invert X & Y) but they were quick and easy to get used to.\nOverall Loving this game.

The aesthetic, the hack and slash, the music, the goofy stuff that you would only find in a Japanese game, and much more.\n\nThe problem I am having with it though is in about every step of the way in this game I am coming across road blocks. It is cool that the internet exists and you can get step by step guides on fixing things but it isn't my job to make a game functional. I paid for a product that functions smoothly. Which this doesn't.\n\nFirst step of the way is that all of the controls for my controller are reversed. Then as you play the game instead of it understanding that you are using a controller it commands you to use key board keys which gets confusing because it wants to function at a fast pace but when the game tells you to left click and there are two different buttons on your controller that function as a left click you find yourself jumping from button to button trying to figure out which one works. Sometimes the buttons you know that the game prompts you to use as a specific button won't work as that button and it just chooses which one is the right one.\n\nThen I kind of figure out the mechanics work out in the third chapter. *SPOILERS* When the boss battle comes up the sound cuts out! Then from then on the sound is cutting in and out randomly through out the game.\n\nI want to like the game but it just seems wrong to sell a product to the consumer that requires a great deal of fixings. If there was a one and done patch for it then I might not be that upset but just three chapters in the game I don't really want to play the game because I just believe I will keep bumping into these road blocks as I go through which will make me exit out, look up the problem, and then fix it step by step. So far I have put more time into fixing the game then actually playing it.

The aesthetic, the hack and slash, the music, the goofy stuff that you would only find in a Japanese game, and much more.\n\nThe problem I am having with it though is in about every step of the way in this game I am coming across road blocks. It is cool that the internet exists and you can get step by step guides on fixing things but it isn't my job to make a game functional. I paid for a product that functions smoothly. Which this doesn't.\n\nFirst step of the way is that all of the controls for my controller are reversed. Then as you play the game instead of it understanding that you are using a controller it commands you to use key board keys which gets confusing because it wants to function at a fast pace but when the game tells you to left click and there are two different buttons on your controller that function as a left click you find yourself jumping from button to button trying to figure out which one works. Sometimes the buttons you know that the game prompts you to use as a specific button won't work as that button and it just chooses which one is the right one.\n\nThen I kind of figure out the mechanics work out in the third chapter. *SPOILERS* When the boss battle comes up the sound cuts out! Then from then on the sound is cutting in and out randomly through out the game.\n\nI want to like the game but it just seems wrong to sell a product to the consumer that requires a great deal of fixings. If there was a one and done patch for it then I might not be that upset but just three chapters in the game I don't really want to play the game because I just believe I will keep bumping into these road blocks as I go through which will make me exit out, look up the problem, and then fix it step by step. So far I have put more time into fixing the game then actually playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callmecougarbait/recommended/261110/","callmecougarbait","EasyBake-sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callmecougarbait/","146 products in account","Allow me to start off with a simple warning: this game is a SUDA51 game. Generally speaking, SUDA51 games are either loved or hated. I happen to be a fan, though I know most aren't. SUDA51 games have an almost cult following, despite some very scathing reviews.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Mondo, an executioner for a shady company that basically completes contract kills. The story slowly and confusingly unravels as a secondary goal of the game. Mondo himself attempts to break the 4th wall stating plainly that this is a game, even making a choice solely to keep the fans happy. The story itself is admittedly not very present, essentially all you need to know is whom to kill and which way to go. Upon completing the game you unlock some information about the game's characters and themes which help to flesh out what SUDA was going for. The story takes place during missions and tends to be the epitome of mind-trip, at once being an Alice in Wonderland-esque house, with a villian asking to die, then jumping to an aged samurai blessed with a Tiger guardian. Trips to the moon are frequent, and dark matter plays role in the enemies and character development. Dream levels and sequences are a way to hint at what is the driving force between Mondo and the main villian, hinting towards past events locked away by traumatic experiences.\n\nGameplay is the main focus of the game, being an action, hack and slash with scores and points being the main focus. The character unlocks better skills and abilities via points and items dropped by WIRES the main enemy. Reminiscent of Bayonetta and Devil May Cry (though admittedly not to the degree of those games) the fighting can be quick, leave you feeling powerful, and can quickly turn against your favor. The greatest fault with the gameplay ultimately comes in the form of the camera, which can be difficult to get right, as you'll find yourself zoomed into a corner focusing on one enemy while the others try and swarm. Ultimately this isn't a great issue as one can adjust to the shifting focus easily, and the problem seems to disappear when focusing with the sub-weapon, an arm-cannon that runs off of the blood of Mondo's enemies.\n\nThere are sidemissions from challenges given out by Scarlett, a seductress that provides and feeds off of blood, and missions dealing with specific items for the office (a hub for stats, upgrades, gift shop, etc). The oddity and a staple in SUDA games comes in the "gigilo" missions in which Mondo tries to get with one of four girls. The mission takes on the appearance of a date with said girl. There is a meter in the shape of Mondo's head that is filled up with a red fluid by ogling the... body of the date. When this meter fills it allows Mondo to give a gift to the girl filling up another meter of hearts. When the hearts are filled you get the girl. Now if your date sees you staring a third meter begins to drop, emptying what is essential a condom. When this condom-looking meter drops, you get slapped and the date is done. These missions are the one method to unlock the three sub-weapons for your arm-cannon. Now these "gifts" aren't really necessary to the entirety of the game, but the side missions and finding the secret challenges require them to complete. This, along with certain costumes and character designs, are all typical sexy/sexist SUDA51 and fans will be happy to know that there are glasses that have an x-ray affect allowing Mondo to see his date's underwear.\n\nThe music for Killer Is Dead is fairly understated. Definitely taking a backdrop. The majority of it being slower-paced, or specifically designed to set an atmosphere for the levels, at times being unnerving, and at others intent on giving a sense of urgency. While it isn't a game that would be pushed for an OST it still isn't a weak link in the design of the game.\n\nKiller is Dead allows and encourages a level of replayability. After completing each mission the player is given a score (up-to AAA) with scores given based on time to complete, deaths, and the like. Going back through the missions after unlocking a certain sub-weapon allows the player to unlock certain challenges, which upon completion unlocks certain bonus in the game such as gifts for the gigilo missions and costumes. However going back through the game for the story is largely unnecessary as one will find themself playing through certain missions that are more fun or provide more experience/money for the gift shop. So while I'm not rushing to play through it beginning to end (some dream levels are just plain boring) I did find myself running through certain levels to get higher scores, more money and experience to upgrade Mondo.\n\nOverall, while this is a SUDA51 game, I can only recommend Killer Is Dead for the crazy, mind-trip of a story, sexy (sexist) and hilarious side missions, fun gameplay, and an enjoyable time. Admittedly I know this is a (very) short game, as the story only takes a few hours, so my suggestion is to wait for a sale to check it out. Now if you know you're not a fan of SUDA games, then, understandably, stay away as this is very much SUDA51 through and through.","July 6, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have a sword and a gun arm. Enemies exist not to threaten you, but to get combo'ed on (with the sword, not the gun arm). There are bosses, who are ridiculous. There is a plot, which is both the dumbest and actually pretty cool. Spoiler: the moon is evil, yo. Graphics are stylized. Voice is acted. Swords. If you like Suda 51, you'll like this game. If you don't know if you like Suda 51, try this game, it's a good example of what he does so well.\n\nIt's a good example, except for one thing:\nYou get weapons by ogling women in a minigame, so you can get a boner which will magically allow you to press the "give them a gift" button in order to give them the gift you saw they wanted using your x-ray peeper vision. I'm not going to speak to how objectifying this may or may not be, I'm instead going to say that this is a really dumb mechanic, and also you only need to do this once, and you really don't even need to do that, because most of the secondary weapons are not worth using when you have THE SWORD. This whole concept was dumb, and I'm not sure why Suda 51 felt the need to include it. I don't like it, but feel that it should not otherwise impact your enjoyment of a game that is clearly batshit insane.\n\nOne other note:\nIt's never explained or shown or hinted at in the story, but Suda 51 has said in interviews that Mondo's arm had to be replaced by a cyborg arm because it got INFECTED BY OSAMA BIN LADEN'S EVIL THAT MONDO CAUGHT WHEN HE KILLED OSAMA.

It comments on the disjointed stories, weak characters, reliance on aesthetic over substance, grotesque misogyny, and even the quick-time events that plague the genre by taking all of them to their logical extremes, just to ♥♥♥♥ people off and get them to notice what God of War and Ninja Gaiden apparently didn't.  And from what I've seen, it worked, which automatically makes this a brilliant game in its own right.  Not to mention there's a ton of variety, the action's top-notch, and the aesthetic is wonderful.  It's a game for gamers who are also art fans.

Very stylish with a crazy story, thanks to Suda's writing. Not as unique as the games he has full control over, but definitely plays better.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and satisfying, and the episodes are of reasonable length. The lady missions feel tacked on however. Infact they are tacked on.\n\nAs for the port, it's not too bad. Except the 30FPS limit. There is a quick fix to bring it to 60 or even 120, though it speeds up UI elements by 2 or 3 times, depending on the running framerate, the rest of the game is unaffected.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've finished it, the game is kinda short (7 hrs for all the main episodes).

I played this on normal and finished the game at exactly 7 hours. Please note though, that I literally did no side missions but the main campaign. Iif you do the side missions also you are looking at approx 12~ hours. To sum this up into a quick review. Think god of war mixed with sin city mixed with a japense setting and that is this game in a nutshell. Although the game is a little mundane and repetetive it is worth a play through simply for the graphics. I can honestly say that I have never played a game with cell shading and graphical effects quite like this game. For that reason alone, I would say that this game is worth experiencing.\n\nNotice: Users do report a glitch not being able to get past a certain chapter on dual processor machines. If you have a dual processor computer I would suggest not purchasing. I have a quad core i7-920 and I had no issues.

Its like a Quentin Tarantino Movie with Beauitful artwork/graphics and story line. I was utterly amazed when i saw this and at the beginning didn't know if this was my kind of game. I'm so glad i got it and i'm really having too much fun with it.\n\n-Pros:\n* Art work i have to repeat this, is just amazing to me it really brings this game together\n\n* The story line, confusing yet wanted me to learn more and try to understand what was going on, in the end of the game i wanted more questions answered which made me hope to see more of this\n\n* move sets are beautful as it is wonderful to do. Weapons and upgrades as you get them down the line helps out a lot more against enemines that really wanna try to gank you\n\n*boss fights are interesting to me, when i thought i beat a boss they come back ( damaged yes) but more powerful with a new fighting technique(s) at which you have to learn nor to beat them down once again.\n\n* outfits you get to unlock are nice ( wish it was more though) and even have some unquie properties about them that you can notice when you use them.\n\n\n-Cons:\n*Chap. 3 i believe ( woman in pain) there is a odd glitch where you are on forever phone loop which can be fixed if you used a free program like HxD to correct the chapter line so that you can keep going.\n\n* Sometimes odd fps drops which makes the game lag a bit ( but i will be upgrading my pc) so that depends on what kind of pc you have\n\n* the Mondo's girls are very VERY annoying when they call you in the middle of a Job. for an example I was running to race the clock here comes one of them calling me which made me start walking and took time off me. I wish there was a way to block them but thats just me.\n\n\nIn the end im very glad i got this, you can play this at your own speed, there is different levels are hardness you can do ( i be doing them all down the line) there is side missisons as well ( even though i dont really like the mondo's girls one cause they bug you even more!).\n\n*****9/10 for my vote ( blame mondos girl for the one point off LOL )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 19, 2015","true","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very stylish with a crazy story, thanks to Suda's writing. Not as unique as the games he has full control over, but definitely plays better.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and satisfying, and the episodes are of reasonable length. The lady missions feel tacked on however. Infact they are tacked on.\n\nAs for the port, it's not too bad. Except the 30FPS limit. There is a quick fix to bring it to 60 or even 120, though it speeds up UI elements by 2 or 3 times, depending on the running framerate, the rest of the game is unaffected.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've finished it, the game is kinda short (7 hrs for all the main episodes). There are secret files that explain some details about the world and characters, but a lot still feel missing.","November 30, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RodrigoGX10/recommended/261110/","RodrigoGX10","Vergil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RodrigoGX10/","96 products in account",""Killer is Dead" is a mediocre action game. It tries so hard to be good that it just ends up embarassing itself. Reminds me of Jayden Smith.\n\nSTORY:\nHonestly, just skip the cutscenes. The story is boring, makes no sense and tries too hard to be cool and edgy. You play as Mondo, an assassin or whatever with a robot arm because... its cool I guess?  I stopped caring after the 5th mission.\nIt tries so hard to be philosophical and it ends up being a chore to watch. It also randomly breaks the 4th wall and adds a few funny moments here and there, yet, the mood is ALWAYS dark, asking you to take it seriously. Are we supposed to?  Mondo has no personality at all, neither do the other characters. The game is short, too with only 12 missions. Also, FIVE 4 - 6 minute cutscenes of boring and uninteresting story before one specific mission.\n\nStory - Just. stop. You're embarrasing yourself. Why/10.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nNow, not everything is garbage. The combat is actually pretty fun, it has some great mechanics, some which are a joy to watch in action. Very similar to other SUDA 51 games such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. You can roll, block and parry (if you buy that skill). Upgrading Mondo is fun too since everything is done by fighting. Everytime you kill an enemy, it drops BLOOD points, Health points and currency. By killing enemies with a combo, you get to choose the item that you want. Want to level up your health bar? Go ahead. Need more currency? No problem.\nRemember how I said you can roll? If you dodge just before you get hit by an enemy, you go into this slow mo effect which allows you to mash X as fast as you can to rack up damage. The whole screen turns red, black and white. Its such a joy to watch.\nThe camera is a huge pain is the ♥♥♥, though. It constantly focuses on the one enemy you're attacking, this works for boss fights but not when there's 6 or 7 guys on the screen at once, all trying to kill you. The lock-on system is busted, too. It will constantly get in the way when you try to switch targets quickly, like when an enemy comes from behind when you are busy with another. It either won't let you, or it will attack a completely random one.\n\nBesides the combat, there's also what they call "Giggolo Missions". In this missions you have to build courage by looking at your "Beauty's" breasts, legs, butt... and then when you fill the bar, you give them a gift until they love you.  Not even watching porn makes me feel this dirty. Luckily, these are entirely optional.\n\nGameplay - Fun and fast paced.\n\nARTSTYLE:\nThis is more of a personal gripe with the game. Feel free to skip this part. The artstyle is unique in its own way but it gets old, fast. Everything is dark which only makes everything feels boring and lifeless. Everyone looks glossy. It has its moments like in the mission where you're on a train or in the samurai gardens but the rest of the time, everything looks dull and uninteresting.\n\nArtstyle: Edgy cellshading/10.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nKID is a mediocre game only saved by its combat but not much else. If you want to play this game I'd recommend waiting for a sale. 80% off. Were it not for how good it feels to get a 100 hit combo, I would not recommend this game. At all. Though, I'm dissapointed, Suda. I expected more from you.","December 25, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

Its like a hydbrid between Kill Bill, Anime and huge amounts of LSD. However the ending was very disappointing, I wish that the game could have lasted even longer. It just ends so suddenly, and you really wish to know more about what happened to Mondo. The final boss was also extremely easy to beat on normal difficulty, which is quite unfortunate.\n\nThanksfully there are lots of varied submissions, which can be played after the ending of the game. They are fun and varied, but it could be much more cool if the settings changed some more.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. As I am in my exam period, I haven't had the oppotunity to play this game while high, but I think it could be a huge amount of fun to play this when smoking pot.

The story is not something that is laided out for you, there isn't one obvious plot thread, it isn't about character arcs and a race against time plot but more of a study of a world and people. It isn't for everyone as most will likely just not get it.

I know how bad PC ports can be but this is fine! Sure there is the whole 30fps thing but to be honest i don't really have a problem with that. I only would if the frames dropped to an unplayable level and so far i haven't seen it drop below 29 :D\nI had played it on the 360 and thought i'd get it again to have a bit more fun with it and i am without a doubt doing just that. i loved the combat quite a lot. It's a bit simplified and you only really need 2 buttons in most fights but i forgave that for the sheer fluidity of the fighting.\nNow as for the story....it's a mixed bag. I really like the overall idea of it. You are working for a group under the jurisdiction of an un-named state. Over the course of the game you take execution jobs that only the wealthiest are able to afford. These jobs range from an enraged train to a samuri with a living tiger in his tatoo.\nIt sounds really cool right? Well i think the game could have sold itslef on that alone but there is an over-arching plot about the character and his past. I'm not gonna say anything but i felt that it took the spotlight off what was interesting to show off something that really didn't hold up.\nI also thought it was very short but seeming as you're getting it for €20 it is weel worth the content available. If it had been €50 like before then i wouldn't have been too sure. But i think thats a good sign right? It had to be good for me to want more of it right? :D\nAll in all i'd say it's worth the buy. The combat is great, there is a lot of variety and there is a man wearing a golden bondage outfit....What more can i say?\n\nOh and that last point?

The story is why. At the end of my normal mode playthrough it said I spent 6 and a half hours.\n\nIt's like a detective agency where all the cases that come in is an assassination mission. Each one is broken up into an episode. It doesn't take itself seriously but it's also not in your face wacky and annoying.\n\nAlmost every level is linear. I count that as a positive thing because in these types of games I think the player usually wants to search every little corner for anything that might be hidden. There are some secrets but it's not a huge collect-a-thon like some tend to be.\n\nThe combat isn't great and I don't care. You can make it challenging for yourself if you want to but the startup of some of the moves is so long and you can't use them in other attacks and it's kind of weird. For example: there is a move that seems like it should be something you would use all the time that knocks enemies into the air but you can't start it unless you stop everything else you're doing first. And it takes forever to start. It's definitely the weakest part but it still manages to be fun.\n\nThe whole style of the graphics, characters , and story gives me a bit of a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure feeling.\n\nI only played one of the optional gigolo missions.

Though a little repetitive in combat.\n\nGOOD\n\nSuda51 sure likes their Hack-n-slashes.  The formula hasn't changed too much from other games of the genre but it feels pleasantly solid and satisfying.  There's a lot of timing involved with dodges, blocking and parrying.  Each feels great to do and the game encourages you to kill enemies at high combos with stylish 'judgement' executions.  The difficulty scales well from level to level and from difficulty level to difficulty level.  Easy could be beaten by a toddler, normal could be beaten by a normal guy, hard a veteran of hack and slashes, very hard for people who found Dante must die enjoyable, and finally Nightmare.  In Nightmare mode all enemies become 'immortal' and can only be killed via execution.  You 'could' cheese Nightmare with the Infinite blood costume, but that wouldn't be fair now would it?  There's a good variety of environments and the boss design is great.  Each one feels unique enough and there's one at the end of nearly every episode.  There's plenty of content and side missions to keep one satisfied enough.  But it leaves you wanting more.\n\nBAD\n\nStory is a bit of a hit and miss.  I liked it but many may not like the way it's set up or the tone.  It relies heavily on symbolism and has a few running gags in the vein of a shonen anime.  Combat while fun can get easily repetitive with only one attack button and a ranged weapon.  The lack of a lockon may irritate some, but I never found myself wanting one here.  Another problem is one series of Side missions.  The Gigaloo missions.  They're a bit embarrassing and you'll likely ignore them after you finish each one to get the other sub weapons.  The game will constantly remind you they exist in missions though.  Girls will call you in the middle of a mission and cry about how lonely they are and generally try to guilt trip you.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to mean anything deeper or not... But it's certainly annoying.","August 13, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Get good at awkward as ♥♥♥♥ staring at boobs and thighs contests, poking at her vulnerabilities  when she gives you them, IF SHE GIVES YOU THEM. She won't, really - just RNG or hack money into the game and hope you don't get banned so you have a fair number of attempts to woo the women the first time around. (Mondo's Girls missions.)\n\n3. Realize that the game will be blurry, and there's little you can do about it .\n\nBeyond that, the game has a decent soundtrack, and a narmy charm you can't help but snicker at from time to time.\n\nIt's cheap enough too - that's a start. Will edit if things improve, but as it stands - I doubt it. They expect too much of the player a wee bit too early (On normal.), and if you don't catch on / run out of your revives early, you're going to not have fun re-doing a lengthy boss fight. (Talkin' bout you, David. Boss difficulty RAMPAGE SPIKE.)\n\nPS: Don't pick Mission 51. It's troll bait and I know I'm terrible at navigating dark dungeons combined with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphic filter, but it's just troll bait. You get into the basement of a dungeon, and never find the way out! If it's a mandatory mission, I'd rather not consider the game - but I'm only 5 missions and two "B-Rank Serenades" of women in. Who knows?)\n\n(PPS: Last gripe. Game insists you get a guard breaker skill in your head to use. Using this however, not only wastes time - but leaves you wide open to be attacked by both normal enemies, and bosses. Combo rate and not getting hit are key. You may as well toss your hopes of upgrading or improving into the trash if you get hit. Killing enemies ISN'T. GOOD. ENOUGH. Guard Breaking is mandatory, but using it on EVERY ENEMY WHICH WILL SPAM-BLOCK YOU, will make your combo meter fall.

This game feels like it was a poorly translated story straight out of a fever induced nightmare from someone in Japan.... but that's honestly a good thing in this case.\n\nThe off-the-wall nature of the game coupled with the surreal environments make it easy to forgive the confusion and just enjoy the ride. This may bother some people, but I find it to be refreshing because nothing becomes predictable like in most games. This will keep you wanting to play just to see what bizarre twists lie ahead.\n\nEven though the game is very confusing the combat remains constant and satisfying. There are plenty of flashy effects going on that make it feel very rewarding when you pull off moves correctly. You also have abilities you can purchase and upgrade at your choosing to tune your preferred play style.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that there seem to be a lot of abrupt halts in the action to make room for cutscenes or tips. This is painfully obvious in the first couple of levels, as you'll sit through several dialog scenes that make little sense then be thrown into a fight with 5 or 6 wordy tooltips popping up. This can make the game feel a little overwhelming to a newcomer. Still, it's not a big enough issue to make the game annoying.","July 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game feels like it was a poorly translated story straight out of a fever induced nightmare from someone in Japan.... but that's honestly a good thing in this case.\n\nThe off-the-wall nature of the game coupled with the surreal environments make it easy to forgive the confusion and just enjoy the ride. This may bother some people, but I find it to be refreshing because nothing becomes predictable like in most games. This will keep you wanting to play just to see what bizarre twists lie ahead.\n\nEven though the game is very confusing the combat remains constant and satisfying. There are plenty of flashy effects going on that make it feel very rewarding when you pull off moves correctly. You also have abilities you can purchase and upgrade at your choosing to tune your preferred play style.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that there seem to be a lot of abrupt halts in the action to make room for cutscenes or tips. This is painfully obvious in the first couple of levels, as you'll sit through several dialog scenes that make little sense then be thrown into a fight with 5 or 6 wordy tooltips popping up. This can make the game feel a little overwhelming to a newcomer. Still, it's not a big enough issue to make the game annoying.","July 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The storyline is somewhat there, though not very linear or coherent at all at times. Even by the end, I was still scratching my head a bit as to what did my body just experience.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid and I'd recommend for any action fan. The flow is very smooth, especially once you max out your sword and get into higher blood level combos. The game has just frame dodge and block mechanics and counterattacks as well.\n\nThe only issue I can say with this game is that there isn't very much variety in attacks, including aerial combat. Mondo can't jump at all. You end up using your gun sub weapons to deal with aerial enemies, which is a bit of a disappointment. Most of the time, you'll just be spamming your katana to do damage, though you do have to do more of course on higher difficulties when you've got different enemies, some of them with armor.\n\nOh, and one last thing, Gigolo missions. I was not prepared since I didn't know about these at all before purchasing the game. It turns the game into one of those weird Japanese dating sims, but more perverted. Really they're just a side game if you want to burn time since you're forced to watch the ensuing cutscenes and can't even skip them.

There are only two really unfortunate flaws: you can't rebind inputs for keyboard + mouse, and an awful reliance on "MASH X" QTEs.  If you don't mind any of this, snatch it right up.\n\nPersonally, I got fed up with it when I got to a boss fight where you can damage him most easily with perfect dodge-slashes (which lead into a MASH X QTE) until his health bar depletes; which leads directly into ANOTHER MASH X QTE and if you get through THAT one you go into his second phase which is exactly the same as the first phase so you do more perfectly-timed dodge-slashes (that's another MASH X QTE) and then you get his health bar down which leads into YET ANOTHER MASH X QTE so at this point you've done 15-20 of these MASH X QTEs and your hand is worn out so you biff it which leads to him dealing over 3/4 of your health meter which kills you and if you want to CONTINUE at this point in the fight, to spare yourself any more MASH X QTEs you call in Mika who revives you... if you can pull off a MASH X QUICK TIME EVENT and this reminds you how much you didn't like SHENMUE in the first place and how the "NO, YOU MUST KILL THE BOSS THE *COOL* WAY, TRY AGAIN" crap from GOD OF WAR somehow became a popular and accepted thing in game design up to the point where it ruined the ONE Castlevania series that Konami has seen fit to put on STEAM and you uninstall the game and vow to never play a game that makes you MASH X unless it makes you shoot lightning out of your bung hole.\n\nOr perhaps that's just me.

You begin as an unexplained exicutioner with a robotic arm who starts off in a dark alleyway, versing some unknown bug-eyed cyborg, where the only driblets of plot-hints you get is a mention of the moon, and the phrase, ''killer is dead''. Once out of the initial drawn out cut scene, you are finally given movement. The only thing you can do is slowly walk after your target and swing your mighty katana around to dodge every single oncoming bullet, and might I add, the game does all the sword-swinging for you, and you have no control over it whatsoever. It's quite frankly like the game is holding your hand and walking you to where you need to go.\n\nOnce you've held 'W' down to move your unknown character through 3 pointless alleys to which your target disappears and then reappears, only to shoot you in the face which of course, since it's already being confirmed that this mystery character is the main protagonist and obviously given the title of the game gives hints to the fact that you can't die and in fact are already dead and therefore can't be killed in menial and ''normal'' ways. Of course, the game hand-holding continues with it moving into another cutscene where you rise from the dead and scare the crap out of the person you are about to murder, the only time you get out of this cutscene is to hold 'F' for 5 seconds, release and then be pulled back into a cutscene of it slashing into your target which turns into some pretty purple stuff that flies upwards to the moon and paints it a purple/pink. You get a victory card and away we go to story part 2! They then finally allow you to know that your protagonists name is; Mondo Zappa, a fairly young and odd sounding name in of itself.\n\nI'm sorry, but in what world did anyone think it would be a good idea to have the first 10 minutes of the game essentially be one giant cutscene, with a couple of absolutely pointless and missplaced button pressings thrown in? In fact, most of the game is actually made up of a sequence of cutscenes, with brief areas where you can hold 'W' to get to the next cutscene. Why you would do this is beyond me. It can barely be called a game because half the time, you can barely tell the difference between cutscenes and gameplay segements. The dream sequences make even less sense.\n\nThe rest of the ''storyline'' is all 'wtf' moments that are never explained, having contracts pushed down onto a table after some random unknown character comes in with a "Hey, kill this person for me!" More pointless and unexplained characters populate the rest of the world, such as Mika, who is apparently supposed to be Mondo's 20 year old assistant, and instead acts like an annoying, whiny 5-year-old that just tags along for the purpose of showing that there are other characters in this game, too. It's later ''explained'' that Mondo just found her on the street, passed out, took her inside and fed her, and the only reason he lets her stay is because, and I quote, 'Turns out she's makes pretty good soft-boiled eggs.' The only NPC with *some* sense is Vivienne (with an e!), who doesn't seem to have any motive besides the paycheck upfront for killing these random nutjobs ~from this world and beyond.~\n\nWith every new mission, Mondo seems to have the need to remind the player of what game they are playing, with a try-to-be-badass haircomb and the line 'Killer Is Dead', but hey, at least you have the ability to move your character around in a tiny elevator! Not to mention whilst it's doing to, the game continues to referrence game after movie after game after movie, as if the references alone would make it funny or memorable.\n\nThe excecution ''mechanic'' is just the player holding and then releasing the 'F' key, after yet another long and ridiculous cutscene. The combat is unrewarding button mashing against enemies that seem to just stand there and wave their bobby looking weapons around. The only other ''mechanic'' seems to be going out on dates with hot women, which have you stare at their ♥♥♥♥ and crotch and give her presents from your knees, to raise your 'guts meter.' The in-game music is as out-of-place as everything else.\n\nAnother point to bring up is the fact that Mondo's mechanical arm was never explained in-game, but rather in an interview with Suda51, the so called designer of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥y, who basically explained the concept behind the arm as being that Mondo was in the crew who killed Osama Bin Laden and therefore, his "darkness" tainted his arm and forced him to replace it with a mechanical one. It also tainted the rest of the team, but of course we never find out what happened to them.\n\nI now understand what they mean by Suda51 being a code-name for the game version of Alan Smithee. (If you have no idea what I'm on about, google it, you will probably get a giggle.) But did they really think a 'big, well known' name backing this game was going to give it something to fall back on when people realised how terrible it was? I am beyond disappointed that Deep Silver even so much as had anything to do with this.\n\nHonestly, has no rhyme or reason to it's madness, it's just plain madness. The entierty of the game is mysterious, pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥y that should have never been made.\n\nMy last gripe is with the interface being horridly designed for PC, so much so that a botched up emulator probably would have done a better job of it. The fact that in the controls, the old style picture of keyboard with squared lines up to the action is all in the same color makes it iritating to make heads or tails of. Then again, it's not like you really get to have much if any control within the game anyway. Lastly, if you have a multi-core machine, give up any hopes of getting past the first chapter, because it will probably end up crashing.\n\nI quite frankly wouldn't even waste my time giving this a slow handclap. In-fact, I feel sorry for the poor sods who were hired to program and code this utter rubbish.\n\nThe ONLY good thing I can really say about this game is the fact that it's quite attractive, it has an art-style of which I'm kind fond of, it saddens me immensely that the games failings were to overshadow this. I had high hopes for this game, each of which were slowly squashed.\n\n","January 27, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

His powers consist of using blood to slow down the enemy and slice them in half with his blade, dodging at fast speeds, having a hand that can turn into multiple weapons, and  a partner that can revive him. If you played No More Heroes the game plays kinda like it, just without the motion controls attached.\n\nThe main game missions and gigolo missions combine can be beaten within about six hours. The game is fairly short but very replayable with multiple difficulties to keep things fresh and fun.

The controls are responsive and the game oozes style; although, at times, the style is too stylized for its own good.\n\nPlot: Mondo Zappa is an assassin who works for a contract agency. The game follows execution mission after execution slowly revealing more about Mondo's past. The plot is not anything special, but it serves its purpose of creating a cohesive enough story to enable progression in gameplay. Mondo is a decent enough protagonist, his two main traits being cool or yelling. Mika's voice is grating at times; I played with the english voice track which can be switched. I have no comments on the japanese voice track but it's probably fine. Overall plot gets a not dumpster out of dumpster.\n\nGameplay: The combat in Killer is Dead is stellar. Dodging an attack at the last second possible is infinitely satisfying as you mash X to slice and dice the enemy rapidly. Guarding is rarely worth it, dodging is the right way to go. The combat is simple but it is also rewarding, especially when you chain perfect dodges and air juggles. The gigolo missions are disturbing, they are not necessary, unless you want certain upgrades. Think of it this way, Sneaking a peak gets you upgrades. Also, if you spend $250,000 on perfume, women will like you; therefore, you will get upgrades. This is par for the course though, since this is a suda 51 game. I give gamplay a not dumpster out of dumpster.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is really quite good. There's a lot of two-step drumbeats and some down-tempo electronic as well as jazz fusion and more uptempo fight music. The sound design is also good. Sound gets a note dumpster out of dumpster.\n\nFinal remarks: I didn't mention the camera because all spectacle fighters suffer from a camera that harms the player at times. The camera in killer is dead is usually pretty good, only a couple tiny sections had camera issues. The visuals I mentioned earler are only a problem in the vampire mission episode 51 where the cell-shading in the dungeon makes so many shadows that it can be disorienting. At times the floor was the exact same shade as the wall and it looked like textures were missing. I did light the torches so it wasn't that. This is a minor gripe and really isn't a problem.\n\nOverall I give killer is dead a not dumpster out of dumpster.","May 26, 2014","true","7.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Grasshopper Manufacture KNOWS how to put in love in gameplay and gamedesign.\n\nThe gameplay is legit. It isn't DMC/Bayonetta level , but I had a lot of fun with the gameplay, because it lets you feel like a badass the whole time. The boss fights were great. I really liked the phases design, which gives you the feel, that you really approaching an End-boss on each stage. Some level had a great design like the Alice Mansion. The game had a lot of mini-games, which were challenging sometimes (that's a good thing).\n\nSadly.. that's it with the positive stuff.\n\nThe characters are dull and I didn't feel any sympathy for them. The story is unnecessary complex. Maybe I didn't play enough Suda51 games, but I didn't care about the story on the halfway of my playthrough, because the storytelling didn't make sense at all. Maybe my brain can't understand the complexity of Suda. Please don't hate me for that. The cutscenes felt like , as if the Devs tried to make them over the top times two, some of them had funny parts, but most of the time I was annoyed of them. I didn't like the Artstyle of the game at all. It is just an over the top Cel-Shading with strange contrast and bloom effects. I don't recall any tracks from the Soundtrack, only the boss theme is stuck in my head.\n\nThe PC port is ... okay? I guess... The game runs smooth on 30 fps and it without any problems for me.\nBut since I like to play hack n slash games, I unlocked the 30 fps to 60 fps. And this is were the horror begins.\nThe game is clearly made for 30 fps. If you go higher, then you break the QTEs and even some Boss fights and they get unnecessarily hard. They even forgot the second layout for the Controller.\n\nEven tho I had fun with the game , I must sadly give it a 5 out of 10 (Port does not count).\n\nI respect Suda51 as a writer and artist. But I don't like his style of writing. It feels like he tries too hard to make a complex story with different meanings.","May 26, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The graphics are stylish and make certain parts of the game feel like they're straight out of a graphic novel. As well as the main story, you also have some optional side-missions, these range from arcade style elimination missions to dating missions that will not fail to make you both laugh and cringe, all while being forced to stare at some computer generated boobs.

I'm sure there are weirder games, but this is the first time I try something out of the norm for me. I have to say for the most part I love it! Of course there are parts of the game that might be awkward for others. First off the story starts off in such a way that you can get a little lost. Thankfully the plot is simple enough for you to be engaged in. The climax is very exhillarating and fun to exprience. Now if you look at the Gigolo missions, it's different. I didn't really have a problem with the gigolo missions. I thought they were a nice icebreaker between all the fighting. They are very sexual, but it's never gratitious. It might feel like it's a lot, but it's not, we just don't get that many games that exmeplify sexuality at all. Yes there is Dead or Alive, The Witcher, All Suda 51 games, but it's no where near to how much sexuality is depicted in say shows or television. Anyway the gigolo missions aren't highly important, but I can see how they could be a deal breaker for some. I myself play the game for the fighting. The battles you have are not only awesome, but they are filled with an amazing art style. I myself felt like I was playing an anime. The game itself is paced somewhat like a mix between anime and prodecual. It has episodes and your always on an assassin contract, but there is a bigger story going on bewtween the episodes. Everything over all is very satisfying. If your a fan of anime, stylistic action, great art style then you owe it to yourself to play this game.\nThe game isn't without it's flaws. The sexuality for one could be a deal breaker for some people, but if you look at the trailer of this game then it is kind of suprising if you expected anything else. The controls are very good, and while you at first start just button mashing, soon enough, you'll have to become a master of adrenaline rushes, timed counters, and upward slashes in order to get higher scores and beat the games later levels and on higher difficulties. Once you do get a AAA ranking it feels awfully rewarding because it actually requires skill and patience. If you play through all the missions just once including the gigolo mission, you are probably looking at a 5-7 hour game depending on you skill level and what difficulty you start with. However to get triple AAA ranking and beating it on the Nightmare difficulty you are easily looking at triple or quadruple that time. If your into bettering your score and leaderboards than this game has a lot of bang for your buck, if your not, then maybe you should wait for a sale.\n\nFOR PEOPLE: Who love anime, procedurals, stylish action, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, Devil May Cry, and countless others. However be warned this game is not as good as the others.\n\nNOT FOR PEOPLE: Who are easily offended by sexuality, or don't like the game I mentioned above, regardless if you can stomach what might turn you off about the game, I suggest you give this game a shot.\n\nIf I had to give a score it would  be a 8/10. Not as good as some of Suda's previous games, or the others I mentioned, but it's still requires the skill needed to truly enjoy an action game, and delivers the same thrills, fun, and at times frustration.  A GREAT game.","May 25, 2014","true","23.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Dont get me wrong...yaiba looks like a great action game, but is WAYYY to expensive especially since its on Steam.  Killer is Dead is just as stylish and action packed although like some comments have talked about the storyline is a little confusing, but the gameplay is so defined that its made up in the action and the little bit of story that is involved.  Also it has a lot of levels of upgrades and action gameplay which is something I search for in an action game....on top of all that it was so much cheaper and looks like just as much action gameplay as Yaiba....only $17.99 for pre-release...Sweet....been playing for an hour an I am already addicted.  After Metal Gear Rising, Yaiba and now Killer is dead one can only imagine the amount of effort that has to be made to surpass these types of gameplay formats\nMy suggestions.....Continue the Dark Siders franchise somebody PLEASE...maybe DS 3 or something in addition to getting some of the other ninja gaiden games on steam...And you cant forget a greatly anticipated sequel to Metal Gear Rising....The God of War Series.\n\nIf you really want me to pay $60 for a game get Tenchu Z up here...NOW THAT WOULD BE WORTH IT","May 24, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","1"

As someone with severe motion sickness (yes I get motion sickness while playing games if there are too many colours or too much movement) I am not able to play this game. The first boss... didn't go well, the colours are all clashing with eachother to the point that the boss just blends in with the background, my eyes started hurting from the strain and I had to quit before I felt anymore sick so that is were my journey ends. I wish I could put it as a good game, I really do it has so much potential... but it can't be played by people like me.

KiD looks and feels polished for the first hour or so, but the issues start to rise pretty soon. First of, as I pointed out on this part of the review before I editted it, this game is too sexist. So sexist it disgusts me and I'm hardly offended. I actually gave a thumbs up to Hitman: Absolution despite of how sexist it is with its portrayal of women, but Killer is Dead tops it. If that offends you, you might have a hard time enjoying this game if you can't get over that. The mini game (which btw is required if you want to have more weapons) is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my gaming life and I'd have a lot more respect for it if something was going on, but you basically look at women's bodies when they're not looking while they talk like they're about to have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Straight guys, seriously... porn exists for a reason.\n\nBut that's not all. Yes, the game can be fun if you can get over the shameless sexism, but you'll also have to be able to look over concerning issues. The gameplay is not as polished as it seems to be in the first few hours and it becomes far more evident when facing a boss. Minions are a walk in the park (I play on normal, just as I play any other game), but then you get to the boss and the game slaps you in the face... about 100 times. Reaching the tiger thing boss I realized how unfair difficulty scaling is and how flawed dodging/dashing (they share the same button and that can be quite problematic) are, as well as problems with the camera not letting me move it freely as I needed at some moments. FPS is capped at 30 (you can change it by modifying values at ini files, but that's something developers should take care of) and there are very limited resolution options (that the supposedly resolution fix should fix, but it didn't for 1366x768) as well as regular lag here and there, something that shouldn't happen.\n\nI can get over some issues if they're not game breaking, but I can't recommend a game like this when it clearly needed a lot of polishing and feedback before it was released. Especially on the "dating sim" mini game and its portrayal of women. So if you can get over the problems and that disgusting detail, it's a worthy game at a discount. Otherwise, it'll be painful.","November 28, 2015","false","7.6"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Also, if you squint your eyes real hard you can pretend the concept behind the women in this game combined with the underdeveloped James Bond aesthetic is commentary along the lines of Said's orientalism (consider the dev interview about the women), cross country game development aesthetics and the shallowness and emptiness of eighth-generation Japanese and American video game storytelling.

It seems that whenever a reviewer gives this game a negative rating, angry weeaboos lose their ♥♥♥♥ and argue that "the game is different and out there, unlike CoD." Yes, the game is out there, but that doesn't make it a good game.\n\nFirst off, Killer is Dead looks like ♥♥♥♥. The game is ♥♥♥♥ ugly. Even on PC at 60fps, it looks like a PS2 game, and that's being generous. It doesn't help also that the gameplay is boring as ♥♥♥♥. Button mashing is literally all you do in Killer is Dead, and every level is designed with not an ounce of effort, with repetive hallways, enemy encounters and boss fights. Of course with most Suda51 games, the story is completely 'weird'. Honestly, every attempt at an emotional moment or humorous joke is borderline cringe-worthy. Suda51 is obviously trying to tell a twisty noir story here, but in the end he fails as none of the characters make an impression.\n\nWithout a doubt, the most disgusting element of Killer is Dead lies within every female character in the game. Never have I seen more over-sexualised women in a game. Weeaboos have defended Suda51's misogynistic approach to his female characters, arguing that it's for an artistic purpose. It's pretty obvious that the only reason every female character within the game is in a revealing outfit is so horny nerds can fap to this filth. It's borderline hentai ♥♥♥♥. Weeaboos argue that Suda51 creates fresh new games that are superior to the mainstream AAA title such as Call of Duty, but I don't see anything innovative within Killer is Dead. Speaking of CoD, the latest entry in the franchise, Advanced Warfare, features a strong and fully realised female character, who at no point in the game is ever seen in a revealing outfit. At least CoD has more dignity than the filth Suda51 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nOverall, Killer is Dead is just garbage. It was basically torture to get through. Fans of Suda51 will love it no doubt, but for any gamers who want interesting characters and enjoyable gameplay, you're better off looking elsewhere. The landscape of video games is changing, particularly with the way women are depicted. Characters like Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite show that female characters don't need to be over-sexualised in order to gain a fanbase. While weeaboos may call Killer is Dead 'fresh and new', from where I'm standing, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dated.","December 10, 2014","false","6.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

You have to button mash in a cut scene like action until your ♥♥♥♥ing fingers fall off just to knock the ♥♥♥♥ out. Even if you use all your might, David always has the advantage for some dumb ♥♥♥♥ reason. Also the revival system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. What's even the point of falling those segments? I mean your literally just going to keep going until you've revived yourself. Other thing that sort of kills it is that the Story is everywhere and really doesn't make much sense in the beginning, however overtime it all comes together. And i'm pretty sure everyone agrees that Mika is literally one of the worst sidekicks ever written  I wouldn't recommend this game to people who don't like action games, losing your ♥♥♥♥ing fingers or incredibly annoying anime sidekicks.","December 21, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","Yet another title from Grasshopper Manufacture where Suda51 isn't the Director.\n\nGetting real tired of seeing him in the 'executive director' role in all of Grasshopper Manufacture's recent titles. Don't get me wrong, the studio's games have gotten better from a 'gameplay' perspective since that, but that level of surrealism and funny writing that previous titles (Killer7, NMH) had is gone. Seems like it's a trade-off: Suda is either directing games and giving us more of his crazy juice with a side of 'meh' gameplay, or we're getting a diluted version of the juice with better gameplay.\n\nGuess where Killer is Dead falls in that spectrum?\n\nIn typical Suda fashion, you play as a protagonist with a cool name: Mondo Zappa. Maybe not as cool as 'Travis Touchdown', but still somewhere in the same vicinity. Just like Travis, he's also an assassin with an organization anyway, so it's all the same. Only that this organization isn't some sort of 'league' where you climb ranks; rather, you go out and kill dudes and things 'corrupted' by dark energy coming from the moon. Filling out the anime cliche role is Mika, who couldn't be more out of ♥♥♥♥ing place in a game about assassins. ♥♥♥♥ I hate her.\n\nCombat consists of mashing your strike button and dodging enemies or blocking their attacks. The dodge and block button are the same key; hold to block or tap and move left or right to dodge. A properly timed dodge slows down time and lets you get a few hits in, whilst a counter is just that. If it sounds simple, it is.\n\nBut it's also fun. When you're surrounded by enemies and dodging left and right it can get really thrilling. Simplicity isn't a bad thing if it's not missing anything. Just make sure to play on the harder difficulties for it to be exciting.\n\nKilling enemies and picking up purple orbs fills up your blood meter, which is used for instant kills on weaker enemies. It lets you manage handling larger foes with, like, 6 weaker enemies around him much easier. Especially in enclosed areas where they keep coming. Managing your blood for quick kills or heals adds a slight tactical edge (emphasis on 'slight') to the game, which is welcomed. Keep in mind that larger foes can't be killed instantly, so its more about crowd management.\n\nThere's also sub weapons that...ah who gives a ♥♥♥♥. I never used them, and I won't bother going over them since they're boring as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSpeaking of which, unlocking sub weapons (there are 4) consists on going through some 'stare at women' mini-game. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and stupid, and if I wanted to oogle women I'd go on google. I played them for completions sake, but you can completely avoid these since the subweapons suck ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, you'll NEVER use them except for taking out enemies that are too far to get to.\n\nIs it a good game? Sure. Is it a GREAT game? Nah. Is it a Suda51 game? Sort of. Do I recommend it? Sure, why not.\n\nI come to Grasshopper Manufacture for my Suda fix, and this sort of delivers. The writing isn't as funny as in his previous titles, and the plot isn't exactly reeling me in. But the gameplay is pretty fun, if simple. Rather than sub-weapons aimed to please the FPS crowd they should've expanded the katana's repertoire. But it's still a decent game with some of that Suda flair.","December 22, 2014","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This crazy little title is similar in gamplay/visual style to the No More Heroes franchise that we've yet to be blessed with for PC. There's even an arm cannon that gives it some gunplay akin to Suda51's work in shadows of the damned\n\nThe Good\nFun and fast paced combat with interesting counter system\nUnique visual style\nRidiculous story (may be good or bad depending on your preference for suda's bizzare story-telling)\nYou can replay levels as much as you like to get more cash and upgrades\n\nThe Bad\nCan be buggy at times (unplayable for those with dual core CPU's, but good god why would you game on that these days anyway?)\n30 Frames per second (can change it in a config file but it becomes much harder unless you tweak the timing for perfect dodge)\nVery stupid negative but if you're a feminist/prude idiot, you will hate this game (but it's just a game, you psychopath)\n\n\nP.S.:[rant incoming] Most of the forum is very misleading with people saying that this is a bad port but in my opinion, anyone saying that is usually using the endless loading as an excuse. That being said, the devs do really need to update the page with proper minimum specs. DO NOT TRY TO RUN THIS ON A DUAL CORE COMPUTER. People really need to stop expecting devs to keep squeezing performance out of CPU's with limited threads (i.e. Dual Core CPU's) there is only so much those processors can handle. I understand (and feel the same) when people complain about Watch Dogs and Dead Rising 3 playing badly on anything that doesn't have I7 in it's name because that is just bat-♥♥♥♥ stupid of them to release such poorly optimized games. But if you still use a dual core in 2014, you will be very limited in what you can get away with. No amount of optimizing, tweaking, or patching can allow a dual core to run games that keep getting more and more CPU intensive. Maybe 5-10 years from now, quad cores won't cut it, but technology doesn't stop for anyone.","November 6, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty fluid and the game as a whole stands up nicely. If you're the kind of gamer who likes to test their limits in difficulty then this is a game for you. It can get really tough on Nightmare difficulty.\n\n\nHowever, I would almost not recommend this for the camera alone. The Devs make a fatal mistake that a lot of Devs make when it comes to hack and slash cameras. One of two things should happen: You make the camera a set angle and don't move it around(semi God of War style), or you give a free camera and let the camera go through walls. This game opts for the free cam, which is smart, but the camera won't go through walls. When the camera is positioned inside a wall it slowly rotates around the player to a better point. This will cause aa headache since most of the rooms in the game are very small. Mostly it's ok, but there are some really bad areas where this is a game killer.\n\n\nAside from that the game wasn't bad. I didn't use any of the other hand extensions aside from the gun, so I felt the others were lackluster. Again, it's still a zany fun game worth looking at.","August 20, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burningdemons/recommended/261110/","burningdemons","burningdemons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burningdemons/","291 products in account","Quite a delightful game. Mainly for the story. Not the main story mind you, while that is decent as well, the real powerful story comes from the episodes. They share a similarity with Cowboy Bebop. The villains, especially the ones in episode 6 and episode 7, are amazing and their stories are decently told, while the rest is up to interpretation.\n\nCombat is fluid and doesn't have a steep learning curve. It may become a little dull if you replay it though. There isn't that much to it. I mainly use controllers for playing, so I can't speak on the keyboard and mouse behalf. I used it a little and the combination was inconveniant in the menus but not in-game.\n\nThe art is wonderful and the potential that lies within editing some .ini's really make this game stand out. Unlock it to 60fps and force it to run at 4k and it truly blows you away. It's sad that they locked it from the getgo, but the guides are helpful and its Unreals .ini's are some of the easiest to edit.\n\nOne con, from my perspective, was the integration of the sexual related tasks that were sometimes essential to the main story and had a portion of achievements devoted to them. They did help build certain characters but ultimately I think it could have been done in better fashion or at least one that fit the game better.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a hack and slash, anyone looking for a game with a good story, and those that enjoy unique and beautiful art styles.","December 20, 2014","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quad core and up works fine.\n- This is a windows 64-bit intended game, issues ensure when you try to use 32-bit like I did for a bit.\n- It needs ini file tweaking in order to get the best experience.\n\nONTO MY THOUGHTS.\n\nHOLY COW. This game is so stylish. The music, the graphics and art, the combat, and the story reek of a specific....suda 51 flavor. This game is bloody, it's sexy, and it is exciting.\n\nYou play as the hedonistic and calculated killer Mondo Zappa as he kills supernatural killers in this hyper-violent brawler/woman ogler action game. The combat is both mashy and attention intensive at the same time, and the woman ogling is questionable and close-the-door-before-someone-asks-what-you're-playing as it can get. The activities you take part in say a lot of interesting things about the well-dressed and spindly Mondo, and if sexist issues irk you, understand that a lot of the stuff is pretty intentional because it's to convey the things that Mondo is concerned with instead of trying to solve the world's problems that can't be solved with a sword and crazy transforming machine gun arm. Mondo just wants some hacking, slashing, and booty tapping. It's a story about a descent into lunacy and anger, so come along for the insanely colorful ride.\n\nIf you can get it to play nice, I'd really recommend picking this up. It's visceral, it's worth examing, and it's fun to watch.","February 13, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The upgrade system is virtually nonexistant with most of your currency that you earn going towards trying to complete gigolo missions rather than being able to upgrade gear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddamngrant/recommended/261110/","goddamngrant","livegw8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddamngrant/","171 products in account","So. Apparently this game has been the subject of quite polarized reviews.  No doubt if you've made it to this review, you've seen a fair share of graphics- and style-related positive opinions and far more, "I don't know what is going on," rants.  Well, by the gigolo's blue thumbs-up, clearly you're going to get a rather optimistic shade of Suda51’s “Killer Is Dead” here.\n\nYet, before I delve into the wealth of audience agency that this game embodies, I will go so far as to admit this is less a game than it is a clever collection of self-aware narratives balanced precariously between the satirical and the sophomoric in a tantalizing trapeze act that rewards curiosity with naught but a developed and introspection manifestation of itself.\n\nTherefore, if the aforementioned is not your glass of red wine circa a vampiric 1600, look elsewhere for your action schnapps and beat-em-up burgundies.  This package is gilded – a story that presents itself as overly obvious only to ignore its own undeniable implications – a graphical powerhouse of almost discernible imagery that, simply in its presentation, solicits nearly subconscious perspective adjustment, both physically and throughout the season.\nExcuse me, throughout the game.  Although honestly, Killer Is Dead is not so much a 2013 video game adventure as it is a new medium for anime.  Or episodic storytelling, for that matter.  Killer Is Dead is, simplistic combo system aside, wanton and embarrassingly sexually charged side-missions aside, rather telling accounts of the double-edged sword of dehumanization through deconstructive characterization and gender roles that permeate modern media that are those wanton and embarrassingly sexually charged side-missions aside, brevity aside, a work of semi-interactive television that only sweetens with each further viewing, or play-through.\n\nMost positive reviews tell you to stay for the art direction and the combat, if they tell you to stay at all.  I’m going to recommend you stay for the show, stay for the story, which after three play-throughs has only become more dense and self-referential as I the viewer notice more of what was always there.  And that’s really where Killer Is Dead is most excellent, when you look past the “ridiculousness” or “disjointedness” and start approach the world of the game like that of a beloved-series, one that you believe in and care enough to pay attention to.  Killer Is Dead teased arguably too many into considering it just that.  However, if you embrace that constantly shifting perspective, that upward motion, moon-bound, Killer Is Dead becomes something just as far in the future as it sets itself.  You’ll get at least as much out of Killer Is Dead as you put into it, and if you’re willing to lose yourself to the Wires and dark matter, you’ll get infinitely more than you bargained for.\n","April 1, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, by the gigolo's blue thumbs-up, clearly you're going to get a rather optimistic shade of Suda51’s “Killer Is Dead” here.\n\nYet, before I delve into the wealth of audience agency that this game embodies, I will go so far as to admit this is less a game than it is a clever collection of self-aware narratives balanced precariously between the satirical and the sophomoric in a tantalizing trapeze act that rewards curiosity with naught but a developed and introspection manifestation of itself.\n\nTherefore, if the aforementioned is not your glass of red wine circa a vampiric 1600, look elsewhere for your action schnapps and beat-em-up burgundies.  This package is gilded – a story that presents itself as overly obvious only to ignore its own undeniable implications – a graphical powerhouse of almost discernible imagery that, simply in its presentation, solicits nearly subconscious perspective adjustment, both physically and throughout the season.\nExcuse me, throughout the game.  Although honestly, Killer Is Dead is not so much a 2013 video game adventure as it is a new medium for anime.  Or episodic storytelling, for that matter.  Killer Is Dead is, simplistic combo system aside, wanton and embarrassingly sexually charged side-missions aside, rather telling accounts of the double-edged sword of dehumanization through deconstructive characterization and gender roles that permeate modern media that are those wanton and embarrassingly sexually charged side-missions aside, brevity aside, a work of semi-interactive television that only sweetens with each further viewing, or play-through.\n\nMost positive reviews tell you to stay for the art direction and the combat, if they tell you to stay at all.  I’m going to recommend you stay for the show, stay for the story, which after three play-throughs has only become more dense and self-referential as I the viewer notice more of what was always there.  And that’s really where Killer Is Dead is most excellent, when you look past the “ridiculousness” or “disjointedness” and start approach the world of the game like that of a beloved-series, one that you believe in and care enough to pay attention to.  Killer Is Dead teased arguably too many into considering it just that.  However, if you embrace that constantly shifting perspective, that upward motion, moon-bound, Killer Is Dead becomes something just as far in the future as it sets itself.  You’ll get at least as much out of Killer Is Dead as you put into it, and if you’re willing to lose yourself to the Wires and dark matter, you’ll get infinitely more than you bargained for.\n","April 1, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People really need to stop expecting devs to keep squeezing performance out of CPU's with limited threads (i.e. Dual Core CPU's) there is only so much those processors can handle. I understand (and feel the same) when people complain about Watch Dogs and Dead Rising 3 playing badly on anything that doesn't have I7 in it's name because that is just bat-♥♥♥♥ stupid of them to release such poorly optimized games. But if you still use a dual core in 2014, you will be very limited in what you can get away with. No amount of optimizing, tweaking, or patching can allow a dual core to run games that keep getting more and more CPU intensive.

Respawning dead. There was an easy way around this considering that the game also allows you to use special tokens to avoid respawning at a checkpoint. But that still doesn't change the fact that if I hadn't had one of those "get out of jail free" items, I would have had to restart an entire mission, in the high difficulty that I had it set in, in order to go out to the store and buy more.\nI should also mention that some of these issues may have been patched in between now (march 23 2015) and when you are reading it, but I somewhat unsure of that as in the time between when I bought the game and that I've been playing, the game hadn't patched out these issues.\n\nI do like the gameplay, and if you are a fan of character action games and don't need a stellar story, then you'll most likely enjoy this game. My only real complaint is that the "Giggalo missions" made me feel a bit uncomfortable and frustrated (due to relatively tame but creep as **** content, and somewhat frustrating controls), and some of the optional missions were a bit frustrating. Other than that, I reccomend the GAME for people who like the genre and are willing to tolerate what else this game throws at you.\n\nBut once again, I do NOT reccomend this port.","March 23, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Regardless of whether you like the visuals or not at least you have to appreciate that someone is making something different to the "modern military fifty shades of dogshit brown" style that gamers seemingly just can't get enough of these days, while still keeping it mature. Sadly gameplay-wise it's not up to the same level as for instance Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. It feel like the developers of this game and those of MGR were working with very different priorities in mind, even though they were both making sword-fighting games.\n\nHonestly I can't think of anyone to whom I would recommend this game over MGR but that's not saying it's bad. It's a fun game in it's own right, despite slightly wonky camera controls and the reliance of a fiddly sub-weapon system for when the games throws flying and wall-crawling enemies at you that you can't reach otherwise.

The gameplay revolves around keeping the combo count high and blocking/evading enemies. Unlike Bayonetta, evading is dodgy (heh) at best. Blocking is much more viable but less rewarding.\n\nAs a Suda51 game, this is by far the most Killer7-y game since Killer7. It's far less inventive, but it has the cutscenes in different artstyles, non sequitur story and high replayability. Technically less fun than No More Heroes, but far more Suda51y. Some moments are truly weird and brilliant.\n\nThe main weaknesses are the boring protagonist and the entirely too linear level design.\n\nAlso, the infamous gigolo missions are clearly played as a joke, which the media absolutely did not seem to realize.","March 26, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a fair amount of side stuff to do and if going for a perfect score on every mission and doing all the side stuff as well is your thing, there is no reason you couldn't spend 15 hours on this game. The graphics are beautiful in there own non traditional way and it borders on, what I imagine, an acid trip would be at times. This game is without a doubt Japanese.

Very pleasently surprised with the whole game. I might give other games of this style more of a chance now. At a full price of $50... Not worth it in my opinion due to how short the game is.

It gets the job done. the character designs are also really amazing being unique and very cool looking.\n\nPERFORMANCE sadly this game has some problems. First of all you have to edit an ini file in the game's directory just to get 60 FPS in game. then the game still has some massive fram drops at times going from 50-60 FPS down to 10-15 just for 1-2 seconds. Sadly I have not found a fix for this. overall this is a decent port and this can be looked over\n\nGAME MODES there are 3 game modes.\n\nStory missions- Story missions tell the story of the game. but mission times can very, some take 30-45 minutes while others can take as little as 5 minutes\n\nside missions- they take you through the worlds of the story missions but provide little objectives to complete for money, and new items in the shop.\n\nMondo girls...-the mondo girl missions are probably the oddest thing in this game. it basically conssits of mondo going to a bar to pick up a girl but the way you do that is you put on these glasses that allow you to see through clothes, the more you look at them the more you guts meter fills up. once it is full you can give the girl a present which causes her love meter to go up, once the love meter is full you basically have sex. and all of those unlockables you get from side missions I mentioned earlier. they are alternate underwear and bras for the girls\nOVERVIEW\noverall the game is super fun and addictive, fun combat, fun mission design, and qwerky character designs that I love. althrough it has some performance problems I believe this game is worth picking up.","July 1, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're into DmC, Onimusha, & Metal Gear Rising, then this game is for you. As mentioned by a curator the camera controls are pretty bad, especially during boss fights, I would lose track of my opponent during the fight because of the camera rotations. The combo system, block and dodge is smooth enough, I still have to try this game on controller to get a better feel for it. There's no lock-on or at least I haven't discovered the lock-on in this game yet.\n\nThe plot so far is interesting, from what I gathered these guys are a bunch of contract killers set in a futuristic cyborg timeline. the character development stories are pretty good. Mondo breaks the fourth wall a few times. And if you like Jessica Nigri, the character Vivienne is actually modelled in her liking.\n\nThe voice acting is great, they got the best in the industry doing the english voice overs. Veterans such as, Tara Platt (Mitsuru waifu!!), Liam O'brein (Kain - FFIV, Akihiko - Persona 3, Caius - Lightning Returns, Shichogoro - Afro Samurai, Orlando - Catherine), & Johnny Yong Bosh.\n\nTroll review:\n\nPervert dating simulator 2013.\n\nThis game taught me very well that when I'm on a date with a beautiful woman to always maintain eye contact and when she's distracted, looks away or closes her eyes to start ogling her breasts and booty until many ounces of blood fills my head. Once that's done, it's time to give her a gift, and then you get laid (No sushi require).","June 16, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/261110/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","Killer is Dead is another one of  those games that I enjoyed playing, however, it ended up feeling very hollow in the end.\n\n=======\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Repetitive: It's a hack and slash, obviously, so this is basically up to opinion. However, I love games like Devil May Cry, so, that's not the complete meaning behind my calling the "repetition" a negative point. What I mean is that you "accept a contract", "navigate through the level", "fight the boss", "repeat". Read my next point for the reason why this is a problem.\n\n- Story: Why is the repetition an issue? Well, it wouldn't be if the story was well put together enough that it could drive the hack/slash gameplay to a point. But... it's confusing, vague, and not concrete. There's a lot of "You don't know this, Mondo? Well... *DEAD*". You don't get a lot of answers, and this repeated cycle of trying to further the plot, by not really furthering it, through adding mystery, but devolving said mystery due to repetition of uninteresting "You don't understand?" dialogue is not very appealing. The ending of the game is something else... you have to really think to piece it together, and even then, it takes a bit of faith to say "it makes sense, now". Because, well... there's a lot of info missing, glossed over, or that just remains obscured. Perhaps they are planning on a sequel to answer these questions..? That's the only thing I can think of, because this game doesn't really provide many answers.\n\n- Gameplay mechanics (Jumping): I really feel like this game lost a lot of grand opportunity by restricting the player's movements and gameplay to solely being on the ground. I understand that there's no real need to jump, as you have the Musselback's gun mode, but... I'd like to be able to jump into the air to hit those enemies with my sword, sometimes, rather than just have to gather blood and shoot. I'd also like to be able to jump over boxes (though, I'd be fine with some obstacles being purposely unable to hurdle over). It feels too restricting, when compared to other games of this ilk (e.g.: DMC, again), and it would have been a fantastic addition that, sadly, would have bumped up the gameplay had it been present, but wasnt. Disappointing.\n\n- Boss fights: They were fairly short, and not very difficult to figure out how to defeat the bosses. Maybe it's harder on Nightmare mode, but... I don't want to go through that. Want to know why? Read below...\n\n- Replayability: There isn't any. Once you beat it, you've beaten it. My only advice is to play all the side missions and gigolo missions as you play, between missions, when available, to boost up Mondo's skills/gain new weapons, and level up your abilities. Then, once you finish, like I have, well, you'll be satisfied leaving it alone.\n\n\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Visuals: This game is stunning; absolutely gorgeous. The contrasting colours, the vivid details... it's brilliant. Fantastic design choice by the developers. Props to them~!\n\n+ Gameplay mechanics (attacking): Very intuitive, especially when using a controller like I did, and very easy to get into. It's satisfying to fight through some enemies, although, when he gets disoriented and you have to wiggle the joystick.. well, that was just annoying >.< But, combat was fun, and very tight controls made it even better.\n\n+ Voice Acting/Characters: Very likeable characters, and solid voice acting. The characters don't feel too forced (Mika can feel that way at first exposure, but that soon goes away), and Vivienne is a little too cliche, but, it doesn't hurt the game. You grow to like the characters well enough, and their voices suit them appropriately. This can't be said for a good deal of games, so, this is a valid point to consider. It keeps you in the headspace of the universe of the game, and lets you suspend reality a little better as you play. Good job, voice actors/actresses~! :)\n\n+ Style: The entire vibe of the game is just... groovy. It's got a great aesthetic and feel to it, overall.\n\n\n\n\n=======\n\n\nSo, do I recommend "Killer is Dead"?\nWell, given that there are more negatives than positives.. yes, I do.\n\nHere's why:\nIt's a game that has solid gameplay, great visuals, likeable characters, and a good atmosphere about it. Of course, it's only real detriments are the story/plot, and the lack of jumping, for me. A lot of people rag on the Gigolo missions, but really, it's not that big a deal. If you don't like it, don't play it. It's minimal, unnecessary, and people have blown it way out of proportion. There are countless numbers of games dedicated to things like this (e.g.: visual novels, dating sims, etc.), and those don't get ragged on. Why? Because they aren't always made by major companies, and only people who enjoy them, play them. You don't like it? Just let it alone, and don't entertain it, Simple.\n\n...Regardless, getting back on track to the review...\n\nKiller is Dead is a fun game, that deserves at least a play through, or to have you give it a go. If it's not for you, well, it's not for you. It won't be for everybody, for sure. I liked it, although there were flaws to it, but they never really made me feel like I disliked it, or wanted to stop playing. I wanted to finish it, did finish it, and I'm glad I followed through.\n\n...Just don't pay full price for it, by far.\nWait for a Steam sale, and, well, if you can get it for less than 10$, give it the go-ahead.\nYou won't regret it.\n\nThough, you won't find any replay value, here.\nUninstalled (*a single tear*)","June 17, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was actually really surprised this was originally released on PS3/360 as it looks comparable to a PS2 game graphics wise, I thought it was just its art style, but it was so inconsistent that it led me to believe otherwise.\n\nIf you want a good hack and slash game, I'd recommend the old classic Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, or Metal Gear Rising.

But this game hooked me in the second I started playing it.\nIt has a simple combat system, but has more advanced tricks you can do that make you both A) Make you feel like a true god damn executioner and B) Completely satisfied.\nThe art is kind of iffy, it's all cel shaded and can be hard to look at in dark areas, but the game looks overall great.\nThe port is absolutely great.\nAnd best of all for me, the story. It can be purely "I don't know what tf is going on, but all I know is I have to kill ♥♥♥♥", or you can go back and look at the tiniest of details that make you go "God damn. This game actually has a story, and it's interesting. I never once looked up a game's lore, not including Alan Wake (I still don't know what the hell happened in the ending of that game).\nOverall score for me; 7.5/10.

Killer is Dead was a fun hack and slash romp from start to finish; with some added minigames that really extened the life of the game.
