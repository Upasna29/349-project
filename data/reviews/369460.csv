Please read the end notes.\n\nOverviewProfessor Why: The Quantum Eye is a child friendly game in which you play as a lab assistant trying to prove himself to a GLaDOS inspired AI named the Eye. You have to successfully perform basic physics experiments that demonstrate basic concepts such as air dilatation to more uncommon ones, such as superconductors. While doing so, you also help the Professor 3D print his hand, so you can exit the bio-metric door to your freedom.\n\nThe Pros:Interesting to Learn - As this is mainly a tool for teaching, it does a good job. The experiments are different enough to not bore you, and the discovery process is natural. You also get hints from time to time if you are stuck or get positive feedback once you've done correct steps.\n\nGreat Humor - I've mentioned the similarity between the Eye and Portal's GLaDOS, but it works well here. You play while being watched by the Eye and prof. Why, playing bad cop, good cop. While the professor will give positive reinforcement and advice, the Eye will openly mock you, doubt you and condescendingly comment on your progress, patiently awaiting your failure. The dialogues are short, but fun to listen to.\n\nDecent Visual Style - I like the very sterile-room style laboratory you work in. Even common objects are future versions of those items, shiny and chrome! Containers have volume indicators on the side, too!\nThe Cons:Shaggy Camera - The camera is a bit unintuitive and unresponsive, and many people complained about that. The devs are aware of that and are working on it.\n\nNo Custom Levels (so far) - As of this far, ten levels have been made, with 10 more to come. However, 20 levels are a bit low, and unless you are a teacher and have a practical use for this, you will complete the whole game in no more than an hour or so. I've proposed the idea of custom levels to the devs, and possibly even Workshop integration. We will have to see what the future holds.ConclusionThis game has potential in my opinion and I am very curious on how it will finish as. Personally, I would not approach this game without a level editor.\n\nEarly Access DisclaimerThis game is still in development and not fully finished. If you like what you see as it is and want to support development of this title, buy it, but bear in mind you have no guarantee if you will like it in its final step. If you are undecided, wait until further versions. If you buy it now and then regret your purchase, you are the only one responsible.\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

I'm having trouble thinking about this as a game - more like an interactive activitity you might do under your teacher's supervision, to demonstrate how science behind those simple experiments. So I don't recommend it for someone who is looking for a puzzle game to play - you can pass all of them by moving objects randomly and if you went to semi-decent school you did some of the experiments yourself or know them from discovery channel or something. So, just to reiterate, this ain't for adults.\n\nThe good:\n- Graphics look ok for this type of game.\n- Good educational value, if you are in elementary school and are about to learn about physics.\n- Controls needs getting used to, but are otherwise intuitive. Got confused early because "Click" in this game means "Right-button click".\n- Backstory seems solid enough, characters might not be the most cleverly written, but are engaging enough for children.\n\nThe bad:\n- Some experiments are bugged and only register as done if objects are moved in a specific order. I did the one with grapes correctly from the start, but then I had to throw them to still water as well to complete the level.\n- The price right now is rudiculous. 8 EUR for 30 min of content is borderline robbery. I understand that the funds from Early Access will be used to finish the game, but people pointed out that this is not a sustainable strategy, and so far I see only another 10 levels in the making. So what, 8 EUR for 1h of "gameplay"? Price should be lower or MUCH more content should be added soon to make the price more sensible.\n- Objects clip and behave weird when touching. In the pinball level I hade that "ball" clip through the flipper (clipper?) every time I hit it.\n- Voice of the GlaDOS wannabe makes me cringe - there is something off with her accent. I dunno, maybe it's just me.\n\nMinor issues, that can be improved + ideas:\n- More interactive options, even incorrect ones, should be available, just to add some fun value. Every item should interact with every other item available, just to add some difficulty and give the robots premise for heckling you :)\n- With that in mind, hints should be available for when people are stuck with. Not needed now, but might be helpful if the devs tackle some more complex experiments.\n- Science behind the experiments should be explained more thoroughly, with more paragraphs of text, just to have the more curious of children something to refer to if they wanted science behind the experiment explained. The game has a potential to be a valuable learning tool, so it shouldn't dumb the science down. You could add animations explaining the termodynamics behind the egg in the bottle trick, maybe a video clip - some strictly educational stuff to back the gameplay up. Not right there in the game, but some more materials could be available after finishing level ("Learn more" button, besides the "Next Level")\n- The AR was selling point for the first Professor Why game, I think implementing it here might add some value. People, kids especially, love gimmicks so AR cards could make the game more immersive and enjoyable.\n- VR support could take this to a who new level!","December 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

Overall idea is good, unfortunately control issues and lack of understanding what's going hides this completly. I love science in games so I will say ok, still hoping that game will improve in the future.","December 3, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It's not a finished product, but I like the direction it is heading.\nFooling around in your private lab is always fun.\nMaybe some more challenges, some different levels.\nCamera movement has to be fine tuned for sure.","December 11, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s not just a logic or puzzle game, it’s not educational… It’s a mix of a few genres so it’s a very interesting case definitely worth trying!","December 11, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As already stated the camera is bad but the control system is terrible. Really struggled picking and placing items and if an item is knocked off the table it doesn't always come back so you have to restart.  I don't think this game is anywhere near ready for even early release.","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

It can teach some basics of chemistry and physics while having fun. But there are many things that need to be worekd on. In my opinion the main table should  be a bit bigger or system of dragging items should be diffrent cuz its very easy to accidentaly crash items or toss them off the table. Also camera its being very uncomfortable to control. While trying to look at items from diffrent angel the camera should flow with the movement of your mouse but in this game it does not. Also there are still many bugs like you cant drag an object or the level aint finished after u did everything  you should do. This game has a potential to be a great puzzle, brain training game but it definitely has lots of things to be improved but thats pretty normal for games in early acces state. I would reccomend this game for people who like puzzle games and have patiency to do things slowly. If you aint that person you will only have a mess on your table.","December 15, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

More like an interactive item movement simulator with beyond horrible camera control and extremely glitchy physics. Don't see this as something that has taken more than 1 day to make.","December 1, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","2"
