No doubt about that. What is here is very rough and I would say at least a year of updates will be needed to make it playable for the majority of Steam users. The menus don't make much sense. The content is at a bare minimum. AI is brutish and easily tricked. That said, it feels like the old Twisted Metal games. There is a lot of potential here. For .99 you get what you pay for at this point, but I have high hopes for this one. Also, "Missle Uzi" is the best name for a weapon ever.","March 21","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I do recomend this... In the future.\n\nsuggested improvments\n\nSlow down the cars they are too fast to have good battles.\n\nTurns are too fast and sharp when moving.\n\nMissles and bombs are too powerful or the cars are too weak.\n\nJumps feel too weird being high\n\nmore unique looking cars.\n\nI'd suggest using Twisted Metal Black as insparation for the controls/feel of movements.\n\nI want this game to be awesome so devs please take my suggestings to heart.

I reckon this has the potential to be every murderous driving game since GW's original and completely mental 1984 release "Battlecars" (you may have noticed the alternative name in store). The sountrack is bonkers, the controls are classic, the maps are simple and effective-all in a very Early Access Game. For those of you with a good old-fashioned simple-minded attitude towards direct violence, I point out the low cost and potential of this game. For those of you without a sense of humour who just want a cheap game with Steam rewards and suchlike-go away. For anyone witha shred of hope-I suggest that you to look at "Orion: Prelude", a giant failure that ended up as a massively popular online game once the moaning clowns were driven from the discussion board by the designers' final release and the fans' support. Get stuck in to this for the price of a third-rate burger and chips or a substandard sandwich that will leave you hungry ten minutes later. It's your choice-a game that may eventually turn into a hilarious killfest for you and your pals when you wish it was 2001 and everything was metal AF, or another night in wondering what happened to the last fifteen years. Gentlemen, start your engines.","April 14","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
