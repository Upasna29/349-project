I WANTED to like this game.\n\nI don't.\n\nThe game looks like a shoddy 2000 made game.\n\nGraphic quality looks like crap, the UI is terribly made, animations are really crap. The playerbase is entirely Russian, and the game itself is just another point and click MMO. Melee enemies can hit you from any distance, and it doesn't do a good job of telling you the strength of your foes.\n\nClasses are gender and race locked. You don't get to choose either. The class I tried, the Gunner, is locked at male, and locked at looking like an obese dwarf. Every class has the same limits.\n\nDon't play this game. There are much better alternatives.\n\nEDIT: Why did I only play for 0.3 hours? Because I couldn't TAKE any more of it. When I said that I wanted to like the game, let me explain. When Karos initially released, it was only in Russian. Once I saw Karos Returns was localized, I was going to give it the chance to redeem itself.\n\nTo address Lioside's comments:\n1: There WERE NO SETTINGS to change. I am running a rather high-end graphics card that can run most games smoothly, so it wasn't a matter of pc specs.\n2: An entirely Russian playerbase means very few players will understand English. No English comprehension means anyone who's new to the game, and speaks English, cannot recieve any help from the (Russian) community. It's like when a Spanish speaking person joins the NA server, then gets shouted out for saying a single phrase in Spanish.\n3: It's 2015. Most games out there are NOT gender and race locked. TERA, RIFT, Guild Wars 2, Defiance, even things like Maplestory! The only games that ARE are outdated games like Karos Returns that have not ADAPTED and EVOLVED to suit the times. (Okay, fine, EDIT: Apparently TERA has 1 or two locked things. BUT MOST STILL AREN'T!)\n\nSo please, Lioside, don't make me commit another Liocide. I don't like killing arguments, especially not when they are so poorly reasoned.\n\nOh, and one last thing. 8 out of the 10 positive reviews are/were joke reviews people give to screw with the public. 2 were reasoned out, but both said the game was either dated, or focused towards the niche fanbase of the genre.","July 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 502 of 596 people (84%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","84","502","596","67","23"

I just couldn't. I do have more play time then most reviews, as I kept telling myself "It might get better at the endgame." I never got that far. The lack of story, highly generic gameplayer, bad graphics, and tiny english community made me drop it.\n\nI usually keep my reviews short 'n sweet, but here's something with some fleshing out.\n\nPros;\n-mai wings with bad animations\n-mai convienent autotravel\n-???\n\nI seriously attempted to name one feature this did that you couldn't get elsewhere or better. There is nothing.\n\nHere's a real list!\nCons;\n\n-Generic point-and-click 1-0 hotkey gameplay.\n\n-Outdated graphics.\n\n-Most of the playerbase dosen't speak in English. Only English speakers I met partied up with me to kill an event boss, which, I must add, had TERRIBLE drops for the effort and resources to kill it.\n\n-*Enemy moves in to hit me, I run out of melee range before he attacks, get hurt anyways* so forget manual evasion\n\n-I still don't know why it's called Karos Returns\n\n-Quests are just the "kill 10 of these, get 5 of these" only the rates are jacked up and I've had to, say, kill 30+ crocodiles for 5 teeth\n\n-As for plot, I had to go tryhard to join an investigation team for people and cases I couldn't care less about, apparently.\n\n>Bruh, I'm just here for the pvp\n>where it at tho\n\n\nI think I've made my point.\nDon't.\nYou want a game that isn't like this.\nGames like this are why the MMO genre is dying.\n\nHey, Aion has some great PVP.

Unfortunately, GC was bought by WebZen in November 2015.  They offered a 175% coin credit just before Thanksgiving and then fired all the staff 2 weeks later.\n\nApparently, WebZen took the money and ran. Karos stopped functioning in January and its been a month, more or less, since WebZen disconnected the SQL servers (inventory/auction/quest/anything specific to the characters not in thier inventory AND the mob spawn) from the environment server. So you can't get any quests, access for inventory, really do anything.\n\nI have not been able to log in from Steam for a month and my GC accounts are spotty, averaging once every week now.\n\nWell, its the death of a game, as far as I am concerned.\n\nI did have a 10 minute discussion with the California Attorney General's office and they asked me to write this up and send it in, so they could investigate and compel a refund of my $100 in game store credits.\n\nIf you want to see more, check out the gamescampus.com Karos Returns forums, or do a web search for reviews WebZen.\n\nIF YOU SPEAK SPANISH, PORTEGUESE, RUSSIAN OR TURKISH, THOSE SERVERS ARE STILL WORKING.

Then when you start a mission the game will run you to it and shot for you. what a "great" hands off experience this was.","August 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And say you want to be a male archer you cant certain classes cant be different gender when i wanted to be a male paladin i couldent because it was a female only class also you cant be a female Warrior if your a girl thats just not a option so because of all these reasons and personal dislikes i think my  less than a hour of gameplay is ok for a unrecomend.\n\nalso may i say\n\n\nFIRST TO RATE lol","July 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","22","48","5","0"

I did only play for a short time. In fact I usually follow a strict policy for MMO's of playing to at least 10 when most of the PVP unlocks however like other reviews. The Graphics, UI, and Tab Targeting is not very fluent. For the first 10 minutes I felt like my character was moving on its own... they pre add the loot, and the tab targeting as an ability to your action bar yet they have quick keys set up.... COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. Additionally if you have an auto clicker you could literally stay in the beginning area and kill stuff and just not loot. Honestly I think thats what the 15 people there were doing because no one was picking up anything. So bots are a given and when it will come to PVP content this will create frustrations and losses for the people actually playing. This game still has a long way to go also they should of used a newer engine.","July 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Since then it's been passed around to quite a few publishers in an attempt to regain some of its former glory, and revenues. Unfortunately, it just doesn't hold up against games out today. Still, it's very nostalgic rolling a new character and seeing what's changed since then. It's almost exactly as I remember it. The only differences that I can see are a handfull of gimmicks to skew their active player numbers, and cheap monetization tricks designed to bring in a quick buck, or more accurately; milk a dieing cow. All in all, it's a click to move, repetitive quest, grindy mmo.

When Karos initially released, it was only in Russian. Once I saw Karos Returns was localized, I was going to give it the chance to redeem itself.\n\nTo address Lioside's comments:\n1: There WERE NO SETTINGS to change. I am running a rather high-end graphics card that can run most games smoothly, so it wasn't a matter of pc specs.\n2: An entirely Russian playerbase means very few players will understand English. No English comprehension means anyone who's new to the game, and speaks English, cannot recieve any help from the (Russian) community. It's like when a Spanish speaking person joins the NA server, then gets shouted out for saying a single phrase in Spanish.\n3: It's 2015. Most games out there are NOT gender and race locked. TERA, RIFT, Guild Wars 2, Defiance, even things like Maplestory! The only games that ARE are outdated games like Karos Returns that have not ADAPTED and EVOLVED to suit the times. (Okay, fine, EDIT: Apparently TERA has 1 or two locked things. BUT MOST STILL AREN'T!)\n\nSo please, Lioside, don't make me commit another Liocide. I don't like killing arguments, especially not when they are so poorly reasoned.\n\nOh, and one last thing. 8 out of the 10 positive reviews are/were joke reviews people give to screw with the public. 2 were reasoned out, but both said the game was either dated, or focused towards the niche fanbase of the genre.","July 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 502 of 596 people (84%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","84","502","596","67","23"

Unfortunately, GC was bought by WebZen in November 2015.  They offered a 175% coin credit just before Thanksgiving and then fired all the staff 2 weeks later.\n\nApparently, WebZen took the money and ran. Karos stopped functioning in January and its been a month, more or less, since WebZen disconnected the SQL servers (inventory/auction/quest/anything specific to the characters not in thier inventory AND the mob spawn) from the environment server. So you can't get any quests, access for inventory, really do anything.\n\nI have not been able to log in from Steam for a month and my GC accounts are spotty, averaging once every week now.\n\nWell, its the death of a game, as far as I am concerned.\n\nI did have a 10 minute discussion with the California Attorney General's office and they asked me to write this up and send it in, so they could investigate and compel a refund of my $100 in game store credits.\n\nIf you want to see more, check out the gamescampus.com Karos Returns forums, or do a web search for reviews WebZen.\n\nIF YOU SPEAK SPANISH, PORTEGUESE, RUSSIAN OR TURKISH, THOSE SERVERS ARE STILL WORKING.

I did only play for a short time. In fact I usually follow a strict policy for MMO's of playing to at least 10 when most of the PVP unlocks however like other reviews. The Graphics, UI, and Tab Targeting is not very fluent. For the first 10 minutes I felt like my character was moving on its own... they pre add the loot, and the tab targeting as an ability to your action bar yet they have quick keys set up.... COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. Additionally if you have an auto clicker you could literally stay in the beginning area and kill stuff and just not loot. Honestly I think thats what the 15 people there were doing because no one was picking up anything. So bots are a given and when it will come to PVP content this will create frustrations and losses for the people actually playing. This game still has a long way to go also they should of used a newer engine.","July 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Since then it's been passed around to quite a few publishers in an attempt to regain some of its former glory, and revenues. Unfortunately, it just doesn't hold up against games out today. Still, it's very nostalgic rolling a new character and seeing what's changed since then. It's almost exactly as I remember it. The only differences that I can see are a handfull of gimmicks to skew their active player numbers, and cheap monetization tricks designed to bring in a quick buck, or more accurately; milk a dieing cow. All in all, it's a click to move, repetitive quest, grindy mmo. Though still fun to play through for a returning player from the old beta days.","August 6, 2015","true","40.9"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","2"
