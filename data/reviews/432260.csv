It's really fun. *dies again* the soundtrack is good too, it really fits the game. *dies again* hey look, there's even a shop with a bunch of unlockable balls. I can be a Pokeball! This is great! *dies again* okay..this is only the first level. Maybe I'm missing something. *changes control scheme* there, I'll try the Keyboard. *dies again* on second thought, playing with the mouse is more fun. *changes contrl scheme* okay, let's do this for real. *dies again* ...okay this is a fun game to kill time with, but is it really that difficult?? *40 minutes later* OH MY GOD, I PASSED I- ..one star? One star?? Out of three?? I can totally do better. *repeats death process until 3 star rating achieved*\n\n10/10 would break computer screen again\n\n====================================================================================\n\nTiltagon is a great minimalistic marble (because, let's be honest, if I say ball rolling, will you really take this review seriously? ....you probably shouldn't) rolling game, in which you..roll a marble. There are 10 levels (thank god for that..i've only just replaced my computer screen), 36 unlockable "marbles", and an endless mode with modes Hard and Hard+. This game is very challenging (couldn't you tell?), however it is very well made/polished, and the fitting soundtrack makes it all the more fun to play. It's $2.99, and who doesn't love to kill time by rolling balls (yeah, I said it) down some slippery slopes? Especially when the ball you're rolling could be a Pokeball. 'Nuff said.","March 29","true","1.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","21","27","13","0"

If you have never played a ball roll/tilt game before you are going to find this game really hard. Can unlock more balls; one ball per level per star earned. Good luck getting more than a single star per level. Cool dance-beat soundtrack. Challenging and fun. Good control system and options. With the ball reward system, the game wants you to go back and earn more stars i.e. balls. After finishing level 10 I went back to level 1 and tried to get another star for doing it faster. Now I feel car-sick and need to lie down. Fortunately there are other game modes too. Would play again. Cons: needs more balls.","March 30","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Runs great at 60fps. Once you beat the 10 levels it is great to go back to the first few levels to realise just how much you've improved.\n\nBig fan of games such as Duet, Velocibox and Super Hexagon and I’ve really enjoyed this game. For those looking for something new to try. I can easily recommend this game at full price.","March 31","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And why do hexagons have to be so mean?","March 30","true","12.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
