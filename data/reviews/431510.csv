This is more than enough reason not to support them.\n\nCensorship is something they support and find acceptable, unfortunately this should now factor in to your supporting them by buying their game/dlc.\n\nWill you support a company who actively censors to ensure an honest review of their game is not available to consumers?\n\nPS: The free to play portion of this game is literally Chapter 1 out of 12.

Just my personal opinion though.\n\nAll in all I think this could be a great game if the branches you pay for are more detailed and as long as the description says, with beautiful CGs and all that stuff. They just lost me on the paying-system and after such a hurried prologue and introduction into the story that kind of was like "Here are the details. Now please give us your money so we can actually let you continue." So yeah- as much as I like to support good Visual Novels, this really isn't the kind of thing I like to see.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter some time to think about it and having received a reply from the developers, I realized that I might have been a bit harsh on them and their game by saying "I recommend not to buy it." just based on their poor choice of paying-system and a prologue that was so rushed it made me feel like there was no effort put into it because they weren't gonna get paid for that part. I forgot that this wasn't a big company, but a group of girls who tried to do what they enjoy doing or maybe playing themselves, I suppose.\n\nSo here I go again, after reading the first Chapter "Firestarter" and some of the 'sneak-peaks' offered in the game as well. I'm not going to change my mind about what I said before: "This game feels incredibly rushed." The art is amazing, the music is beautiful, the characters are each interesting in their own way and the ideas for the story itself are awesome as well. However, in my opinion, they're jumping from one huge plot point to the next, one big happening to the next. For me it was hard to connect to the Main Character that is more or less supposed to giving me the feeling of 'me' I suppose, before I was already thrown into the cold water of the story itself. I suppose the introduction of the guys was nicely made, typical Otome, to get to know them all on your first day at the university. That part I liked, I admit. But after that it's back to the jumping back and forth between places and plot happenings, which (also in my opinion) don't give me enough details on how or why my character is feeling like she does or why she sees things a certain way. I can tell that she's not the most emotional of all people out there, probably thanks to her 'mother' and all that, but it's kinda sad that so many amazing ideas for a visual novel get lost on me and probably others as well simply because we're not given the chance to actually get into the situation the character is in. It kinda feels like your favorite book got caught in half, cutting out all the 'unnecessary' details so it ends up rather being a history book than a beautiful fantasy novel. Or something like that. Same with the guys. The character barely knows them and as much as we as the player hope to get close to the boys as soon as possible, it was a tiny bit too quick for my liking. Like, with a character like her that feels so distanced at first (to me at least), to suddenly get all flustered over the company of a male person, doesn't seem right. And me trying to get into her kind of mindset, the boys suddenly being all up in my face felt like they were invading my private space. Strangely. Except for Takumi, of course, who had been a flirty character from the start.\n\nThat's probably the reason why I'm so butthurt over this as well, because there's so much potential in this visual novel, so many good ideas and so many beautiful things like the art and music. It kind of frustrates me that this whole thing that could probably easily be one of the best visual novels out there not from Japan, feels so rushed. With amazing ideas for a story like that, I would have loved to be allowed to get into it as well, maybe experience the kind of things the developers experienced when they first thought of those things. Sadly, I'm not really given the chance and that upsets me a little.\n\nRather than seeming like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who only complaints, I really hope that this review can be a tiny bit helpful to the developers at least. I'm not meaning to discourage them, quite the opposite, I'm already looking forward to their next project, in hopes the whole thing gets a better start than this one. I might edit this review again once a DLC comes out with one of the characters I'm interested in to see how that goes, since it really does seem promising and hopefully I'm given the chance to actually feel like a part of the story then.","February 11","false","1.0"," 78 of 112 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","78","112","0","3"

That being what it is I felt that writing a review of this game from the perspective of someone who is a fan of the genre was necessary.\n\nFirst and foremost I can't get over how lovely the art is. Sprites, backgrounds, and CG's are all beautiful! It is very obvious that a lot of love and attention to detail was put into the visuals of this game, and the style is something new and refreshing. Also, the music is suprisingly great as well. The writing was really solid. The dialogue is believable. Characters have defined personalities and the plot is pretty interesting (I have seen the supernatural theme come up in a lot of otome games but the story has it's own world and lore makes it just a notch above other games with a similar theme) and the writing was pretty sound grammatically too and was void of any glaring typos. If a game of this genre has all of these things it is already superior to 90% of the games that are out there.\n\nI have seen some complaints from other reviewers with the way the game is being distributed with the prologue and sneak peek of each route being free, and each full route being availible for individual sale as they are released. I for one don't mind this. I feel that each route is long enough that the price per route is fair, and if it allows me to play each route sooner since I don't have to wait for the whole game to be completed then I don't really see what the big deal is. If every route is just as long as Shou's route, there will be hours of play time for each character route, with multiple endings for each one.\n\nTo be honest I am pretty hyped up to play the routes as they become availible. I think this is shaping up to be a really great game!","February 21","true","25.7"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","0"

This one immediately stands out to me because of the beautiful coloring and linework, and the incredible backgrounds. I can tell a lot of time and effort went into making this game. The music is STELLAR! I'll update this review once I've finished Shou's route and have more to say.\n\nYes, you do have to buy each route. At $5 a route(sold as DLC) for 5 total routes, this amounts to $25 which is a pretty standard price as far as quality visual novels go. Cheritz's games (Dandelion and Nameless) run for about $28 each. If you enjoyed this game I highly recommend checking those out as well!","February 24","true","1.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

I don't expect any of them to be the same, that being said, here's what I think of the game from playing the Shou route, and sneaking a peek at the others too.\n\nI think this game is really interesting and cute. The story kept me wanting to play more (so I'm a little bummed that I can't play the other routes yet, but I'll be sooooo excited when the Takumi route is available :P ), and the characters themselves are really interesting.\n\nI like how all the guys aren't just hitting on the main girl character constantly. I find that to be a bit irritating in some games. None of the guys look the same, they all have their own personalities, and none of them seem to be overbearing as far as personality goes.\n\nI can't wait for the next routes.

I knew this going in and when I finished the prologue I found myself immediately buying the DLC wanting to find out what happened next. I don't regret it in the least. The shou route alone had five hours of content for me.\n\nI can tell a lot of love went into this game, the art work and music alone is proof enough of that. That little avatar of the character you are playing the corner, it actually shifts subtlely in expression, as well as of course the people you are talking to. I did like as one reviewer pointed out, that all the guys are not constantly hitting on you, hell Shou is not even really hiting on you lol.\n\nI don't know about the whole censorship thing going on with videos reviews. I do know however, that there is really only one route and there are three ending and those are the last chapter. So, yeah the conversations may change slightly, but that donesn't push you off on to a different branch of a story like lot of visual novels. So, if someone puts a video online of the "gameplay"....it pretty much spoils everthing.\n\nThe story is pretty dark, but I like them that way. Don't expect to escape this game without any feels lol. As I said, there aren't may points where you get to make a choice and those only effect the last chapter. Even the dark ending doesn't seem like a bad one to me, just kinda neutral. So my advice is, give it a chance and sit back and enjoy a good story. This is shaping up to be one of my favoriate otomes, and I can't wait for the next routes to come out.\n\nIn short, Star Maiden Games, shut up and take my money!.\n","March 13","true","12.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I really look forward to getting the other ones, assuming they are similarly priced. It's surprisingly deep for an otome game and not all sunshine-and-daisies, which is really nice. The plot line is interesting and engaging and fun when it would have been easy to go for a jaded, over-used storyline. My only complaint would be that the choice-to-story ratio is pretty small, and I'd love to have more frequent choices, even if not all of them matter so much. Even considering that, however, I had immense fun finding all the endings to the first route and reading through the story.","March 1","true","18.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

In comparing with those, it's so much better as you don't have to wait for "tickets" or what ever to continue reading. Down side was that I didn't anticipate having to actually buy a story line to continue reading, especially when the base program was basically just a demo. What made it all better though was that you could skip through stuff you've already read, had multiple endings, amazing images and music, and Shou was an awesome character to read about/work with. Though with having read nearly every line of text published so far(Shou's Story line and the other character's Sneek Peaks) it's taken me less then 8 hours to complete.\nAll in all, I love the it, just wish that it would have been a little more honest about being a payed game instead of the use of payed DLC's.","March 7","true","9.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

What Happens Next Will Warm Your Heart!\n\nI play A LOT of otoge and am what one may call an "otoge connoisseur" of sorts. See, I'm addicted to feeling the physical sensation of my heart being squeezed due to an emotional stimulus.  For myself that sensation is often ellicted by either otoge or shoujo manga, so I spend a lot of time devoted to both. It's an unpredictable feeling, sometimes I feel it due to some amount of romantic angst and sometimes I feel it during a happy moment of the romantic revelaton between two characters.\n\nUnfortunately, it remains an extremely rare occurence for me. However, the rarity of this sensation has allowed me to realize just how great a piece of fiction is whether it be a game, a manga, or a book.\n\nAnother influencing factor in my critique of an otome game is whether the game managed to make me fall in love with a character. Too often otome games will focus on getting the characters to fall in love with the player rather than getting the player to fall in love with the characters. I can't tell you how many times I've been forced into wooing a character I had absolutely zero feelings for just for the sake of the objective of the game. I'll spend the entirety of the game hoping that at some point I'll fall in love with a character only to end the game feeling empty and like all of my efforts were just a waste of time. A good otoge should make me want a character to love me just as much as I love them.\n\nI use both of these factors to help determine whether an otome game is worth playing or not. If a game manages to do both for me then it's a game I will highly recommend!","May 25","true","20.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

All of the routes are completely different so it doesn't actually detract from your ability to enjoy Shou's route. Only the prologue is the same amongst the stories, I also find it enjoyable that all the characters have varying degrees of relations/friendships even without 'you'.\n\nI love the music it is beautiful and to be honest I let it just play as background music while I wrote this review. The background and CG art is all very beautiful. Additionally all of the characters are well thought out and interesting. It pulls on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nI can't wait to play the other routes ^-^","March 29","true","11.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I love visual novels but the only negative thing I would say about it is it sucks to have to pay for each character instead of it being a game where your character just happens to fall in love with one the love interests available. Also, I am not sure if it's just me but some of the story line seems to just fall off at the end of a few chapters. For instance chapter 4 while in the cafe you see the girl with blue earrings but then it jumps to you being in class. It's very weird and a little confusing/annoying. Other than that the characters are relatable, the overall story line is entrancing, the visual art is amazing and the music fits very well. I still wonder if I am the only one who thinks the chapter jumps are weird. It feels like I've missed important parts of the story. EDIT: After completing Shou's route I am totally in love with this game. I still feel like there are bits of the story missing but it's a great story none the less. I am so excited for Hikaru's and Takumi's routes. If you are into visual novels you are definitely going to love this one.\n\nI've finished Tatsuya's route and I didn't think that I could fall more in love with this game. I definitely appreciate that the story is completely different that Shou's. I quite enjoyed Tatsuya's route but I can't wait for Takumi's route *HINT *HINT Lol. It was so sad for him to be in love with the main character but not being able to choose him or at least comfort him. I WANT TAKUMI!!!","March 30","true","45.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Basically, I rate this game like 9.5/10 definitely give it a try with what's given to you for free and see if it's your thing!************\n\n\nOkay so the artwork, the story, the music (holy ♥♥♥♥ the music though...) and the personalities are all so wonderfully done in this game.\n\nTbh the artstyle threw me off at first because it was so different from what I'm used to seeing (really anime stuff, you know what I'm talking about) but it is so beautiful, the artwork. It's so well done and the background images look like they took /forever/ to create--it's all beautiful. The facial expressions and subtle differences from when they are blushing and aren't--it's amazing.\n\nThe music is probably my favorite thing about the game, though. It fits really nicely and it's just calming to listen to. I could just let it play for hours and never get bored of it. It fits the mood, whatever that may be, and really let's you get a little more immersed in the world.\n\nThe story!--it's really interesting! Now I definitely see a few things that they did wrong (completely in my OWN OPINION) but for the most part, the story is nice and original. There were some clichés in the story but nothing is forced and for the most part, it's nicely paced.\n\nAll the characters have their own personalities!!! (This one is just amazing) So like even the MC like...ACTUALLY has a personality for once. I CANNOT tell you how many god damn times that I've played a visual novel and then I had to stop because the MC is just so stupid. Honestly, the generic, pushover, girly girl type can only go so far and I am SO glad that they decided against making the MC like that. You can change her name to whatever you'd like and she is--mostly--calm and collected...also she's a nerd who loves anime and that in itself is great.\n\nOverall, this game is really well done. When I'm writing this, there is only 2 routes out (Shou and Tatsuya's) and I've played through Shou's completely, and Tatsuya's halfway. But even so, I can tell that it's only going to get better from here. Please support this company and this game. I can't wait for the other routes to come out (though it may be quite a while before they do) because you can tell that these people actually care about their product.\n\nAlso Tatusya is and will be forever my favorite. He's such a dork omg I love him so much ;u;","May 25","true","14.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/431510/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","It's a romance story.You play Tsubasa Fujimoto (though you can rename her to anything you want at the start of the game), a 20-year-old female university student who comes to acquire magical powers through unexpected circumstances. Take your pick of 5 good-looking men (one at a time though - don't be greedy!) to accompany you through your mystical journey set in contemporary urban Japan.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous.So is the music. And there's an "auto" option so you can play through the entire thing mostly hands-free, save for when you need to make choices.\n\nThe story is ...ok so far.This is the just the first chapter of the game (you have to pay for the rest), so I don't know how things'll unfold later on, but I played through all 5 different prologues (i.e. the 5 different story paths if you choose each different guy) and things seem promising. All the men have very distinctive personalities, which should make for different enough story paths. And the game promises that all men have a "secret" to tell, or some backstory that will be revealed if you play on.\n\nBut only one of the guys' stories is available for purchase at this point!I hate to say it, but this is the #1 factor I won't be buying this game, though I do still recommend it to anyone interested in what they've read about the game thus far. I personally prefer playing through all characters' stories at one go, in one sitting, one after the other, and not having to wait a millennia before each of them becomes available, one by one, in which case my interest in and memory of this game would have largely waned.","April 27","true","1.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furybird/recommended/431510/","furybird","Heron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furybird/","18 products in account","Edited to include responses to the devs' comments.\n\nI am still tentatively not recommendeding this game (although I am willing to change my review once the developers do something about my complaints). It's a mixed bag. Not AAA but not quite awful either.\n\nStoryline: Within a few chapters, the protagonist already has three - yes, THREE - guys who have the hots for her (i.e: Shou, Takumi and Tatsuya ). This is fairly questionable, especially since in the early chapters the leading lady is an emotional wreck. Not particularly attractive. I was especially shocked that Tatsuya would like this vibe.\n\nThe devs said that there are deeper reasons at to why this is happens. I'm not 100% convinced. This kind of reaction is jarring to the player and could potentially put them off buying future routes and actually discovering whatever justification there is. It's best to at least attempt to bridge the jump between being a stranger and a crush with more appropriate reactions.\n\nWhy Hikaru didn’t go to extra lengths to protect the protag once Shou got critically wounded by a dark phoenix escapes me, too. This is a fair plothole that the devs just ignored in their response.\n\nThere’s also little closure about Shizuka and the MC’s dad. I would’ve also liked a little more about how Shou adjusted to his life as a born-again dark phoenix. These were matters I was still curious about at the end of the route but got brushed under the carpet. Although, according to Star Maiden Games, there will be an epilogue. Feels a little like penny-pinching, especially since "Mystic/Passionate/Dark Ending" kinda implies - well, an ending.\n\nThat aside, main character was believable enough. Although, the constant meltdowns and getting pushed out of the way of danger got a bit old. It would’ve been more interesting to see her bear the brunt of Iulius’ fire instead of being shoved aside by Shou (which was a grossly predictable and cliche move.) It would’ve been even better if SHE pushed HIM out of the way. I can’t be the only one who was curious about how immortal she really is right?!\n\nArt: It’s of acceptable quality but not without its share of complaints. If anyone's here from Kickstarter, get ready to be let down. The developers haven't be open about how the two "achieved" stretch goals weren't really all that achieved. Explanations in the later paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, three CGs per route even though the KS achieved the $3,000 stretch goal (for more CGs and improved BGs) is nothing short of disappointing. That’s not even the entire complaint, apparently achieving the $3,000 still results in using stock background. This was particularly jarring for the Chowa backgrounds, which looked low quality and out of place. The devs said they had to stretch the budget, couldn't afford to pay their own team for five months and still haven't really commented on what the future of "more CGs" will be.\n\nThe $3,500 stretch goal for customizable main character coloring was also achieved in the Kickstarter but it’s not available in-game. The devs have just responded and said that despite that the stretch goal is "met" on KS, it wasn't really. That's a shame. It's still unprofessional, misleading and downright dishonest of them not to have mentioned this in any of their updates.\n\nWhether or not your team is getting paid is ultimately a consequence of your financial planning. It is NOT an excuse for you to rescind whatever you promised. You officialised the stretch goals, so it is within your words. Kickstarter expressly forbids projects which: "can’t mislead people or misrepresent facts, and creators should be candid about what they plan to accomplish". Additionally, "when a project is successfully funded, the creator is responsible for completing the project and fulfilling each reward. Their fundamental obligation to backers is to finish all the work that was promised." See: https://www.kickstarter.com/help for more information.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have about the artwork is definitely the continuity. In a particularly important scene where the main character tears the wings off Iulius - Iulius’ sprite still has the wings on his back. That was nothing short of unprofessional. Similarly, the desk and Shou’s hoodie catching on fire was never depicted in the background or on Shou’s sprite. Felt like lazy work. Also detracted from player immersion.\n\nThe developers just said that their artist is "very meticulous" and "did her best". I'm sorry but that's hard to believe when she botched a sprite in the climax of the game. You should fix the sprite.\n\nI’m also not a big fan of the soft brushwork paired with the harsh silhouette outline on the sprites. This is particularly prevalent when Tastuya wears his work uniform (the soft lines were jarring against his sharply defined glasses) and when Shou wears a suit with his glasses. Iulius’ outline looks odd when his wings are spread. This should be remedied if the lines weren’t restricted just to the silhouette of the character.\n\nI've noticed that plenty of the characters have unaligned eyes. It’s generally the eye on the player’s right that looks positioned a little too far down the face. The main character also has one noticeably thicker arm in her sprite (this is particularly noticeable in the ballgown variants).\n\nMusic: I liked the title screen music. In-game music was unremarkable but didn’t detract from the playing experience. After I accidentally unplugged my headphones, the music just stopped playing from both my speakers and my headphones. I had to quit and start up the game again.\n\nSystem: Even at maximum speed, autoforward was too slow. I resorted to tapping my enter key instead. Please let autoforward be faster.\n\nOther: I don’t mind paying for individual routes however I would encourage a separately marketed “demo version” and a “paid version” to avoid confusion. Just because Voltage markets their games as Free To Play on the AppStore doesn’t mean that you should adopt the same strategy on Steam. If Valve suggested what you said they did, it still doesn't hurt to be more upfront about the F2P label.\n\nI'm sorry there was confusion about the YT situation.\n\nClosing thoughts/TLDR; The story idea had promise but the game feels rushed, relatively incomplete and/or broken. With a bit of fixing, maybe I would recommend this game in the future.","February 20","false","4.1"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","1"

Although I think at least one or two more CGs and a little expansion on the (really interesting) world would be great, but I have seen the creators reasoning for this (time & money) and totally understand. Hopefully there will be an update when everything is out or something :)\nI'm not a big fan of individual routes being sold separately, but the developers have a legitimate reason for this, and I don't mind too much as it was nice to be able to play it early. However, while I know that once everything is out it will be available as a bundle, I feel like there should be some reward for those who spent the money early on, as they will have paid more over time. For example perhaps a special CG or a discount on the last story released or something for those who bought all the others before the bundle was available. This is of course just a suggestion, but I hope the developers will at least consider it.\nAnyway, overall I loved it, and can't wait for the next guy ^^","February 26","true","7.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The MC is very realistic, she has some backbone but some insecurities as well, like any normal person. The finer personality traits are more up to you of course, which makes it easy to immerse in the story.\nAt first, I wasnt sure if i was gonna buy all the routes. I thought I wasnt gonna enjoy some guys because they were not my type. But after playing 2 routes, this feeling completely disappeared. They are all different, complex, deep characters that have both good and bad points and the game is build in a way that makes you want to get to know that person better, even if you haven't played his route yet!\n\nThe music is great, they complete the feeling of the story while playing. It makes your heart race or calm down when the story asks for it.\n\nThe art, like you can see, is very realistic. It is easy on the eyes, detailed and the CG's have some slight variations to match the storytelling, which I really love!\n\nMix all this together with the good stories and somehow, you fall more in love with this game the more you play it! Definitely a game to recommend!","May 20","true","41.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm willing to pay a decent amount for this game but sell me a season pass for the rest or something. It makes it feel like the game is being broken up arbitrarily into small pieces just to make more money (even if the feeling isn't logical).\n\nMajor criticism out of the way, I really enjoyed playing Shou's route! It's so refreshing to read a sweet and fluffy slow burn romance for a change.\n\nThe main character is fairly competent but believebly akward. I like that you can push the MC to be flirty and romantic but Shou doesn't imediately turn casanova and shove his tongue down her throat. He has some self control and is a bit awkward himself. Be warned, there's no sex. If that's something you absolutely need in your VN's, you probably won't enjoy this.\n\nThat being said, there is also no "almost ♥♥♥♥" situations or abuse from Shou to MC which is nice. There is some abuse from MC's mother in the begining and torture at the end but the majority of the story is very clean.\n\nFrom what I experienced, this was pretty well written. The fight scenes read a little clunky in some parts but were passible. For me, there was a bit too much emphisis on describing exactly what characters were doing during combat which made it a chore to follow from frame to frame. There was a good variety of descriptions especially for things that repeat, something that other VN's forget to do. You don't see lines like "my heartbeat increased" over and over again (my biggest pet peeve). As others mentioned, there were a few plotholes that didn't get resolved but I'm not too upset about it. The main story arc / romance is most important for me and this one was satisfying.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone in the mood for a read with a ton of warm and fuzzies.","April 8","true","19.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Please also note that this is a review exclusively about the novel itself and not about the game developers or any of their actions elsewhere, as I don't feel this is really a fair platform to discuss or critique that.  This review is meant to help those seeking information about the novel and how good I felt it was.\n\nThat said, all the issues with this game were fairly minor.  It is enjoyable and I do recommend it.  I feel that the price is worth it if only for the fact that it's just a really beautiful game.\n\nAnyway, on to the pros and cons...\nNOTE: Some of the previously mentioned "cons" to the game have been addressed and/or the developers have said they intend to address them.  I had mentioned a lack of sprites for side characters, but new sprites have been added in at this time.  Several other issues have been mentioned by the developers as things that they intend to resolve, and one issue looks like it might be resolved in Shou's epilogue.  I will continue to update this review as the developers make changes to the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Exceptionally gorgeous artwork.  There are tons of backgrounds and locations, all of which are nicely done.  The character sprites are all really beautiful, and have a decent range of expressions.  The artwork is just, honestly, completely gorgeous.  I feel like I spent a lot of time just admiring everyone's amazing hair or the setting for various scenes.\n\n-Sleek design.  The whole game really looks super polished.  It's not just the artwork but even the menus are really nicely done.\n\n-Likable characters.  I think it's great that all the main characters seem lovable and fun - I hate playing games where there's that one character I just can't *stand.*  In this game, everyone seems like they have their virtues and flaws, but will be enjoyable to play through, regardless.\n\n-Story that was not predictable.  I was surprised by several of the events in Shou's story line, as well as Shou himself.  Even though there were moments I kind of want to just shake him...he's still a sweet character.  His route had some pretty surprising twists, and was really fun to play through.\n\n-Nice music.  Though I always turn the music way down in these games, it's still nice to have decent music, rather than something that makes me want to claw my ear drums out after five minutes.  There were a few moments where I, uncharacteristically, turned it up a bit because it really suited the scene, or just sounded nice.\n\n-All the endings were fairly long, and had unique content.  They all felt like a legitimate and logical end, rather than something thrown together for the sake of having more endings.\n\n-The main character has an actual personality.  She has moments where she can be feisty and independent, or moments where she can stand there and cry.  It's nice to have options that portrayed a stronger protagonist, and to just see a protagonist who is more developed than what a lot of games bother with.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Very little variation in the story line.  At least in Shou's route, there is a single "fork" in the story where it splits into the different endings, none of which are really bad - just varying degrees of sweet.   Up until that fork, the story is the same regardless of what choices you make - no hidden scenes, no skipping scenes, no unexpected bad endings. At most, you get a few new lines of narrative before being forcibly placed back on the same path.  This game is essentially one path with different endings and only one branching point.  It's fine to have some decisions affect only some invisible tracker that determines what ending you get, but the game would have been more engaging if the choices impacted the actual path you travel to get to those endings as well.\n\n-The lack of CGs.  There are only three as far as I can tell.  I would have been willing to give up on some backgrounds/locations for the chance at more CGs - after all, unlocking the CGs is a huge draw of games like this.  Even one or two more would have been nice. There were at least two other scenes I felt would have been really good CG moments, so it was a little disappointing there were so few of them.  That said - the art work is SUPER amazing and I imagine that they may have simply run out of time or money for more than what is there.  This is something I hope they can update down the line, but I can understand why there are probably so few.\n\n-Story is a little shallow at times -  The MC is way too accepting of surprise magic classes, and a magical basement at her university.  And the magical basement, at least in Shou's route, is really not ever given a decent explanation as to why its even there. It felt weird that the MC never delved into that too deeply. Also, since the route focuses entirely on Shou, the MC really doesn't have much in depth screen time with the other guys but somehow develops deep bonds with them.  That felt a little contrived but is still a fairly minor story flaw.\n\n-There is also a minor antagonist that never gets a proper wrap up.  They just sort of vanish from the story entirely at one point and you never really hear from them again.  It would have been nice if these things had been handled with a bit more finesse, but comparatively speaking, the story is still relatively well developed for an otome type novel so it didn't stand out as being terribly shallow for the genre.\n\nOver all, I definitely recommend this visual novel.  Like any game, there are points that could be nitpicked, or areas where the game can improve. The fact that the character routes are being released one at a time means the developers will hopefully use feedback to improve future routes.  It also means there will be plenty of time to save up to buy the rest of the routes when they are released. =)","February 20","true","8.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Still, gorgeous game. Good dialogue, few typos/grammatical errors. Humor is thrown in more than I expected, as well.\n\nThe storyline is wonderful. It kept me interested the entire time, always wanting to know what happens next... At least, I felt that way with the main story. Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the epilogue. In the name of finishing the gallery, yeah you'll want the Epilogue's apparently, but I think for me Shou's will be the last one I bother with... Unless I'm so enthralled with one of the characters I just HAVE to see the Epilogue.\n\nEDIT: I take back what I said about the epilogues. I've been itching so bad for the next piece, I couldn't even wait for Tatsuya's epilogue. I think it's safe to say, I'm just not a huge Shou fan. I didn't think I'd like Tatsu either, but I liked him more than I thought (though I liked his rival more, honestly...)\nOf course now, I've finished it all... and I have to wait for the next part as patiently as possible....

He's genuinely so adorable. (I just love guys who blush). I The story is well written, the world well built, and the art is beautiful, of course. I like the payment method as well - whoever did not enjoy the prologue, trust me, Shou's route is a step up. The prologue doesn't give the game justice. Plus, paying for Shou's route is getting several hours worth at least of entertainment, and you can get a MUCH better idea of what the game is about. The only thing I have to complain about (if it can even be considered a complaint, really) is that MC could be a bit more spirited in character, but at least her backstory/goals are plausible compared to pretty much every other otome game out there.\n\nThis is a first for the developers, and relative to what's even on the otome market is very good for their debut. I look forward to reading Tatsuya's route!!\n\n\nEDIT: I just played more and seriously, the character development is awesome and I'm really liking MC so ignore my previous comment.

Overall I'd give the game a 6/10 with Shou's route being better put together than Tatsuya's, imo.\n----------------------------------\n\nFirst off though I'd like to make a note about the marketing for this game. The game is stated as f2p with paid dlc. The free part is really just the prologue and the first chapters for each guy. The dlc is what you need to pay for to get the complete routes for each character. Now, this is really common in mobile dating sims/visual novels, where the aim seems to be to get the user to spend as much money as possible by splitting up the game into sections and then locking them behind price tags. At the same time this allows the game to have some content playable and ready, while working on additional content to be released later. And that's fine for mobile because you usually go in knowing that and it's a well-used strategy. But I don't think steam was the best place to launch this game with that type of business model (it's also not very common on here, hence all the angry/shocked reviewers of this game. First of all steam doesn't seem to have the right type of categories to accurately describe how this game is set up, so you get people clicking on the game (not reading thoroughly - it IS stated clearly in the summary how the game works) expecting the whole thing to be free just to find out that they have to pay to get anything out of it.\n\nI honestly think it would have been better to wait until all of the routes were finished and then release the game on steam with the entire price tag. It's what visual novel romance games that launched on mobile are starting to do: consolidating all the routes under one price tag and porting to steam. But it seems like the devs wanted to get the game out as soon as possible so they went this way, launching each route as it's ready and releasing it as paid dlc. Again, I really don't think steam is the place for that type of model (and really having to pay for the separate epilogue as well makes it an even worse idea) but it's what the devs decided worked best for them and I can respect that.\n\nAnyway to the actual review.\n-----------------------------------\n\nGraphics:The art is 10/10 for Shou, 7/10 for Tatsuya. Everything is really soft with a beautiful painted look. My only problem is that for Tatsuya's CGs his face ends up looking really weird/awkwardly drawn, while Tsubasa's (the main char) was always perfect. Don't know why that ended up like that but it's just something I noticed.\n--------------------------------------\n\nMusic:The music is okay. I really enjoy the menu song but the other background music is your standard stuff.\n--------------------------------------\n\nGameplay:It's a visual novel. So lots of reading with a few choices sprinkled in that can change what ending you end up with. Shou\'s route has 3 endings that are all happy. Even though one is called the "Dark End" it's not all that dark, you still get the guy it's just not as straight forward lovey-dovey as the other endings. For Tatsuya's route there are 3 happy endings and 2 bad endings.\n\nShou's route was good. The pacing felt right, nothing was too angsty, the protagonist wasn't a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, and it was just overall a well done story. Tatsuya's route on the otherhand...it was boring. It was longer than Shou's but stuffed with so much bland internal monologue scenes, useless drama or instances where the protoganist over-reacted just to create a situation, that I lost all interest and was glad when it was finally done. And because of the length, Tatsuya's "hot and cold" attitude ping-ponged and dragged on longer than needed which made him come off as a jerk that likes to send off mixed signals. I just really didn't like him by the end of the game, even though I was okay with him at the start. Also I noticed a lot more typos/misplaced words in Tatsuya's route that got to the point where it was breaking immersion. I don't remember Shou's having that many but I could be misremembering.\n\nMore of my thoughts on Tatsuya's route here if anyone is interested (shameless blog plug): Tatsuya Route Review[eriserato.wordpress.com]\n\nIf you're interested in this game and don't mind paying for each route, I'd recommend the main chapters for the guys. But I can't really recommend paying for the epilogue as well because that just seems silly to me and feels more money-grabby than anything. Unless you don't care, you do you boo.\n\n**Edited for formating and additional comments.","June 1","true","23.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And then two different downloads for the game and the epilogue, which you'll probably be doing for the other guys as well, why not just throw in micro transactions while you're at it? Might see what the price looks like when its finished and you have actual options to choose from in game, but for right now, I would not recommend.","May 14","false","2.4"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

There are no words I can really place down to say how beautiful the music is ! The music draws you more into the game; it makes you want to keep playing. It's both relaxing and fitting for how the whole game is.\n\nArtThe art is very mesmerizing ! It's definately different than the types of visual novels I've played. It was a bit weird at first looking at it, but once you get into the game it draws you in completely. Very beautiful artwork in the game.\n\nStory As I mentioned aboved, I am hooked on to this story ! It become a storyline I was honestly not expecting it to become. I mean, yeah how it starts out with bumping into a guy helping you and ironically meeting with the other guys at the begginning; the typical cliche a lot of visual novels starts out to intorduce characters. But what really makes it unqiue story is the heroine herself. It is supernatural genre, but how the supernatural world in this game is what makes you want to keep going.\n\nEverything was smooth ( meeting characters, progression of story, etc. ), and what really grabbed me into the story was that the prolouge touched base on each of the male characters. Aside from more than basic introduction of them, you as the main character get to see a little bit into each male character's personality which is really nice because then you're just wanting to know more !\n\nOverrall Definately worth your time ! I love everything about this game, and although it's only the prolouge and first chapter, it's in your best interest to play it ! I'm eager to play Shou's story and really looking forward to the story unravel more ! Try it !

Beautiful art, amazing sound track, intriguing story and characters and all of the dialogue has a nice flow to it. My absolute favorite thing about this game is the protagonist. She's a good balance of vulnerablity and strength, helping to make her believable. She gets stressed in stressful situation, but she doesn't behave unreasonably, in fact in many of those situations you even have the choice to give extremely pragmatic responses.\n\nI'm actually not bothered by the release method the developers chose to take with this game, in fact I actually see it as another plus. It means we get to experience more of the game sooner rather than waiting months for every single route to be completed. I'm among those who have been passively watching the game development and progress, and frankly I was surprised they managed to even finish Shou's route as quickly as they had.\n\nNow moving on to some of the negatives to consider. There were a few aspects that left me wanting. Every part of the story that was there was good and strong, but there were a lot of plot points, story elements, and character aspects that could have been explored more deeply. In particular I had been hoping for something to the effect of a side plot involing Shou's acting rather than a single event in the story.\n\nThere were also fewer CGs than I was hoping for. I'm not sure the exact number in the route, and because of how the Gallery is set up it's hard for me to tell how many I'm missing, but after finishing with the "Passionate End" I only came across two.  I know I'm probably missing at least one from what is likely the best ending, and possibly one or two more that require particular response connditions to be met.\n\n\nIt's not the best otome I've ever played, but it is good. It made me laugh and grin like an idiot and I look forward to the next route. Now I think I've touched on all my thougths, more or less. I hope my review was helpful :3","February 11","true","8.9"," 29 of 61 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","29","61","0","1"

The GUI felt a little weird at first, but in the end, I got used to it since it's nice and dark and easy on the eyes.\n\nMusicThe intro music was beautiful, and I normally don't like to listen and go through those but it's one of those that I don't mind it.  The BGM while playing the game is really relaxing and exactly how background music should be.\n\nStoryThe first meeting with a guy is a typical cliche but the heroine makes it different, which is a good breath of fresh air in this sort of genre. It has a familiar atmosphere with guys to choose from but it soon becomes something different from the usual path in the visual novels.\n\nI personally did not find the prologue rushed at all.  It was at a good pace and it opened up the beginnings of the plotline very well.  Perhaps I'm one who likes it quick to the point and not need so many details.\n\nIt does, however, gives an insight of all the guy's personalities as well as the MC (aka you), which is a huge thing for me.  While the guy's may be attractive, seeing their personalities in the prologue is a huge selling point.  Without it, I wouldn't even bother to play onward to Shou's route, or other routes of the guys.\n\nMCI know that or some, the MC in this genre can be annoying, but the MC here is far from that.  She thinks of situtations with logic rather than shrug it off or let others walk over her.  What I really loved too is the MC actually has a purpose to meeting these guys plus the school she is attending.  That alone is fantastic.  While I do love other games have no reason at all, to see one have it is very refreshing and enjoyable.\n\n\n\nI'm taking it slow playing Shou's route so that I won't rush it, but so far, I really love how the choices I've been presented.  The player can be serious, funny, sassy, and mean back to a bit of texting on the cellphone and I really enjoyed that.  I don't know if it will affect the outcome, but it's still great that they included personality related choices to respond to the guys.\n\nDefinitely going to be looking out for the other routes to release.  I don't mind paying at all like the ones on mobile since the amount of time and work Star Maiden Games has done can be shown just like the professionals in this industry.  It's not perfect, but it's way better than good.  It's great and lovely and I cannot wait for more!","February 12","true","3.9"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","0"

As I'm terribly impatient, I actually never play unfinished games (in terms of all available chapters/stories being out at the same time), I couldn't resist playing a glimspe into MDSoA and happy I took the plunge anyway.\n\nAlso, definitely recommend completing ALL THREE ENDINGS as each gives you a different glimpse of the character/story/the world and so worth exploring!\n\nIf you like VNs or otomes with a pretty logical protagonist who actually has a legitimate reason for being the focal point of the plot (not just the 'I'm so adorable so everyone must fawn over me, naturally') with unique characters she can face off with, you'll definitely enjoy the world MDSoA creates.\n\nP.S.

All the characters are Complexly written and the story for the first route was extremely compelling. I appreciate that the MC is a central part of the story and that her love interests seem interested in her outside their own stories.\n\nThe graphics and music on this game are also top notch. I must have watched the intro about thirteen times now. Also in most Otome games the CG's have the MC eyeless or wth no face at all. That is not an issue here. The developers have added little things that round out the apperance of the MC is in the corner of the screen and she blushes and crys. I know it seems weird to focus on this but I'm enjoying to have a character to look at because most of the gammes I have doesn't have that ability.\n\nFinally the most important thing in my opinion is that the game deveopers have given us choices. The prologue is free and the characters after this are 3.99-4.99 each. Making it easy to test out which LI you want to play without having to commit to all of them. I will be playing all of them, but still the choice is nice!

The pricing is really good, considering the quality and the length of game play. I'm usually sort of "meh" on visual novels, they seem to either hit or miss with me, even when the reviews are really good.\n\nThis game, though, this was very refreshing. The art is lovely! Very well done and not the typical anime look, which is almost a relief, just to see something else. The writing and story really pulled me in too. Yes, there's romance, but it's not the whole point of the game. There's a lot more going on with the person you play as, as well as the other characters. Everyone has their own issues and even when you're not following down the romance path of the other guys, they are still your friends.\n\nThe story is a nice rollercoaster of dark/heavy and light/fun and I really look forward to more story releases.

At this time only Shou’s route is available (The prologue and 1st chapter of each route is free. Full routes can be purchased) so my review will be for his route.\n\nPros:\n-really beautiful and varied music. It changes to match the mood of the scenes quite well.\n-lovely and consistent art style.\n-the main character is wonderful! She is compassionate, but willing to stand up for herself. She also struggles with some fear and insecurities. She is not a blank slate and has believable responses to the situations she is placed in. I suppose it could be a downside if you are wanting a character you can mold to match your own personality, but I really enjoyed reading the MC’s thoughts and opinions.\n-the story starts out seeming like a typical school setting where this group of guys is thrown in with you but it has a wonderful twist in the prologue that I won’t spoil here. The fantasy setting seems very well thought out and has lots of backstory that is relayed to you in a way that is not overwhelming, but intriguing. Love it!\n-the writing style is very lovely and descriptive. It really pulls you in.\n-the relationship between the MC and Shou grows slowly and believably. It also strikes a great balance between some really cute, sweet moments and some darker, intense scenes.\n\nCons:\n-that title. Come on, “Mystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons” is a mouthful. And upon first hearing it, you’re not really sure what it’s supposed to convey. Um, it’s a fantasy type game? A mystical fantasy? I might be nitpicking, but even shortening it to “Serendipity of Aeons” would be better, IMO.\n-while the artwork is lovely, there are only 3 CG images for Shou’s route (one contained in one of the endings). Would have been nice to have a few more…but again, this is a minor thing.\n-my biggest downside may not even be considered a downside. Let me explain. There are certain moments in the game where your character (default name, Tsubasa) must make a choice. These choices will decide which of the three endings you get (Passionate, Mystic, or Dark). But other than the ending, your choices only seem to affect a few lines of dialogue before you go right back to the main story. For example, at one point Tsubasa is asked by another character to meet them somewhere. You can choose to say yes, say no, or hesitate. No matter what you choose, Tsubasa will still end up going to the same place. The next few lines after your choice will be different, but then everything will be the same as if you chose the other options. Again, this may not be considered bad, as long as you view this more as a story being played out by characters that you can nudge one way or the other, instead of a “choose-your-own-adventure” type story with a self-insert MC. Once I accepted that, I did enjoy it as it allowed Tsubasa to stay true to her character and let the story unfold how it was intended. However, I didn't feel like my choices made that much of an impact (especially since even the "Dark" ending isn't really a "bad" ending. In fact, I liked it better than the "Passionate" ending.)\n\nI honestly didn’t think I’d enjoy Shou’s route that much…out of all the characters to choose from I probably would have picked him last. Since his route was the only one available so far, I went ahead and took a chance. I’m so glad I did! Now I’m wondering if any of the other routes will be able to live up to Shou’s story. :) It was sweet, funny, heartbreaking, and exciting. I will definitely be coming back for more.","February 17","true","13.4"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

The world she has always known has been a lie and now she must face the truth.  Aided by some new wonderful supportive friends, Tsubasa begins her journey into the Unseen World, the magical realms where supernatural beings lie hidden from the human realm. MDSoA introduces a rather interesting moral dilemma; what does it mean to be human?\n\nStarMaidenGames has done a fantastic job with this game. They have listened to feedback from fans and have implemented changes that have really made this game shine. While it’s not the traditional ‘anime’ art style that comes with many otome games, the artist should be congratulated highly for such a beautiful style that highlights and captures the story in amazing ways. The characters are very well rounded and complement each other wonderfully. Character stereotypes have been broken apart and it’s such a nice sight to see. The story is complex but well-structured; there are moments of confusion, which I believe is well intended because like Tsubasa, we are experiencing this world for the first time. While it does leave some rather big questions open, this is the first route of the game and I do expect that they will be addressed in future routes.\n\nPlaying Mystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons will give you warm fuzzy feelings but it will also make you feel some angst as not everything is sunshine and roses. So if you’re ready to embark on a beautiful journey of self-acceptance, love and magic then press that purchase button and play until you cry. <3","February 15","true","6.1"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

I've played through the first available storyline, and it was both interesting and touching. I liked the main romance, and I didn't feel like anything was rushed. I also loved the relationship between Shinji and Tatsuya, which made me laugh more than once, and  how choosing one storyline didn't stop the main character from developing friendships with the other characters. Overall, I liked this a lot. It felt like the main character was given agency and made decisions, even if I thought her decisions were poor on a few occasions, which I like a lot and we don't see enough of in these games.\n\nIf I have any issues/suggestions, it'd be that while there were plenty of choices, I'm not exactly sure what those choices did or if there were multiple endings available. I'd also like to see the main character have a relationship with a woman that isn't hostile, which I'm hoping will come up in one of the other storylines. But I did like this a lot, and I'm looking forward to playing the other storylines when they're released.\n\nETA: I didn't mind the option to pay for each path for a few reasons. (1) You get the game out sooner than if we had to wait for every path to be finished, and (2) if there are paths you're definitely not interested in, you don't have to pay for them. And honestly, even if you buy every path, it's a really inexpensive game.","February 13","true","6.1"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","12","28","2","0"

It started off slow and monotone to me. It got kinda boring... I expected a lot from the prologue. Nothing really happen except that they were growing to learn to control. I know that's part of the process of getting her powers controlled.And I kinda felt awkward about the friendship between the group bc I guess it didn't feel like everyone was close. I can't explain it well anyways enough with that... In the middle, that's when it started to peak my interest again. The foreshadowing and the feels really got to me.

I can say that it takes at least a good 5 hours to run through his route and get one of the 3 endings.)\n\nWriting: Watching anime on TatamiRoll? Instant 10/10!\nOn a serious note, the writing in Shou's route is one the best I've seen from this genre of gaming. (Well, with the competition being larger companies and translations, the bar doesn't seem that high, but the humor is pretty decent.) Some options play out differently from what they would seem like, so it's not always clear which option is the best/worst--- I think that's a good thing.\n\nCharacters: 8/10\nWell, with only Shou out, it's kinda hard to judge. Personally I'm waiting on other routes, but from what I saw Show isn't half bad of a character, though his development seems slow at times (then condensed at other times). Still, he gets plenty of interaction with the main character.\nI'll also throw in the protagonist into this category. She seems somewhat relatable, but one thing I noticed is that\n<spoiler alert?> she cries a ton, like...at least enough for me to feel dettached from her sometimes. <end spoiler alert?>\nStill, this is being picky. The side characters, particularly the ones that don't have sprites, were probably the reason why I had to deduct some points here. I'm glad the father has a sprite, though.\n\nActual Plot: 8/10\nI think the plot is unconventional in a way? The antagonist took me by surprise (I'm glad you gave the antagonist development though, even though it was treated like an afterthought in my opinion.)\nFor Shou, it was a straightfoward plot, and it kinda had a feel of many tropes that you've probably seen before in dramas and anime. I didn't notice huge changes in text from the choices made...perhaps the result of a very minor problem changes, but for the most part the plot is intact.\n\nThe foreshadowing and some elements of the plot were clear enough to predict, which does subtract from this rating, but just a little. Regardless, the writing does compensate for this greatly. I wish there were more moments involving fluff/comedy (there's plenty of angst and tension in the mix, though!), but having 3 endings was a nice touch.\n\n\nArt: 9.99/10 (realistically, 9/10)\nOh bless the art staff. This game had some real love put into it. I particularly love how the characters actually have multiple outfits (some being absolutely gorgeous--- one particular sprite of Shou being in mind ;)  The background art was standard and polished. I wished that less time was spent in the same settings in the middle of the plot, though.\n\nThe only reason why I would not give this a perfect score was because of the number of CGs obtained in the route and the lack of sprites for the minor characters, which interrupted the flow of the story in my opinion. (Though I'm pretty sure they are in the works? I find it hard to believe that Tatsuya's parent didn't have a sprite yet, hopefully it isn't because this parent is not actually that involved in his story.)\n\nConsider throwing some concept art or sketches/doodles into the gallery too. It feels a little empty there. >.>\n\nMusic: 6/10\nThis is probably the last thing I paid attention to, so don't take my word for it. I honestly did not find the music memorable (maybe except for the menu theme, even so, it's not memorable in a positive way-- I would describe it as "meh.") and I really wish the soundtrack was stronger. Maybe use a piano for the sad theme and something more lively for the street/town music? The battle music was acceptable, but again, none of the music stuck out to me.\nThe toute ending song did not resonate as much as I hoped. Hopefully this will change with the other routes.\nSound effects were fine-- it's funny that you used the iPhone jingle and apparatus.\n\nGUI/Controls: 8/10\nAverage, to be honest. I actually wished that the design would change with the character or maybe even with the plot (the spell circle in the text box! I wished it would change with the situation but it's static...). Do note that the protagonist's sprite changes quite a bit, and that is very much appreciated.\nI'm a litte surprised there is no section for instructions on controls? (Maybe I missed it?) Anyways, the skipping and saving function works, so no problem there. It would help to have an indication of sorts about how the route is going, but I suppose it's natural if that doesn't exist.\n\nOverall, give this project your time especially if you're into the genre. I'll be looking foward to the other routes!\n\n\n\n\n","February 11","true","11.5"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

You also get three endings, but it depends on your choices during the storytime in which ending you'll get.) ^^\n\nGood things:\nThe story and it's plot is ámazing.

With web comics, making music on youtube, hosting a podcast, making indie games, any online careers that have popped up in this day and age you have to make a few choices related to how you make your money when you start, get an audience keep making money and also keep your audience so that you can still keep doing what you're doing...\n\nThis is an example of how not to treat your audience...\n\nI downloaded Mystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons for the sake of research (I'm a writer myself and I've been dabbling with visual novel creating softwares because one of my original works may end up working better in that format than in a novel or webcomic format.). Most of my Steam friends and all of my friends IRL will tell you i'm determined to be a web comic artist who doesn't rely on ads on their site in order to make money (because i hate those ads myself). I consider myself a very honest writer. I want to be funded completely by my audience if i can, if i absolutely must do sponsorships i'll only get sponsors that I have experience with or get sponsors related to products and services i have used and approved of, so on and so fourth. In this day and age, if you wanna go indie you need to be upfront and honest with your audience unless you want to end up like the shameful Digital Homicide (using an indie example) or perhaps worse: be accused of being your field's EA equivalent!\n\nSo seeing that this game was free to play and i wanted to study how some of my favorite visual novels worked, i downloaded this game under the impression i was getting a whole game... I did not. I got a prolouge and 1 chapter for free with 11 OTHER CHAPTERS behind a paywall...\n\nNow putting some content behind a paywall i can understand... DLC, extra routes that may not appeal to everyone, sountracks, art collections, pre-order bonuses and other stuff like that which may not appeal to everyone i can understand charging for... But if you're gonna put 11 CHAPTERS OF YOUR VISUAL NOVEL BEHIND A PAY WALL, then why not just charge for the game outright?\n\nSpeaking for myself in particular my webcomic is still in the process. The story is worked on in a unique way where things are subject to change so no storyboarding gets done until things are final. I have an editor to keep me in line so i don't do anything stupid, but who also makes sure i get stuff done. Currently my web comics have no budget in particular and i do all of the art, 90% of the writing and a good chunk of any research i need for it myself. I don't have a site because I know full well I don't have much material to display currently, and if you have no finished product, you shouldn't post at all... That only makes sense!\n\nThat's my main complaint about this game...\n\nThey paraded it like a free to play game that you could download and enjoy in it's entirety but once you finish chapter one you realize "Oh... Only the first chapter was free. Now they expect me to pay..." For that, you might as well hold off your project until it's near completion, maybe put it in early access if need be. If you really need the money to work on your product there are plenty of people on Kickstarter who could help fund your game. Being an honest indie dev is hard, i know. You don't make much if any money when you start out, you have to rely on your audience's kindness, you have to build a rather LARGE audience in order to make enough money from donations or through services like Paypal or Patreon alone... These are things I'm willing to face as an indie creator myself. HOWEVER, EVEN I KNOW FULL WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE OR NEAR COMPLETE PRODUCT NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL, YOU SHOULDN'T PUT IT OUT FOR SALE UNDER THE GUISE OF IT BEING 'FREE' ONLY FOR THE REST OF IT TO BE PUT BEHIND A PAYWALL...\n\nAccording to some of the other reviews I've read, people pointing out what i am saying are facing censorship from this game's developer (how very Digital Homicidal that seems). I'm not sure if this is true or not, but if whether or not it is, this is not how you behave as an indie dev...\n\nI know this review has mostly been ranting about the paywall, but i won't be interested in playing this game further for other reasons as well:\n- The writing seems very rushed in the prolouge. I didn't know whether to attribute it to the heroine just giving us little anicdotes of her day and maybe that's why it seems choppy or maybe it's the developer putting more story in the prolouge behind a paywall\n- The heroine seems somewhat generic. Maybe it's one of those things where she's supposed to be our in-game avatar but i honestly don't like that approch all that much. It's been so overdone it's almost offensive for your heroine to be so bland (Bella Swan and Anastasia Steel being 2 big examples of this writing sin). There are a lot of dating sims with interesting heroines, I'd rather play those instead!\n- The art style is okay. The women look especially nice but for the men it kind of gives them a weird uncanny valley sort of look... but that's probably just me.\n- The prolouge is too damn short and rushed... If you wanna release a free prolouge for your upcoming game, that's fine. But at least give us a good chunk of story so we can understand what'll happen in the full game once it's released... All i can gather from the prolouge is that there's magic and alchemy involved but i'm not getting much else...\n\nOverall, this game gets a spank on the butt from me... Unless the devs release it as A: a COMPLETE free to play game (which is unlikely) or B: Get rid of the paywall and just release a finished complete product for 15 or so dollars, I won't bother with this title further...","April 19","false","0.7"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","10","28","0","1"

Or, actually, if you haven't read a work of fiction, to be sure. Sounds extreme, huh?\n\nYou don't have to take my word for it, you could download the game and see for yourself. If you do, try and change the MC name for Bella Swann or Anastasia Steele and see if it changes the plot in any meaningful way (Spoiler: It won't, because this MC and those two others are the same person. I like to call her Mary Sue).\n\nOr you could check out a Let's Play of the game. Except that you can't. Because the developers are actively sending copyright takedowns to small channels that don't like their game. This is widely regarded as Something Not Nice To Do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVmGYat2YN8\n\nWhat kind of person you have to be to see someone criticizing your work and go: "Oh, the appropiate response is to claim they are breaking copyright law? This is a measured response to critique!" Sweet baby jesus on a stick. (I'm sure this doesn't have anything to do with trying to protect their sales, seeing this is only chapter 1 of 20 and you have to pay for the others)\n\nYou could try to talk to the developers about this, but their youtube comments suddenly went private. Wonder why. So next step is to claim the bad reviews are harassment and to demand donations to their patreon, right?\n\nI guess the tumblr professional world is very different from the real world, and I just don't get how copyright works there.","February 20","false","0.1"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

It is boring, tedious and in the free version you only play the first chapter out of 12, and are presented with two choices.
