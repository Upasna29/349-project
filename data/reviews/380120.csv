A game that's about finding a 'build' that suits you to clear the game. There are many variations ranging from the classics to unique setups. Mix and match and see what build you prefer, and what works out! There are many NPC's in Celia's Quest with rich backgrounds, and a series of dialogues between characters that'll make you chuckle on more than several occasions due to the creators witty senses.\n\nIn short; Celia's Quest is a game that offers unique gameplay elements that most RPG genre lacks nowdays. A gameplay that's refreshing from the occasional "grind until you can't grind anymore" games out there.","June 24, 2015","true","12.1"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

A fun mix of story and humor had me giggling at Celia's Quest which I haven't really done since Borderlands... there is no xp to be gained and no traditional "level ups" which at first seems lacking but the more I play the more im starting to enjoy it as im finding myself playing the game without fighting hoards of monsters in a tireless grind, I still have much to play (yay) so im hoping I continue to giggle and push through to every last corner of this colourful world 7/10","June 28, 2015","true","2.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

One distinct genre of games on Greenlight is the games done with RPG Maker. Unfortunately, most of them looks generic and not attracting my attention. But Celia's Quest charmed me when I first saw it. It was so much different!\n\nThe indie games attract me because you can feel the very soul of developer, not a common thing for mainstream AAA projects. And in Celia's Quest this feeling is very strong. The story, the characters, the world: it all brings the mark of care and love. Just read the game manual and you'll see it yourself.\n\nThis game becomes a truly place for rest for me, when I leave this dull world and enter the bright, colorful and happy world of Celia's valley, filled with interesting and funny places, characters and monsters (my personal favorite is Fast Mini Bear :) ). Another thing I like about this game is its nonviolent behaviour. Actually, you are not even killing monsters in the normal sense of this word, you are beating 'em so hard, that they just cry and go away :)\n\nAlso, I like the idea of skill tokens and tutors. Instead of endlessly earning XP points, you should find some thing calling a token, that can be exchanged for a new spell or skill. Unfortunately, these tokens are often located in the chests behind powerful bosses :) But sometimes you can just explore the area a little bit to find it.\n\nThe game is filled with interesting small puzzles. For example, in the Sandy Place you should activate the towers in the correct order, and in the Fire Temple you should pull the triggers to prevent yourself from roasting on fire, and so on.\n\nSome bad parts of this game: only one music track for all fights. Not a bad one though, it is humming in my head right now :) Also all monsters are depicted on the map by identical lantern-like sprites. But on the fight screen each monster is of course different and drawn with the same love as the rest of this game. Damn, I just cannot criticize this game, I like it so much :)\n\nOh, and the monsters have different abilities... And you can develop you character to be a warrior or a mage... And you can befriend with the interesting characters and listen to their stories... And so much more!\n\nI hope that this game will be the same flash of light in your life, if you will buy it!\n","August 14, 2015","true","14.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I like the effort the creator put into it, a real labour of love.","June 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"
