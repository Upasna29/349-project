I don't know if they plan to update and add it, but there's little to no diplomacy whatsoever. The AI does diplomacy sometimes (Finland announces it has joined the Communist Bloc! O_o), but you can't. If you play Sandbox with the pre-set alliance disabled (neutral, Allied, Axis), everyone fights everyone. It's still really fun, but I thought I would warn you. This is a combat game, not a diplomacy game!\n\nThere isn't any other reviews yet, as far as I can see, so I thought I'd write a super-quick 10 minutes first impression on launch, so you might be spared the hassle to refund if you don't like it.\n\nFirst things; graphics and sound is very dated. The game does not look pretty in the least. There also is no sound slider, but with the rather sad quality of the audio you might as well mute it.\n\nNow for gameplay. I haven't played enough to find the real depth or tactics yet, of course, but I can say that altough the UI is a bit clunky, the game works well. It seems to be the straightforward WW2 sandbox game I've always wanted. Hearts of Iron is too complex and slow for me, while Risk has too much luck. This is a middlepoint between the two extremes, more towards RISK but without any stupid dice.\n\nWould I recommend it as of now? Yes, yes I would. It's clunky, and looks bad, but you probably already saw that from the pictures. There's a specific type of gamer that would enjoy this, and if you are already looking at the reviews, you probably are that person.\n\n((45 Minutes later edit)) - the AI is pleasingly competent, and I feel there's more than enough depth and content already to justify the price. If you are looking for a milsim game, this is not it. If you want to play Risk with no luck against AI that's surprisingly skilled, this is it.","April 22","true","6.5"," 104 of 122 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","104","122","6","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/338130/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection is a collection of three turn based combat war games including two campaigns and a massive sandbox mode.\n\nLooking at the screenshots Strategy & Tactics looked a little complicated at first and I wasn't sure if it was something I'd love but I gave it a try and I have no regrets. The game is actually easy to learn and the tutorial is very in depth and talks you through everything as you play so you can properly understand what you need to know.\nThere are three separate parts to Strategy & Tactics: World War II, World War II Sandbox and Medieval Wars. World War II has a campaign mode where you battle your way across Europe via multiple missions. Additionally you can play multiplayer skirmishes against the computer or hotseat with a friend with rules which you set yourself. There are also various scenarios for you to try, each with different objectives, map sizes and bots so there is plenty of variation. World War II sandbox mode seems to be the same as World War II skirmishes but on a much grander scale. The whole world participates in one large battle where you can choose your country and whether or not you want to play with alliances. You can then set your objective and start playing. I've actually found this mode to be very intense and exciting rather than the smaller scale battles. In the Medieval Wars you'll take part in the Excalibur campaign where you defend, defeat, and reconquer you way through The War of The Roses. The gameplay is almost identical to World War 2 with the exception of names on areas of the map being different, having different units, different music and a nicer looking in- game interface (though this is just my preference).\n\nIn the campaign modes you'll start with a tutorial which will explain all about units and movements, attacking and supporting, defending, unit health and objectives. I've not found anything important whilst playing that wasn't explained. Once completing the tutorial you'll be faced with your first mission. Each mission has objectives, optional objectives, defeat conditions and the how many turns you can take to get the gold or silver medals for the said mission. You must use your units to secure victory by conquering key points on the map or clearing out enemy soldiers. Some missions have different ways to win and some have just one. Strategy & Tactics is a very combat based game. There is little to no diplomacy in the game and it centres around military victory. You'll start with some units, which vary from ground soldiers, to air support to boats and armoured cars (WWII), and a small amount of territory. Some pieces of territory grant resources whilst you own them and those resources are used to call in reinforcements. These reinforcements can be chosen and dropped at any of the key locations you hold and are very pivotal to winning a game. Though there aren't masses of unit types, what you have gets the job done and stops it from being overcomplicated. As you play through missions you'll earn 'Research points' which can be spent upgrading either your military or science research which in turn will improve things like your soldiers strength or health adding some nice progression and an added incentive to complete the missions within the allotted turns.\n\nThe sandbox mode is a lot more intense choosing to focus on large battle. This time instead of playing on small areas of the map the whole map is opened and every country is involved and starts with multiple units and a section of owned territory. You can choose to have alliances turned on for everyone, off for everyone or off for just the player so you can experience battle three different ways. You can also select one of many different end objectives which vary depending on which country you so it doesn't feel repetitive. There are tons and tons of different scenarios you can set up for yourself by combining these different variables. I would recommend playing some of the campaign modes first so you aren't completely overwhelmed but there is still a tutorial here for those who want to dive right in.\n\nThe graphics and music themselves are very reminiscent of older games and although this doesn't bother me some people might be looking for something a little more refined. The in-game interface is nicer in the Medieval Wars game mode in my opinion at it just looks a little more modern but there isn't much difference.\nI should also mention though having a good amount of campaign/scenarios the developers are planning to add more so the current content will actually increase.\n\nThings that could have been improved are: I think there needs to be a button to move to you unit that still have moves. This isn't an issue early on but as you play more and more and the maps get larger you have to do a lot of looking around to make sure you haven't missed something. It is most prominent in the Sandbox mode where there is a lot going on at once. It'd also be nice for difficulty settings as right now the bots just have one difficulty and it can get pretty challenging, especially if you've not played something like this before. I think steam achievements would be a great addition to the game as there are many different scenarios and campaigns to choose from, it'd be nice to be able to track your progress like that. Lastly I can find no way to move into allied territory in sandbox mode. It may be me doing something wrong but I tried everything. I was playing as Great Britain and ended up trapped on the island because France was an ally and I couldn't move into anywhere they owned.\n\nOverall I think Strategy & Tactics is an awesome combat TBS with plenty of content and very fun gameplay. I've already sunk 3 hours into the sandbox part alone. $10 is a great price for what you get and I think any casual turn based strategy fan should grab it, especially on sale.","April 23","true","6.2"," 75 of 93 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","75","93","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/338130/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2044 products in account","A bang for the buck for turn-based, strategy fans as this collection features three games in one buy!\nGame Overview\nStrategy & Tactics - Wargame Collection is a package of three turn-based strategic games namely "Strategy & Tactics: World War II", "Strategy & Tactics: World War II Sandbox", and "Strategy & Tactics: Medieval Wars".\n\nIn Strategy & Tactics: World War II, you can play as one of the three forces prominent during the World War II which are the "Axis Powers", the "Soviet Union" (USSR), and the "Allied Forces" in each of their respective campaigns.\nThe skirmish mode features tons of maps for you to choose as well as seven (7) scenario-based maps. It also has a hot-seat mode available for you to play 1v1 with either an AI opponent or with your friend.\n\nThe gameplay in Strategy & Tactics: World War II - Sandbox is quite similar with "Strategy & Tactics: World War II", however it showcases a rather single-player style skirmish with AI.\nIn this one, you can pick on the main objective for you to priotize in order to win the game, which of the 39 countries you are going to play as, and the alliance settings for the session.\n\nMedieval Wars: Strategy & Tactics also borrows the game mechanics from the first two games in the pack, but is executed with a different period as it is set on the medieval ages.\nCampaign mode has three (3) armies for you to play as which are the "English Armies" (England), the "French Troops" (France), and the "Crusader Forces". It also has skirmish, hotseat and scenario mode that is similar of the first two games.\n\nAll in all, the games seems to focus on a more combat-oriented strategy rather than a combined gameplay with diplomatic aspects.\n\nThe Pros\nDetailed Tutorial - Having a detailed tutorial is a pretty important aspect especially when it comes to strategic games, may it be new players of the genre or the seasoned ones. Every game of the genre has something that is differently executed than the others, and learning the ropes easily depends on this.\n\nAtmospheric Soundtracks - The soundtracks made for this game really gets the feel and presence of going into a war, which adds to a wholesome game experience and more importantly, the tracks aren't the annoying type that makes you mute them after hearing it repeatedly.\n\nGreat Value - Presenting a price of three (3) games for one is a very enticing offer, and even more if the games deliver to what they offer as advertised. Seeing through the game, it seems that there are more contents to come and it'll definitely be a plus for the game.\nThe Cons\nSimilar Gameplay - Though there might be differences in terms of period setting and some gameplay mechanics that differentiates each of the three, there isn't really anything that makes them standout from one or the other as a whole.\n\nCrude Interface - A thing that really bothers me in every game is when it doesn't have a clean interface to deliver. The font style used for each of the game are somewhat hard to read and is confusing to the eye at the very least.\n\nThe Verdict\nIn terms of overall features, this game goes about what a standard strategic game offers. However, it is good to note that it'll be still updated with more content in the near future and is atleast worth the try to get.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 23","true","3.7"," 67 of 82 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","67","82","2","0"

The UI is very annoying to use, the click-click option for moving armies is really a pain to use. I suggest they'd exclusivley use a click-and-drag instead so nothing gets mixed up in your commands.\n\nDon't pick this up expecting anything realistic, the game is obviously designed to be a fun experience irrelevent of historical accuracy. As a fan of WWII history and strategy, I still enjoyed this game for what it is.\n\nThumbs up for the developers and I hope we see some updates soon.\n\nP.S. Check my guide on this title; it's very helpful for newcomers/casual strategy players.","April 24","true","5.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"

YES please, three good games in one... YOU rock, Strategy and Tactics isn't just a single amazing Strategy game it's three of them.  WOW, you can't top that value three top notch super fun strategy games for a low price... Where do I sign up???   You already know the answer it's this games store page.\n\nThe three games are similar to each other with slight differences, the differences aren't anything major, mainly just the games setting, two of the games are set in World war two, while the third game takes it back old school to the days of Knights and kings..  Great stuff.\n\nStrategy and Tactics World War 2, allows you to play as one of three super powers from the second world war, the Axis, The allies, and the USSR.  The game has loads of skirmish mode maps, and 7 historical scenario based maps.  The game also has a multiplayer mode which I admittedly didn't play, although the single player game was enough to keep me learning and burning..  Lots of fun to play, dominate your enemies and bring them to their knees.\n\nStrategy and Tactics WW 2 Sandbox is almost the same as the non sandbox game, with the difference being it's more open and accessible, you can pick one of 39 countries to pick from, a great mode to kick back and let your old school strategy game playing flag fly.  destroy the world through force or through.... FORCE, bend all he countries to your own personal will..  Are you going to go all out crazy and outlaw crazy mustaches, or maybe you'll ban men from wearing Skirts.. (that won't go over too well in Scotland)  Whatever you choose, this is your option if you want a more open experience that is far more open ended.\n\nStrategy and Tactics Medieval ....  I'm sure you heard the expression, I'm about to go Medieval up in this piece... well this game is just that.  Go back to a point in time when king's sat on their iron thrones, knights patrolled the country sides in search of maidens to rescue and King Arthur pulled the magical sword from the stone..  (Ok I lied about the King Arthur part... I'm a bad boy)  What Medieval does have is 3 historical campaigns, 4 historical scenarios, more skirmish maps than you can shake a stick at.\n\nThree games in one, pick your poison and get ready to rumble because in this game you'll be rumbling and bumbling for sure.\n\nPro's\n3 games in 1 neat package\nAwesome tutorials, let you know just how to crush you enemies\nFun gameplay\nAI that doesn't suck\n\nCon's\nYou get 3 games, but they all have very similar gameplay\nSlightly repetitive game play\npretty bad User Interface\nCould have used a bit more complexity in non combat aspects\n\nRecommendation\nWell Strategy and Tactics won't be the game of the year, what it will do is offer you a chance to play a fun historical strategy game that has just the right difficulty to allow the gamer to feel like the boss, but keeping you on your toes at the same time.   I absolutely found the game to be thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the purchase point.  The few negatives the game has are overshadowed by the positives, and really leave the gamer enthralled by a visceral experience that can keep you entertained for hours on end.  Strategy fans should buy this immediately, it's a quality title, with decent Ai, and fast paced game-play.","April 28","true","6.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

I'm used to playing Axis and Allies, both the Milton Bradley board games as well as the old Nova Games, which was the best...I also play the triplea version, which is excellent. This game is much more in line with the Milton Bradley games. A relatively simple game, simple mechanics. That being said, there are some very nice features that I enjoy. You can plot out moves in a step by step fashion. Moving infantry to take the first territory, then "relocating" mech units into the newly taken territory, and then launching an attack with them into the next. You are not required to to plan out every move for all your troops, they can be executed one at a time. This is definately a "beer and pretzels" kind of game.\nThere are, of course, things that I feel need to be addressed to make this a truly awesome game. And I do believe the potential is there. One of the issues that I saw in other reviews was that there is no diplomacy. Since this game is based on WWII, the sides are pretty much determined. Don't let that stop you from buying this game. However, it is true that you are unable to move your troops through an allies territory. This is quite problematic. England is pretty much handicapped until Germany makes the mistake of taking a coastal province. As long as you don't do that, and there is no compelling reason to do so, you've effectively blocked any invasion from that front. As Germany, you are completely unable to send troops to aid Italy. English and French navies will never combine. Spain is pretty much on its own. Think of it as a first come, first serve kind of war. If I get there before my allies, they are going to have to figure out another way around, and if they get there first...oh well. This is the one thing that I feel needs to be addressed. The war was Axis and Allies...oh, and Russia. Axis and Allies and Russia. Not Germany, an independant state that promised not to attack Italy, Italy, an independant state that promised not to attack Germany, France, an independant state that promised not to attack England, England, an independant state, Romania...etc. Once that gets fixed, I would definately recommend this game. As is, it's enjoyable, just could be better...","May 6","true","35.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For this game has three parts each unfolding a new type of game play, while two of them venturing into the (WWII) era while the third one in to the medieval era. But make no mistake this a TBS gamers delight. The game encircles primarily around Europe in a grand strategy sort of game play,  apart from any major ideological drawbacks.\n\nImagine a World where you are either the allies namely U.S.A. , Britain,  France or the axis namely the Japan, Germany or Italy.Now youre given resources and military supplies based on the amount of resources you have and have been ordered to conquer different parts of the World.(but in a fun sort of way). This game offers exactly that in the sandbox mode. One thing worth mentioning here is that the war is strictly fought over Europe and some parts of Japan. There are key provinces which you must control to win the game. Each province offers some resources (generally 1 crate/gold coin). There are a few provinces in which and in only them can you call your reinforcements. one complaint here is that because of the enourmity of the sandbox mode .Its hard to keep track of all the troops or troop movements in one turn.So it is advised you play the tutorial or the second part of the game first.\n\nThis part is the campaign mode, where you play as any of the (WWII) powers and conquer your enemies provinces one by one.Theres also a bit of cinematics to this part of the game, as you generally see the WWII characters come to life on your screen.Here it is worth mentioning that the music is different for different versions of the base game.How ever they are all superb.\n\nThe music in the third version of the game takes our adventure to the medieval era, where the rules are a bit different. The WWII is nonexistent.Here instead of crates of supplies you gain coins. These coins you use to buy gold from special provinces marked with a small camp sign. how ever it is worth mentioning here that, the amount of resources you generate each turn is limited and is proprtional to the amount of area you control of the map.\n\nThe game play overall is smooth and and its a very fun game for strategy and tactical game fans. You get to call in all the units of each era in each era you play in a time specific manner. There are special citadel structure on the map,  on special provinces that gives defensive bonuses. In each missions depending on the era you can earn bouses like research points , that unlocks new advantages in millitary or industry. Or medals which grant bonuses. but to achieve these you must fionish the game in a limited number of turns. It is also noteworthy that in each game you start off with a limited amount of land. The game has many pros and relatively no cons, but to mention a few.\n\nPROS\n\n+ The game has three different versions in one complete game.\n+ The price for this three games are of that of one\n+ Sound strategy sanse and tactical sense implemented in this game\n+ Tons of units from each era present in the game namely horseman,longbow man,tanks,aircrafts,motorized vehicles to\nname a few\n+ Sound music in all three versions of the game\n+ Self explanatory tutorials which are fun\n+ Fun tech tree specially in campaign mode\n\nCONS\n\n_The sand box mode needs to be gotten used to, else theres a feeling of nausea with every turn end\n\nAll in all its a 7/10 game,owing to its low price tag. The game is a must have for a strategy game fan who likes turn based gameplay and tactics.","May 9","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In this game you can pick from a WW2 style or medival style board game type. I played the WW2 sandbox and you would think that would be awsome. But there is no telling what is going on. In the game I played recently I was Spain. I thought I would have a little bit of diplomacy, nothing major but something like "Start a war" or "Peace" but no, The game chooses your side. If you are Spain you are Axis, flanked by the French, the Americans and Protugal (Sorry for the misspelling) and whats worse is that there is no way around this. THere is no "I want peace" button. You are at war against everyone thats an ally. This makes it terribly confusing because before that happened, I thought I was my own country, not on a set team. Whats the money? Supply. Each turn and depending on how many cities you have, you get Supply. This is used to purchase troops and develop research. Not bad, fairly simplistic but not bad. Except when you factor in that all the stuff that is worth anything at all is 100+ supply. When you purchase a unit, depending on how expensive it is, they have a strength number. If it is at a twelve, it is a full army. There is also a health system in the game where if you lose all your health, the units die. There is naval and air but those are the same things unless bombing with aircraft or ships which is by a slider. Thats it. The game's idea isn't bad at all. I like Risk and I love board games. But this game does it all wrong with AI that I swear cheats because as Spain, I was spending money trying to scrounge up troops while the US has armies of 12 all over the place as well as the French did as well at least five turns in. The game also doesn't teach you everything in the game. I had a difficult time figuring out what goes with what.

(It's free as app so kinda disappointing)\nSo I buyed this game for 10 Euro and launched it, it's not very big so the download was very short.\nThe Menu starts in window mode and looks cheap, but hey you have a 2nd game called Mediavel Wars..\nI never asked for that but ok, need to test that out soon.\nYou can also play the sandbox mode, which is in my opinion the best, or the 'Missions' mode.. but with limited nations.\n40fps lock and sometimes even less than 30fps (I have a gtx960 and a 3.80ghz amd processor)\n..hmm ok, not optimized for PC I guess, but still playable.\nThe GameplayYou will find yourself most of the time thinking about your troop management, wether attacking a zone, spending points for new units or the tech tree, or maybe retreat and build up a defence.\nSo the 40fps lock doesn't really matter.\nBeginning with a nation like Germany may require more skill, since germany is surrounded from France, Russia and the UK..\nRussia is much easier, russian bias confirmed ;)\nThe action is very slow, because you can move units only 1 zone, except vehicles and planes. So for some1, who doesn't like slow strategy games is that not the best game.. You should play then Supreme Commander 2.\nNeed for improvementEvery time you end your round, begins my most hated part of this game. Watching ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI moving Tanks from Zone A to Zone B and then back to Zone A just to ♥♥♥♥ me as a human is annoying and when nations like russia or germany do that is this the hell, because they have so many units and space to do their ♥♥♥♥.\nBut the devs were so friendly and give us the possibility to skip that ♥♥♥♥, but hey... you just need to wait for the bot to calculate what the AI is doing, may take 10-15 sec for every round you're ending(30-50 for 1 game?) and you don't know at the beginning of your turn that Germany slaughtered Switzerland meanwhile, hmm\n\n\nWould I recommend you this game?\nYes\nBUT, they really need to add a World War mode.... You can only play in europe? OH DID NO ONE TELL YA THAT?!\nAsia? nope and USA has only ~5 Zones in Europe and is weaker than Poland?","May 30","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
