If I accidentally pass near a large group, I end up in a boring cycle of of running, hitting, running, hitting, picking off enemies one by one until the group is small enough to take on directly.  I don't mind that enemies chase you, but maybe have them split off and start fighting each other again after a while.\n\nAs for the good:\n\n- Combat is awesome.  Feels very tight and responsive despite being simple.\n- Gore effects are great.\n- Physics feels satisfying!\n- Interesting concept with promise of more maps to come!\n\nOverall I'd totally still recommend the game, and I imagine the kinks will be worked out over the next few updates.","October 26, 2015","true","20.4"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","65","69","6","0"

Muscular? Fat? Armored? Who knows.\nEDIT: The new bodytypes are Muscular and armored. With Tank Top Prisoners and the Buff Boss being Muscular, and the Riot Helm guards being armored.\n\nThe Review\nPaint the Town Red is a medium-paced bar fighting game with a large variety of weapons and enemies now and here to come. It still needs a bit of optimization, but the devs assure us that the game will be optimized as the game progresses (And updates.)\n\nThe enemies are completely destructible. You could dissolve someone if you have enough time and the weapon doesn't break. All the voxels on the enemies have different properties, with bone being the strongest natural voxel and skin being the weakest. (You will be able to damage Riot Helmets later on, but those aren't natural.) Additional fact, is that if a enemy's brain is damaged in anyway, they will instantly die, if they don't, its a bug.\n\nThe weapons range from messy steaks and urinal cakes, to Katanas and Shotguns. All of them have different durability, damage, throw damage, voxel damage, and maybe even a unique trait, such as being able to instantly stun someone if you hit them in the head area with Soap or a Urinal cake. Example of a enemy being stunned in utter disgust with a Urinal cake.[gfycat.com] (You do not need to directly aim for the mouth to stun the enemy, and you can stun a enemy with any blunt weapon if you hit them in the face, though it is random.)\n\nThe combat is quite intense as it is mostly melee combat, you can do overhead and right side swings and normal attacks. You can also kick of which knockback power and damage depends on how full the bar is. Full means a guaranteed knockdown. (Knockback has not been implemented yet.) Throwing damage, speed and range also depend on the bar level. But if you sit ontop of the bar throwing mugs at people, you aren't playing the game right.\n\nExtending on the Combat subject, if you damage a enemy enough, they will go into a enraged mode dealing extra damage, having extra speed and attack speed.\n\nIf you are having problems with FPS, look at the low performance section of the "Common Issues" thread I linked above. Otherwise, the game runs quite well when you select the appropriate options for your machine. (In game options.)\n\nI rate PTTR (Paint the Town Red.) 9/10.\n\nPositives:\n-Fun Combat.\n-Great Mechanics.\n-Active Developers.\n-Very Friendly Community.\n-Relatively fast updates when they're not working on bigger things. (1-2 Monthly big updates, weekly small updates.)\n\nSmall Negatives.\n-Still needs a bit of optimization. (The Disco Dancefloor.)\n-A bit of bugs, not necessarily gamebreaking, but immersion breaking.\n-Rare crashes.\n\nThis is most of the information ive gathered so far. Thank you for reading this review.\n\n\nP.S.\n\nJust a minor thing, this isn't mean't to be a shooter game, yes there is a Shotgun and upcoming Coop multiplayer, but there won't be a gun every level, Or driveable tanks and helicopters. We're not gonna shoot down Cargo Planes with nuclear warheads, could you imagine the optimization then?\n\nWe are fighters, not soldiers of fortune.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themasterofderp/recommended/337320/","themasterofderp","TheMasterOfDerp | Sleeping","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themasterofderp/","67 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVideo version\n\nI find Paint The Town Red to be so much fun I actually have questioned a couple times whether this game has brought out some dark, deep-seated psychotic side in me. This is, without a doubt, the most entertaining beat-em'-up I have ever played. The combination of wacky yet semi-realistic physics, pixelated brutality (in impressive detail for a pixelated game), sheer amount of action taking place all around you at once, the amount of ways to beat the absolute sh*t out of people, and some of the most satisfying blows I have ever delivered unto another person, makes this, as I said, the most fun beat-em-up I have ever played. Allow me to, later on, go into more detail on most of these points.\n\nThere are only three levels out right now (Bar, Disco, Prison) as well as a sandbox level, as of this review. However, the developers seem committed to this game, and I am insanely jittery to see new maps being released at some point. Imagine a gym/wrestling ring, city block, mansion, fairground, subway...a bit of Gang Beasts comes to mind when thinking of levels that could be added to this game. And, as those new levels come out, hopefully along with even more weapons, character models, etc., I will be pouring WAY more time into this game than my current 9-10 hours shows, as of this review.\n\nThe way the blunt weapons, such as the bat or the baton, smack into your enemies' temples, causing copious and comical amounts of blood to spurt continuously from their face, and then having the next hit warranting their entire face to crumble into chunks as their body crumples to the ground(yes, this actually happens sometimes. I'll explain later), delivers, as I stated, some of the most satisfying combat and victories I have ever seen in ANY type of game.\n\nThe game isn't very far from the truth at all when it states you can use pretty much anything not nailed down to take out your opponents. Hell, in the prison levels, you can rip off the shower nozzles and use them as a weapon. YOU CAN THROW APPLES AT PEOPLE. I HAVE KILLED PEOPLE WITH APPLES. I HAVE PUT DENTS IN PEOPLE'S FOREHEADS WITH F***ING APPLES. THINK ABOUT THAT.\n\nThe amount of action going on around you for most of the fight, as you work to take out every other living being in whatever building you are dropped into, makes for a constant adrenaline rush as you uncontrollably spout profanities at the various enemies tromping towards you, weapons in hand. You are never safe until every last being is taken out, and, very much like in a real fight, you have to always look behind you to make sure someone is actually dead (even with the signature snare sound that plays whenever someone is dead, you still can miss a few people), or to make sure someone hasn't spotted you and started stalking you with their only goal being to cave your head in until they can use it for eating Ramen.\n\nThe physics have multiple chances each brawl to showcase their realism and their wackiness, depending on the scenario. Especially with the "hard hitter" match modifier, kicking people with a full "kick" bar (or whateverthef*** it's called) sends them flying across the map, hitting the roof sometimes (not exaggerating) or getting booted up to a higher floor. In other scenarios, the way some of the weapons bounce off the walls, or the way an enemy will crumple to the ground or fall onto their @ss after a particularly hard hit with a bat, will add to the satisfaction of taking someone out in a more realistic fashion.\n\nThe gore in this game is certainly something that I did not see coming, at least not to the extent that it turned out to be. This is strangely one of the most violent games I have ever played. I had no idea until I started beating someone's face in with a tire iron the first time that you can literally TAKE APART someone. Their entire bodies are destructible. Every pixel. And each pixel is colored in to resemble flesh, bone, muscle, or brain. To a pretty accurate degree, given the size of the pixels. You can chop off arms at any area, not just joints (I think), same with legs. You can decapitate people (sometimes VERY cleanly, which will leave you saying "OOOOOOHH SHITBISCUITS" or something at least that's what I would say shut up). You can even curb stomp a f***er until his pixelated brain is showing. This game is brutal in the most comical and satisfying of ways.\n\nAllow me to, off the top of my head, list every weapon in this game. As they come to mind. Beer bottle, cup, cleaver, knife, machete, kitana, pool cue, pool ball (cube), toothbrush shiv, basketball, shower nozzle, frying pan, slab of meat (yes, really), soap (YES, REALLY), money ("I am sad that I lack the talent to make this sh*t up" -Jontron), tire iron, bat, dumbbell, barbell, barbell weights (small and heavy), barbell pole, ham (I'm done), lunch tray, apple, orange, various chairs, nunchaku (hidden), shuriken (hidden), lightsaber (only in sandbox level currently), guitar, shotgun (hidden). Not all of these can be found in each level, however, each level is of decent size and packed with weapons. Imagine more levels with MORE weapons to be found depending on what new levels we get.\n\nNow, before I go to my conclusion, I do need to tell that another part of what makes this game so satisfying is that it is surprisingly difficult at times. Like stated before, if you don't watch your back constantly, a couple blows to your head with most weapons will kill you just as easily as the next guy. Not only that but it can be very easy to get surrounded or in a corner if you don't know your surroundings well. Most of what makes this game difficult are reasons that can be attributed to fighting in real life. Not only this, but there are also "boss"-esque characters in each level, that don't come out to attack you right away. For example, the boxer in the bar level basement, who takes a POUNDING and can take you down with 4-5 punches. Even when it comes to a normal dude, though, a few hits with a bottle, a couple slashes with a machete, etc., and you're down and out, and you have to restart. This game has managed to literally make me jump when I forget to watch my back and I turn around to leave a room and there's a big brolic black dude named Requis ready to skullf**k me.\n\nThe game is so addicting, though, that you can't really give a lot of a sh*t if you wanted to. Especially since you have the ability to combat this difficulty with magical powers of blowing people up (yes, really). You have a bar in the top left that charges up as you beat the sh*t out of people, and as of this review, there are three powers you can choose from. The first that gets unlocked is "Shockwave", which releases a ring of kaboom-y juice around you that throws enemies back, across the entire room in some cases. It's good for when you get in a tight situation, but it doesn't do much damage. The second power is "Berzerk", which turns the game into slo-mo, and you have the ability to one-shot MOST enemies with your fists, and see their heads/bodies/wherever you hit them explode into a bloody pulp. This helps if you have a lot of guys following you and you need a break. The final ability is "Smite", which allows you to make a gun shape with your hand, point at people, and have some otherwordly power bring holy, explod-y, bloody death to their entire body at the click of the mouse. This is good for taking out bigger enemies as well as just taking out a large group of people. It's great in general.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is hilarious, brutal, satisfying, addicting, and a time-waster all rolled into one. It can also be a very good stress-reliever. I cannot recommend Paint The Town Red enough, and I really hope the devs stick to this game for weeks and weeks to come, adding new stuff to it as often as possible. Delicious things could come to this game in the future.\n\nDelicious things. <3","February 19","true","25.2"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","96","48","50","15","0"

You wake up late and rush to work. Of course you’re stuck in traffic. Great. You arrive at work , too late, and you get fired. On your way home your car dies for no apparent reason. Literally everything has gone wrong today and you have this urge … this urge to …\nPAINT THE TOWN RED!\n\nStoryThere’s no apparent story. You can make your own.\nWhat we do know is that you’re in control of a bad ♥♥♥, one could even say, Chuck Norris.\n\nBut other than that the game’s focus isn’t story driven in case you were wondering.\n\nGameplayPaint The Town Red runs pretty smooth. I haven’t encountered any apparent problems or bugs other than enemies ignoring me just because I’ve turned the water on in the public bathroom and decided to jump onto the sink. They just looked at me in disgust, while they were severely bleeding and looking at me with hatred in their eyes. Couldn’t care less to be honest.\n\nAnyway. Paint The Town Red is a truly chaotic, first person, voxel based melee combat game. You’ll fight your way through different time zones and locations.\nThe default level is a classy one. It’s a Biker Brawl in Bitter City.\nIt’s tuesday, february 4th in 1992. One man vs the world. Well vs the everyone in the bar.\n\nThe next level is a truly funky one. It’s Saturday Fight Fever and boy it’s on!\nOn sunday , june 11th 1978, you’ll get just a tad too funky.\n\nSo you see you have a unique location and enemies through out the levels.\n\nThe goal is to beat the ever living shi … well is to pain the town read. That means that you have to defeat every enemy in the location.\nYou might wonder how? Well however you want! That’s the true beauty of the game.\nYou can use cups, a stool, a chair, a knife, a guitar … literally everything that’s lying around or being held by someone. A dude has a bottle that you want? Kick him in the face and send him flying because that’s your bottle! You want a knife? See those chefs over there? Just beat them till they drop it.\nYou can kick, jump, stab, punch, throw, block … You can do so much. Hell if you want you can watch some people fight to the death if you’re tired or need a break.\n\nEventually you’ll run into an enemy that you can’t kill that easily. Lucky you! You’ve found a boss.\nThose guys are just a tad tougher but fear not! You have more power than them. I’m not kidding you literally do have powers. There’s a blue bar in the upper left that fills with each enemy that has been defeated and there’ll be a message on the screen once a power’s fully charged. So let’s talk about the fun stuff.\n\nFor example the shockwave! As the name implies you’re able to slam your knuckles together to create a shockwave that’ll send enemies flying. Best to be used if you find yourself in a tight spot.\n\nNext up is Berserk! Boy that’s a bloody good one! Everything slows down and you turn into a one-hit-one-kill killing machine. Seriously. If you punch their head like once it just explodes. Kick the enemies and you obliterate them. Bloody good fun! Literally!\n\nLast but not least is a truly god like ability … Smite. No not the game. That’s pronounced SMITE you doofus. I mean smite!\nWell you point with your finger at someone and then you smite them. Basically a blueish light will shine on them and, as the name implies, smite them. Best part about it? You can use that from any distance. Not to mention you get to play god for a few seconds before your power runs out.\n\nOverall the gameplay is bloody good fun!\n\nVisualsLove it or hate it. The game’s using a voxel-based art style. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, to be quite honest I never thought I’d like it, but I did quite enjoy it. Might also because of the dumb faces some enemies make while they’re trying to kill you. Or because you’ve cut the cheek off as you can see here\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534527650\nOne of the good things about the art style is that it doesn’t look too serious. To be honest I found it quite hilarious to see a guy running around with half his skin shed from his head and showing all the world his magnificent white skull!\nNot to mention you can even chop off the arms of your enemies.\nThere’s just so much good stuff to see and I think that the voxel approach was a good idea\n\nAudioCan’t say too much about that. The music and the sound effects are quite good but nothing outstanding. My favorite track might the Funktown. Just sounds funky … Duh!\n\nAnimated GIF ReplayBy far the best feature in the game. It allows you to create GIF just by clicking two things.\nCreate GIF -> Upload gf to Gfycat -> ? -> Profit.\nYou can easily capture your best kills or funny moments and just upload them and easily show your friends. Or you can just brag at how awesome you are in the game.\nSeriously this addition makes the game just so much better and I think that it was a splendid idea.\nI’ve already used this feature to no ends and I don’t see myself ever stopping!\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Paint The Town Red in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nIt’s fun. It’s bloody fun.\nI’m not going to lie folks but at the beginning I thought to myself: What’s the point?\nBut then I just found myself immersed into the game and was busy to literally Paint The Town Red and to just enjoy my killing spree. The enemies are challenging and easy at times but overall it’s just good. No to mention it does run really good considering that it’s an early access title. No to mention the possibility to easily create gifs. Such a good option seriously.\n\nOverall I can only recommend this game. It’s just one of those games that you start up when you had a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day and guess what? You’ll find yourself in a better mood in a matter of minutes.\nGet it folks. It’s worth it.","October 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 67 of 82 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","67","82","11","6"

But unfortunately keeping distance and throw various objects at your opponents is way to easy to win such a brawl... I had more fun, running into the crowd, hit them down and crushing their stupid heads. Okay, I admit it is good in satisfy my sadistically root.\nI was impressed how the damage model of the figures looks like; Every person in the game has skin and a full skeleton, it is possible to literally shred one to the bone. And of course you can decapitate them and chop their limps. In combination of blood (which’s certainly not overused) this is one of the most brutal games I had to play for years. The only thing I miss here are some painfully screams or angry shouts, to indicate more that those blocky figures are living beings... (I suddenly realize in which way I'm leading this review... I better go on with the maps...)\n\nThere are 3 complete maps right now, a fourth exists as a sandbox level where you can test AI and weapons and so on...\nEvery one of them (those three) comes with at least one unique boss with more HP and generally a personal weapon.\nI will present them in a short list of information:The Bar\nIt is the easiest of all because of its sheer amount of objects laying around, such as chairs, glasses and plates, or a billiard queues as long ranged toothpicks (for eyes). I don't remember any particular highlights in this one, except that you can hit a rock band with its own instruments. A boxer and some cooks provide variety.\nThe Disco\nThis place is crowded, really! You don't have much space so step onto the dance floor and do what this game is all about.\nIn my opinion this is the hardest map of all three, most likely because of a Yakuza gang and their boss who 's endurance in person and a worthy opponent with his samurai sword. The best way to stay alive is to use hidden weapons such as Shuriken and Nunchakus.\nThe Prison\nMy most favorite map. You got a huge variety of objects; food, weights, barbells, shower heads, tasers, etc. and people who use them...\nIn this level you can see the wonderful love in detail that was put in. You can even be friends with a high-builded muscular prisoner, who helps you during the fight.\nI hope more maps are incoming shortly... but at least you can have lots of fun with the existing.\nI've also read there's a level editor with Steam-Workshop incoming, maybe it can bring some more variation.\n\nBut there's a little thing I want to criticize here; By killing people you earn points which can be sold in weather a shockwave, slow-motion with increased damage and an instant-kill- attack, available for a few seconds...\nBut why this? This is killing the atmosphere of a brutal and unreasonable fight. It is not a big thing because it's optional, but because it's still available urges you to use it. This makes the game too easy... remember when I called it a challenging experience in the first place? Maybe I was wrong by that.\nI do not demand, that this should be put out of the game, no, certainly not, but rather an option tool that disables it.\n\nUnfortunately there's no really good soundtrack behind the game, but I don't even miss one at this point, because of... uhm... metal-reasons.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice- /Performance: Good -> 10 bucks is absolutely alright, if you are able to try out the levels more as once, you won't waste your money. Also a good gift option, but make sure the person you send it to has a computer that's good enough... there are still some performance issues so take a look on the system requirements!\n\nRating: Good -> A fun time brawler with great map design, I highly anticipate more to come out!","January 21","true","5.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","26","27","6","4"

It's you and your blocky fists against many other blocky men in an orgy of blood and violence. Voxel violence.\n\nBlows landed will bruise, cut, break, and dismember your enemies, spilling their square blood onto whatever surface is nearby. Anything and everything is a weapon. Bar stools, steak, bottles, afro combs, shuriken, bats, pimp canes... really, the list goes on. Nothing will stand in your way once you unleash your god-like special powers. Stack enough bodies and unleash shockwaves, pop men like balloons using nothing but your fists, and finally, call down the wrath of God and literally smite your enemies, reducing men into lifeless piles of wasted carbon.\n\nThe three levels available as of this writing are fun and colorful, bursting with personality and secrets, and they include:\n-A biker bar where everyone wants to take a bite out of you\n-A Saturday-night beatdown at the local disco\n-A maximum security prison where dropping the soap is the least of your worries\nThere's even a sandbox level to play around with or to learn the finer points of Paint the Town Red.\n\nDo I recommend this?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kwertyuiop/recommended/337320/","Kwertyuiop","Kwertyuiop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kwertyuiop/","326 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis amazingly unique and gory game is like Hotline Miami in first person. It uses voxel gore that's procedurally generated for extreme "holy ♥♥♥♥ I just, like, scalped a guy." The game's enemies have layers, an outer one with textures and faces, an inner muscle layer of blocks, the skeleton and their head has a brain inside. The game is... Extremely brutal. It's a bar fight simulator, essentially, but it will soon branch out into a prison riot level and maybe even more varied things after that. You can grab basic weapons Dead Rising style, such as weak chairs, bottles, plates or mugs. You can go into some hidden-ish areas and find more formidable weapons, such as the kitchen of the biker bar and kill the chefs to take their meat cleavers and knives, break open the safe of the biker gang leader and take his spare tire iron, steal the band's mic stand or even take a katana from the owner of the Yakuza controlled disco club. As it is, this game is worth the 10 schmeckles but there's one good thing that you won't notice unless you get to the community hub ASAP. These guys made Probably Archery, a funish YouTuber bait game made for a game jam. Imagine that game, 3 times more complete, and the devs gave it weekly updates. Since its extremely recent release, the devs have given the game a few updates and are active with the community, responding on the subreddit (reddit*com/r/paintthetownred), and in the community hub. They talk about their future plans, development, bug reports and suggestions from players. It's clear a lot of care and work went into this game, even in its very unfinished state. In the interest of honesty, take the following opinion lightly because I am easily swayed. I've been burned before on early access games (Starforge, *hopefully not* Medieval Engineers, and I don't remember if Signal Ops or Redshirt were Early Access but you get the idea) and I preorder games a lot, some of which come back to bite me (GTA V, Batman Arkham Origins, Watch_Dogs) but this game is being made by the most trustworthy developers I've ever seen since Godd Howard unveiled Fallout 4. Which is a short time, but these guys are comparable to Bethesda and the amazing looking job the did with Fallout 4 and whatever that doesn't matter here. These devs are communicative, which is a rare trait these days and I would give them 10 dollars for the first level of this game, let alone the other one and the upcoming sandbox and prison riot levels.\n\nPROS:\nAmazingly fun, yet simple gameplay. Melee features jabs/stabs with fists/objects, or powerful sideswiping attacks. You can throw your fists and you can throw objects. Devs plan to add very rare guns later on, it's not a gun based game.\nIncredible gore system, imagine if the Minecraft world you've most destroyed was a person's face.\nResponsive and trustworthy developers.\nIngame idiot proof gif maker, automatically records the last 15-10ish seconds of gameplay and can make a gif in the folder of your choice.\nA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and there's 2 levels about to be released, consider it an investment.\nOn that note, the price is fair for what you get if you're easily entertained by bashing a man's skull in with a tire iron (I know I am), otherwise there's gonna be more content for you /r/patientgamers who want more bashing for their buck.\n\nCONS:\nPoorly optimized game. I won't pretend to know how games are made, but it seems like the lighting is the culprit. Maybe. I don't know, I don't even know if the game is optimized well or poorly. I do know, however, that the game is reported as lagging for a ton of people and my 4.5/10 system (BF4 all low settings at 1080p gets me 50ish smoothish fps) can't handle this without 1/4 resolution textures (because the 1/8 resolution smallest size ones are awful), lowest settings and 1368x768 resolution. Then I get 60ish fps, very spikey and the dance floor of the disco is a 10-20 zone.\n\nThat is quite literally my only fault with the game and I don't mind the lower resolutioon, the game is stylistically ugly anyway. Overall 10/10 for me, it's one of my favorite games and you should get it.","November 2, 2015","true","9.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","27","31","5","0"

But here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-When you throw the katana is goes through people, fun like hell\n-The Pimp Cane Exploded the body part you hit, A but unrealistic but I don't give a damn\n-If you're into blood this game has a lot of it, Even for punching\n-The bosses make you panic and try to survive\n-The levels are fun and there are many ways to kill someone\n-There are powers that makes the game more easier for you and twice as fun\n\nCons\n-Sometimes when you throw the katana through a certain amount of people, It begin's to think it's stuck inside someone, so it slides against the ground forever\n-If you feel nausous seeing blood that is not real or decapicated people this is not for you\n-Sometime's it takes too long to kill a boss and it gets boring after a while\n-The NPC's Swing slowly, You swing when you click the mouse, They swing when you're not moving for 20 seconds\n-Its easy to beat the levels if you don't pick a fight with the bosses of the levels\n\nOverall, Its a great game. I see no issues with this and if there are any I am sure they are minor and easily removable/fixable and or improvable. My grammar is bad but I recommend buying it. The Developer is nice enough to add levels occasionally, He is currently adding a prison level so.

At first I was like:\n"yeeeah, another voxel stylized FPS game, like there's not enough of them". But then I watched the trailer and I was really stunned. Both the body damage system and the gore in this game are just one f*cking huge "wow". You can actually punch enemies through their skin literally so hard that you will reveal bones, brains, intestines and so on! Like, that's pretty nasty, but so damn cool, since this a melee based brawl game. And the view of enemies running around, fighting with their skulls and bones sticking out and bleeding at the same time is just priceless. What's even better, everything is a weapon. You can literally even beat your enemies to death with a f*cking steak or a bundle of cash. Even at the disco level, you can take a comb from the other dude's afro and stab him to death with it! I mean like, there are only 2 levels at this state (they are huge though), but the devs will add more, and more, and more, and more. There will also be a WorkShop and mod support in the future, and a multiplayer, which is awesome too.\n\nUpdate 19/10/2015\n\nThe devs have released an update yesterday, which fixes the performance for the older GPU's. I have tested this update on my second, older PC, and the game ran better than before. I recommend turning off soft shadows, for even better performance on the old PC's. Good job with this update, devs.\n\nUpdate 28/10/2015\n\nAnother update, enhancing the performance, adding better options menu, no new levels. Game actually runs better now, good job again dev!\n\nUpdate 06/11/2015\n\nMajor performance update. More graphics options, dynamic settings preset feature added, ability to crouch was added, new level added - although it's just a sandbox test level. Stats will now display at the end of each level and game runs now even smoother than before. Keep 'em coming.\n\nRating and why:\n\n17/10/ 2015  8/10  - Fun, addicting, awesome gore system, only 2 levels, AI needs to improve","October 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

I have a new map suggestion.\n\nMy idea is a high rise office map. There would be new weapons like computer screens, rulers etc. You could kick the office worker npcs out of the big glass window. The story of the level would be you were fired, and wanted to cause a fight. At the end, you would escape down an elevator. The boss of the level would be the "Boss", and he would have a large 1m metal ruler that would work like the katana. I feel this level would add lots of novelty to the game.\n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot to add the fact that there would be those makshift office walls, that can be kicked down and destroyed.

The basic concept of organic cuboid gore and the wide variety of tools at the player's disposal from release have made the existing product a good example of an early access game.\n\nSo far the only given objective is to kill everyone, in the spirit of notable stylistic cousin Hotline Miami.\nThe Hotline comparisons are thick on the floor, save for the damage model and backstory. You can take multiple hits, as can foes, depending on what you hit them with and where. Reactions to those injuries are lacking somewhat, and multiple times  found myself wondering how the thug I'd just disfigured was continuing his assault unflinching with a face full of broken glass and chair splinters. The story is 'missing' - nothing is told to us, yet the title screen suggests we're either reliving memories or outright time traveling to sort history out one beatdown at a time, a far cry from Hotline's well buried and confusing world. (Not that all games need War and Peace for a backdrop of course)\n\nThe technical flaws it has so far are fairly usual for a Unity game in early development; framerate inconsistency, laptop processors having trouble, occasional clipping errors and a lack of in-depth settings currently sit on the game's shoulders, and are never shy about asking for your chips. At times,(usually when re-enacting the elevator scene from 'Driver') Voxel bloodspurts are so voluminous that the framerate chokes on those too.\nThe AI feign ignorance at times, but they always know where you are, and it can lead to a 'Conga of death' where half the level's population will seek you out and swarm you for an unseen bathroom murder.\nOh, one other thing, you can rebind the controls, but the main menu isn't the place to do it for some reason. You must currently be in a level to get the option to adjust control methods.\n\nPVE multiplayer has been hinted by the Developers as on the horizon, and it would be welcomed, as will the mass of patches that will undoubtedly invalidate this review.","October 27, 2015","true","23.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There is lots of gore, if you're into that stuff. The gore is a bit unique when compared to other games, or actually a lot. I mean, you've probably seen a head get busted and blow into bits... But HALF a head?\nThere is actually no story in the current version, as of 10/21/2015. The enemies don't immediatley attack you, giving you an opportunity to plan your approach in some levels. Attacking one of them would trigger the other enemies to attack other NPCs and you, just so they have something cool to do, while you're in the midst of combat. There are some destructable elements in the game other than people. Currently, in the bar level, on the second story, the rails may come off. More destructable objects in the game that could actually hurt the NPCs would be more fun, because basically, other than the railing breaking, that is it.\nWeapons in the game though. You can nail people with pool marbles, stools, even steaks. Anything that you can grab, it's yours to fight with, so be creative with your killing.\nYour character has power. Literally. Killing people will give you them. (Don't try this in real life though) If you're in a tight spot, just hold "R" and choose a move. There's a shockwave, which sends your enemies flying quite like unrelenting force. It's not very lethal, but can come to your aid when you're surrounded by enemies. Berserk power will obliterate anyone you hit. Smite power allows you to do some laser thingy which also obliterates your enemies, if you click on them. In all, I think that Paint the Town Red is a game worth buying. It may be a little limited now, but soon the kind and god-like developers will soon add more content. (NPC relationships would be find. I help this guy in a fight, and the next person he wants to punch is me?)","October 21, 2015","true","28.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The gore was awesome, the gameplay was awesome, and the level design was awesome. I really think you should buy this game. At it's current state, there are only 4 levels: The biker bar, the disco, the prison, and the Pirate Cove. I beat them all and I only put in 2 hours in total from playing all of those levels in no rush. But the game is highly replayable so I still think you should get it. But maybe wait for a better discount like $5.00 maybe. The $8.00 I spent was kinda worth it, but at least I'm supporting the devs by paying more then the amount I would have liked to pay.\n\nOverall I think I'll give it a 9/10.

Or, don't.\nTL:DR - I write about how good it is. Give my suggestion, yadda, yadda...\n\nThis is a great game, has a whole lot of potential. Reminds me of a Quentin Tarantino movie. It may look like a crappy Indie game, well because it IS, but as for me and my opinion... I like it. My reasons for liking this great garbage gem of an early access indie game is simply that I like beating the pixles out of aggressive box-headed  npcs that bleed/spew vovel blood everwhere. You can even slice apart every limb and face (the whole head has a "skin" layer) with items that are (hidden at some times) around the place. The all around idea is quite fun to blow off stress with, seriously. Now for the list of things and features they have going at the moment. Its not very much but still a solid framework game, even with the weird box-headed npcs.\n\nGood mentions of what they have...\n\nA great gore system and hit reaction on npcs that is both fun and comedic.\n\nAs of right now there are 3 powers. Shockwave, Berserker, and Smite. Two of them slow time down. (Berserker and Smite slow time)\n\nSome throwable furniture, like some chairs can be chucked at them.\n\nSome, but not a lot of weapons. Katana is really fun in my opinion.\n\nVery moddable and simple looking base. Looks like it would be perfect for beginners to mess around in. (Workshop would be cool.)\n\nExtra Options, like infinite power and one hit kills. Random weapons too!\n\nCombat system is okay, but could have a little more to it.\n\nGlitches with items breaking, and clipping. Why is this a good thing? Have you seen a chair go mach 10 and smash into a npc? Yeah, thats why. The ragdoll effect is funny.\n\nLayers of damage! Yeah npc bodies have a meat layer all the way to a skeleton. You can hack away all the way to bone... Which is quite inventive, and kind of disturbing.\nSome of the bad...\n\nNothing to do exept hit people. This can make it get boring quick. (Although, it is early access.)\n\nNot a whole lot of items to use. They're fun, don't get me wrong just kind of repetivite with some.\n\nNeeds more fixes in some of the UI, hopefully will be fixed on release. It looks like it could be a browser game with the fonts. Main Menu needs more work.\nMy Suggestions\n\nAdding more game modes. Like an escape game mode, you have to fight your way through to escape to the goal.\n\nAdding more weapons. Throwing npcs who are down. (Guns? I saw the shotgun.)\n\nMore "extra" options to choose from. Like never ending enemy spawn on a map.\n\nSome sort of Multiplayer.\n\nBigger maps.\n\nMaybe some helpful npcs? Passive ones to help you when you are being crowded? Like the prison one could have it where you're the guard and you have to beat down the rioting prisioners.\n\nModding Tools. Map Modding Tools. Workshop.\n\nMissions/Goals. Like beat this many type of people, or only throwing kills. Rewards can be like extra special options.\n\nA story? I don't know if it really needs one, but heck I would be interested on what they got.\n\nFall Damage/Limb Stress. I think kicking a npc off the 2nd floor or down stairs should yeld some extra damage to their body.\nThats all, thanks for reading all of that. Really, I would have stopped half way and just agreed that the game has some good times in it. I just hope they add more, it has a great outline.\n\nStill here? Okay... Eyy, have a text dawg.\n╥━━━━━━━━╭━━╮━━┳\n╢╭╮╭━━━━━┫┃▋▋━▅┣\n╢┃╰┫┈┈┈┈┈┃┃┈┈╰┫┣\n╢╰━┫┈┈┈┈┈╰╯╰┳━╯┣\n╢┊┊┃┏┳┳━━┓┏┳┫┊┊┣\n╨━━┗┛┗┛━━┗┛┗┛━━┻","February 8","true","7.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","3"

In fact, a zombie mode would be perfect in a game with this much gore. The zombies could be dismembered and still live until you bash their heads enough, Also, the AI seems to focus on the player to the extent that massive hordes of guys all come after you instead of attacking each other. This is especially evident in the Priseon level. In that level, why do guards attack each other? There should be some kind of smart AI system. So far so good. Can't wait for the coming updates!\n\nP.S. Please add in a flintlock pistol in the Pirate Cove level!\n\nP.P.S. Please make it possible to disable the drum kill sound.

What I will list next are not complaints, but suggestions that could be added in the game to make it even better.\n\nThese features might be welcome (especially if they are toggle on/off features):\n\n- Collision Based Damage: This would make tossing an enemy against a wall or furniture more relevant.\n\n- Fall Damage: Similar to the above it would make kicking enemies and falling off heights relevant.\n\n- "Realistic" Blood Mode: In the game's current state just punching an enemy causes him to bleed profusel. A mode that made the blood spurts more adequate to the damage done would be welcome as well. Bleeding profusely would be achieved by stabbing an enemy, "breaking his nose" or caving his head in, but still more tame than the current more cartoonish mode. This would also make it more challenging to paint the maps RED. Requiring more violence to really get that bloodbath result.\n\n-Dangerous Unarmed or Bruce Lee mode: Although there is the Hard hitter mode (makes enemies fly further) I find that I would like to replicate Kung Fu movies and go through a stage bare handed. It is possible to do so in normal mode (if played carefully), but I would really like a mode that caters to that specifically. Higher damage and Easier Stuns with fists would be nice in this mode. Some visual and audio aditions might be nice too. Like Chinese Kung Fu characters and sound effects.\n\n-Kung Fu Themed Map: Regardless of the previous item, it would be REALLY nice to get a kung fu themed map. Like a shaolin temple or a tournament setting.\n\n-Counters Attack: Would make for an interesting gameplay  shift to have the possibility  to steal the enemies weapon or counter attack them if timed right with a block.\n\n-Better Collision When Tossing Items: Maybe it's my PC that's not really that good, but the collisions when tossing items seem a little wonky. Making the items bounce according to their type and knocking down the enemies would be a nice visual response. Sometimes solid items, like billiard balls, just fly through an enemies head as if they were bullets.\n\nI really do recommend the game. Just tons of mindless fun.\nHope the devs get a chance to read this.","May 21","true","13.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

I love the thought behind it. You basically have to kill all of these people by either stabbing, throwing objects at them, kicking, punching, and several other ways. The blood ends up everywhere and looks like red cubes of jell-o, which makes it even better.

I love how it lives up to its name also, you paint the town and its inhabteints well\nRed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienhell/recommended/337320/","Alienhell","Alienhell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienhell/","517 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRemember one of the penultimate fight sequences in Kill Bill Vol 1 where Uma Thurman is surrounded by "The Crazy 88" Yakuza swordsmen and proceeds to defeat them in a long and extraordinarily bloody sequence? Have you ever wanted to play a game where you felt that tremendous sense of "One Against All" in a way that felt equally thrilling and brutal as that scene?\n\nMeet Paint The Town Red.\n\nThe setup is very simple: Enter an area with a large amount of individuals (presently a bar, a nightclub and a prison), find a weapon (or don't) and proceed to kill everyone. Kill enough enemies and you unlock the first tier of a special "power". Don't use that power and kill more and you advance to a more powerful tier, continuing on to the third respectively.\n\nIt's an astonishingly simple setup which is just too good to deny. Smashing a chair over someone's head before running across the room to grab a bottle, which I throw into the face of one of two individuals surrounding me. With a large group in pursuit, I run into a supply room and grab a guitar and come out swinging - taking down several individuals before I activate my power, sending the large group of seven flying across the tables and chairs that litter the bloodsoaked floor.\nAesthetically it's just ludicrously appealing, seeing pixelated seas of blood bathe entire rooms in seconds after you stab a mob boss in the face and then punch his bodyguard across the room. Watching the faces of tougher enemies fall apart, gushing blood before they eventually fall after repeated pummelings with objects.\n\nThere could do to be more content in the game, e.g: weapons (and I'd love to see a cinema level), but what is supplied here at the minute is more than enough to keep you playing for hours.\n\nPaint The Town Red is sheer, all out war. It's a hell of an experience that grabbed me straight from that Kill Bill feeling I got the moment I started fighting someone, all the way to being cornered in a room with a tire iron while furiously smacking at everyone around me.\n\nStick on some smooth jazz or some beatdown hardcore and get swinging.\nPAINT THE TOWN RED!","February 8","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Oh boy, this game. This is an Early Access game (which has become an ugly title, I know), but dear god it's done the way Early Access is SUPPOSED to be done. The game is cheap, it's fun, it's entertaining, and the developers are frequently updating and supporting the game. They listen to the community, they listen to what we have to say and it shows in the quality of this simple, yet absolutely fantastic title.\nPaint the town red is a bloody, gorey mess of a beat 'em up game with lots of weapons, lots of physics and gibbing, and it's easily worth $9.99. The graphcis are basic but extremely effective, the sound track is awesome and the gameplay and fighting feels great. Yes, I'd recommend this game. Even with how little content there is now (only three levels and a sandbox mode, but they just added level modifiers) this game is still easily worth $9.99 in its current state. I'd fully recommend it, and I've even done multiple videos of it on my YouTube channel.\nEasily a 9/10. Buy it.\n\nEDIT: They just added level mods. Holy hell they're fun.

Yet that we can throw a glass of beer in the face of the guitar player, then we also can use our 3 special abilitys that activates at 3 stages, when killing people. We have a great character control and combat movement, when talking defending our self or kicking a guy out of the balcony on first floor.\n\nCurrently Paint The Town Red offers two maps, which is the bar and disco. Each locations has some small 'bosses', like a mob, pimp, rocker boss etc. Yet that these strong in-game npc's can slice you up with a sword, the staff of each locations aswell don't fear to take a knife to show you how to remove arms from people. The game it self offers a keyboard aswell a controller support, to release your inner killer.\n\nNot only has the game two maps too offer, but suggestions from the community will make the game even better since there is so many ideas that this first person fighting game fit into. I hope with my whole hearth, that the developers add a multiplayer for the ultimate fun. If you love and search for a game to hurt people in the moste brutal ways, this game is worth the shot.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NTmWlyQvZg&list=PLxDx_O1l8oBsLpg2i7BMkf2xGyEgVJq_I","October 13, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Some of them gave me shifty glances. It was my first go on Paint the Town Red and I wasn't sure what to expect... I just knew I was meant to fight! Remembering my favourite scene from the film Train Spotting I thought my best option was to grab a glass and wing it over the edge of the balcony into a random guys head. It shattered and sent him to the floor, blood spurting from the wound. As soon as I did this the music changed to a funky acton beat, fitting for the carnage which was about to take place.\n\nSuddenly all hell broke loose and I kicked the guy infront of me - sending him smashing through a wooden table before stomping his head into the floor - taking some strange satisfaction in this brutal act. Before I could finish my "fun" another drinker cracks me over the back of the head with a pool cue.\n\nThis was the first 5 minutes. It just continued to get better. Not *loads* of content, but the developers seem to be updating weekly at the moment with promises of lots more - and the current content is easily worth the asking price. More people should know about this, it really is great!\n\nIf you enjoy big brawls and lots of gore, get it.

It feels very "clean" in the sense of no extra mods, loading processes, background calculation, etc... It runs smooth and plays smooth and that raises the enjoyment factor quite a bit. In addition to the stable framerate and easy playability, the visual style matches the gameplay. Solid colors, decent music, and amusing ragdoll effects makes for a replayable game that you'll actually enjoy.\n\nAlthough there is no real story, this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all.

Each level has a boss, with a powerful weapon and a lot of health at his disposal, and his heavily-armed henchmen alongside the standard mooks. For a voxel-based game, the injury system is incredibly complex and highly detailed: enemies can be bruised, extremities can be hacked off and blood will be spilled from their wounds - and there are many more methods of committing GBH and ultimately murder for a suitably-haematolagniac player to explore.\n\nPaint the Town Red has truly impressed me as a game, not least in which it has proven that a game where all there is to do is slaughter bar patrons can indeed be more enjoyable than a hugely-complex war game with the most advanced graphics and realistic gunplay to date ...

The dev's are planning on adding many new features to an already very fun game. It's an awesome experience to run into a bar, prison, etc. and start slashing and whacking at pretty much everyone you see. The physics in this game are awesome, and the destruction of the NPC's are very bloody and gory with a blocky art style.

I don't normally purchase early access games, but the sale price, the description and the positive reviews convinced me to take a chance. Right now there isn't a ton of content, but what's there is very fun. Chaotic battles abound in these 3 levels and seeing your enemies come apart, piece by tiny piece is both horrifying and pretty damn cool.

Man muss in einem Level eine Schlägerei anfangen und jeden töten, sobald man jemanden schlägt, geht es los. Daraufhin fangen alle an, sich zu verprügeln und wollen dem Spieler natürlich auch ans Leder. Es ist möglich, die meisten Gegenstände aufzuheben um damit um sich zu schlagen oder sie zu werfen. Das Werfen von Dingen ist besonders bei den stärkeren Gegnern nützlich, von denen es in jedem Level einen gibt. Das Spiel sieht so ähnlich aus, wie Minecraft, alles scheint aus Klötzen gemacht zu sein. Am beeindruckendsten ist allerdings die Gewaltdarstellung, es ist einfach ein riesiges Blutbad, da es sogar möglich ist, Gegnern Gliedmaßen abzutrennen oder so lange auf den Bauch zu treten, bis die Rippen zum Vorschein kommen. Das einzige, was ich aktuell noch bemängeln kann ist der Umfang, es gibt nur 4 Level, einen Pub, eine Disco, ein Gefängnis und ein Testlevel. Aber da das Spiel aktuell noch Early Access ist, wird da sicher noch mehr kommen, deshalb empfehle ich es.","January 8","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw a guy holding a beer mug looking at me, then walked inside the massive bar that was located right next to me, seeing a bunch of pirates drinking beer and holding daggers. I tried to ask the bartender for a shot but accidentally punched him and he went down.\n\nThen while everyone started fighting each other, one guy came after me with a bottle and I panicked, grabbing the closest thing I could (which turned out to be a ham shank) and wacked his face a couple times before kicking him halfway across the room, knocking over a few other people in the process. Once they got up they too got angry and started heading after me, armed with glasses and daggers and even cutlasses. Scared, I sprinted up stairs, grabbing an oar that was on the wall on my way.\n\nWhen I got up to the rooftop, there was a pirate with a massive sword sitting and munching on an identical ham shank, but he must have been in a bad mood because when I stepped up there he immediately got up, grabbed his sword, and charged me. Luckily my reflexes kicked in just in time and I juked him to the right, slamming my oar into his head. He flinched but kept following, and meanwhile his bodyguards started coming after me too. I dealt with them first, slamming my oar into their faces over and over until just as I had killed the last one, my oar broke.\n\nThe captain was swinging his sword down and I thought it was the end of me, but at the last moment I kicked out and my foot connected, slamming into his midsection and sending him through the guardrail and out into oblivion, where he was promptly eaten by sharks as he landed in the water. However, the other pirates from below had made their way up to the roof by now, and with no point in risking my life I jumped from the roof down and made my way to the beach.\n\nI saw a couple of pirates fighting beside a campfire and knowing I already had plenty to deal with, I grabbed a shovel lying on some boxes nearby and kept heading down the beach. At the end there were two pirates jousting with cutlasses, and I must have interrupted them because the stopped and instead came after me.\n\nI banged up a couple with my shovel and kicked some out to sea, but my shovel broke again and I frantically made my way up to the rocks and grabbed a harpoon lying on the edge. I was prepared to make my last stand.\n\nPirate after pirate flooded onto the cliff like a stream, and I just batted pirate after pirate off with my harpoon, seeing blood fly and pirates tumbling off the cliff into the sharks below. My arms were swinging full power, lodging the head of the harpoon deep within my enemy's heads, then slamming my foot into them to send them off. I must have killed 20 pirates before my harpoon, once again, broke. Seeing no other alternative, I dashed down a ladder that led to a small rock below the cliff.\n\nThe onslaught continued, pirates coming down the ladder one by one. I sparta kicked the lead and he went flying back, dislodging five others behind him and disoriented, they went into the shark-infested water to be devoured. I threw left hooks, right hooks, upper cuts, pirates dying by the dozens. But one pirate, equipped with a harpoon himself, jumped up and landed a blow that took my health down to almost nothing. My vision dizzy, I scrambled onto a small boat and onto the boardwalk, desperately trying to evade any blows.\n\nI made by way back into the building, stumbling in with a severe limp. I saw corpses all around me, bits and pieces of them scattered around the floor. I felt faint and groped for a dagger lodged in a pirate's head, retracting it and making my way out again, to the ship that I had come here from.\n\nThe vicious cries from my tailing pirates were almost overwhelming, but I knew that I must push on, for I could not bear to lose my life this way. They were shouting obscenities, breaking bottles inside the bar as they moved through, in an effort to intimidate me. Bleeding profusely and exhausted, I stroked the wheel of my ship and vowed that I would not go down without a fight. And soon enough, the dozen or so pirates made their way up to my ship, surrounding me.\n\nTime seemed to pass in eons in that moment, for I had a sudden burst of energy so overwhelming I felt as if I were going to faint. The mouths of the pirates slowed, their weapons in the air crawled in inches, but I had never felt as alive as I had then. It was as if the gods had infused their power into my soul, their blood into my veins. I could feel it surging through me, pulsing in time with my heartbeat, and I lifted my hands up to my face and saw blue lightning coursing through my arteries. I knew what I had to do, and with a ferocious yell, I brought my fists together.\n\nThe resounding shockwave almost blew me off my feet, and I could see the sound waves as they travelled outward from my knuckles, pulsing through the air like ripples from a drop of water. The pirate's faces contorted into looks of awe and then fear as they realized what was going to happen to them in a split second, and with a massive grin on my face the sound waves made contact.\n\nThe pirates were swept off their feet, blasted back with such force they were flipping through the air. They sailed for what seemed like years, their weapons leaving their hands, yelling and crying for help.  Flipping head over heels over and over and over again, they tumbled in a slow arc out to sea, and one by one their cries were cut short by the gulping of sharks and the bubbling of water. Splashing occurred frequently in a short time period, but it stopped no sooner then it started and the ocean was calm once again.\n\nThe moon shined bright in the sky, a full pie gleaming down on the red coat on the water. I looked back to the bar and took in the bodies, the broken bottles, the severed limbs. With a sigh of relief, the blue energy gradually left my arms and I felt tired once more, happy that I had survived. And with other deep breath, I put my hands on the wheel's embellished mahogany, and set sail for the country I had come from.\n\nThe menu popped up, and displayed a thumbnail of what they now call "Cutthroat Cove". I pumped my fists up in the air and yelled with delight, and maybe swore a few times at the pirates that had caused me such trouble. After minutes of shaking my head at what an amazing game I was playing, I finally sat down once again, and stared at the screen for a couple more minutes, frozen with awe.\n\nThen I directed my cursor to the right once more, and pressed "play".","February 26","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shapeshifters/recommended/337320/","shapeshifters","Shapeshifters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shapeshifters/","128 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFun for the whole family.. If your family is a bunch of sadists. Paint the Town red is a great stress relief game, and is super addicting to play. The objective of the game is to kill everyone else in the level and become the only one, then walk out all cool with a mess of blood and mutilated bodies behind you.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is great, and it has to be, considering this game is all about fighting. You can pick up most items around you, including bar stools, mugs, chairs, pool ques, pool balls, knives, bats, nun-chucks, katanas, throwing stars, shot glasses, tire irons, pimp cains, and more. They usually break pretty fast though, which forces you to run around constantly grabbing things to use as weapons and gives the combat this improvisational feel. You can do light punches if you tap, and heavy punches if you hold. There's a block button so you can take reduced damage, but generally I see little use for it when you can just dodge very easily by backing up. Unless you're cornered block really has no purpose. Then theres kicks, you have a knock down bar that when full lets your kicks knock people over, it depletes entirely once you use it and constantly fills back up at a quick pace. One of my favorite things with kicks is dropkicking, if you time your jump and your kick just right you can do one, but it can be pretty hard at times. As for weapons they use the same mechanics as punches, but light hits are jabs, heavy hits are swings, and you can throw them. Sometimes your hits stun opponents letting you just wail on them until they recover or go down.\n\nSpecials\nThere's three special abilities that use a blue bar, which charges up when you kill people. The first one costs a third of your bar and does a shockwave knocking anyone in your immediate area down, it's called shockwave. The second ability, berserk, slows down time, and lets you explode peoples faces in prosnorkulus style fashion with your punches, using two thirds of your bar. Smite, the third and final ability, using a full bar, slows down time and lets you shoot people with your hand spirit gun style, causing them to be obliterated into nothing with a beam from the sky. The second and third ability sometimes dont work, which is really annoying, and they waste precious slowed time doing an animation. Sometimes due to this you'll only get to kill one or two people with berserk or smite, sometimes none at all, which is just a total waste of your bar, and can be really infuriating.\n\nBosses\nThere's a boss or two on every level, of which there are only two right now (The Bar, and Club beatdown),  but there will be more to come. These guys usually carry a super deadly weapon, and have some ridiculous durability. They're unaffected by your special moves and your kicks, and they can take so many bottles to the face it's hilarious. You can fight them at any time you find them in the level, and usually they come right after you once you do. As for their ridiculous durability, these guys will generally have half their skull hanging out their head and still come at you. But once you get their weapon it usually one hit kills everything you come accross until it breaks. Boss weapons have slightly more durability than others but still break pretty quickly if you have a bunch of opponents left. A nice detail for the sadists out there, your weapons take zero durability damage from smacking corpses so you can mutilate things as much as you like.\n\nConclusion\nOverall I love this game, and despite a couple issues with specials, and lack of optimization, I can see me and my friends taking turns on this game for hours just in its current state. Which kinda makes me wish there was some local coop/deathmatch support in the future. But anyways, if you like senselessly gorey brawls, and/or your looking for a way to outlet your rage, then I recommend you [try] Paint The Town Red.","October 14, 2015","true","29.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I hope multiplayer is involved and some sort of leveling system is introduced later. This game has a ton of potential and I look forward to watching it grow either through the steamworkshop with maps, skins, weapons, attack moves, and powerup customization. Being able to create your own gifs of your fury is great which you can upload it as artwork and use it on your steam profile. However, the frame rate gets a little choppy when everyone starts throwing things at eachother and you will not get over 60fps with SLI 970's and I7 4790k.\n\nTLDR; I hope it gets optimized a little more but overall I recommend it for what it is at the current state as a fun and entertaining game with a lot of potential.","October 14, 2015","true","5.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Afterwards it becomes the same thing over and over. Hit, run away. Hit, run away. Hit, run away. The AI is incredibly stupid. For a game that's supposed to be a beat em' up fighting game, it has terrible AI. If you hit one guy, he'll only come after you, even if someone else hurts him. This can cause you to get a horde of people chasing after you. Not like this is a problem ofcourse, because you can just Hit. And. Run. Repeat. or H.A.R.R for short.\n\nLater on in development, if the devs whip up a better AI system so players aren't just H.A.R.Ring all the time, it'd be well over worth the $10 asking price. I'd gladly pay $20 or even $25 for this exact game, with better AI (and all the maps ofcourse, but those will come in time...)","January 8","false","2.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","8","15","3","9"

It is currently available in Early Access, and the developers are fixing bugs and adding new things almost every week.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is seen from a first-person perspective, and it looks fairly good: the blocky characters that you fight are nicely varied and feature different facial animations, the blood that spills from their wounds really paints the whole level red, and the level design is well done, with hidden weapons and such that reward your exploration. There are a couple of animations bugs, like beheaded enemies that are still alive, or doors that glitch out of existence, but it performs really well and I haven't found anything annoying.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is simple: start a brawl and be the last man standing. You can use your fists, your kick (which makes your enemies fly in the air), or you can pick up almost everything that you find in the levels, from chairs and beer bottles, to baseball bats and katanas and guitars, as well as a shotgun (the only firearm currently available). The weapons are powerful but break down after a couple of hits.\nThere is also a Power Meter, which grants you three different special moves: a Shockwave (which makes every enemy near you fly away), Berserk Mode (which gives you a one-hit kill for every punch you throw), and Smite (you point your finger at an enemy and he blows up). This helps turning this already violent game in probably one of the bloodiest I've ever played, making every game session engaging and rewarding.\nUnfortunately, the game lacks a lot of variety, and after a while you will get a bit bored of it. But after one or two days, it will be just as exciting as the first time.\n\nCHALLENGEExcluding the mini-bosses that you find in each level, every enemy goes down with a couple of hits from the weapons you find, so they aren't that hard to kill. However, when there is a mob of people that puts you in a corner, they easily overpower and destroy you, making everything a bit more frustrating than it could have been.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are spot on, and every hit from punches and weapons gives you an adrenaline rush. The music from Kevin McLeod fits the game very well, and even though the tracks aren't all that memorable, they are very fun to listen to while playing.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game now has three levels (a bar, a disco floor, and a prison) and a Sandbox Mode to try out different weapons and attacks. There are also some modifiers that you can use (like giving every enemy a machete, or giving you unlimited power) to spice things up a bit and making the whole experience fun every time.\n\nOverall, this is a very good game to play when you have thirty minutes of free time or when you are upset: it is rewarding, it is fun and it doesn't last long. I strongly recommend supporting this game, especially because the developers are constantly fixing the bugs and adding new features to satisfy the fans. I can't wait to see what they will give us next.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8\nFRUSTRATION: 6.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","January 18","true","4.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","9","17","4","0"

Some map ideas are Zombie Town, Cruise Ship, and Party Crasher. If these maps became a reality it would help the game a lot.

There is also kicking and sparta kicking in the game which just adds on the fun factors of the game.\n\n==Engine/Graphics==\n\nThe graphics to me are pretty neat as most things/people are made up of small blocks even the blood is made of blocks\nThe engine is okay but to me it needs improving as looking at some places in the bar dropped my fps to around 30 but I didn't have these issues in the sandbox and disco. The gore engine is amazing like I have said, another thing nice about it is blood and bodys stay in the map.\n\n==Sounds/Music==\n\nThe sounds are pretty good but nothing to really go on about, the music is nice and fits in with the fights, so at the disco funk music and at the bar rock music.\n\n==Vertic==\n\nAmazing game highly recommend picking it up if you want to lose some stress, but the engine needs improving.\n","November 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It is very fun but the gameplay is repetative.  It has limited stain power but if they came out with more maps (mabye 5) it would raise the games worrth to 20 dollars. Some map ideas are Zombie Town, Cruise Ship, and Party Crasher. If these maps became a reality it would help the game a lot. Even though the game is not fully developed I think they could have done better. I would recommend this game for people who have anger issues, voilent needs and want to see somones head smashed into oblivion with a power up.","November 2, 2015","true","26.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The boss guys or what ever they are, are a challenge to fight and are fun to toy around with. the abillity to bunny hop around and punch thing reminds me of my good old gmod death run days and the voxel gore just adds a nice touch, and its not entirly for show either. The superpowers are also a bit of gun, a little laggy even on my beast of a machine because of all the voxel gore that stays! Nice touch. I cant wait until more levels are released.

There is only two levels at the moment, but the next level is already planned to be a downright prison riot that I already can't wait for. An ingenious voxel-based system that doesn't feel like a gimmick but rather an amazing way to provide gore and destruction that looks and feels satisfying. A combat system simplistic yet effective, providing kills and tricks that just feel right. And to top it all off, the devs seem genuinely devoted to this game and even have dev logs that you can find in the discussions.\n\nThis isn't to say there are no issues however, of the two levels the second one feels a bit underwhelming; and in a game with only two at the moment that's a pretty big deal. I've had times when I felt like I should be hitting someone yet they mysteriously take little to no damage. The devs expect glitches though, and judging from the stuff I've already seen in discussions they'll surely listen to any bugs and errors that are noticable. But DO NOT let that stop you from purchasing this game, there is an insane level of potential here, and for $9.99 it's practically a steal.\n\nSeriously people, I think we found a good one.","October 13, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While right now there isn't a whole lot to do, what there is to do is pure gold. Absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic gore effects (no homo) with the beautiful voxel artstyle is perfect. Your character doesn't feel sluggish, allowing you to freely move quickly and effectively around the area. Neither are you too powerful, or not powerful enough. Of course you can outsmart A.I., but getting kills will charge a meter that will give you some neat abilities (they really need to fix it though, shockwave is the first one you get and is still the best). Taking hits will be very punishing, but landing jabs and blows without being hit and seeing your enemies skull evaporate is very satisfying. Ever level is chock full of tiny interactions and funny bits. In the bar you can break railings by throwing objects, in the club you can find mother♥♥♥♥ing ninja stars to decimate your enemies, or even use stacks of money for a hilarious beatdown. (Also, you get a ♥♥♥♥ing insta-kill katana, that's pretty cool). It does need a few more levels, but I would prefer a handful of good levels with some aspects that change everytime you play (enemy placement, weapon availability/placement, etc.) rather than a ton of bad maps.  For an early access game, this game is amazing, and you should pick it up now if you love some gorey fun.","January 2","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After about 5 minutes, the whole "KILL EVERYTHING" aspect had turned into "Ok, my fists are useless, now I have to think of this tactically because there are A LOT of enemies." That ruined the game for me because I was expecting a casual game with lots of action, like the trailer insinuated, what I actually got was a game that very quickly turned into a tactical game (which was not what I expected).\n\nThe technical issues I had with it was that right away, and I mean right away, the frame rate was consistently bellow 60 fps, which I think nearly ruins a game. I switched the graphics to a lower setting and it a got a bit better but not good enough for me to sit down and have a session of Paint the Town Red. Then I changed the aspect ratio along with the graphics which helped, but pretty much ruined the game. It was still playable but got extremely repetitive after a small amount of time.\n\nI played this on a Mac and for comparison, I get a consistent 60 fps on games like Garry's Mod, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, and others. I rate it 3/10.","January 22","false","0.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

While an interesting idea that is well executed, it is very much a spectator game that lacks enough in game goals to be fun to play for an average gamer.\n\nI think some edits to the enemy AI could be done in order to make the mid game battle less like a swarm, and also perhaps a little more variety to the levels including additional sub goals along with the main end game.\n\nI will replay this game as it gets updated and edit my review accordingly, but as is now, I do not believe that you will get as much playtime out of the game as the amount of money you are spending is worth.","January 18","false","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Every level feels full of weapons and cool things you can do (Knock off taps, etc.), every enemy can be killed in several ways... It's honestly a brilliant game. It's one of the best games on steam I have played.\n\nIt does lack content however, with only 3 levels, two if you don't count demo levels. And the levels do get a little stale after a while. But I'm sure those will be added in the future. (If you're reading this, devs, I hope a museum level with paintings, bits of sculptures, and medieval weaponry all usable as weapons is added.

The graphics are retro but it's easy to see how recent this game is. You'll need a powerful computer though, since it may look laggy and slowed down which is unpleasant. Overall, the game in itself is greatly orchestrated and will put the player in a moment of intense bloodshed at the frontier of reality... it's safe to say that with all the carnage going on in a single game, you could easily be rotting in jail for about 9 or 10 human lives.\n\nTo sum it up, if you're affraid of blood and violence, you may possibly have a blackout.

If this was being sold simply "as is," I'd say it'd only be worth 5, maybe 6 dollars. How'd I come up with that number? If you enjoy these types of games, at a bare minimum, this game will be "new" for 2 or 3 hours, and continue to be highly enjoyable for a while after that. 5 to 6 dollars is about the same price as a movie ticket, which nets you 1-2 hours of enjoyment.\n\nBut, the game isn't being sold as is. It's being updated weekly, continually adding new content, adding to it playability, and replayability. They might add an amazing new feature, some amazing new level, or they might add something that's horrible. But that's the point. If something sucks, post about it, let SEG know. If you have an idea for something that would make the game better, let them know. You can change and steer the direction of development.\n\nNow, the number one issue with Early Access games is devs not delivering on promises, or jumping ship with your money after a few updates. But here's the great thing about this game; although I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if the devs dropped off the face of the earth, it's already enjoyable enough that I'm willing to pay $10 for it, though not everyone is me, which is why I only gave it a "value" of 5 to 6 dollars.","November 5, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The disco club introduces new weapons such as throwing stars, katanas, nun chuks, and lethal hair picks of death.

There's not much of a storyline but this isn't the kind of game that needs one. It's sandbox violence at its finest.\n\nArt/Style - 10/10\nEvery time you hit someone it will either leave a bruise or remove part of the voxel based model of their body. When you slam them with a bottle you can see the layers of muscle and bone - even down to the brain. Goreboner.\n\nCurrent Content - 6/10\nThis is an early access game and it currently only has two levels (Biker Bar and Disco Club) while I'm posting this. It has a plan for a new level (Prison Riot) and I'm sure there will be plenty more. It should be understood that it is Early Access and this really isn't a negative towards the game thus far since you get what you pay for and grow with the game and the developers.\n\nSound/Music - 8/10\nThe two levels have different live bands/djs. The bar has a rock band that can get involved in the fight. Take the mic stand and slam it into his square head. Disco club has a DJ. No mic stand but find something else and repeat operation "Slam into Square Head".\n\nOverall  - 8/10\nI'm excited to see where this game goes because the current idea is something I've been searching for in a game for years.

I got about 2 hours out of it in its current state and I can genuinely say I enjoyed myself. I really liked just how gory everything was but it's a specific kind of gory that's fun and not grimdark that I really enjoy. The touted "fully destructible enemies" are on full display with the ability to see details like their skeleton when you really beat them up. Visually, it's very charming while also having a nice fidelity. Specifically, the way light reflects off the blood of your enemies is a very nice touch.\n\nIn terms of what can be improved, I'd like there to be a way to regain your health. My friend and I were theorizing a few ways this could happen. Either by drinking the beer and other drinks inside of the bottles and glasses you pick up or by killing enemies. That or have a super easy kids mode with regenerating health for the losers who can't play video games (like me). In order for this game to be worth the money, there desperately needs to be more levels.

Your objective is to murder everyone in the location, by any means necessary. There's no real rhyme or reason as to why you have to, but that's the fun part because you create the story. Say you had one too many drinks and decided to bash that guys head in, say this one guy owed you money, or just looked at you wrong, teach him a lesson in pain and beat him with a pool stick. You can literally use just about anything to maim and incapacitate your foes in the game, and that's one of the best parts. Ever wanted to grab a guitar and break it over someones head? Poke a dude with a mic stand and leave a gaping hole? Break a pool stick into someones head? Well, all that and more is possible.

There's no story or characters, just you and a room full of nobodies who for whatever reason need to die in order to win. Literally what it says on the box.\n\nIt could be described as a first person Hotline Miami with the ludicrous about of violence and the rediculous number of almost comidical weapons at your disposal. I killed a man with a urinal cake.\n\nIf you're looking for an entertaining game that you can kill some time with, or a massive One Punch Man fan, then I'd recomend this is for you.\n_\n\nImprovments: Obviously more maps are needed.

It has alot of potential, but the as wonderfully causualy laid back and fun as this game may be, one thing ruins it horribley. The Ai! The Ai just mobs on you the entire time, only a few fight each other! so whenever the level starts you have around 100 guys just mobbing you and chasing you around the map. You have to keep running around and advoid corners. This severly detracts from the gameplay, as the game often offers  funny or entertaining ways to kill a guy, but you can only get that one enjoyable kill in the map, becuase as i siad, as soon as you throw a punch, everybody in the world mobs you.

Being able to disassember body parts is cool but what would be cooler is being able to pick up dissasembered body parts to use as a weapon.\n3. I know there is some awesome weapons in the game even the secret hidden gun but there is only 1 gun in the game... the shotgun. i think you should add more guns too like snipers (for mlg people :D) and pistols and even a laser rifle.\n4.a level sugestion that i have in mind is a island with a volcano on it like in the newest map there is water and a shark eats enemys and players who go in the water so in this map idea you can lead enemys to the top of the volcano and wither kick them in push them in or shockwave them in and they burn.\nand finally my final sugesstion 5. ok before anyone freaks out if this feture gets added this would be really awesome and OVER POWERED and kind of a little i dunno dangerously deadly weapon... the chainsaw i think it would be cool not because its overpowered but because IT WOULD BE MORE OVERPOWERED THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE..... maby? it depends if you add it or not or make it op or now.\nso there is my 5 suggestions and my raiting.\n\nalso here is a joke: Why did the player kill the enemy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nawnser: SO THE PLAYER CAN PAINT THE TOWN IN RED (a.k.a Blood)","December 19, 2015","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Armor and/or Health recovery - The enemies do hit hard after all, some more than others, and while it is still possible to win without these, it's rather difficult, especially the pirate level, so something to restore some health or something to add some armor would help a bit, or at least make it optional.\n2. Co-op Multiplayer - This is the type of game that would benefit MASSIVELY from being able to play with friends if possible, and add tremendously to replay factor.\n3. Smarter Ai - I'm cutting it some slack since it's early access and it's a beat-em-up, but the AI needs some work on it.\n\nOther than that, I haven't run into anything yet, and I really like this game, and hoping it will continue to get even better.","March 31","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Maybe that was the intention, but meh.\n-Modifiers are a bit boring. Machete time, Random friends, and Random weapons aren't really good modifiers.\n\nI love this game, and the things I dislike about this game aren't bad.

Every level feels full of weapons and cool things you can do (Knock off taps, etc.), every enemy can be killed in several ways... It's honestly a brilliant game. It's one of the best games on steam I have played.\n\nIt does lack content however, with only 3 levels, two if you don't count demo levels. And the levels do get a little stale after a while. But I'm sure those will be added in the future. (If you're reading this, devs, I hope a museum level with paintings, bits of sculptures, and medieval weaponry all usable as weapons is added. Just a suggestion.)\n\nThis game deserves a 10/10. It's all a game needs to be, fun, replayable, and brilliant.","December 8, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game is constantly training you for bar fights, murder-discos, prison fights and more to come soon! You never know when you might get in a bar fight.

That being said, the AI opponents populating each map will not only fight eachother, but will also attempt to stab, slash, punch, kick, and brutalize you just as much you would to them. They can also take advantage of the weapons that they find, giving them a heafty boost to their damage output.\n\nThis is also a very challenging game that will take you multiple tries to fully master the levels. If you don't feel like going through that, you can always set the optional level modifiers on. These are special "perks" if you will that give you abilities such as your fists acting as tazers. Or grant you UNLIMITED POWWWEERRRR. Spawning random weapons across the level, or the ability to turn theme off completely, leaving it to a good ol' fisticuff brawl. There are more after that, which further extend replayability.\n\nThis is the most fun I have had with an indie game in a while.

Do you want to wring someones neck? Tired of human life? If you've answered yes to any of these questions then you are in luck. Paint the Town Red is just the thing any psycho such as yourself can play to take a load off their shoulders, or take a head off someones' shoulders... hehe.....\nNow you can have your cake and kill someone with it too! Highly recommended for anyone that's had a stressful day. Or if you're just in to killing people with soap and watching their limbs fly everywhere. Although the weapons have the durability of the spines that you're breaking, it is still an amazing game nonetheless.\nHave fun you sick sociopath.","February 18","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game that's in early access this has to be one of the best games I've ever played. I have to point out that not everyone will be able to run this game, but keep in mind that this is an indie game. It runs super smooth on my GTX 970 and I do believe future updates of this game will surely allow more people to be able to run this smoothly.\n\nThis game may not be too fun for everyone, but this game, for me, is perfect. I love the fact that the blood particles actually stick to whatever they hit and even cause said splatter to have a reflecting texture. Also, imagine the world of minecraft, but instead of a world and lands the people in the bar consist of all the blocks and they're fully destructible.\n\n10/10 would chop a person in half with a baseball bat again.\n\nKeep up the amazing work devs!
