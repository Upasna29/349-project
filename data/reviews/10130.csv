Lots of flat textures and the colors are mostly grey. The story itself is very much like Half Life 2 as there is a dystopian future (or past as it is in this game) that is ruled over by a tyrant who loves to talk about himself over large jumbo trons. The voice acting isn't bad but it's nothing to write home about. It doesn't get in the way but there's never a moment where I went "Oh wow what a great line!"\n\nThe weapons are all varied and pretty damn fun to use. The action in the game really feels like one of those games nowadays that tries to capture that "old-school" shooter vibe and yet the game just plays it straight intead of trying to shove it down my throat. When I slow down time then unload both barrels of my shotgun on a guy and I watch as his ragdoll flies backward while still in slow motion as his blood splatters on my screen I know it was badass I don't need a game (or game's character) to TELL me I'm badass.\n\nThis is the only purely action time manipulation game I can think of other than maybe Singularity although it's not really the same manipulation. Not many games allow me to reverse time and walk past the guys who just kicked the door down in front of me and unkick the door down in reverse time so that when I bring time back I was behind them the whole time with shotgun aimed squarely at their backs.\n\nIs it the best game ever? No. It's weak story and bland environments really bring the game down and you'll find yourself not caring about any of the stories or characters and Dr. Krone does not make for a good villian especially when you barely here him speak other than on some jumbo trons while loud gunfire is happening. To bring up Half Life again, Dr. Breen was such a good villian because his face was everywhere constantly preaching the combine's message as he has sold out humainty so that he can live in comfort. Behind all of his messages and threats he is just a coward sitting up in a tower. You really get to hate the guy. Dr. Krone is just evil scientist number 7 that wants to rule the world becasue...EVIL.\n\nIf you are looking for an action packed old school style shooting game however this is the game for you. How many games let you pause time, take an enemy's weapon, stick said enemy with a grenade, then use his gun to headshot his buddy he was talking to? Tell me please because if there was I'd be playing that game too.\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 92 of 96 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","92","96","6","0"

I've played this game back to 2008 and when i saw it on steam and was on sale, I immediately got this game in my collection.\n\nThe most innovative thing in this game might be the control of time. Games includes bullet time is increasingly common since Max Payne, but this game has something special- not only slow, but also pause and reverse time, both in defeat your enemy and solve the puzzle. The puzzles are pretty fun- some of them are smart you actually need to think for a minute- but not too difficult that's the fun part of the game.\n\nI'm have way through the game now, for the skilled level and I got the cross-bow. This weapon is what I'm clawing for from the beginning of the game since it's so powerful that it kills everyone one site within one shot- Having this weapon in hands actually immediately lowers the difficulty of game, but the good thing is you have some advanced enemy- some have part your ability like moving fast, to balance the game.\n\nFor a 2007 game like this, I played on Win8 and didn't have any running issues which is good. I used to have some graphic issues on my Win7 computer but for my win8 laptop, even there was a window pop up right before I run the game says beware of the comparability, it seems everything goes in order. I have a very pleasant experience with this game and I intend to finish this game during the weekends.\n\n9/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/10130/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Much like the time manipulation gameplay it's based on, Timeshift is a window into time. A time when games had to try and be as familiar as possible, but still contain a gimmick to attract any sort of audience.\n\nSuperfically the gunplay of Timeshift is very reminisicent of F.E.A.R, Timesplitters Future Perfect and Star Wars Republic Commando. The art style is painfully reminiscient of Gears of War and Timesplitters Future Perfect, but much less goofy and colorful. And the timeshifting gameplay itself is taken straight from Prince of Persia: The Sands of TIme.\n\nSomething you may have noticed is all of these games released years prior to Timeshift. As dated as Timeshift is right now, it was dated even when it came out. The game is painfully linear, the art style is very generic and colorless, the storyline is laughably generic and sounds like half a dozen other shooters and the time shifting gameplay feels too much like a gimmick. I end up just not using it at all because it makes the game too easy even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nBut I still recommend this game for people who like first person shooters. The game is still surprisingly competant, and its multiplayer was a halfway decent attempt at mimicing Timesplitters Future Perfect. But you have to go into it knowing that it's very generic and unimpressive. It does a good job at being a clone. Much like the time manipulation gameplay it's based on, Timeshift is stuck in the past and never moved on.","September 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","66","81","2","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/10130/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Timeshift is one of those games that was mostly overlooked and forgotten, and it's a shame because it's actually a pretty neat game. It gives you the power to rewind, pause, or slow down time, and while you can just play the game by slowing time, shooting everyone to death, and then moving on to the next fight and doing the same thing, it's pretty boring that way, and the game gives you room to be somewhat creative with the powers instead. You can freeze time and grab enemies' guns out of their hands, and they'll either try to maneuver to a nearby gun if it's on the ground or just surrender to you. If someone throws a grenade at you, you can rewind time until it's back in their hands and shoot their arm, causing them to drop it at their feet. Most of the weapons feel satisfying to use (the assault rifle is the main exception, since it's pretty weak against most enemies and is only really good for the grenade launcher secondary fire), and most of them have unique secondary features like flamethrowers or laser cannons. The game uses a 3 weapon limit system, which isn't really ideal, but at least gives you the opportunity to have a close range weapon, a long range weapon, and a fun weapon, instead of just being limited to the standard shotgun/assault rifle combo that most games with two weapon systems force you into. It slows down a bit near the end and has a few levels that feel like padding that don't give you as much of an opportunity to appreciate the time powers, but otherwise it's a generally fun if somewhat basic shooter campaign.\n\nI wouldn't say it's worth immediately going out and buying for $20, and since it's an Activision game you can pretty much bet on it not dropping except for the occasional Activision sale, but when that sale does come around and Timeshift drops down to $5 again I'd pretty easily recommend it. It's worth mentioning that the Steam version of the game is 1.0 and it lacks the 1.2 patch, so if the game doesn't work for you (It worked fine for me, but maybe I was just lucky) you may need to follow one of the guides on Steam on how to install the 1.2 patch.","May 15, 2015","true","9.2"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","46","50","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher/recommended/10130/","FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher","Autistomatic`","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher/","2370 products in account","It's a pretty solid FPS with some unique time shifting mechanics. Basically you have the ability to... as the name implies shift time. You can slow it down, stop it or reverse it, which could make for some interesting combat situations, but unfortunately that's not the case here, because mostly you'll just find yourself slowing down time in order to mow down groups of enemies with some ridiculously OP weapon, which is completely fine and I found enjoyable since you get to feel like greek god. There's a just a certain type of satisfaction to be had when your targets freak out and yell "THATS IMPOSSIBLE!" before getting blown apart into pieces by a timed explosive arrow. Where this game does put the full extent of your time shifting abilities to use is puzzle solving, I found the puzzles to be a little simple and repetitive but still interesting and clever, sometimes I'd stop to think how cool it was what I just did.\n\nThe story was mildly interesting, without spoiling too much you basically get sent back in time to take care of a renegade scientist who went back in time to take over the world, but due to how time travel works your time line doesn't get affected and you're actually just saving an alternate timeline... or something, I don't know, probably not but that's what I got from it. Time travel is complicated as ♥♥♥♥ so don't expect me to explain it ok? Anyway where this game TRULY shines is in it's art & graphics direction, it's got a really awesome mix between cyber and steampunk going on set in a nazi germany type aesthetic, it made me want to keep playing to see more of this world.\n\nSo in conclusion I wouldn't call this game underrated as steam tags suggest, its rather a more obscure title set in a cool ♥♥♥ world where you get to feel like a god. Definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy FPS. I'd give this game about a 7/Bioshock.","May 13, 2014","true","5.5"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

Above all it is FUN. I'd describe it almost like HL2 with much better shooting/weapon design and less bloat. Indeed they even use the same physics engine (Havok) common to many games e.g. F.E.A.R.\n\nIt isn't hard to see why many would write it off as the first two hours or so are rather meh.  Average weapons/shooting (though each gun does have a secondary fire that normally does something fun), bullet spongy generic enemies, so-so level design and the time powers seem like nothing more than a gimmick.\n\nThen it improves. More open levels, interesting level design instead of bland urban areas and you get the first fun weapon (an explosive-bolt firing crossbow). The enemy designs start to vary too from stand and shoot to jetpacks and energy shields. Time powers become important (you're never far from death) and the setting changes from generic dystopia to FUN sort-of future. It's perhaps best described as similar in style to an 80s or 90s cartoon with its mixture of a serious story and rule-of-cool setting.  Never does it get too silly or too serious, however.\n\nFrom this point onwards the game just gets steadily better and better until it ends adding more fun weapons, enemies and levels not to mention some vehicle sections (honestly I didn't realise how much I missed them in modern games). Sure it's a little short and another 2-3 hours would have been nice but it leaves you wanting more which is preferable to a game so full of filler you're happy to finish. Again it compares favourably to HL2 which dragged on far too long. The ending levels are, again, in the more boring urban area but it's nice to revisit them seeing the changes you've made with your time travel.\n\nStory isn't amazing but functional and doesn't have any major flaws. It does make some use of the time travel concept but believe me this isn't the type of game you buy for the story. There are also some puzzles that are slightly unintuitive but you aren't likely to have any major problems and if you do google is always available.","September 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","0"

It's pretty obvious this game takes a lot of inspiration from Half-Life 2 in environments and story. Lots of crawl spaces, various puzzles, driving levels, etc. The only detail I took a lot of notice at was the urban environments look very similar to what HL2 was originally planned to be, as there's quite a bit of Art Deco and weather similar to Viktor Antonov's concept art.\n\nOn another note, the lighting and character models, including gibbing resemble Doom 3 a little too much. I almost felt like I was playing it at some points. I also hate the rebel leader, how he emphasizes certain points of his phrases, and how most dialogue with him involves me doing grunt work. He does say thank you though, so I guess he isn't all that bad.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I'm not even kidding, the AI is designed to kill you very fast like real soldiers if you don't take advantage of time manipulation. It will happen, don't even try to fight soldiers without doing it. The total time of the entire campaign is about 8.5 hours, which is short for single-player. That's probably just me though, I tend to go through SP games very fast.\n\nThe GameSpy shutdown made this game's multiplayer defunct. I doubt there's even a patch out there, and the devs have long-since abandoned the game. It's main downfall points is most likely its lack of a community and/or mod support.\n\nIf you want to get this game, get it on sale or if you don't care about sales, that's okay.

Do this!" "Do that" "Hurry" "Go! What are you waiting for?" "We need fuel!" which all culminates in a pretty anti-climactic and confusing / sequel bait-ish ending\n\nAnd that's one of the other issues about the gameplay, all your objectives are really boring, it pretty much consists of pressing buttons or pulling levers all game, and there's no exploration at all, when I started playing I looked at every nook and cranny like I usually do in games but quickly learned that it was a pointless exercise, you have regenerating health and ammo is plentiful too so you pretty much never run out of it, so you're just going level to level, waypoint to waypoint pressing buttons and killings dudes with combat that turns repetitive after a while and in the end you have a very easy and disappointing final boss\n\nPlus if my playtime's any indication the game's 5-7 hours long at most and multiplayer is dead for this game, so combining  all that you can really see why this game wasn't initially well received in the first place, and after I read a bit on it apparently it had a really rocky development cycle, changing publishers a few times and even it's story was scrapped and completely reworked a few months before release\n\nSo in conclusion: like I said in the beginning of this review it's still a fun shooter with some interesting mechanics that weren't quite fully realized but at the end of the day is not really worth it's full price, just wait for a sale and you'll power through it in a few hours","May 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The story in itself is utterly slim and unattractive (and with quite the erratic narrative) :  a scientist, Krone, decied to found his own empire in an alternate timeline and you go after him. The end. No surprises, no twist, no incentive to continue.\nThe hero is a soulless mute, joining the Resistance just because and being ordered around, while nobody bats and eyelid at a suit guy appearing from nowhere and able to manipulate time around him.\nThere's a grand total of two timejumps !\n\nBut well, story is not meant to be the strongest point of a FPS. Problem is, the gameplay is also lacking. Not that it plays badly- on the opposite, it plays quite smoothly. But the game is far too easy. Your ability to slow time, combined with the quick regeneration of your health and a genous cooldown for time-controlling abilities, makes you near-invulnerable if you stay cautious. The game compensates by unleashing hordes of brainless soldiers, but it just makes the fights longer, not more interesting.\nThe puzzles are short of anything creative. A puddle of electrified water ? Stop the time, the water is solidified, go unscathed. The bridge is collapsing ? Activate return, walk on it as it goes back in time for your needs. It won't challenge your intellect, rest assured.\n\nThe weapons feel good, especially the explosive crossbow, but in the end you feel like you spend most of your times pushing buttons and going back. Cooke, the leader of the Resistance, yelling at you every twenty seconds in some sections till you accomplish the objective is quite unnerving.\nThe game is mercifully rather short- about 8 hours, without replay value. In a way, it's quite soothing because you stomp the ennemies with your arsenal and slow time capacity, but it was really clunky and uninspired at the time, it's not better now.\nIf you want a FPS with the Time them and a good dose of humor, try Time Splitters : Future Perfect. Else, even Singularity is more convincing than Timeshift : at least you interact with the world, you're not a mute puppet in a suit.\n\nSurely Saber Interactive is doing better now, but then they have also produced Battle Los Angeles...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/10130/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend TimeShift then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nSaber Interactive creates an epic first person shooter that allows you to manipulate time in order to solve puzzles and defeat hordes of enemies. TimeShift accomplishes what other games only can dream off with brilliant mechanics and fantastic gameplay elements.\n\nStory:\nTimeshift offers a game that essentially has no elements of a story until the entire campaign is completed. Don’t worry once the game is over you will finally be given the story. You play a scientist who is part of a team developing a suit that allows you to traverse time. Dr. Aiden Krone director of the project realizes the power that the suit holds and uses the Alpha suit to jump back in time. This gives him the ability to create a dystopia where he rules in an alternate timeline that parallels WWII. You take the Beta suit, a newer version that has not been tested, in order to jump back in time and bring Krone to his knees.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign consists of twenty-four levels, each of varying length and difficulty. The campaign is a combination of puzzle solving, first person shooters, and boss fights. You have to use your suits to reverse time, pause time, and slow time in order to get through traps, operate systems, and defeat enemies. With a combination of boss fights and hordes of enemies you must accomplish objectives. Overall the campaign should take about eight hours, depending on difficulty. With the difficulty selection you can control the strength and numbers of the enemies, but the difficulty of the puzzles cannot be adjusted. The puzzles allow the campaign to be entertaining even if the campaign is on easy.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game has nine weapons (KM-33, KM 2103 Karbine, Shattergun, Echo Rifle, ThunderBolt, E.M.F. Cannon, Bloodhound, Hell-Fire, and SurgeGun) and grenades. I found myself rarely using grenades throughout the campaign, because of the high weapon variability. Most of the guns have a secondary fire mode, which allows them to be versatile. Not only do you have a large variety of weapons to make the campaign entertaining, but you also have the ability to control time. The suit allows you to pause time, slow time, and reverse time. Each of these features can be used to change how the game plays. For example when enemies throw grenades you can reverse time in order to cause the grenades to go back to their host. You can pause time in order to heal yourself, and slow time to rush up to enemies and blast them before they can react. Time control combines elements of Max Paynes bullet time, and pushes it further with much more diversity.\n\nResults:\nTimeShift is a brilliant game that was ahead of tis time. The story is brilliant and complex, yet not clearly dictated. You will want to know what is going on, but after everything is over you will finally understand what happened. There are twenty-four levels and each level is of decent length. The gameplay offers both advanced concepts used in future titles, and also new concepts that although brilliant have never made an appearance again. With the ability to fully control time, either by outright stopping it, slowing it, and even reversing it creates a diverse game which combines all dimensions. TimeShift combines puzzle solving with action to create an epic adventure that is absolutely amazing. I would recommend TimeShift even if you pay full price, $19.99, it is still a good deal; although, if you can get TimeShift on sale it is a steal and I would completely recommend it.\n\nPros:\n+Ability to stop, slow, and reverse time.\n+Loads of weapons to mess around with that have secondary fire modes.\n+Fast paced combat\n+Puzzles that require you to use special tactics to solve.\n+There are loads of ammo boxes so you don’t ever feel low on ammo.\n+Epic boss fight that finishes the game in a bang.\n+Loads of enemies that make the game refreshing.\n\nCons:\n-The story doesn’t present itself till after you complete the entire campaign.\n-Controls are not as obvious and it took me a while to figure out I could look down the barrel.\n-Most of the weapons are not available till late in the game.\n","May 17, 2014","true","10.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The Time control mechanic works really nicely in this game, and that's when it evolves from run-of-the-mill to something special. It's a hidden gem, overlooked by the big boys of the time (Gears, CoD4, Halo 3 and so on).\n-You Can SLOW DOWN AND PAUSE TIME (This alows you to pull off some really neat looking kills, and hell even steal your\nopponet's weapon and shoot em' in the face)\n-You Can REWIND/REVERSE TIME (Ever had a nade thrown in your face, or the enemy spotting you too quickly and ruining your fairly stealthy approach?

I recommend this game for anyone who remembers the 2002-2007 era First Person Shooter games with warmth. This game is filled with a bunch of cliches, bad dialogue, flat characters and an uninteresting story, but my damn if it isn't worth a playthrough.\n\nThe game's general design incorporates the usage of time manipulation: slow-mo, stop and reverse. You are definitely not being dragged down by the storyline, but are instead left alone with you, a bunch of enemies and your powers most of the time. The strength of this title is definitely in those time abilities, as it doesn't get old to go into slow mo, shoot eight guys in the head with the shotgun and then go back and watch them fall to the ground instantly.\n\nIt's not a very long game and it's not too difficult. It's a good thing in this case, as variety isn't a featured element. Yes, there are a few vehicle and turret sections, but they're very short and, well, a little boring.\n\nOn the surface this title is far from perfect, but beneath it's got it's own charm.

Because the ending can be confusing if you weren't following along with the cutscenes or any of the dialog spoken by Krone during various instances.\n\nBefore I get into the game itself, a few things you should know if you want TimeShift to run properly on your system:\n\n1. Find the TimeShift.exe in the install folder and change the compatibility to Windows XP (SP3)\n\n2. Find and install patch 1.2 for the game as Steam/Activision only have it updated to 1.0 and you'll have a slew of problems.\n\nI'm pretty sure those two cover it, the game will run much more smoothly and won't/shouldn't freeze on any loading screen or when paused.\n\nI can't say I enjoyed the overall story in TimeShift, the whole stop a madman from ruining everything in a dystopia seemed rather generic. I did like that the protagonist stays unnamed and has ulterior motives when he jumps into the past to save the future. The gameplay was rather repetitive, running and gunning, going through vast buildings, pushing buttons, sometimes driving, using a turret, climbing up and down ladders. That's pretty much it. The saving grace with the gameplay is the time manipulation ability that comes with the Beta suit that the protagonist has. It's really cool, being able to stop time and seeing rain just frozen in mid air. Or reversing an action if you messed up. Or slowing down time/being able to move really fast.\n\nI guess my biggest complaint was how uninspired the story seemed at times. There's hardly any background as you're just thrown into a situation. I would compare the whole situation of a dystopian world and you're the hero to Half Life, but at least in Half Life, there's context given and side characters that explain the situation. The side characters in TimeShift are so minor that I actually thought they were expendable and was surprised when the small crew you're with for a large portion of the game survives. Granted, you're not actually with them; most of the time, they'll stay behind and let you do all the work.\n\nAt least the graphics are still pretty good. Obviously a bit dated being 8 years old now but the whole world had an atmosphere of 'wow, this place is really falling apart' and added so much to the overbearing dystopia. Sound design was pretty great too.\n\nAnyway, while it has a number of flaws, TimeShift still proved to be fun after I got it working.\n\n8/10","June 27, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can even rewind the time for a short while. This puts the game in another lighting - with this ability the game isn't just a standard FPS, because throught out the game you'll have to use you time changing abilities to solve a few puzzles. Also, it's always funny to stop time, charge in, shoot a few people in the head, start time again and see them thrown back.

The atmosphere is also somewhat unique consisting of a 1939 steampunk distopian world. The weapons all feel unique and provide different tactical arrangements given the situation your in. The 'gimmick' in this game is that you can slow, stop, and reverse time not only to defeat your enemies but also to solve puzzles. The game is also the right length, not too long for its own good but not short either. It knows exactly when its time is up.\n\nI also thought the level design was excellent and varied, although most of the levels revolve around the standard FPS gameplay their were other levels consisitng of driving and turret levels to keep things fresh.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe story is a bit hard to follow at first and its hard to care about any of the characters in the game.\nThe game can also be a bit frustrating especially towards the end of the game.\nThe game is also very rushed near the end leading to a very anticlimatic battle.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game really surprised me, and highly underatted. The level design and areas reminded me a lot of half life 2 although no where near the same quality and that is the biggest problem with the game.

I played this game in 2008 but dropped it soon after I started.  And the reason was poor storytelling.  This time I was more patient and clever.\n\nWell, firs thing first: now I tell you what this game actually about. Our protagonist works in some very advanced research facility  where they develop suits  which can manipulate time. But it is clearly understandable is he a scientist or some kind of science CIA agent to watch over scientists do not use their inventions in some "improper" way like your antagonist did. And head of research team was one badass scientist named Krone who stole of suits, blew up the facility, jumped back in time and made himself a dictator. Well, he oppressed the people, and the was a rebellion. And we jumped in time to the end of the rebellion.\nThis is the moment you star playing this game and you see only grey concrete around, ugly city, revolutionaries who look like hobos and terrorists, you get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol and machine gun, you cannot manipulate time, you get a feeling that you constantly loosing and finally you see how rebellion...failed.\n\nThis is the time when fun starts. Your suit sends you back in time several days before the rebellion. And you get a shotgun and grenades and this grenades are sticky...and electricizing. The stick to an enemy and he is screaming "Oh, my god explosives. Hit the deck" while been bitten by electric current and then BAM! And now you can manipulate time: stop, reverse and slow. Well you user "reverse" to get to some places to advance in the game, "slow" is for slow motion as in every other game except everything you do happen in usual timeline, for example you throw a grenade in "slow" and while enemies run in slo-mo and scream in slow-mo it explodes with usual speed, and with "stop" you can come to bunch of enemies and take their weapons from their hands and the listen how they say kinda "well, dude, you see we are unarmed so...move along".\n\nAnd you storm prison and stronghold.  And you get sniper rifle and rocket launcher and crossbow with exploding bolts and hand cannon with exploding ammo and machine gun with flammable ammo and electro gun. And you meet enemies with jetpacks, kinetic shield enemies, enemies who can manipulate time and teleport enemies and enemy heavy walker and helicopters. And then you hijack big flyers...well, a lot of stuff will happen in this game. And with all this stuff you kinda do some corrections to the course of rebellion and for it outcome.\n\nAnd exploding barrels! LOTS OF THEM!!!\n\nBut still because of poor storytelling you will keep asking yourself: who are these people around you? why are you with them? why? why?\n\nSo if you put aside shady beginning, lack of storytelling and sudden end it is 2007 rail shooter at best. 7/10.","May 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I can safely say that even now, it still gives me that amazed feeling(even though pc controls are a bit difficult for me). The gameplay is good. The time manipulation mechanic works to keep combat fresh, as well as a puzzle solving tool. It reminds me a lot of Half-Life 2 not only in the gameplay, but the story as well(minus the time manipulation stuff). It looks nice, even on the lowest settings and my dinosaur of a computer can still run it fine. It is a bit dated, I mean it was made in 2007 so what can you expect? I would definitely recommend giving it try for $5.00. I'm not sure if it's worth the full $20.00 price though....

I found this game clunky and quite silly in some respects. A major issue I had is the number of bullets you must put into enemies, though there is at least enough ammo dropped to refund you there. But when it takes vital extra seconds to make sure they're definitely dead after that nearly 20 bullets point-blank, that then causes you to die repeatedly from the sheer volume of AI surrounding you, that each seem able to severely cripple you, then it becomes rather annoying. The controls are not exactly set up the best as default either, and it doesn't help when you have to use those strange controls to stop the game using the 'amazing' time powers (which are not able to be utilised as well as they could) for you and wasting the charge on them, as well as throwing off any rhythm you manage to achieve.\nOverall, though it has potential to be enjoyed, and I am sure many can, I do not reccomend it for those reasons, as I believe that it has not the quality to have enough fun to be worth it. Feel free to try, however, as it may get better later in the game.

Ultimately, Timeshift feels just gimmicky - and it exhausts it's bag of tricks very fast. I had fun shooting an explosive bolt into a guy's head with time frozen and watching him suddenly become inert gibs. A couple of the weapon are very interesting, regardless - a submachine gun with incendiary rounds and attached flamethrower was different enough to become a favorite -, but their designs are, again, uninspired (What the hell is that assault rifle?!), and the audio and feedback lacks any punch (though the shotgun WILL send people flying... after maybe two or three shots at close range.)\nThe game quickly devolved into slow-motion dashing through cover while waiting for the limited time-resource to recharge.\nIn the end, Timeshift didn't offer enough freedom to abuse my timepowers nor enough challenge or solid gameplay to constitute a good shooter - in this regard, it didn't achieve either a sandbox I could blow steam off in nor a challenging game I could be engaged in. Instead, it forced me to play it like a shooter with a fun-but-repetitive gimmick I could enjoy every forty seconds - and it doesn't have enough foundation as a shooter to force me into that. F.E.A.R. provides a far more enjoyable experience - in which the time effect, while not as varied - supports a much better game - and one that stands on its own without the gimmick.","April 5, 2015","false","7.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

The first level or so were a bit so so but the game takes off after that.

I don't usually have the concentration to finish any games these days but this one was short and sweet enough for me to enjoy... I paid $3.75 on special and the game is worth probably around that region due to it's short campaign.\n\nThere are minor little "bugs" throughout the game but more of a polish issue but this didn't detract from the game either.\n\nThe voice acting wasn't aweful but not perfect either, often the response to enemy comrade deaths was a bit weak "He's dead" in an unsurprised manner...

All of the alternate future weaponry looks cool, but none of it has any weight. The storyline is, to be perfectly blunt, as basic as you can get. A faceless, voiceless protagonist, who follows the orders of a ragtag resistance movement helps them obtain victory during certain engagements leading up to an assault on a walking tower ... fortress thing? This is a game that tries to tell you it's a lot grander in scope than it actually is. The plot has enough holes (not only thanks to time travel, but weird, inconsistant writing) to make the stoy not worth actually listening to, and the levels are rail straight, there's no exploration and very minimal interaction outside of "Slow time down to bypass this air vent,"  ....\n\nIn fact, if I look back on the environmental interactivity, I'd be hard pressed to list more than 5 different things you really need time manipulation for, and some of those don't make any sense narratively anyways!\n\nSlow Time: Killing Enemies without getting torn to shreds yourself. This is a must. Cover is barely available and your shields are only able to take one or two shots, while enemies can take half a clip or more to kill, and usually come in waves of 6+.\n\nSlow Time: Avoid Environmental hazard A,B,C etc (Ruptured gas lines on fire, electrified pools)\n\nSlow / Stop Time: Avoide Mechanical Hazard A,B,C etc (Fan blades in a vent, Giant Fan Blade over Chasm, Instant kill Cutting laser security beams, more fans)\n\nReverse Time: Engadge mechanical system which would let you pass through it into the next section, but only if it were going backwards. Open doors, previously opened by something moving through it so you can pass into the next area. Rinse, repeat.\n\nHere's the thing about time manipulation. If you're going to give a player the ability to slow, stop and rewind time by a Phlebotinum powered onesy, for god's sake give them more than 3 seconds of the power in the middle of their firefights. The amount of suit energy any one power would drain was completely different at different times. They don't even try to explain it. Quote Wikipedia:\n\nThe key feature of TimeShift is the player's ability to control time: slowing, stopping or even rewinding time more or less at will. This allows a player to stop time to dodge an incoming projectile or steal an enemy's weapon. Specific time-related puzzles also require these abilities. In some parts of the game the time powers are lengthened.\n\nIn some parts, the powers are lengthened. Sweet. Caramel. Zombie. Buckshot.\n\nYou can literally walk into an area and be killed within a second by enemies who target you. Using the Slow Time power outside of any pre-approved "tactical recommendations" from the Timesuit's AI results in your suit power being guzzled faster than you can say "Out of power, on open ground being shot at by ten enemy characters."\n\nHowever, in EXTREMELY similar situations, or in situations where there IS no enemy presence, time slow, time stop and even time reverse powers seem to be magically more power efficient. And let's be clear. We're not talking about a local time shift. We're not talking about alternate universe jumps. This is literally a game where they promise to give you the power to bend time as you want, then tell you for no good reason you can't do it for more than a few seconds, when ten minutes ago, you were making it fifteen minutes ago with enough power left over to charge your fitbit.\n\nZero crunchy combat, promised time manipulation powers that are as railroading as the envrionments, disappointing, prosaic story. It delivers on the action/shooter front and that is it. If it's on sale, and you want an FPS you can tuck away after 7 hours and never think of again, get it. Otherwise, avoid.\n\nCheers.","December 13, 2014","false","9.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.\n\nEdit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.","November 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This game is a narrative trainwreck, which sucks because a lot of it has so much potential that you can see rotting on the vine.\n\nFirst off, this game doesn't handle multiple monitors very well.  I've had to turn off my side 2 through nVidia control panel to make it play nice. Every time the game starts up, it opens a little pop up saying I've got incompatible drivers and sends me to nvidia's homepage to download the latest drivers which I already have. Older game, hard to program forward compatibility, but whatever, I can deal with that. Not impressed, but not enough to kill it either.\n\nGameplay: This is a generic linear corridor shooter with a gimmick of limited time control. You can slow time down, stop time and reverse time.  And that's about it. It's not even as much fun as it sounds. What would have been more interesting is an open level approach with multiple solutions, instead of forcing the player down a single path and having the only option to be to shoot everyone. The time control features are introduced within 5 minutes of the opening level, and other than some weapons, that’s about it. The weapons themselves tend to flip flop between underpowered pea-shooter and BFG9000. There’s no character customization, only about 6 weapons total, a few have some alt-fire which is easily ignored and forgotten.  A better way of doing this would be a leveling system that lets the player choose how they want to accomplish their objectives: perhaps some would like to do things stealthy, others like the time manipulation tools, still others prefer to load up on heavy armor, big guns, and shoot friends and foes alike until there’s nothing left but smoking ash. Some variety.\n\nThe AI is forgettable. They mostly just stand there, or get into poor cover while shouting about what kind of gun you have, request reinforcements, or repeat the same few canned lines again and again and again. They make up for their stupidity in sheer numbers and by killing you in a few shots.\n\nStory wise, don’t even bother. You’re dropping into an alternate timeline around 1939, but might as well be 2100 with all the future tech running around. There’s the generic evil empire vs the good rebels, but I constantly found myself asking “Who are these people and why should I care about any of this.”  You see some of the present in flashbacks, but don’t expect it to answer any questions. It might have raised a few questions, but by then I didn’t even care.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Deus Ex or Dishonored instead.","April 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","3"

Pitiful story, worse gunplay, and gimmicky timeshift mechanics.\n\nFirst of all, there is no sprint, which wouldn't be a problem but the main character casually walks in the most life threatening situations. You can often die trying to walk to cover when your time powers run out. It tried to make you think about where you should be as you run out of powers but it's more like putting anvils on your shoes and calling it a design choice.\n\nThe time powers were also a very big disappoint. Neat concepts but the execution was very poor. The time rewind and time stop use so much power it seems they were only put in to solve the extremely simple time "puzzles"; such as walking over the millions of electrified puddles. Time slow is about 90% of power usage as it's the only power that gives you any real chance in combat vs more than one soldier.\n\nNow the gunplay isn't the worse I've seen in a game, but the way enemies can soak up about half of a magazine til death makes even the best FPSer turn into a camper while his OP slow time power comes back. I was never a fan of the bullet sponge enemies because it makes combat more gimmicky and campy. Even if you are quicker than the enemy it doesn't matter when you have to go through half a mag to kill one enemy while 2 others are shooting. Combat tends to be either slaughter everyone while in time slow mode then camp to wait for power to come back, or spam grenades for one hit kills then pick up more from their bodies. The only time combat felt somewhat fair outside of time slow was either the ballistic crossbow or sniping headshots, and even then enemies all had pinpoint accuracy from a mile away; and mouse sensitivity is iffy and ignores small movements when zoomed in too far in scope.\n\nThe game also doesn't understand what pacing or transitions are. The weapons go from the weakest assault rifle ever made, to the most overpowered weapons. The game goes from frustrating to super easy mode with the one shot crossbow, or infinite ammo boxes with a sniper or rocket launcher next to them. It still ends up being time slow then murder everyone; it just gets easier being able to one shot everyone before they murder you with pinpoint accuracy from a mile away when your time slow runs our and you are out of cover.\n\n\nI mean, for an old game it isn't as bad as what I've seen, but it definitely doesn't deserve all the praise  when it really is just semi-unique and but a very gimmicky one trick pony","May 6, 2014","false","5.6"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

The time control mechanics make regular combat insultingly easy, even against the enhanced enemies. By the end I was just breezing through the fights.

It is not; I stand by my point: this game sucks, and I am pretty sure that the reason why bad reviews are systematically poorly noted is that there are people who's interest is to sel... erm, downvote bad reviews of that game. DO NOT BUY. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.\n\nI expect this review to be poorly noted (around 0%, maybe a bit more if I'm lucky to be read by someone honest), just like ANY other bad review on this game (I won't write here what are my takes on "why", I let the reader figure out by himself why ALL the bad reviews on this game are poorly noted, whatever they may contain).\n\nThis game is not a pretty game. It's from 2007 but looks like it was from the early 2000 (LOTS of bump mapping, low-def textures, bad animations, very low poly models, etc. - I'm, of course, running the game on "best" settings for everything; and honestly, as pointed out by one of my contacts, it's not due to the engine, which is pretty solid for the epoch, but rather to the lack of artistical direction, and very poor graphical choices). This game isn't a fun game either: the gameplay is utterly repetitive, the immersion is inexistent, there is no challenge either, and the time-based mechanics are interesting for a few minutes at best.\n\nThe player is left without any instruction, without any guidance on how to use the controls, without any background story, without anything that can help immerison, or interest: to imagine what playing this game is, just imagine downloading a random indie FPS with funny, unusual controls, with a random map, and stupid A.I., and you'll get close to what that game is.\n\nI haven't played enough to give more insight about that crap, but I surely regret having spent 5 bucks into that. There are PLENTY of better games to buy, from Singularity (that also features some time-control mechanics) to Hard Reboot, and so on. Don't waste your time (especially) or money on that one, not worth it by any extent.","May 2, 2014","false","9.4"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","7","24","0","0"

It's just unnatural. Starts with the default key bindings which are far off from what the average FPS is using: Zooming in is done with 'e', a melee attack by clicking the mouse wheel, the powers use awkward keys. There is no sprint, you get slightly faster additionally when slowing down time, but energy recovery is far too slow.\nOn "Skilled", it takes up to three shots with a shotgun to the head if they enemy's wearing a helmet. I fire away an entire mag with the assault rifle to the body. Luckily you get a lot of ammo, however you still heavily depend on using your time shifting abilities. But as said, the energy recovers way too slowly for such a heavy use.\n\nYou don't get any information on who you are are what the ♥♥♥♥ even happened. You suddenly appear in 1939 of an alternative world where a high tech civil uprising takes place instead of WWII. It's just your standard, linear, straight-forward FPS with special abilities in which difficulty doesn't mean a more human-like AI, but rougher enemies with increased health and armor and more bullets for you to take.

Being able to control time to some extent is awesome, slowing time down to make it easier to kill enemies, stopping time to pass a hazard of some sort or even rewind ot to get access to a passage that was destroyed only moments ago, is simply awesome. The enemies even acknowledge it, when you stop time, move to a different location and the enemies then see you there, saying something like "He can warp" and be totally surprised, makes you feel awesome and powerful. As i said, the game is pretty short, you see the ending ina good day of playing it, but at least the developers did a good job utilising the time-warping mechanics.\nThe story ends with a kind of cliffhanger, we are oblivious to the fate of our character, so a sequel might be possible and i would wish for one.","March 24, 2012","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechanic of controlling the flow of time offers a rather unique and interesting perspective on the first person shooter, and this is where timeshift shines. An enemy is firing at me. I can a) shoot him in the face, b) stop time, steal his gun and unfreeze time to watch him flail in confusion before bashing him, or c) slow time, dodge his bullets matrix-style and headshot him and his eight teammates before they can call reinforcements. It's good that this freedom of choice is around, as the plot leaves something to be desired. The story is rather bland and not very fleshed out, the characters are dry and sometimes annoying, and the AI can be nothing short of stupid at times. Regardless, the game is fun.

I had to fiddle with ini configuration files to increase resolution and make it automatically decide to use the other monitor (good luck if you have multiple monitors with the same resolution).\nEspecially in the tutorial, I noticed *big* hung-ups when I entered new areas, even rooms, where it probably loaded some data. A bit later, you occasionally slow down, simply walking a lot slower, which probably hides the loadung unresponsiveness. Hung-ups are definitely not something you like to see on a powerful PC.\nWhen launching, it tells me my drivers are not supported, twice, and links me to a dead website.\n\nAll in all, I had no fun at all in the little I played (I did press through the tutorial to see if the game itself, with the time manipulation aspect was any fun, but it was not), and with the technological issues, I’m thinking about refunding the game - because I certainly won’t play it any more.\nDefinitely no recommendation.","September 29, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No death was too annoying to stop playing, though a couple of times I had to take breaks from slight bugs (rewind time puzzle segments are SOMETIMES finnicky, you just have to activate it in the right place, plus one objective didn't react well to saving and loading, but it was an easy and relatively short one that was optional anyway). Not entirely sure what was going on with the plot, but what of it that I did get was really cool. I wish there was going to be a sequel, and the game is expertly set up for one, but I think it wasn't enough of a success to warrant one.\n\nWould recommend, even at full price, weapon selection is excellent (and try out all the alternate fires, seriously), time abilities are awesome, useful and not too broken, plot was not handed to you on a silver platter and was actually intelligent (plus it actually DIDN'T answer all the questions, which makes you think about it), and the final boss fight is SUPER satisfying (if not particularly difficult once you get the artillery dodging pattern down, but I only figured that out on the last barrage).\n\nPlus, I got to blow up Time Stalin's Bolo, then execute Time Stalin himself.","August 1, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to follow a bad guy who leaped to the past and kill him so there wasn't any complication. The key feature of the gameplay is 3 time-shifting commands.\n\nSlow - slow down the environment and speed up yourself. Mostly used in combat.\nStop - stop the environment to make yourself immortal for a moment. Very effective but doesn't last long.\nReverse - reverse time of the environment. Often used in puzzels.\n\nThe difficulty of the gameplay is relatively easy. If you're skilled at shooting then you may find a bit boring. The lure is dedicated by its atmosphere and time-shifting abilities. The experience of similar FPSs such as F.E.A.R series will help you grasp the way to use the abilities in the earlier stage. I enjoyed most part of battles since I could overwhelm a bunch of enemies who are strong if usual, with the help of abilities. I wondered whether there was any kind of time-paradox theme or something like that, but I don't know at last.","November 9, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/recommended/10130/","varanisridari","Varanis Blackclaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/","74 products in account","This early unsung hero produced by Sabre Interactive is a cult classic that would form the basis of the portfolio, get them hired on to produce Halo: Anniversary, and would see ideas put forth in this game recycled by a different developer into the much more successful game Singularity (produced by Raven Software). Unlike that title, which used industry-standard Unreal III graphics and fairly safe gameplay, TimeShift utilized propriety engine technology developed by Sabre themselves that allowed for time manipulation  resembling a beefed-up version of the "Bullet Time" slow-mo effects found in games such as Max Payne. Players could not only slow down time, but stop it altogether or even reverse it, with all physics suspended or undone entirely during manipulation. This allowed for all kinds of neat tricks like stealig enemies' weaponry and replacing them with live grenades, etc. Furthermore, this proprietary tech also made possible then-impressive real-time shadows and bump-mapped textures on par with titles like Doom 3 ; the level of detail in the environments and draw distance on things is still quite impressive.\n\nSadly, this game was semi-doomed from the start, as the original finished product was rejected and the game was sent back for an entire additional year of polish, which didn't help it contend against heavy hitters like Halo 3 and Bioshock, since the game was mainly pushed on consoles and not PC before digital distribution would be mainstream enough for this game to reach it's proper audience more quickly, Other nitpicks include a somewhat byzantine story that waxes on Half-Life 2 more than it cares to admit, and herky-jerky controls that take more time than some are going to put into the game to make second nature.\n\nHowever, if one fancies a time-travelling tale wrapped in a futuristic dystopian shooter with some really well-implemented time manipulation tricks and shinier-than-expected visuals for the period, then there literally isn't anything else like this game. Again, Singularity met with more success, but arguably this game did it better.","February 17","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
