As a very big fan of the original, I have to admit, at the start off this game, with the different controls and lackluster main character, I was thinking I wouldn't be a fan of this one and in turn, would end up being disappointed or would avoid the 3rd game, Dreamfall: Chapters- this ended up not being the case. The story is a 3rd person adventure/puzzle (WSAD/arrow key movement, not Point & Click) with minimal fighting and frequent puzzles. The puzzles aren't terribly challenging and only 1 part of the game has you do a lot of back & forth "fetching". You swap between 3 roles or characters in the game with the main character being a new girl, Zoe. Chat can be fast forwarded with the space bar, game is saveable at any idle time (non-conversation/cut scene), and, sadly, the game does not allow full screen windowed, which is something I enjoy in many games due to my dual monitor set up.\n\nPros\n-Game is now realized in a full 3D environment. Graphically much better than TLJ.\n-Main character, Zoe, grows and changes from when introduced to the end of the game. I really appreciated this as I initially was very uninterested in her.\n-Story developed nicely. It was slow in the start and middle as it built up. The last couple hours of the game I felt very attached and well immersed.\n-Puzzles weren't bad and most were easily solved without external assistance. I do want to call out I always use a guide in point & click games because, honestly, I just don't have the time for all the trial and error and I really do enjoy the stories of these games.\n-Once you figure out the controls, the WSAD keys, Space Bar, and Tab can control your inventory, action wheel, and every other in game action needed- very easy to play from a laid back position.\n\nCons\n-Movement and camera control gave me motion sickness during the game, especially at the start as I adjusted sensitivity and tried multiple configurations to find the "sweet spot". Eventually I gave up and primarily used the movement turn keys to control the camera turn.\n-The combat was dumb. Controls were clunky and fighting was unneeded. This was during the time where game devs were trying new features and hitting as many check boxes as possible.\n-Main character was kinda pathetic in the introduction and start of the game. I really felt she started to hit her stride when she arrived at Japan.\n-Focus mode was mostly pointless and forgotten the majority of the game. A couple puzzles required it, otherwise it didn't do too much.\n-1 Part of the game had you go fetch quest items, back and forth, twice. I really missed the ability the double click the edge of the map to instantly move- something found in other Point & Click Adventure games (Deponia trilogy & TLJ, for example).\n\nTL;DR/Bottom line: Get the original, The Longest Journey, and this game, the sequel, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, as soon as you can afford it. I highly recommend them both and they go on sale together for $6.24 at the lowest. The 3rd game, Dreamfall: Chapters released 2 days ago (10.21.2014) and is, at the time of this writing, receiving very positive reviews.","October 23, 2014","true","11.7"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","1"

The game is a sequel to a classic adventure game released in 1998 called The Longest Journey. It is not necessary to play the original TLJ to play Dreamfall, but it helps a lot, since the game universe and many characters are the same. The game is very heavy on story, dialogue, and cinematics, and light on puzzles and gameplay.\n\nStory: the story is both the best and the worst I have ever seen in an adventure game. In the last two years I have completed 12 adventure games including old classics and modern indies. Dreamfall has a very complex and compelling story involving several interesting characters, political movements, and the complex game universe. It includes elements of comedy, drama, and tragedy. The story really gathers steam toward the end, resolving one storyline while introducing several more. Then, in the middle of the gathering drama and revelations, the game suddenly ends with no resolution to the fate of a dozen major characters and a dozen major plotlines. This is perhaps the most unsatisfying ending I have ever seen in a game, movie, book etc. Even if they did plan on a sequel, this was just plain terrible. I know a lot of people hated The Empire Strikes Back because of the unresolved plot lines. This is 100x worse.\n\nGameplay: there are a few puzzles that require some thought, but overall the mental challenge of this game is on the light side for an adventure game. It is a little unfair to say that this is just an interactive movie, there are some clever puzzles. Unfortunately there are many times you are just sent on a mission to fetch a particular item and bring it to a particular place. The purpose of these brainless missions is to trigger cut-scenes that move the story along. A lot of the action takes place in small rooms and tunnels. This means the camera that follows you has to zoom in and out a lot. I suppose this is a problem with any 3-d third-person game, but it can make you a bit dizzy. The interface was tweaked to be more "console friendly". This makes it a little more clunky for the PC, but not terrible.\n\nFighting and stealth: the developers added a few fights and a few stealth sequences in the game. The fighting is flat out a waste of time. Just stand in front of your enemy and smash the mouse button and you win. Either that, or the enemy is so tough you always lose. The stealth sequences were much better, although they did not really fit in an adventure game. I like to play adventure games leisurely, with one hand on the mouse and the other hand holding a cup of coffee. I don't want action.\n\nGraphics: the graphics are dated by 2013 standards, but they are nice, especially the Dreamcore sequence. The close-up shots of faces look the worst. Lots of cut-scenes, some of which are pretty cool.\n\nSound: there seems to be a lot of interesting music and sounds, much better than the typical adventure game.\n\nOverall, from the quality of the story, to the quality of the sound and graphics, to the overall scope of the game, this had the potential to be EASILY the best adventure game of all time. Unfortunately the game was crippled by bizarre decisions by the developers: the mega-cliffhanger ending, the introduction of bad action elements, the clunky interface, the too-easy puzzles. What were they thinking?","January 12, 2014","true","17.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

April Ryan is back although her cheerful spirit is distored after what had happened in the previous game and therefore I recommend playing The Longest Journey first. Zoë, from the world of science, will be fighting a huge corporation while searching for her best friend. Kian, from the world of magic, finds himself torn between his faith and what his leaders tell him to do. All these three characters will get to interact with each other and controlling them, throughout the 14 hours that this title offers, is really great fun. You'll need to solve a few minigame puzzles (hacking), find ways to enter dangerous areas by putting enviroment to use and meet numerous people who always have something interesting to say. I wouldn't like to compare Dreamfall with TLJ since they are very different. They stayed similar in things that matter though and I appreciate that with 10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quelluomo00/recommended/6300/","quelluomo00","GORILLA.BAS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quelluomo00/","593 products in account","I'm very, VERY disappointed.\n\nThis game is a sequel to "The Longest Journey", a point-and-click adventure released in 1999.\nI bought both games one year ago, and finally got some spare time, enough to play them both.\nTLJ was simply beautiful. It had good puzzles (and a couple of difficult ones); I instantly fell in love with the world, the characters and the story.\n\nThen I started playing Dreamfall.\nYou can clearly tell this game was born in an age when classic point-and-click adventures were dead, and the developers started using different mechanics for them (Grim Fandango comes to mind, but that was actually a wonderful game). Also, Dreamfall was developed in a period when consoles were the main target. This combination caused a long string of very bad design decisions that affect the game negatively.\n\nHere are some aspects of the game I'd like to talk about.\n\nThe ControlsAs soon as the first cutscene ended, I noticed a certain difficulty in interacting with the game. The controls are AWFUL. So awkward and counterintuitive. It is clearly designed with controllers in mind, so I said "Hey, I'll just use my Xbox360 Wireless Controller". But it didn't even work. And if you're planning to use one and you somehow manage to make it work, you still need some third party software to bind the triggers to keyboard keys because they won't work otherwise. So, after 30 minutes of googling and tweaking of input options, I ended up playing the game with keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe CameraOh, the pain we must endure. This is supposed to be a game about exploration, about searching the environment for clues and items to solve puzzles (I'll talk about "puzzles" later). The way the camera is implemented makes it so frustrating to even look around in smaller rooms. It just gets in the way. Not that there's a lot to look at, anyways. Gone are the descriptions of places, objects and such. There's so much less. And it's written so poorly.\n\nThe Main Gameplay and PuzzlesNonexistant, basically. You have a couple of minigames that you will need to play 5-6 times during the entire span of the game (the hacking one, and the lockpicking one). They're both extremely easy.\nThere's never been a single moment where I was stuck in this game. The puzzles, which should constitute a good portion of the gameplay, are instead few and boring. The inventory space is very limited, but it's not a problem, since I don't think I ever held more than 5 items at the same time (counting your mobile phone and a lockpick that you always have with you, so that makes it 3). With some characters, you even play big portions of the game without any item whatsoever. At some point, you feel like the game consists only of walking, talking to people, and watching cutscenes. 10-12 hours of cutscenes.\nSo, puzzles are not a big thing in this one. They instead decided to dilute the gameplay with...\n\nStealth and CombatSeriously, this is the sequel to a point-and-click. It's mainly story-driven. so, WHY ON STARK did the designers think that STEALTH and COMBAT sections were a good idea, I honestly cannot fathom.\nStealth sections are EVIL. Note to all devs: DO NOT put stealth "missions" in ANY kind of game that does not make stealth its primary mechanic. It's frustrating and boring at the same time, and it just has no point whatsoever. You get caught, you have to redo the section. Now combine this with awful camera and controls. Oh, the FUN!\nOh, and the combat. Dull, buggy and boring to death. I honestly don't know why they put combat in this. Luckily you don't get to fight a lot, but still... it's like Serious Sam with crosswords in it. It breaks the flow. Badly.\n\nThe CharactersYou will control 3 characters throughout the game:\nZoe. She's the "main" character of the game, and gets the most screentime. Some people disliked her, but I actually liked her since the beginning.\nKian. He should play the role of the "Zelous assassin that will slowly come to question the dubious actions of his religious order". But he gets at most 20-30 minutes of screen time during the whole game, provided you don't get lost (which is quite hard in this game). They don't give you enough time and depth to actually see his transformation, or to actually care about him in general. Could have easily been an NPC.\nApril. By the Balance, girl. What have they done to you? You suck so much in this game. What a sad, sad person you've become. I loved you in TLJ, you were fantastic. Now you're an empty, self-loathing shell.\n\nThe StoryNOTE: I don't consider what follows too "spoilery", but I will be talking about the ending in a general sense, trying to not reveal more than the necessary.\nSo this game has its flaws, I got it. And I forced myself to play it, because I loved the first TLJ and I really liked the story of Dreamfall. And you get to rivisit some of TLJ locations, and assist to events that you knew happened if you played TLJ. And I think this is just awesome.\nSo I pushed on. And I played avidly despite the awful gameplay because, well, the story is all this game has to offer, and it's actually pretty good.\nAnd when the story is at its peak, it all abruptly ends with the BIGGEST, most cruel cliffhanger ever done. It just ends.\nThey managed to close a single arc about an insignificant "The Ring Girl" character that you don't really care about during the whole game. And they leave 10-15 threads not just open, but brutally cut. Including the ones about the 3 main characters, whose fate is unknown. Hell, the fate of the WORLDS is unknown. This enraged me to no ends. I played the whole game just to see the ending, and I got NOTHING out of it. It's like they ran out of money and they had to cut this short. And by "cut" I mean "just leave it this way and maybe we'll make a sequel in 8 years where we'll (hopefully) fix this mess".\nI ragequit as soon as the credits began rolling.\n\n\nSo, TL;DR.\nAwkward controls and camera management; it's impossible to enjoy the scenery. Then again, you won't be able to analyze half of the things you should be able to in a game like this. Terrible inventory system, but it's not such a big deal since the game has very few puzzles in the first place, and they are all boringly easy. Frustrating stealth sections and dull, boring combat sections, mechanics which were hastily developed and don't belong to this genre anyways. Some great characters but some terrible ones as well. Great story, but AWFUL, rage-inducing incomplete ending with huge cliffhanger.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say so, DO NOT spend money on this game. It's a 12 hours long, frustrating, and incomplete cutscene.\nIf you loved the first TLJ like me, wait until the last of the Dreamfall: Chapters is released, so that you can at least get a complete story out of it.","December 23, 2014","false","12.8"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","37","56","4","4"

A must buy for adventure fans who love a good story,\n\nFirst, you should know that this is a sequel to the game The Longuest Journey, also available on Steam. You should play that game first for story continuity, and it is a good adventure game as well.\n\nThe story is what made me fall in love with this game. The well paced plot keeps you interested throughout, while well written dialogue and excellent voice acting made the characters believable, and even pretty darn likable. Zoe and Kian, two of the three characters you will play as, are particularly very charismatic.\n\nThe other staple of an adventure game are the puzzles. The worst scenario for a player is to be stuck on a puzzle they cannot solve, which is not a problem at all in this game, as puzzles are relatively easy, and consequently do not slow down story progression.\n\nThe scenery is simply breathtaking: varried, colorful, and beatiful. Don't just take my word for it, look at the screenshots above. Graphically, the game still looks good (current year 2013).\n\nAround 4 or 5 times in the game, you are asked to fight. The game suddenly changes to an action game, the controls of which are awkward, and the experience felt unpolished.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/6300/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Dreamfall, the second TLJ game is, as far as sequels go, extremely well done.  Dreamfall takes the original Point-and-Click adventure theme and takes it to full 3D.  I was amazed at how true to the world this game is.  I had just finished TLJ and was so engrossed by it I immediately moved to Dreamfall, and there were numerous places that you explore in TLJ that are revisted to almost pixel-perfect replication of their 2D counterparts - or - recognizable, and yet changed by time.  The attention to detail is outstanding - I distinctly remember a point where a familiar character is writing in a book and narrating what he's writing and if you look closely you can see that the words he is writing are actually what the narrator is saying, not scribbles or obscured text.  I found that impressive for a game released in 2006.  To go with this 3D update, the player is given a much improved settings configuration, along with full controller support, which I found nice since Dreamfall really works well with one.  Also, while TLJ had beautiful backgrounds the character models were pretty dated; however, in Dreamfall, everything is quite beautiful.  The textures are good and the world is vibrant and alive.\n\nOne of my favorite things about TLJ was the voice acting.  While the VA is good in Dreamfall, I felt that TLJ had more outliers for the VAs.  In TLJ some people *really* nailed their part, but some really failed.  The median voice acting performance in Dreamfall is better than TLJ, but that also means these standout performances are unfortunately lacking.  Another major problem this game has is the combat.  It adds a sense of urgency to the game, unlike in TLJ you can actually lose and have to reload, and that's fine, but the combat is slow-paced, clunky, and just downright terrible.  I would have preferred removing it entirely.  There are also sneaking sections in the game and they could have been improved as well.  Coupled with these "failable" sections is an autosave feature, which is nice, as I usually find myself sucked into these games so much that I forget to save after awhile.  They're well placed and non-intrusive.\n\nGameplay wise I like the puzzles in Dreamfall much more than in TLJ.  In TLJ the puzzles were extremely convoluted at times.  In Dreamfall the puzzles make sense; for example, you need to make a torch, so you get a broken axe handle, a rag, dip it in petrol and light it - it makes sense and is easy to figure out through intuition.  There is also less backtracking than TLJ had, which is nice, keeping the storyline progressing and the pacing of the game better.\n\nThe main reason I love The Longest Journey is the plot and storyline and Dreamfall is a worthy successor in this regard.  There are recurring faces and familiar places, but since the game takes place ten years after the events of the previous all have changed, some good, some bad, but they are all well done.  The game also plays more on the creepy side TLJ had, setting up a sense of mystery and horror.  The developers also took advantage of their new engine, making the game extremely cinematic and utilizing four different points of view, granting the player control of different characters to explore the world and storyline.\n\nPros:\n\nStory/Narrative/Pacing/Characterization\nNice Variations in Setting\nLogical Puzzles\nAttention to Detail\n\nCons:\n\nCombat\nNo Map\nFew Minor Bugs\nEnding?\n\nWhile it isn't *necessary* to play TLJ before Dreamfall I would highly recommend it, especially since the first game is so good.  I really appreciated the developers staying true to the world they created in the previous game.  That said, the combat was awful, and it's impossible to overlook it.  The ending also doesn't resolve everything in the game.  Had I played this when it was released I would be furious; however, now that Chapters has been kickstarted I can wait a few more months to see how Dreamfall wraps up.  I'd really like to rank this game in the As; however, with these issues cited, I'm going to have to keep it on the very upper edge of the B range.

The whole game made me wish for less tacked-on combat and stealth and more of the point-and-click puzzle solving that made TLJ a great game. The few puzzles it did feature weren't much of a challenge and didn't require much logical thinking to solve.\n\nStill, the voice acting, environments, and entertaining characters made this game worth playing. I loved seeing all of the familiar faces as well as some interesting new characters. Despite being released in 2006, the environments delivered some solid scenery porn that holds up today. The story was also compelling enough to make me play to the end.\n\nWith Dreamfall Chapters in development, this is a must play. If you can overlook its shortcomings and focus on the story, you'll definitely enjoy Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.\n\n","September 13, 2014","true","12.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

TLJ is a masterpiece in storytelling and has some of the most well written characters in any game. Dreamfall is the sequel to TLJ and it follows a new protagonist and has a new plot but it all takes place in Stark and Arcadia again.\n\nNow, I need to make this perfectly clear: TLJ is a classic point-and-click adventure. Dreamfall is not. Dreamfall is a third-person action/adventure game. This sets the game apart quite a bit; they are not the same type of game.\n\nThe lore is definetly the main part of both games and it's amazing. The two worlds, Stark and Arcadia, has a lot of wonderfull characters and creatures that you encounter. Dreamfall continues the story of April Ryan as well but the game is mainly about Zoë, the new protagonist. You get to meet some of the people and characters that helped April in the first game and quite a few new ones. For the sake of the lore, Dreamfall does bring a lot to the table but it's a whole new game that tries to introduce quite a lot of new features and action elements; for good and bad.\n\nLet me elaborate. First of all; it's in 3D and not 2D any more. You no longer point-and-click but you control Zoë with the WASD-keys. To find/view/interact things or people of interest you have to walk up to them and press a button. You also have a targeting function where you can view or interact with things from a distance. They have also added a fighting mecanic in Dreamfall in instances where you have to fight. This makes this game a whole new plattform and moves from classic adventure to fore action than adventure.\n\nNeedless to say, this upset a lot of fans of the original game and to me it comes across as it's trying to hard to bring a modern design into the genre. It still works but it's quite annoying at times when you get stuck in camera angles and what not.\n\nBut this game (weird controls or not) is still a great game thanks to the mentioned lore, amazing story and well written characters so I can only recommend it. I still recommend that play TLJ before this game; not only for the lore but because it's one of the greatest games ever made. Dreamfall is like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of TLJ but you need to look past the quirky controls and experience the ride.","October 5, 2014","true","10.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Or several parallel stories if you will. There's always more to the story than meets the eyes, and you will most likely be left as a huge questionmark at times.\nI love games that makes you keep guessing, the sort of "maby if, but then he would, and if that have already happened then she knows and that would mean that..." etc.\n\nAll in all, the game serves you a superb story on a silver platter.","January 1, 2012","true",""," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The characters are interesting, the dialogue is well written and well acted, the graphics are good, and the UI has been completely overhauled - a huge improvement on the previous game in all ways.  It does expect the player to be familiar with terms and characters fromt he previous game, but I only played about halfway through the previous game and I wasn't too lost.\n\nDreamfall is the good kind of sequel: one that transcends the original and builds off its ideas without remaining shackled to old UI, graphics, and voice-acting. The only problem I have with the game is that combat is poorly implemented, clunky, and either too easy or too difficult, depending on the fight. Luckily, the combat sections are short and few, so that's not a dealbreaker.\n\nIf you've already played The Longest Journey, I heartily reccomend Dreamfall. If you don't want to deal with the previous game, you might want to read a quick summary first.","October 29, 2015","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For fans of the first Longest Journey, this is an absolute no-brainer must play, purely for the continuation of the story alone. For everyone else, sadly... not so much. First of all, it's hardly a game (ok, so maybe 25% game, 75% interactive story) - but since most people buy games expecting... well,  gameplay... it's hard to recommend from that standpoint. But as I said, for fans of the original, it is an amazing continuation of the story. The developers fixed my main issues with the original and really tightened up the dialogue and storytelling. In that respect, it is nearly superb, and worth playing for alone. But the uninspired puzzles (i.e. fetch quests) and combat sections really bring down the 'game' part of the equation. Add one final major insult in the lack of an actual ending, and it's really hard to recommend for those who never played the original. But for those fans, it is simply not to be missed.

It's using a 3D engine and you can use the WASD keys to move around and explore, click characters and objects to interact with them. Unlike The Longest Journey, the player switches between 3 characters; April, Kian and Zoe. Each has they're own beliefs and perspectives, this allows the story to be told from multiple points of view. Gameplay is diverse and includes combat, dialogue, exploration, puzzles and stealth, however there are often multiple ways to get through a section. For example, sneaking past someone might avoid having to fight them, or there may be more than one way to get out of a situation. Now the story might be difficult to understand especially if you haven't played The Longest Journey, even then the ending may leave you feeling very confused. This takes place after The Longest Journey and before Dreamfall Chapters, a lot of loose ends are tied up here but many unanswered questions remain in the lore. I would suggest playing all 3 games in order, that way you will be introduced to the series gradually and avoid confusion :)","December 12, 2015","true","18.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Now back to person A. Now talk to person C. Now talk to person D to get object X. Back to person A. Back to person B. Now talk to person E... (continues ad nauseum)\n\nIn my entire first visit to Arcadia, the fantastical world that contributes half the setting of Dreamfall,  I didn't make a single decision or solve a single puzzle. Instead, the game fed me a string of explicit or implicit instructions on what I should do next. When a puzzle finally bothered to turn up, the game practically leapt up and down in its efforts to show me the solution, reducing the act of solving it to yet another follow-the-instruction exercise. After tolerating this for over an hour, I shut the game down in disgust and looked it up on Metacritic. I felt that reading some of the critical drubbings handed out to it would soothe my frustration.\n\nThe Metacritic score for Dreamfall is 75%. The ration of positive to negative reviews is 26:2.\n\nMaybe I'm becoming a cranky old man who is increasingly out of touch, but... really??\n\nIs following instructions good gameplay? Can I put together some IKEA shelves and then exclaim, “wow, that game was fun!”. Certainly I've had more head-scratching puzzles presented to me by flatpack furniture instructions than in the whole nine hours of Dreamfall.\n\nIt's not as though the game is much better in its other sections. Throughout, the puzzles are almost offensively easy to solve. In one location, a mysterious set-up of statues and symbols taunted me with the half-promise that I would have to do some serious thinking to progress. And then I turned a corner and discovered... well... the solution. Just sitting there, waiting for me to go back and do the busy work of implementing it.\n\nEven these very easy puzzles are occasionally so badly implemented as to defy belief. One puzzle required me to recreate a tune I had previously heard, but the game had allowed me to remove the source of the tune from the game. Unable to remember what the tune had been, and without any means of hearing the tune again, I was completely unable to progress. On two other occasions I realised the puzzle solution instantly, but the game was so pedantic about how I went about it that I had to trial-and-error my way to taking the correct action. It reminded me of early text-parser games where you needed to type in multiple different phrases before the game finally understood what you wanted to do.\n\nAnd when the game isn't insulting you with non-puzzles, it asks you to slog through some typically dull and clunky fighting and stealth sections. I understand that when adventure games began falling out of mainstream favour, developers thought they needed to sex up their games with this stuff, but did it always have to be so badly implemented? The best fighting strategy turns out to be 'press forward and mash the quick-attack button until victory', and I found the best sneak strategy to be 'try not to die of boredom while watching your character inch like a lethargic snail towards their objective'.\n\nSo... why the good reviews?\n\nWell, the passive elements of this game are generally very good. The plot is intriguing, and becomes genuinely gripping once it gets into gear. Budget limitations make the locations feel pretty sparse, but they're beautifully stylish and full of distinctive characters. Voice acting is good throughout, though I found the main character (Zoe)'s voice to be somewhat tepid and unconvincing during more emotional scenes. The dialogue is usually great, and skilfully conveys character in just a few lines. I can certainly see many people playing this game, falling in love with the characters, getting hooked on the plot, and coming away feeling they just played something wonderful.\n\nBut they didn't. They watched a lot of wonderful things, they heard a lot of wonderful things, but they didn't play much of any worth. Especially near the end where the developers once again stop bothering with this whole 'game' thing and go back to 'Talk to A, talk to B, talk to C...' interspersed with dramatic cutscenes.\n\nAnd the sadder truth is that even the plotting and characters aren't good enough to warrant the skew towards positive reviews on Metacritic. I understand the game was scaled down from a more ambitious vision due to budget restrictions, but it has left some odd effects. One of the player characters undergoes a crucial and transformative change in perspective, but the reasons for this whoosh by without examination, which makes the change feel cheap and contrived. As the plot develops, you can see that the writers are aiming to explore a theme, but its all very muddy as to what they're trying to say, if anything. The end of the story is a huge 'To be continued...' with only one plot element resolved satisfactorily, though even that left me wishing for more detail.\n\nIrritatingly, there are hints of something better here. Early in the game, I was given a set of choices in a dialogue tree that I saw would take the scene in different directions. I made what I felt was a smart choice, and was pleased to see the result. Suddenly, I was playing: using my wits to make a decision and see what happened. Even now, I wonder what would have happened had I chosen the other option. These choices pop up later too, though they are unfortunately few, infrequent, and generally of little consequence. Having watched the developer introduction to Dreamfall: Chapters, I am hopeful that this avenue will be explored to its full extent in the sequel.\n\nPlay Dreamfall if you're a sucker for reasonably well-told fantasy stories and you don't mind not having an active role to play in the experience. But if you think 'interactive entertainment' should encompass the whole spirit of the phrase: avoid, avoid, avoid. My personal score on this is 4/10. Your mileage may vary.","March 3, 2014","false","9.1"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","1"

Even so, I wouldn't rate it as highly as The Longest Journey, but it still hits those important "life as a journey" ideas and questions.\n\n***Potential Spoiler Alert***\n\nAdditionally, to those that might be put off by the rather abrupt abd confusing ending, Dreamfall was never meant to be a standalone game but part of a trilogy which, due to unforeseen circumstances, was cut a little short. Thankfully, Red Thread Games will (or have depending on when you read this review) be releasing Dreamfall Chapters which will not only finish the games stroyline. but also start new ones with new characters; and hopefully some old ones too(?).","August 22, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you can get past the controls/combat and enjoy a good story, play it.\n\nDreamfall: the Longest Journey is not a direct sequel to the original Longest Journey (apparently that is planned for later release after Dreamfall Chapters) but is set in the same world(s) ten years after the events in Longest Journey and involves some of the same characters. The main protagonist, Zoe Castillo, is a new character, but you'll also be able to play as characters from the original game. It's also a departure from the original in that it's not a point-and-click adventure game - instead the developers tried to use a 3rd-person over the shoulder perspective and threw in some combat and stealth sequences to break up the story. However, even the developers admit that these added sequences are not very fun but thankfully there are relatively few of them in the game.\n\nThe 3rd-person over the shoulder controls are not very well done and it will take you a little while of fiddling with the settings to get them to a playable point. There is very little tutorial (if it can be called that) or direction given to the player on how to play but the controls are fairly simple so this doesn't seem to impact gameplay in a negative way. The UI is incredibly minimalist to the point that you don't even see it unless you're in a fight (health bars) or you open up your inventory. There are far fewer items used in this game and you will instead be talking to people a lot more.\n\nThe conversation system displays a series of one-word dialogue choices which when moused-over, are elaborated on by the controlled character at the time giving you a good sense of what the character will say if that choice is selected. The choices often indicate a direction that the conversation should follow (aggressive, friendly, tell the truth, etc.) rather than a specific sentence or phrase. My one problem with the conversation system is that the option to exit several conversations (Thank you) was also used as a non-exiting conversation branch, so I would recommend always mousing over the options before selecting to make sure that you don't miss a branch. I particularly enjoyed the conversations with Crow and being able to see and control the conversation between two opposing sides.\n\nThe story itself is fantastic and will send you on several twists and turns through the game world, and getting to see the game from different perspectives. It's all set on an Earth split into two - the futuristic/cyberpunk "normal" world (Stark) being the science half, and a fantasy-themed world (Arcadia) the magic half. I won't go into the story so as not to spoil it, but you get to adventure in both worlds and examine the relationships between them. The dialogue was also very engaging - usually thought-provoking and even sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nAt some points there are mini-games to hack or unlock things. They are fairly simple but fun and do not interrupt the story much if at all. The same cannot be said, sadly, for the combat and stealth sections, but again there thankfully aren't very many of them - or at least not many of them that will be hard/annoying. The stealth usually involves clicking on objects to hide and using your stealth walk (right CTRL). There were only one or two points in the game where I had trouble getting through the stealth, but the game seems to always autosave when you get to one so you thankfully don't have to replay too many cut scenes if you fail. In longer stealth sequences (the catacombs come to mind) I recommend saving and saving often whenever you're in a "safe" spot so you don't have to re-sneak all the way back. For the combat sequences you'll never really get stuck, as once you figure out how to beat the very simple AI you'll never lose a fight again. Hint: characters always block after you hit them, and you happen to have an attack that always passes through a block... you're welcome!\n\nOverall, I think the Metacritic score (75%) is almost spot-on, but for me personally I absolutely loved this game despite its flaws. If you enjoyed the first game and want more of the same style of story, or if you enjoy great story-telling in general, definitely play this game. If you haven't played the first game and enjoy point-and-click adventure games though, I'd really recommend playing the original Longest Journey first. It isn't required to play Dreamfall strictly speaking, but you will enjoy Dreamfall a lot more if you do and the references in Dreamfall about the original will open up the storylines from the Longest Journey that you would otherwise miss.","September 21, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got a few minutes in and found the start too slow for my liking, plus I didn't particularly enjoy the 3D camera control and I was generally critical of some of the lack of polish. I shelved Dreamfall for a number of weeks.\n\nHowever, I'm very glad I picked Dreamfall up again. About an hour in, a gripping story begins to unravel. There are also some very likable characters and several genuinely funny parts later in the game. Dreamfall is also extremely beautiful.\n\nThis game is more of an interactive story than an adventure. There are barely any puzzles, and the few it has are very easy. However, this isn't necessarily a negative point because it's still enjoyable.\n\nThere's way too much unimaginative and redundant dialogue in Dreamfall, often to the point of frustration. Fortunately, you can skip over most of it without missing any story, and you can read back on previous conversations via in-game UI.\n\nThere are currently many good, cheap adventure games around, and I think although Dreamfall is absolutely worth the price (compared to other forms of entertainment), it is still overpriced in todays games market, so best to put it in the wishlist and play other games until the sequel nears towards 2015.","April 22, 2013","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The biggest problem came with Funcom wanting Dreamfall to be more action-oriented and it really suffers because of this, there's some pretty bad forced action and stealth segments but they're thankfully rather scarce and don't ruin what really matters in TLJ, the writing.\n\nThe writing is still damn good and arguably better in some ways to the first mainly being a lot more concise unlike its verbose predecessor. It doesn't quite capture the magic of the first game but Dreamfall is still an emotionally resonant and beautiful game despite its flaws and one of the worst cliffhanger endings I've ever seen. Thankfully the third game, Dreamfall: Chapters, will be out next year and I can't wait for it. I pledged $110 for it and I don't regret it for a second. Play this and TLJ, I bet you'll grow to love them too.","July 15, 2013","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A good story which becomes excellent primarily in its final act, writer/director Ragnar Tørnquist once again serves up thoughtful, charismatic and well-written characters whom- with the exception of main character Zoe- are generally voice-acted very well. This game will definately appeal to any looking for a new venture into story-driven, fantasy games, whilst I would recommend those who consider the mechanical aspect vital to give this a miss, as the limited camera scope and movement mechanics will likely have you tearing your hair out!","March 2, 2015","true","13.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey has an engaging story, narrated nicely. It's more of an interactive novel than a real adventure, and quite linear. But the characters and story are well developed, and you actually care about what is going on. The puzzles are simple to solve so even a casual gamer can enjoy playing the game. The graphics are nothing to write home about (this is a rather old game), but this game is defined by the story, not the graphics, and I rather enjoy that.\n\nThe big drawback is that this game was obviously originally developd for a console, and the PC version inherits one of the most atrocious, braindead and next-to-unusable control schemes I've had the misfortune to have foised on me. During porting, the developers did, kinda-sorta-way, include mouse support, but it always gets in the way of camera control. Movement *also* forcs camera control - in exceedingly stupid ways - and the result is an interface that makes it neigh on impossible to navigate your character. I've sat and screamed in frustration at the screen because something as simple as turning left and looking at something specific (required to trigger interaction) becomes a cumbersome, dragged-out affair that can take a minute. Now imagine using the interface-that-hates-you for combat that is (luckily) used sparingly, and you have a recipe for desaster. It took me a while to clue in to the fact that you must never, ever, touch the mouse if you engage in combat, or you'll invariably end up with the camera showing you a wall, and your opponent killing you solwly.\n\nHowever, if you can overlook the dubest, most unrewarding and relentlessly hostile control scheme that you only need to navigate the whole game, this game is actually fun. The story *is* nice. This is a really, really engaging casual adventure. The puzzles are solvable, and most situations allow for multiple solutions. Since combat is something to avoid (crummy control), it even makes it feel like an accomplishment to get out of a situation by sneaking (which unfortunately *also* requires fine control), or some quite humorous dialogue.\n\nIt's a great journey - but it's made the 'longest journey' only because of the silly way you have to control the actor.\n\ntldr; - good story, atrocious controls, sum: above board.\n","February 1, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Its terrible (but thankfully infrequent) combat sections and poor voice acting lets it down slightly.\n\nFull Version:\nThe Dreamfall universe is a very interesting one. You've got Stark, which is basically our world but more futuristic, and Arcadia,a sort of fantasy world with magic, with both worlds seperate and still sort of linked. A small few people have the ability to travel between both. You start off playing as Zoe Castillo, who is the games main character and a resident of Stark. As the story progresses you get to play as April Ryan, the main character of this games predecessor The Longest Journey, and Kian, a sort of holy warrior. The story and the duel settings in particular are interesting and are what kept me invested in the game. The gameplay is mainly of the traditional adventure game sort with a lot of dialogue and cutscenes as well as a  (thankfully) little bit of combat which is poorly executed and doesnt fit with the rest of the game.\n\nHowever its the story that is the main selling point here. Its also worth mentioning that playing the Longest Journey or at least reading a synopsis of that games story is advisable as some of the lore and characters might be a bit confusing and the game sometimes assumes you have this knowledge.\n\nGood points:\n- The games settings of  futuristic Stark and fantasy Arcadia are great and the relationship and lore between them is interesting enough to keep you wanting more.\n- The story is quite good which is important for this type of game and having April and Kians sections is a welcome break from the dull Zoe.\n\nBad points:\n- the voice acting is pretty terrible for some characters. Theres one minor female character with an exotic accent that sounds like they kidnapped the voice actress from the airport and forced her to dothe lines at gunpoint. The dialogue was also a bit glitchy at times as every now and again the dialogue would skip.\n-the combat it a steaming pile of crap. You have a light attack, heavy attack and a block button. But its like trying to control a an arthritis riddled person to fight agaisnt another person with arthritis who happens to be severely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thankfully though these combat segements arent very frequent and are easy enough. They just add nothing to the game.","May 12","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/6300/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is an adventure game released for the Windows and Xbox platforms in 2006 and is the sequel to Funcom's The Longest Journey, which itself was released in 1999. The roughly 13 hours long story takes place ten years after the events of the first game and focuses on three characters, Zoë Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane.\n\nGraphically, this sequel is a step up above its predecessor showcasing a fully 3D world to explore. While the environment art is very nicely rendered, the 3D characters themselves look a little dated by today's standards. Music and sound are appropriately orchestral sounding and melodic and were a nice treat.\n\nStorywise, while the first game emphasized on the grandness, mystery and majestic scope of the two worlds Stark and Arcadia, Dreamfall takes a much more up close and personal look at the lives of the inhabitants. Characters that you know from the first game do make their return and is especially nice to see how they have evolved. It was especially interesting to see how the first game's protagonist April Ryan had matured, even though some may not like the new direction she has taken. Because this is a sequel, it is advisable to have played the original game first to better appreciate some of the story elements.\n\nThe story is not without its faults however as I felt the pacing seemed to be slow at the earlier chapters. It does pick up pace right around Chapter 6 as the plot slowly unravels. Although It is an intriguing tale, some parts felt unfinished as there are some questions that remain unanswered even at the end of the game which itself ends at a cliffhanger. This is a tale in which the journey is definitely more rewarding then its destination. Hopefully the upcoming Dreamfall: Chapters due to be released in 2014 will provide more closure to the story.\n\nDownsides, the game felt really linear even for an adventure game. You are never given multiple puzzles to solve at a time and can only progress in a very linear fashion. Focus field (which is the game's way of interacting with hotspots/objects) also felt very awkwardly implemented. It makes the protaganist look like a robot scanning for items.\n\nBecause this game was also made for the XBox, there are way too many loading screens even though certain areas looked like they could've been connected together. This really kills the immersion sometimes, and it would've been alot better if they just freeze the screen and have a little loading bar at the bottom instead of just completely blackout the screen and showing the game's title for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe game also introduced some combat and stealth elements which I felt was very shoddily designed and very tacky. (Eg: Winning a combat means to just spam the attack button. Sometimes the opponent just stupidly stands there without even doing anything!) Had they been designed and implemented well, I wouldn't have minded, but as they are now, they really felt out of place and unnecessary.\n\nThe game also did not have any ingame maps and there is alot of travelling back and forth between locations. There isn't any way to warp between them, and it is very painful to have to slowly jog all over the place. It really felt like a very cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. The ability to at least increase the character's movement speed would've been very welcome here.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.0 / 10\nIn conclusion, this is a worthy sequel to the original game but is let down by its technical issues / questionable gameplay design which hinders the enjoyment somewhat. If you had enjoyed the first game, definitely pick this up and if you are willing to endure its flaws, you will experience a story that matches and sometimes even exceeds the quality of original.","May 25, 2013","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is good if you're like me and like games that have a great storyline.  There's also heavy dialogue throughout the game.  This may be a good thing depending on what you like.  If you're not into story-based games you may not want to play it.  If you skip dialogues you'll miss the story and may not know what to do next.  It's not all dialogue.  There's more exploring and adventure than anything.  This game has a mix of sci-fi futuristic and medieval environments.  This game has a feel of Tomb Raider on how the adventure gets exciting.  If you're a fan of story-based games you must play this.\n\nI also have to gripes about this game too, not real bad but must be said.  The game is a little old so the graphics are dated but still good for the game.  If you're like me and play it with a Xbox controller you need to take the time to adjust the controller settings.  If you don't you'll be pulling your hair out. The mouse, oh I hate the mouse in this game. Even when playing with a controller the mouse arrow never goes away so you have to drag it to the corner.  But please take note: do not drag the mouse into the lower right corner of the screen.  Windows has that feature "show desktop" and for some reason the game doesn't ignore it.  If you drag your mouse to that corner the framerate will suffer greatly!  Keep the mouse out of the lower right corner!  I thought my game was broken but it was that little glitch that messes it up.  Finally, the fighting.  There's a few places where combat takes place.  Normally I'd welcome it but this game isn't easy to fight with.  The controls are stiff and unless you practice in the dojo level (at the beginning of the game) you'll fight bad.  The game is mostly moving around and getting from A to B and the fight scenes aren't big and very few.  It's just annoying.  Otherwise it's still worth playing.  It has a great story and I can't wait to play the sequel.\n\nPros\nStory\nMusic\nVoice acting\nDialogues\nFuturistic/Medieval environments\nEnding was good\n\nCons\nController - settings had to be set, don't trust default settings\nMouse - just everything about the mouse (stay out of lower right corner!)\nFighting - it's just bad\nLanguage - there's foul language in this game.

The story is solid, and the exploration is just ok. Everything else is flat out bad. The "stealth" gameplay doesn't fit and it's cumbersome. The combat makes Morrowind's combat look like the pinnacle of game design. The fetch quests are just repetitive and pad the amount of time it takes to complete the game.\n\nIf all you want is to see the story continuation, I'd recommend another avenue like watching cutscenes on youtube and reading the story on a wiki page.

You don't have to play the first game in the series, but you will get more out of the references, returning characters, and world in general if you have played the first and gotten to know Arcadia before this game.\n\nThe controls are... a bit annoying at first, both combat and sneaking are really bad. But luckily you get used to it after awhile, so it doesn't drag the experience down too much.\n\nThe game has a variety of characters, most of them interesting and/or fun. As for our two leading ladies, Zoe and April. They are just so cute, and they both have both adorable and funny moments (which I appreciate) in the middle of this dramatic journey. They are also both flawed in their own ways, but their cuteness and capabilities outshine that, so it more adds to the complexity of them.\n\nAs for the third playable character, Kian... Here is a character that seems to be defined entirely by his gender in this story. He is about as interesting as that sword he loves waving around, which is to say not at all. He is strong, tough, manly, honorable. And all his flaws come from him being too manly, too tough, too selfrighteous and confident. None of his parts really added anything good to the story or the experience for me.\n\nThe music is mostly great. I say mostly because a few times it is really distracting There is a romantic/kissing scene, where the music makes the whole thing super cheesy, and in a section near the end the music and song pulled me out of the experience, until it stopped when I got to the next cutscene... Just so loud and distracting in a periode where I think silence would have been more powerful.\n\nThe best part of this game is the story and the emotions of the characters. And while there are times when it isn't perfect, it mostly nails it. When it needs to feel serious and dark, it does. When it tries to be cute, it gets super cute and makes me just want to hug and cuddle the leads, even if those girls are more capable and bigger badasses than I will ever be. And when it tries to be funny it is. And when it wants the story to be tragic and sad, it pulls it off pretty well as well.\n\nSo yeah, if you can suffer through the controls, the combat and stealth sections of the game in particular, there is a great story here for you. And the return of one of my favorite sidekicks, Crow! All shall fear the power of his beak, humor, and small bird-brain!","April 11","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot of exposition dumps at the end and fells unfinished. It does have some interesting characters like Roper Klacks form the original game and the beggar, the rest are forgettable. It lacks the meat of the story that makes me care about the characters and the events.\n\nIt is in 3D, for some reason, and by that I mean, combat and stealth sections which are unnecessary and not beneficial to the experience. It does have prettier graphics, but they are mostly wasted as the world is quite empty.\nYou play as 3 characters: Zoey who is tasked by other characters to do "stuff" and is optimistic every step of the way.\nApril (from the first game), she has her own problems now, and for her, they are more important now than the balance.\nKian, skilled warrior with a heart of gold, that sees the errors of his cult. I guess! he is barely in the game.\nThe puzzles are in very few numbers and not that hard, there are a few dialogue options that will provide alternate ways to continue.\nThe story, it does not bring as much wanderlust as the first, both worlds have new governments and have adapted to the changes. Zoey is a "normal-rich" girl, who is minding her business when her ex-boyfriend gives her a task, that will raise a lot of questions that need answers, also a static anomaly tells you to "save April". So you fallow the trail you get to meet Aprils old gang, you go to the other world, find April, she has her own problems. April and Kian's story end in the other world, you go to a factory with a few puzzles and get to listen to a Exposition Dump about the static anomaly, which is indeed sad, but my interaction being zero, is even sadder, after which you go home and are booted to the final chapter where you simply go forward and listen to more exposition, The End.

I don't recommend this game, UNLESS you really enjoyed The Longest Journey's plot/world. I'm not really going into the plot, visuals, voice acting, except to say I really wasn't taken with them so much. As a continuation of The Longest Journey, it is definitely satisfying to revisit the world and check in with the various characters from the original, but this is in spite of the rest of the game.\n\nFirst, there's combat, and it's bad. It's awkward as hell, it plays sort of like a bad minigame from Final Fantasy or something.  Basically it tries to be Rock Paper Scissors with very silly looking animations: fast attacks beat strong attacks, strong attacks beat blocks, blocks beat fast attacks, and circling beats. Enemies only ever approach one at a time, and the whole thing just comes off as a stupid, tedious affair. Not really difficult to deal with, but there was no reason to include it, or implement in the way they did. It takes away much more than it adds.\n\nNext there are stealth sections, and they're also pretty terrible. Your character has a 'stealth mode' for movement, which is frustratingly slow. It's not required on every stealth section, but the game doesn't do all that much to indicate to you when you need it and when you don't. Patrols and security are very simple, and these sections are once again pretty tedious. I don't really feel like they added anything much to the game, and the world would be better off if they were handled more like point and click puzzles where once a solution is found you don't have to continue sighing and playing around whatever issue.\n\nThen there are the item puzzles, which weren't all bad, but lots of obnoxious back tracking which just wastes time(really missing the ability to skip time from the first one). A couple also weren't very intuitive and of course there's the song cave puzzle which gives no hints whatsoever basically forcing you to bruteforce a 4 point permutation (or look it up because who can be asked). Basically every other puzzle in the game is: use your phone on X, use the one item other than your phone you have in your inventory, talk to that person again. I never really felt challenged, but I was a bit annoyed. Seriously, I've played first person shooters with harder puzzles.\n\nAnd, guess what? The plot ends on a cliffhanger. Very disappointing. Conversation options don't really seem to matter either, that's kinda okay I can understand not wanting to bother with branching story, but the choice doesn't matter if the outcome is the same.\n\nIf they refined the above sections this game could've been like Beyond Good and Evil, well maybe it could've been. Everything about this game just felt like a half-hearted attempt, and I'd give it a half-hearted recommendation except that's really not a recommendation is it?","January 9","false","11.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are brief bits of inconsequential story tacked on.\n\nNo wait, the opposite of that.\n\nDreamfall: The Longest Journey is a fantastic narrative-driven adventure game. I started the series because I saw the trailers for Dreamfall Chapters and wanted to get caught up on the story. I played it immediately after finishing The Longest Journey (which I reviewed here), so it was interesting to compare the two.\n\nDreamfall definitely holds up better than TLJ from a technical standpoint. Being able to play at 1080p and 120Hz was a breath of fresh air, and the graphics are clean and recognizable. They've also thankfully foregone the most egregious uses of classic 90’s adventure game tropes (combining an object with every other object, pixel hunting, etc.). Unfortunately in its place they put some pretty mundane combat and stealth sections, but those sections are mercifully brief and infrequent.\n\nThe story is where this series really shines, and Dreamfall definitely delivers. I don’t want to go into too many specifics, but it was very interesting and thought-provoking to say the least. As always I was very satisfied with the writing, though I felt the voice acting wasn’t as strong as The Longest Journey. It was also kinda creepy how everybody’s bodies are completely stationary while talking – only their mouths move, which is slightly unsettling.\n\nAll in all I still greatly enjoyed it – though I would definitely recommend playing The Longest Journey first so you can get all the references and callbacks, plus you get to be amazed at seeing familiar places recreated in FULL THREE DEEEE. If you enjoy narrative-driven games I highly recommend it.","November 13, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Everything in the story is shallow and blunt, in special the characters.\n\nYou play three different characters in order of appearance:\nZoe Castillo: Cute Spanish girl that you want to like, but simply can’t. All she does is walk around and complain about her lack of interest on things. You do get to play detective with here, but at the end it’s only so you learn about the story. You cannot even make the smallest decisions, like not kissing that blond guy that never appears again.\nApril Ryan: I love April from the first game she is fun, curious, driven and bold. In this game, a plank with a sad face on it could very well substitute her. She nags the whole time and gets about nothing done. Of course other characters mention she has not been herself, but even if that’s supposed to be the reason she could at least be someone with some depth.\nKian Alvane: The perfect action hero archetype. It’s not too difficult to excuse him for his apparently shallow personality, since it’s pretty much a given to action hero’s archetypes. There’s one thing though you do not forgive from them, not taking action. As “the girls”, he’s another execrator to everything.\n\nBlunt characters, no decision you make matter, a story clearly created to be only the hook for the sequence that only 9 years later they are managing to pull together, a tiny world, more loading screens than any other game I can remember… this is a disaster.\n\nI’m not sure that you could find many worst sequels, but if you forget the original game, this is playable. Not a good buy in any case.","August 8, 2015","false","18.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not a point and click adventure like the first game is. It is an adventure game though, make no mistake. There are however less puzzles, not very hard ones either, and it plays out more like a movie. You are very seldom given a conversation option. The voice acting is alright, some of it is below average. The weakest link in the game is the combat system, it's clunky and unnecessary. I wish they would have left it out of the game. If you like adventure games I can highly recommend it because it has an interesting story. It takes you back to Arcadia at times and lets you revisit old locations and characters from the previous game.

I really did try.\n\nDreamfall and its predessor, The Longest Journey, are often praised by adventure game fans, and I like adventure games, but I just cannot find anything to like about either of these. In Dreamfall's case, the adventure/puzzle component has been stripped down to a bare minimum and combat and stealth has been put in to make up for it. The trouble is, it doesn't do any of these things well, so by trying to appeal to "everybody", it becomes decidely mediocre at everything.\n\nThis isn't purely down to the game's age, as even fans of the game recognised these shortcomings at its release, but still praised its story. Well, after 7 hours, I can't share those sentiments either. The "twin worlds" idea of "technology" and "magic" is a naive concept at best (what do you think stoves, spinning wheels and doors ARE if not technology?), fate and destiny and conspiracies and ancient civilizations are potentially great sources to mine for a story but I found nothing new or interesting about any of it, at least not by the half-way point. The voice acting is terrible by today's lofty standards, which I accept is an unfair criticism of a relatively low-budget game, but the end result is something that comes across as amateur.\n\nI've sat through worse games, and to call it terrible would be doing it a disservice, but the shoddy stealth/combat bits comined with a fiddly camera have broken this particular camel's back and I cannot summon the will to continue.\n\nOn the plus side, I had no problems getting the game running properly this time, which was nice.","April 28, 2015","false","7.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

If it wasn't for the fact that it was released in 2007 it could have been. It is only fair to compare games from the same year which were focussed on a strong narrative and see how Dreamfall compares. So lets take a few choice picks: Bioshock, Half-Life 2: Ep2 and Mass Effect.\n\nStand Dreamfall side by side with these games and you'll see the problem. A strong narrative can be achieved in 3 distinct ways, The story itself can either be engaging with various twists, turns and intrigue. Or the presentation of the story itself can really be entertaining even if the story itself is simple. Or finally, a game has both a great storyline and presentation. HL2:Ep2 was a simple storyline which was well presented, Bioshock had an engaging storyline which had mediocre presentation and Mass Effect had both an amazing storyline and amazing presentation.\n\nDreamfall however, has none of these.\n\n\n** MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD **\nThe general plotline surrounds Zoe, an art student who is sinking into depression over her tedious life. Drop into the mix a sudden disappearence of her ex-lover and the story is away. Or at least, it manages a clumbsy take-off. The presentation of the story is done at a snails pace with it dragging out some very mundane 'secrets' which frankly you'd not be very keen to uncover. Around part-way through it drops an utterly pointless appearence by 'generic-broody-anti-hero' type known as Kian the Apostle and a cameo appearence of the previous games' April Ryan. The storyline around these two is both tedious and has absolutely no connection to the main plot except for the seemingly mysterious message driving Zoe forwards leading to the envitable encounter with April. The game spends an extended amount of time suggesting a great deal of links between the various parts of the tale but ultimately leaves you with unsatisfying loose ends. The ending itself is a slap in the face and feels like the last half of the game and story was completely pointless, it actually feels like the ending belongs in the middle of the storyline but the developers squandered that part by focussing on the resistance movement headed by Raven in Arcadia.\n\nI genuinelly had to force myself to keep playing through this game as the storyline became so bland and lifeless after the 5th chapter that I actually stopped playing for months. Occasionally I'd dip back in with the hopes that things would improve. Just as things got interesting I came to the realization that I'd actually reached the end of the game.\n\nWhile there seems to be Dreamfall chapters around now, you may be wondering - Would playing Dreamfall: Longest Journey actually give me greater appreciation of the storyline? The answer is no, because there is so little here that you are not missing a thing. Playing the original Longest Journey would be beneficial however.\n\nOh and yeah, 7 hours on record. That is how long the game takes from start to finish. The fact I took months to complete it shows how tedious it was because in theory someone could finish everything in a weekend.","August 28, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I guess I wouldn't recommend it unless you're bored. It was engaging and immersive and I really wanted to finish playing it! But, when I was done playing, I was glad that I had finished it.\n\nIt would be inaccurate to say that this game is a diamond in the rough--to do so would be to dismiss its flaws and recognize what it could have achieved with more polish. There's something "off" about every aspect of this game. It's actually the consistent level of imperfection that makes this game better than average, almost "so bad it's good." Almost.\n\nThe puzzle-y and other game-y aspects of this game ranged from simple, boring chores to extremely frustrating and lacking direction. The whole gameplay thing really just got in the way of the story.\n\nThe real gem here is the story though. It's entertaining and the main character will grow on you. It starts off sluggishly and builds momentum with an equal lack of haste. I have to admit that I skipped through a lot of dialogue in the beginning. I had trouple playing for more than 20 minutes at a time early on. However at what was probably the half-way point of the game I decided that I just needed to finish the thing. I'm still confused about whether or not I liked it, which character was the worst, or if I maybe just missed some of the parts where it went back and filled in plot holes. Also the ending sucks.","March 25, 2015","false","15.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

But this must be one of the most boring games I ever played. Be prepared for running the same way again and again and then some more times. About 80% of the time you have no indication of where you are supposed to go, no map, no quest indicator and no description of the way except "at the south gate" or "to the ghetto". No compass either btw to get to South Gate. The best bet ist always: at the exact opposite end of the town, alternating between the ends of town of course, so you can fully enjoy the about 8 loading screens - you encounter them about literally every 10 meters of way.\nThe story at least tries to continue the story of the first game "The Longest Journey" and you encounter quite a lot of places and characters from that game, but unfortunately makes no sense at all contrary to the first game. There it made some sense to appear in a new world in your underwear as you traveled while sleeping. Here it seems to happen all the time - probably to distract from the lack of sense it all makes....\nSo really: DON'T BUY IT!","November 8, 2014","false","12.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

For fans of either point and click or action genres, this game is a boring slog that does not reward your patience.\n\nControls are obviously set up with consoles in mind, leaving the PC controls extremely awkward.\nThe combat system is pointless and seemed like an afterthought.\nStealth is either boring or frustrating due to the awkward controls.\nPuzzles are significantly oversimplified and very unsatisfying.\nThe game is told in the perspective of three different characters and while this is not always a bad thing, it was poorly executed in this game, ruining what immersion there could have been.\nThe voice acting for the playable characters isn't bad, but other characters will often stop mid sentence because the game needs to change the page on the subtitles.\nIf you haven't played the first game (The Longest Journey) you may find yourself scratching your head at some parts.\nThe ending was not an ending. There are more unresolved plotlines by the end than at any other point during the game.\nThere are a few bugs that cost you some time.\n\nThe music was nice, the story was fairly interesting, and the graphics were a marginal improvement over the original (but it should be seeing as though it came out 6 years after.)

The original was far better, longer and well written. The reasons Dreamfall falls down is simple, controls and writing. They completely changed the control of the original and added in some weird fighting system which is very awkward. Apparently this game was ported to the xbox or more likely ported over from xbox to pc because the controls are awful. Some of the writing isn't great either While the story is interesting some of the characters come across very shallow. The backgrounds are still awesome. The models are improved on. But I can't forgive this game for the controls and writing. I would only recommend this to hardcore fans who really need their fix or to newcomers to point and clicks because it isn't much of a challenge.

It is praised by many but I must disagree. I've played both the first game and this one and I must say that the first one is way better.\n\nIn this one they have hyped up the graphics to the 2000's standard and made their own game engine it seems. All character has this blind stare into the distance while talking, with only their mouth and eyes moving, it's creepy as heck to look at.\n\nThey've introduced fighting mechanics since the last game, and let me tell you, they are HORRIBLE and unbalanced. The enemy will 9/10 times whoop your ♥♥♥ because of this.\n\nCamera movement and movement overall (mouse and keyboard) are completely worthless and janky, Escape doesn't take you out of the menu or inventory, you HAVE to click the 'Resume Game' or inventory button to get back again. It's probably better with a gamepad, but a plain 360 controller isn't even picked up by the game..\n\nPuzzles in the game are too easy, not even worth calling puzzles because it's just "go here, go there, pick this up, done".\n\nAreas feels very empty, no people are around, most areas are just big empty places with very few things to interact with, and with the janky camera it's not even worth trying to look around and get a feeling of the place.\n\nThe first game in the installment is much much better, voice actors have more feeling in their voices as well, helping with the immersion. I hope the third game (Dreamfall Chapters) will weight up for this piece of garbage called a "puzzle" game.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the first game instead. This game is just a dust collector with a few references and callbacks to the first one.","May 17, 2014","false","10.3"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","2"

TLJ and Dreamfall both have breathtaking storylines. I felt that this game was a lot more enriching for having just played TLJ.\n\nThere are many differences though. For instance, TLJ was more heavily focused on problem solving and interaction with NPCs. This game was very different gameplay wise, including a heavy focus on stealth puzzles, this boring minigame where you match up symbols (it was fine the first time, but after the 5th time of doing it, it was old hat), and a combat system which was not very well executed.\n\nI also had huge problems with the camera and movement when I first started. I recommend this game be played on a gamepad if at all possible as it did not react well to my mouse and for some reason the camera movements were inverted.\n\nBut I am a player who plays games for their story, and this one had a fantastic storyline, although you are left with many questions at the end. I couldn't imagine having played this game 8 years ago when it came out and then having to wait until now with Dreamfall Chapters to finally get answers to those questions.\n\nIf you play for story, I recommend this game, (but play TLJ first; its graphics are definitely dated, but it's story is timeless).","February 17, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Игра перестала быть квестом. Теперь меньше головоломок и больше сюжета. Это пошло игре на пользу. Буквально с самого начала погружаешься в происходящее. Создатели ввели множество новых персонажей, даже главная героиня теперь не Эйприл Райан, а Зои Кастильо. Хотя нет, не так. В игре 3 играбельных персонажа. Каждый со своей сюжетной линией, которые идут параллельно, иногда пересекаются, а в финале .... Я не скажу что было в финале. Игра стоит того, чтобы в нее поиграть.

Now, less puzzles and more plot. This to benefit for game. From the beginning immersed in what is happening.

Each with their own storyline, which run parallel to, and sometimes overlap, and in the final .... I will not say what was in the final. The game is worth to play it. Pleased meeting with old characters and constant reference to the Longest Journey, which cause love this game even more.\n\nI did not like the combat system. Terrible ♥♥♥♥. Why? Why? Why the developers have added to the game fights?\n\nGenerally, if you have not played this wonderful game, you should try it. Guarantee you a good time.

It is ENTIRELY story-driven (a la Telltale's TWD) so if you're a fan of good storytelling in games, this is definitely for you. It has a very unique narrative which I don't think I've ever seen done in a game before, and I'd say the game accomplishes what it sets out to do with it. For instance, at a certain point in the game, when playing as one of the protagonists, you come face to face with another character you control, and are at complete odds with. The dialogue exchange between them after which the game transitions to the point-of-view of the character whose ideals you were just questioning was definitely the highlight of the game for me. And there's also the scene in the hospital room, which was utterly heart-wrenching.

I am quoting "follow" because the events take place 10 years after. However, the game feels very different both in gameplay and story, so I think it should be viewed as a standalone game.\n\nGameplay wise, it is fully 3D with heavy reliance on conversations. Not many puzzles that challenge your mind at all. Inventory is reduced to a minimum and normally you keep forward just by walking your way to your objectives (some running forth and back too). The game features stealth and combat, which is made in a poor fashion. Stealth mechanics are kind of ok, but forces you to press a key (def. key control) all the time, instead of just toggle stealth with a key. Probably one of the reasons playing this game with a keyboard can be punishing. Combat is just terrible, you just smash the button and attack. Luckily there isn't many combat. I can understand why they decided to put it in game, but the implementation really is terrible.\n\nIn terms of story, it is really complex, cryptic and creepy at times (character design, especially the faces contribute to that level of "creepyness"). Travelling through the two worlds, I found Stark to be more fun and interesting than Arcadia (this also happened to me for TLJ). After finishing the game you end up with hundreds of questions. The game story isn't closed and this can be frustrating.\n\nTherefore, I can only recommend playing this game if you plan on playing Dreamfall: Chapters and you are interested in the story of these worlds (and wait for a sale ofc). If you liked TLJ only for the amazing point and click adventure game it was, you will be disappointed with Dreamfall.","December 3, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combine that with the character being less convincing and A LOT less likable than The Longest Journey's April and an overall much weaker premise for the game, and you have a lead character that's just dull.\n\nSpeaking of which, April Ryan is back... and VERY MINOR SPOILER is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥. Her voice acting and reasoning is still more solid than Zoe's but she's too weak the carry the story on her own and, as I said, Zoe is more of a hindrance to that than anything. The story itself is okay but far from mind-blowing. It's quite obvious that the people responsible for it wanted to take it in a "different direction" (as some self-proclaimed 'visionaries' tend to do) and failed miserably to recreate that sense of purpose the first game gave you, even when faced with more overwhelming odds.\n\nThe combat system... Well, let's make it quick: It's painfully bad and its only saving grace is that there's only few instances where you actually have to fight. A few more of them and all the goodwill in the world couldn't have convinced me to recommend this game. Yes, it's that terrible - among the worst I've ever seen in a game I actually wanted to play.\n\nAs for the camera and controls, they're clunky at best but you can get used to them enough to not be hindered by them. When it comes to the adventure gameplay, well, it's not in the same league as its predecessor or any other adventure game, really, but if you're playing this game, you're probably here for the continuation of the story from The Longest Journey, and for that, it's okay...ish. What is not, however, is the unbearable sneaking system. You are annoyingly slow, the areas are large, you have no idea when they'll see/notice you or not... Again, it's only tolerable because there isn't too much of it.\n\nThe graphics have improved from the first game... and yet they haven't. The first game had pretty (if dated), well designed maps and backgrounds. This game has 3D environments that are large and empty. Yes, the graphical quality has increased, especially the character models, but they've lost that spark, that soul somewhere along the way.\nThe music somewhat makes up for that. Actually, it may very well be the one thing I have very little to complain about. It's fantastic, a few vocal tracks aside that push the "romantic" or "sad" over the edge... It's like the one in charge of these scenes had William Shattner compose them.\n\n\nOverall, the game gives the impression of being half-cooked: A couple of ideas thrown together without giving them a critical once-over, half-hearted execution, unconvincing design and voice-acting, a story just one step shy of being boring (and a few more steps away from being actually interesting)... In a word: A filler - something to push out the door until somebody could come up with something better. Which is weird, since they apparently had six years between this game and the first one. You'd think that'd enough to make a better game.\nThe cameos and returns of characters from the first game are convincing but, overall, the writers were a little too quickly to discard ideas, characters and motives from The Longest Journey and they didn't have the skill to turn a good story-driven adventure into a fresh action adventure of similar quality.\nNow that I read my review again, the only reason I'm still giving this game a recommendation is because I want to know if Dreamfall Chapters can make up for it.\n\nIf you're coming from the first game and want to know what happens, pick this up on a sale. That is the ONLY circumstance under which you should buy this game. Otherwise, go and find something better.","September 16, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has a few moments that feel like a "hidden item puzzler" but it's an adventure game with a solid plot, a solid script, and some decent voice acting.  Word to the wise though:  play "The Longest Journey" first.  Otherwise there are parts of this one that will leave you scratching your head and thinking "WTF was that all about!?"  Also, word is there will be a sequel released soon that will add closure to the series.  This one, like the previous entry, has an ending that really leaves you hanging.  Like your favorite TV show suddenly says "To be continued..." and then the series gets canceled!!\n\nAlso, get a good walkthrough online.  There are a few puzzles that NO SANE HUMAN BEING will be able to figure out without some help.  Such as, take a rope and combine it with some tongs, then add a rubber duck inner tube, ZOOM IN AND CLICK A TINY BAND-AID ON THE BACK SIDE OF IT to remove the band-aid and deflate the duck, then use the whole contraption as a fishing rod to grab a key off of some railroad tracks.

This chapter is set 10 years after the original (The Longest Journey), many things have changed that will engage the player's curiousity from the start. Ofcourse memorable characters and locations make a comeback and look better than ever with the leap in graphics. I caught myself warmly reminiscing the sights of Venice- the border house where April Ryan lived and the Fringe Cafe ahhh the memories! April and Crow do make an awesome return though much of the game focuses on a lovely new character named Zoe. When I started this game, I wanted to play as a familiar face but I grew quite fond of Zoe very early on. Partly because the developers have obvious talent for building characters but personally because of how quickly I identified with her and her decisions that many people make in their youth and stuggle through: dropping out of school, letting go of relationships, and trying to find a purpose in life.

Gameplay is a dull, slow-paced, repetitive, and often irrelevant experience when you just want the wonderful story to unfold a bit quicker. The "puzzles" will also be a letdown to most adventure fans, ranging from pathetically simplistic or aggravatingly obtuse. The graphics are serviceable with nice attention paid to a diverse art style, the music is sparse but well-produced, and the voice acting is top-quality. The  likeable cast of characters is easily the greatest driving force behind the narrative. I recommend Dreamfall to gamers looking for a fantastic story and solid writing in a video game, which are rare but pleasant treats in the modern gaming industry.","July 16, 2011","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm so glad I did. This game is truly one of the greatest adventure games I've ever played. It's not without faults, but you will find an experience that will keep you up for hours on end regardless.\n\nThe story is phenomenal! It's initially slow and is executed slightly cheezily (given the age of the game), but it quickly hooks you in once the atmosphere of the game has settled. After the first to second hour of this game, I found myself wondering why I've never played it before! It's intriguing, mysterious, and almost detective-esque. The story really picks up in the middle of the game-- to save you all from some major spoilers, I'm just going to say it's magical.\n\nIn addition, the music is fantastic: the composer puts subtle musical cues into the world's environment and professionaly crafts those into the score, creating several memorable and beautiful themes! I'd have to say that this is the greatest video game soundtrack that nobody has heard.\n\nThe voice acting is hit and miss; however, when it hits, it HITS. There are some fantastic voice actors in this game. The main character sounds great, but some of the minor characters that you run into are downright HILARIOUS! There are moments and lines in the script that are just joys to watch and listen to, some examples being the hilarious elevator scene, the spice trader, and a few others. A couple of the voice actors kinda suck.\n\nSure, the combat sucks and the animations could be better, but c'mon: this game was released in 2006! The Steam screenshots are touched up with effects and shaders to make the game look better than it actually is. Some of the puzzles are just rediculously hard and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll definitely look those up online to save time.\n\nIf you can get past the minor setbacks (and trust me, you will), you will find yourself a well crafted, memorable adventure that will consume your thoughts!

Nevertheless, one can still lose track of time in this game as the characters, story and setting are still top notch.

To add insult to injury there are some incredibly out-of-place combat and stealth scenes, all of which cause insta-death if you press the wrong button. And yet... the world of The Longest Journey is a rich and beautiful one. The fantasy half isn't my cup of tea, but the sci-fi half is great, and the ending is extremely compelling. All the pain of the earlier parts of the game go away when the story truly unfolds. The denouement does go on a little long - i wish they had ended at a particularly poignant fade-out (you'll understand when you get there), but it's still got a real emotional impact and some very cool ideas.","January 16, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combine that with the character being less convincing and A LOT less likable than The Longest Journey's April and an overall much weaker premise for the game, and you have a lead character that's just dull.\n\nSpeaking of which, April Ryan is back... and VERY MINOR SPOILER is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥. Her voice acting and reasoning is still more solid than Zoe's but she's too weak the carry the story on her own and, as I said, Zoe is more of a hindrance to that than anything. The story itself is okay but far from mind-blowing. It's quite obvious that the people responsible for it wanted to take it in a "different direction" (as some self-proclaimed 'visionaries' tend to do) and failed miserably to recreate that sense of purpose the first game gave you, even when faced with more overwhelming odds.\n\nThe combat system... Well, let's make it quick: It's painfully bad and its only saving grace is that there's only few instances where you actually have to fight. A few more of them and all the goodwill in the world couldn't have convinced me to recommend this game. Yes, it's that terrible - among the worst I've ever seen in a game I actually wanted to play.\n\nAs for the camera and controls, they're clunky at best but you can get used to them enough to not be hindered by them. When it comes to the adventure gameplay, well, it's not in the same league as its predecessor or any other adventure game, really, but if you're playing this game, you're probably here for the continuation of the story from The Longest Journey, and for that, it's okay...ish. What is not, however, is the unbearable sneaking system. You are annoyingly slow, the areas are large, you have no idea when they'll see/notice you or not... Again, it's only tolerable because there isn't too much of it.\n\nThe graphics have improved from the first game... and yet they haven't. The first game had pretty (if dated), well designed maps and backgrounds. This game has 3D environments that are large and empty. Yes, the graphical quality has increased, especially the character models, but they've lost that spark, that soul somewhere along the way.\nThe music somewhat makes up for that. Actually, it may very well be the one thing I have very little to complain about. It's fantastic, a few vocal tracks aside that push the "romantic" or "sad" over the edge... It's like the one in charge of these scenes had William Shattner compose them.\n\n\nOverall, the game gives the impression of being half-cooked: A couple of ideas thrown together without giving them a critical once-over, half-hearted execution, unconvincing design and voice-acting, a story just one step shy of being boring (and a few more steps away from being actually interesting)... In a word: A filler - something to push out the door until somebody could come up with something better. Which is weird, since they apparently had six years between this game and the first one. You'd think that'd enough to make a better game.\nThe cameos and returns of characters from the first game are convincing but, overall, the writers were a little too quickly to discard ideas, characters and motives from The Longest Journey and they didn't have the skill to turn a good story-driven adventure into a fresh action adventure of similar quality.\nNow that I read my review again, the only reason I'm still giving this game a recommendation is because I want to know if Dreamfall Chapters can make up for it.\n\nIf you're coming from the first game and want to know what happens, pick this up on a sale. That is the ONLY circumstance under which you should buy this game. Otherwise, go and find something better.","September 16, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Needless to say, dialogues were less monologuish and pointless than the first, and the graphics and environment designs were great considering the time the game was released. Playing the game was quite a visual treat.\n\nI'm not sure how the hell I was able to play this game in the past without having first played TLJ1, but man I remember being so confused by April Ryan and everything back then. Now with a replay in context, a lot of things make sense. I feel really bad for Zoe's dad, though.\n\nThere are several really annoying bugs and glitches in Windows 7 version, however. I have 8 GB of RAM and my graphics card is nVidia 950 GTX. The most annoying issue of all is the voice stutterings that almost slow to a crawl, happens in several places. Second most annoying was getting stuck outside doors for certain maps, which required switching between windows to fix.\n\nAt any rate, the story was pretty decent and original (no chosen one BS but still of course has "the special one" thing). The fighting mechanics really do suck. I would have liked a bit more puzzle solving - I think there was actually much less of that in this game. Or they far more straightforward than the first game to the point where they felt none-existent.\n\nAll in all, this is still a pretty solid adventure game imho, and I'm looking forward to finally start with Chapters.","January 5","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No spoilers, but it hit me in the feels. This is such a great story, I really couldn't reccomend the series more!","December 4, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am quoting "follow" because the events take place 10 years after. However, the game feels very different both in gameplay and story, so I think it should be viewed as a standalone game.\n\nGameplay wise, it is fully 3D with heavy reliance on conversations. Not many puzzles that challenge your mind at all. Inventory is reduced to a minimum and normally you keep forward just by walking your way to your objectives (some running forth and back too). The game features stealth and combat, which is made in a poor fashion. Stealth mechanics are kind of ok, but forces you to press a key (def. key control) all the time, instead of just toggle stealth with a key. Probably one of the reasons playing this game with a keyboard can be punishing. Combat is just terrible, you just smash the button and attack. Luckily there isn't many combat. I can understand why they decided to put it in game, but the implementation really is terrible.\n\nIn terms of story, it is really complex, cryptic and creepy at times (character design, especially the faces contribute to that level of "creepyness"). Travelling through the two worlds, I found Stark to be more fun and interesting than Arcadia (this also happened to me for TLJ). After finishing the game you end up with hundreds of questions. The game story isn't closed and this can be frustrating.\n\nTherefore, I can only recommend playing this game if you plan on playing Dreamfall: Chapters and you are interested in the story of these worlds (and wait for a sale ofc). If you liked TLJ only for the amazing point and click adventure game it was, you will be disappointed with Dreamfall.","December 3, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In it, we follow a new protagonist, Zoe Castillo, as she attempts to track down her ex-boyfriend Reza. We also catch up with April Ryan, who has become jaded after the events of The Longest Journey, and Kian Alvane, a member of the Azadi who is brought to Marcuria in an attempt to destroy April and everything she stands for.\n\nStory-wise, the game was quite impressive. We get multiple perspectives throughout the game, which was a nice was to gain knowledge that might have been harder to obtain if we'd been stuck with Zoe. There is a strong mythos a dreaming, as Zoe is a dreamer - she can use her dreams to move between worlds. The idea of the dreaming and dreamtime was pretty clearly inspired by Aboriginal mythology on dreaming and the creation of the universe. The mythology itself is fascinating in its own right, and very underused in writing so Dreamfall gets some major points for utilizing it. The story itself had lots of twists and turns, many of which I did not see coming (especially the ending of the game).\n\nThe gameplay mechanics left much to be desired, though. There are a small handful of combat scenes that involve spamming the left mouse button and they mostly only serve to be annoying. They don't regularly appear so I have to wonder why the appeared in the game at all. The camera was also pretty awkward at time, especially during the numerous stealth scenes. However, it wasn't so bad that the game couldn't be finished.\n\nOverall, I would say Dreamfall is worth playing, especially if you are already invested in the series from playing The Longest Journey. The story and the mythos are enough to make the game worth it.","January 16","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I can very much still talk about it.\n\nI found this game while searching across the internet a few years back, it looked fantastic.. And kinda "exotic" to me, as I were one of those FPS only gamers at the time. After a few days thinking about it I decided to download it, unfortunately I had to turn to piracy, due to lack of money. My first impressions of it were quite solid, it was a new and interesting game, with a good story to it. At least what I could grasp at that time.. Seeing as my English was not very good. After about a third of the game done, it decided to die on me.. It would not start anymore and I quickly gave up on it.\n\nNow, a few years later, during the annual Winter's sale, I picked it up, alongside Dreamfall Chapters, the new sprout in the series. And so I began playing it for a second time. Now with a more.. *Mature understanding..\n\nThe game does indeed feel a bit old, or at least older.. Probably due to how the controls work out. They are a bit clumsy in some scenarios. But it is something that can easily be overlooked. As for the gameplay itself.. It was very good. I felt that I got a deep enough bond to some of the characters, especially the MC, to actually care about them. Which is a plus in my book. The story was interesting and captivating, with much varitaion and exitment, though I believe I would have gotten a sligthly different.. Feel.. To it, if I had played its predecessor, The Longest Journey. To say the least I am very happy that I came back to this game, it was truly time well-spent..!","January 16","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, this game took me by surprise. I experienced something we do call a sophisticated walking simulator these days - a game with unrelevant gameplay mechanics. Fortunatelly it had parts which required to move in stealth - or let find a more sophisticated way to describe it - required to stay 'undetected'.  So, if you want some envolved gameplay mechanics, you wont find any. As a matter of factly, I strongly suggest to play this game with a controller (does it work with the steam controller, TBH i dont care - it worked wonderfully with an old XBOX 360 controller -  had just  to remap 1 button) as I couldnt cope with the Mouse and Keyboard controls. The puzzles were easy - the combat was just awful. (There are alternative solutions to avoid most combat in the game).\n\nSo if not for the gameplay, why do play it at all? For the storytelling and the story, and If you have not played "The Longest Journey - Funcom 1999" yet - play this rather classical point and click adventure first. In fact do it now. You will miss some meta-story elements which actually made Dreamfall - and its last chapters a blast for me. Oh, and besides that, handful characters and many locations from the first game had a comeback in Dreamfall.\nAnd no, no synopsis and summary will do it - trust me on that. Some parts need time to sink in.\nFuthermore - the writing is superb and rather mature compared to other games out there. The voice acting is outstanding. Within the first chapters I'd say - TLJ 1999 had the better voice acting. But after finishing the game. my opinion changed drastically. I would say its different. I missed the sarcasm and humor of the first game. But some of it came back in Chapter 8 (with certain characters). And i am sure Ragnar Tornquist had his reasons to keep the theme a bit darker/serious.\n\nBe warned - the ending is not for the faint of heart and the weak of mind. And there is a reason why so many people wanted a continuation in "Dreamfall Chapters" (3rd game in the series)\n\nDo your choices matter - some minor choices and decisions made in the chapters will have some minor impact on the story, but will not change the outcome or the plot on the meta level (unlike LiS or TWD Season 1)\n\nGraphics: so this game was made in 2006 - I recently googled some of the 2006 Titles - back then this game was top notch - and I'd say, Dreamfall still looks acceptable today - it was rather awkward, because some the settings are astounding. You will travel between so many locations - and it will be impossible for you to guess what will come up next. The Characters are very well made - top notch lip-sync - eye movement etc. but the great character-art will feel awkward compared to these days facial animations - rather like blunt doll faces.\nOn a different level - compare this to KOTOR 2 - which was made in 2005, KOTOR 2 just looks awful compared to Dreamfall.\nDreamfall runs with all modern 16:9/16:10 resolutions.\n\nSound: Great support for all kinds of Soundchips from back in the day, Dolby 7:1 worked fine. The Soundtrack is amazing. Everything here from modern lounge music to non synth classical tracks played by a real symphonic orchestra.\n\nWill I like this game?\n\nIf you rather lack in patience - do not like long dialogues. Dislike games with mediocre gameplay mechanics: better stay away\n\nIf you need to feed your hunger for a unpredictalbe story written by of IMHO best writers in the gaming industry (Ragnar Tornquist). Want some outstanding voice acting -  go for it.\n\nIs it better than "The Longest Journey"? Its different in many aspects. IMHO the pacing was better, but TLJ requires a lot more discipline to play, Especially if not using a walkthrough. (which is way more rewarding) Storywise - until chapter 8 I'd say TLJ any day, but after finishing the 2nd half of the game - I started to like both games for different reasons. If you have played and enjoyed TLJ (1999) - I'd say go for a playthrough of Dreamfall.\n\nOne final Warning - as already stated: the Ending is not everyones cup of tea - There are cliffhangers. As IMHO the story itself was mostly resolved - but the mystic metaplot kept my mind spinning (in a good way). Luckily Dreamfall Chapters are almost finished.","April 22","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
