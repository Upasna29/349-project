Well, many of the sounds are missing, mainly around the player character. Considering the character is a knight, it's generally expected you'd have a "whoosh" whenever you swing, but in this case, there's no sound. When you take damage, there aren't any indicators, visibly nor audibly, which makes managing how many hits you've taken rather difficult to maintain. Minor complaint, but it serves as a disconnect to the gameplay, in my opinion. Also, for some reason, there isn't even a death animation, so when you die, it says "Game Over", but you can still move around and attack.\n\nAs for the layout, it's rather linear. A lot of the rooms appear to have other areas to explore, but in reality, it's just a small cell where you defeat enemies and move on, much like Binding of Isaac, without the variation.\n\nStory-wise, well, there isn't much of one, to be honest. The main antagonist apparently kidnaps and tortures princesses, but in the illustrations, it shows him murdering, maiming, and dismembering them, FAR from what the story leads to believe. And apparently your role is to save your princess...as far as from what I can tell, she's probably already dead. Apart from the story, as this game is being catered to an English-literate community, more effort needs to be made into proofreading, since there are many mistakes that need correction in that regard.\n\nOverall, the game is an interesting concept, despite the flaws. For now though, unless the developer adds more content and variety, asking for people to pay, even the current $1.79 as of the re-writing of this review, is not acceptable in the game's current state. Until more is added and the game is better completed, I cannot recommend the game.\n\nUPDATE: 2-3-2016\n\nBlack death potions have an unnecessarily large hitbox, being miles away when I accidentally pick them up. Updates don't seem to have done much to the overall gameplay, except you don't go straight to the title screen anymore, which is a huge plus.\n\nUPDATE: 3-13-2016\n\nGame hasn't been updated in well over a month. Hope the game dev hasn't abandoned it and run with our money. Guess that's the risk with Early Access games though, isn't it.","January 15","false","0.6"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","34","47","3","3"

It's been some time I've seen so much potential in a game. It could really be an awesome game, yet it is, sadly, terrible.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\n\nSilver Knight is Binding of Isaac gone wrong. Let's start with the good things first. Its art-style is nice and although you might have seen this kind of visuals in many other games, it's easy to love Silver Knight's design. Even the UI is not bad at all. It should be worked on more, no doubt about that, but there are bigger problems than UI. One more thing that I've kinda enjoyed is sound effects and soundtrack, which are simple and kinda suits the atmosphere to be honest. Now, the sad part of this review. I don't think I've ever been more sad about roasting a game than I'm now. But things must be said, so the developer will (hopefully) work on this game some more. Firstly, what the hell are those hitboxes? I simply can't (and don't want to) play this game if I don't really know when I'll hit enemy and when I won't. Or even better when you take the black potion (you lose 1 HP) randomly. Yes, it's utterly broken. So is the dash. After using it few times, the visual effect of it stays but it simply doesn't work. Another thing, that I don't think is supposed to work like that, is resetting levels. Let's say you beat a level, you have full HP and you find a red potion there. So you leave it there to "later use" just because you're used to it from other games. So you beat the next level but lost 1 HP, you want to take the red potion from previous level but surprise, surprise, it's not there. You return to the level you already beat but another surprise awaits, it spawned enemies again. Just.. Why? I wanted to give this game a good rating, I really did. But I can't.\n\nPROS- visual side\n- trading cards\n- BIG potential\n\nCONS- gameplay\n- awful bugs\n- level design\n- so many better games in this genre\n- difficulty (related to terrible gameplay and bugs)\n- basically no settings at all\n\n======RATING======\nAs a lover of this genre, I was really looking forward to playing this game. At the time I've managed to get it, it didn't even have that many negative reviews, so I was like "okay, this might be a nice game after all". Oh boy, was I wrong. Unfortunately, the game didn't deliver. I'd compare this game to that feeling when you know a person that has a talent to do something cool yet he/she doesn't fully use it and work on it. That is exactly what this game feels like. I can't recommend it at this stage but my hopes are high that I'll be able to change this review to a positive one someday.\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 12","false","3.7"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","1"

You can't tell a small spider from junk pieces. Also this is totally not a twin-stick shooter because you can attack only in the direction your knight faces, but that was not enough: you also can't turn while you keep clicking the left mouse button! Without much experience It's very hard to tell the distance and alignment, and whether you are gonna hit a hitbox. Some apparently solid objects like pillars get transparent when you enter them. The survival demands getting quite used to local peculiarities. both physical and visual, and a lot of effort which I doubt many would grant to this software.\n\nВидимо, задумано как неуклюжий клон Связывания Исаака со случайными помещениями, полными смешных убийственных зверушек, но не хватает точного управления (только клавиатура с мышью) и четкой картинки (изометрия+особо грубая пиксельная графика). Не отличишь маленького паука от кусков мусора. Также это вовсе не стрелялка с независимым выбором направлений, так как атаковать можно лишь в ту сторону, куда смотрит рыцарь, но этого было недостаточно: также невозможно обернуться, не перестав щелкать по левой клавише мыши! Без большого опыта очень сложно судить о расстояниях и соотношениях, и о том, попадет ли удар в границу объекта. Некоторые очевидно твердые предметы типа колонн становятся прозрачными, когда в них заходишь. Выживание требует хорошей привычки к особенностям местной физики и внешнему виду, и много усилий, насчет которых сомневаюсь, что многие будут готовы вложить их в данное программное обеспечение.","March 26","false","9.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","3"

As a roguelike I expected a lot more variety.  Feels like more like a demo than an actual game, and it's probably better suited for early access.  I did like the simple story about saving princesses.  It's a nice refreshing change of pace to the convoluted mess that a lot of games try to do nowadays.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneEyedThief/recommended/432170/","OneEyedThief","「Mentle」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneEyedThief/","53 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI came across this game for a dollar while I was looking for a decent action/adventure game. What I was found gave me mixed feelings. The game "Silver Knight," while looking like a school project thrown together in a week at first look, is actually a decent game. Its nice, simple use of pixelated graphics compliment it nicely with the environments. However, the gameplay can be rather dull. It boils down to you entering room after room, killing all inside before moving on. I've yet to find powerups or anything that could spice it up a bit. It feels slower than it should be, but that issue is easily fixable through the game's "dash" action. Something I actually haven't seen much use of in other RPGs. The battle is pretty hit and miss, but the rooms being so small limit your ability to actually do much first off without falling flat on your face and having to start over. Each enemy will aimlessly rush you with no sense of surprise or actual strategy, and bombs will be the lifeblood of your playthrough. The controls, to be blunt, are awkward and shoddy, the whole character stops moving when you swing your sword in a decently-lengthed animation, but in crowds this becomes a futile task that only dashing out or using a bomb will fix.\n\nOverall?: 6/10 as a game, 7/10 for the price, even on sale.\n\nIt's something that will fill the gap of boredom, but won't leave you with a lasting impact or sense of replay. The mechanics are iffy, and combat is hit-and-miss.","February 9","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well in this 16-bit Dungeon Crawling RPG, there is a devious Black Knight who travels the world to hunt down princesses and torture them. You as the "Silver Knight" are chosen to slay this wicked fiend for his trechery and at the same time reacquaint with your lover. He comes across the Black Knight and starts following him to wherever he is going. That's the pretty much general story of whats happening. After that you left in a room dying and you must begin your journey.\n\nThe game controls are quite simple with the usual WASD to move, Number 1 to Attack and Number 2 to Dash while dropping sweet bombs with E. With these weapons in your arsenal you are expected to traverse through these dungeons. In my first few attempts in this game I noticed had similar gameplay as Binding of Issac, with moving around dungeons and planting bombs on the ground wasn't a bad feeling. The hit mechanics majority of the time is perfect and dashing helps ya a lot although would be nice if there was some stamina bar (as you can constantly spam dash). Pretty much in this game you will be hack'n'slashing for quite some time with a diverse list of enemies including  the usual spiders, wretched fairies (no idea), some toxic waste slime monster, suicide bombing imps and occasionally a mixture of both fused in one (Slime spewing out fairies).\n\nThe Map design and graphics so far are quite morbid and desolate which compliments with the constant music that is playing on the background. Each map level is quite different from the other and as the game mentions monsters spawn differently everytime you replay the game. With this factor sometimes the game can get a bit hectic and quite challenging as you also have a limited health supply of 5 HP. That saying the game is great so far but as expected from any early access it is not complete.\n\nThere are some bugs in this game which can make this game frustrating and some a bit more entertaining in which I will take the time to point out. Some of the maps if ya spam your dash can actually make you go through the wall and into a different part of the game. However please be advised by doing this some maps can trap you in limbo thanks to invisible walls and you are pretty much screwed. Enemies sometimes cannot be hit and can double hit ya even before whacking it and sometimes they spawn invisibly and you won't know killed ya. At occasions when potions are dropped in-game your character might have to spam the dash button into and eventually it will pick it up. These bugs are expected in this early access so shouldn't detract you from playing.\n\nOnly thing I wish the developer could have done was perhaps add some more RPG elements say leveling to improve the protagonist as he can be puny against baby spiders and perhaps some more abilities.\n\nAnyway this game ain't your walk in the park type, you will die quite a lot and from that you learn more about this game. I have played a good hour and I haven't encountered the bosses yet due my lack of skills. If you are thinking off trying this game out I highly recommend it as it is quite unique with a straightfoward story, near-perfect mechanics and great design however, if ya not a fan of bugs I'd wait it out to be more completed. To the developer kudos for the and I hope you this review to better improve your game.","January 24","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With a lovely music and cool main character, you have to enter to an old and strange castle with a lot of enemies. In fact, there are enemies of all kind here! Is not just retro fantasy, also there are bad machines and toxic wastes. That made me laugh because of the mix, a little strange for a "fantasy" related game.\n\nGameplay\n\nControls are easy and you can put traps! If you don't have more traps you can get some extra killing enemies. They will appear as drops.\n\nI know the game is on early access at the moment so I hope to see more enemies and dungeons soon! The maps are cool and remember to kill all the enemies to pass the next map. You can teleport through them but again, beware of the enemies, yon won't know where the enemies will appear from many places. In fact, I have been killed a lot because of that.\n\nI could use bombs and traps which are helpful in big enemies. Remember to destroy what seem to be machines, and take all the drop items. There are some interesting, like extra HP. Yes, we all love HP red pots.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI recommend the game. Remember is in early access and there are things to polish of course, but I like a lot this kind of old dungeons classic games, so I give a 7/10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 23","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
