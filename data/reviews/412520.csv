Build you defenses to stop incoming enemy forces from reaching the end of the path. Have each of your towers and turrets co-operate with each other to help take down strong enemy’s and defeat large hordes.\n\nPros & Cons\n++  Pros\n+Charming graphics\n+Great tutorial\n+Gives motive to continue playing\n+Fair price (Current $9.99 US)\n+Sound / Effects are on point\n+UI and HUD / Menu is very user friendly\n+Amount of maps\n\n-- Cons\n-Have to grind (farm) for coins to upgrade towers (sometimes / cant always upgrade after each match)\n\nPersonal Opinion I Believe this is a great tower defense game. One of the best, charming, detailed games of its kind. There are many tower defense games but this is my number 1. I love that the graphics and the art of the characters and environment is very easy on the eyes and provides great game play flow. Then there is strategy, you must build the correct towers next to each other that really co-operate so one can slow down and the other can do slow heavy damage.\n\nFinal recommendation: Based on controls, mechanics, price, graphics, and overall game play, I rate this game 7/10. This has great replay-ability and a good go to game if you don’t want a game that’s so intense.\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","January 11","true","16.5"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","0"

Yes it's a mobile port but a good one, with zero micro-transactions. Purchase grants 100% of the game. Huzzah.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw4B23PDRZU\nIncludes a fair bit of content for the price. 100 odd levels are spread across 5 different regions. 60+ towers providing alternate upgrade paths along with global leaderboards for each and every single quest. I'm still in the early stages playing through on normal, though it's already become quite challenging to 3 star levels. Story is presented with a tongue in cheek nature that actually provided a few laugh out loud moments. No in-game options were available, a slider for sound volume would be welcomed but otherwise nothing was really required. Graphics stayed crisp scaling up to 4k resolution via the unity launcher.\n\nEvil Defenders has great presentation and screenshots don't do the detailed animation justice. Something that particularly surprised me was the cut-scenes which were comprised of some lovely cg work. With a ton of achievements, decent soundtrack, responsive controls  and your typical TD *one more round* hook, the game gets my thumbs up. Recommended to any TD enthusiast and I feel the price is spot on.

But compared to other TD games on PC it falls way behind. Games like Defender's Quest, Defense Grid (1+2) and GemCraft offer both deep and satisfying gameplay - for around the same price.\n\nEvil Defenders feels like it belongs on a tablet or a phone. At first you might not notice, but it becomes clear after a short while. It's very simple and doesn't offer much in terms of strategic planning. My advice to you is pretty simple as well:\n\nIf you are new to TD games this might be a good place to start (although I'd wait for it to be on sale). Be sure to check out the games above afterwards.\nIf you are a TD veteran you will be wanting more out of a TD game that costs €9.99.

If you haven't already discovered it, Evil Defenders is a tower defence title where the player dons the responsibility of making sure creepy, noseless peasants don't invade your domain. Equipped with a large arsenal at your disposal, ranging from foot skeleton soldiers to Orc-operated cannons, the player must choose the most efficient way to dominate the playing field. Keep in mind that each tower requires payment by gathering money after defeating each opponent, and additional bonus cash for quickly accomplishing each wave. This game requires you to utilize every tactic to gun down your enemy before they get the opportunity to inflict some serious damage on you.\n\nVisuals are beautifully illustrated along with a well thought out menu layout. The in-game combat is sleek and simplistic, with each map or location having a set of 6 areas which require stronger defences over time. However, with each successful victory, the player is rewarded with a currency in the form of souls; this soul cash is then used for your tree ability list, enabling you to seriously lay the hurt on intruders after upgrading.\n\nIt's easy to understand the combat system and all of its functionality, it also gets more challenging as you progressively unlock levels. The only thing this game would ever need to have is more levels to play through! :) If you're having trouble deciding on whether to try this game out or not, check out my preview video to see for yourself!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOwPLNwXjwc","November 11, 2015","true","3.5"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","28","41","6","0"

In this game we are at a "Dark" side, our goal is defend Evil and his land from people. This game first was released for android platforms, but now we can enjoy it at pc aswell. A game have a lot of content. You can play 15 maps, and there you can use up to 60 different towers to defend The base. All maps have 6 levels, these mean totally you have 90 levels, not a little number.\n\nIf you beat a level, you´ll earn souls for yourself what you can use it for upgrade your towers. The enemy have 15 different units, you should defend your base from 10 waves up to 30, how many waves been this depend which level you are at. A game have a good guide, you can read all important information’s abut units. A game graphics looks very nice. Sounds and music also good, well harmonized with game style.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+lots of content\n+good music and sounds\n+good graphic\n+interesting shooting mechanism\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-leaderboard don’t work\n\nSo this game is very nice and have good music, this can be a good rest after hard day of work.

Is this game worth your money?\n\nOn first glance Evil Defenders seems to be just another mobile port of a tower defense game. However after taking a closer look there is a surprising amount of content here.\n\nIn my 5 hours of gameplay I've seen 5 base line towers each with 3 upgrades which then convert into 3 specialized towers with 3 additional upgrades. 2 special abilities and 1 big mean deamon buddy.\n\nOn top of the towers you have a list of specilizations that you spend "Souls" on in between rounds. These specializations improve your normal towers greatly. Depending on the map your running you may need to change specializations, thankfully there is an easy way to do that with only a 10% decrease in souls per use.\n\nConsidering there are over 90 levels in the game atm and 15 different maps this translates into a crap ton of content. Each map has 5 different difficulty settings that increase the rewards for mastering plus a challenge mode that you can run repeatedly to gain souls to buff your towers abilities.\n\nThat graphics are very well done, the voice acting is hilarious, and overall a damn good purchase for the price of a movie. If you enjoy tower defense games with some meat to them and a ton of content this is a solid buy.\n\nFor my full review with gameplay check out the video below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8g2tY3uemU","November 20, 2015","true","13.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

The problem however comes with the things it doesn´t do well.\nIf you set aside that you are basically playing the same missions over and over again, which didn´t really bother me that much, the fact that the first time you play a mission (standart difficulty) is by far the hardest and most recognizable one doesn´t go well with it.\nThe ONLY challenging waves are the early waves which doesn´t change with increased difficulty. There are some exceptions on this, more to that later, but this makes the later waves (and thus the higher difficulties) feel even more like a grind as you´re just sitting there on speed x4 waiting for it to be finally over. Once you figure out which towers are good and which aren´t (which is the sad truth this game faces) you will find yourself rarely slowing down the speed to actually use your abilities.\n\nWhen the game completely fails however, is when you make it to the final wave and get completly destroyed by it´s wave. It is not always the same which strong enemies you get which sadly reeeeally matters here. Getting a juggernaut, a summoner or a paladin makes up everything in the earlier difficulties as you can´t build defenses against all 3 types in such a short time making them once again way more difficult than higher difficulties.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this however and overall what i took from this game was not the grinding of later difficulties but the overall design it has. That´s what makes this game special and that is the only reason why you should buy it. If you don´t own a lot of the TDs here on steam i´d still suggest getting another, as there are better ones out there, some even with nearly the exact same tower scheme.","November 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

The peasants managed to find our lair! It’s time to setup our defences and crush the insurgence of do gooders and protect the lands of Evil!\n\nEvil Defenders is a well-designed Tower Defence / Strategy game where you are in control of the Devils army.  You will have at your disposition up to 60 different towers across 15 maps. Each of these maps have 6 levels to beat, an awesome 90 levels to play. Upon success, you will earn souls which you use to upgrade your units and abilities.\n\nThe enemies are the nasty humans and they have 15 units from peasants to berserkers (by Belzebub, this one is mighty hard to kill!).

As you progress, the game gets quite challenging - make sure you accumulate as many souls as possible by beating all level per map before jumping to the next one. Otherwise, you will be stuck (just like I was) trying to beat it over and over with no success at all. What the Hell!\n\nI really like the graphics in the game including the artwork, the audio is catchy for a while (that is until you get stuck and you blame it on the boogie).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/412520/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","The defenders are evil, the game is good, and the crowd goes wild!\nOnce upon a time there was a game called Kingdom Rush, it was popular, it was popular because as Tower Defences go it was polished, easy to get into and well balanced, whilst at the same time maintaining a solid, and interesting set of upgrades as well as a good set of unique twists that made the game genuinely great in it's own right. There's been other genuinely excellent Tower Defences as well (Defence Grid : The Awakening being the prime example), however, these are few and far between. Most of the time, you get "decent" attempts, or ones that are just forgettable...\n\n... until now.\n\nTake a bow Evil Defenders. Please, come forward onto the stage, and be showered with roses and cheers, for you are most definitely one of the greats, and deserve to be welcomed and feted. Now that's not going to be unreserved praise. There's a few things I will take up with you, but considering you get so much right, I think we can get along just famously. Evil Defenders doesn't do anything particularly new or novel, it doesn't break ground in any significant one (save for a minor twist, which is actually rather neat in it's own right), but what it does is take what exists, and it applies polish. It applies polish over and over, until there's this worn in lacquer that's almost, almost Blizzard worthy. At a price point that makes this a real bargain.\n\nFirst impressions can be misleading...\nNow to be fair, the first impressions are going to have you sit back in the seat and make you wonder if the game really is all that. The intro video screams "Mobile game, Clash of Clans, Free To Play", it's got -those- kinds of vibes about it. The options menu is utterly bereft of anything bar a couple of sound sliders and a toggle for health bars over the tops of things (Really? That needs to be an option? If it was a choice between bars and numbers, that'd make sense at least...), still, you fire up the first map and then things begin to look up, there's a set of difficulties (some locked off) and a challenge mode.\n\nNormal mode to begin with is merely the appetiser, it's generally pretty easy as long as you don't fall asleep at the wheel or make entirely dumb choices, as the tower positions are fixed all you need do is make the "correct" choices as to what goes where. However, there's another -four- difficulties after that, going all the way to inferno at the top which throws a marathon number of waves, comprised of advanced mobs from later maps and forcing you to adapt and improvise, taking lessons from much, much further in, and applying them to your earlier levels. Things begin to look up...\n\n... and then you open up the upgrade tree.\n\nThe Nine Levels of Upgrade Heaven (and Hell)\nOhhhh lordie lordie. The upgrade tree is -massive-, not only does it branch like a massive set of snaking vines, along multiple paths, with individual paths for each tower and power type, as well as a utility tree for things like "Bonus bounties" from killed mobs. But you can level the upgrades iteratively, so buying the same upgrade multiple times improves the bonus it gives. This means setting up specialised builds is a thing (at least before the eventual maxing out of -everything- if you're OCD about minmaxing your towers).\n\nThe game goes from being this rather generic looking tower defence to being this amazingly polished and genuinely deep tower defence that offers real replayability and a serious flexibility in how you design your defences and how you guide your playstyle. The level of customisation as a result is absolutely incredible, not counting the sheer level of upgradability in game (each tower has three tiers of base upgrade, followed by their specialist three tiers depending on the path you pick). On top of this, each level has a landscape feature that may help or hinder you to some extent, learning how to use this to your advantage can be critical in helping stem the tide (the prime example is the oil river on the desert map that can be lit up to cause DOT fire damage).\n\nIt's not all fun and games in Evil Land...\nThere ARE complaints though. First, no endless mode. For me this is a minor issue, but one that should be noted nonetheless. Some people might care about it more than others. Secondly, the game can feel grindy at times, you will need an awful lot of souls to max out your upgrade trees, but again, that's only an issue you intend to minmax the whole lot. Finally, the game, whilst amazingly polished, doesn't do -much- to move things forward, but then this is one of those "reviewers" things, for most people this isn't even going to be a consideration. If you're looking to try something really -new-, this is something to bear in mind.\n\nThese are however, in case you've not already noticed, nits. Minor complaints, these are small hitches in an otherwise stellar presentation of Tower Defence, and easily one of the strongest TD's since the likes of Defence Grid and Kingdom Rush. At the price point it's pitched at, it's a very, very easy sell.\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended - Particularly to people looking to get into Tower Defence games AND to TD fans alike.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Grind successful missions and difficulties to increase the potential of your towers. Certain missions require certain towers. In other missions your fully upgraded tower might be useless. Some towers are plain useless anyway. Long story short, you can pretty easily beat the game by just playing mission after mission, mostly. But the harder difficulties and challenge missions require a lot of grinding, which is why this game is already getting uninstalled again.

For your information, I was not able to play this game on steam due to technical problems, I played it through a different app on my computer and therefore playtime was not added. Overall i played this game for about 2 hours more or less.\n\nAbout The Game\nThis game is much like Kingdom Rush, you are the devil and are being raidied by peasants and you must defeat them. There are 5 different and unique towers each with their own upgrade paths. Build your defenses in key positions to take down the peasants. Each level has a unique map bonus that will aid you in the peasants downfall. This is much like Kingdom Rush but also very different and a lot better with more content.\n\nWorth it?\nIs this game worth it? Yes this game is worth it, it is cheap and a great game with amazing visuals. If you are a fan of tower defense games or looking to try one then try Evil Defenders. This game will bring you 100s of hours of gameplay.\n\nPros Amazing graphics.\nLots of different tower upgrade paths.\nUnique map bonuses that assist you in many ways.\nOutstanding level layout.\nLots of different enemies, some with their own abilities.\nDifferent modes of difficulty for each level.\nLots of different upgrades for each tower\nDifferent abilities that let you conquer the battlefield.\n\nCons\nRequires a bit of farming for upgrades.\n\nMy Final Verdict I rate this game 8.7/10 this is a really great game and is very fun to play. It provides a good challenge and has great tower upgrades. There are so many different towers to choose from with different upgrade paths that lead to game changing towers. I recommend this game to any tower defense fans and its never to late to get started.\n\nIf you liked this curation and would like to see more make sure to follow our curration group Here","November 14, 2015","true","0.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","13","23","7","0"

Though slowdown of other PC of engine does not seem to be the culprit.\n\nMechanics are lack luster and tower AI is atrocious as the seem to select targets willy nilly or at random, typically changing targets at the worst opportunity. An example would be instead of finishing off an enemy about to heal itself or activate a dash, they will instead select another target that has is typically last in line or has the highest health, which in turn usually means the Priest is allowed to heal themselves and all their companions back to full health. It's seemingly random as to wether your minions select the proper target and even more so as to whether or not they will actually STAY ON it.\n\nPowers seem randomly spectacular and underwhelming as well. Being the evil leader (Or something) you may strike with lightning, teleport, and summon a demonic creature. Lightning can chain down a clustered line of targets, but sometimes will only strike a single target and deal minimal damage only to adjacent creatures. Teleport typically targets the attacker behind the leader for some odd reason as though it doesn't properly line up with the cursor. However as with lightning strike it can work correctly seemingly at random.\n\nThe only well functioning aspect appears to be the artwork which is chuckle worthy, but the specialness wears off when fighting with the game mechanics for the better part of ten minutes per map, having to restart merely because a tower decided that it was going to switch targets at the worst moment.\n\nFinal thoughts: There are far better tower defense games out there. "Don't Steal my Gems" on Ninja Kiwi will serve far better, and it is free.","January 29","false","6.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

That being said, the game introduces map specific activatables and wave events that can spice things up, a nice add. You get your typical array of towers with a nice new addition (the summon tower) but what really breaks the game for me is the tower progress tree: want to make your tower better? Spend skulls, want more skulls? Clear more maps. Rinse and repeat. If you remove this you'll find the game to be very shallow.\n\nStory: You get the bare minimum to context why humans are trying to pillage Evil's land (pure statement, it's just a quick TD game, can't really fault it for not having story, though I could sing its praises if it had a goon one).\n\nSound: No breaking ground stuff here, just a cute jingle to acompany the passage of time. Tower upgrades get some irky lines, not a fan.\n\nGraphics: This game looks very much like a smartphone one, maybe it originaly was? As so graphics go for the cartoony style and do a decent job at dilvering what you'd expect from a TD for the mentioned platform.\n","May 29","false","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If i ever come across a new one i always give it a try and this game is officially one of my favorites. Like most games there are severall difficulties per level and a challenge mode. My favorite part is that you have a skill tree thats always increasing. You can remaster a few levels to get some extra Souls(used to upgrade) and continously improve your towers. The game is also available on mobile but you get the complete game for a single purchase on steam without the need to buy extra levels or drain money on souls to get ahead. would recomend this game to anyone who simply enjoys a good tower defense game.","January 29","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full Review Click Here ["http]\n\nKingdom Rush series is one of my favorite Tower Defense games around, it's a shame none of its other chapters have come out on PC. In comes Evil Defense, another mobile TD come PC game. How does it fare? It has charm, and the same strategic elements that makes KR such a fun series.\n\nHowever Evil Defense lacks heart and soul, it does little to really differentiate itself from other TD games. You still lay out ground troops, and you still back them up with mages, archers, and mortars. This PC version keeps endless amounts of grinding which can be a complete bore to push through. That may fly well on mobile devices but on PC, its easy to get bored. Yes, you will have to grind the same levels 5+ times to gather enough souls to upgrade further and play the next hard level 4-5 more times. Not at all what I look for in an engaging TD game.","December 4, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dreadful Spammer, Heroes Grave, Napalm Artillery and Eye of corruption. In the last map, i didnt use the heroes grave.\n\nSo maybe have maps in the future, where its very good to use the other towers etc..\n\nThink the game needs a "Endless Madness" Challenges. They just keep coming and gets harder as you progress in waves. It first stops when you out of life.\nHave a leader board on that, who can get the most waves with the skill that are availible.\n\nMaybe a random map maker or even a Map editor for players?\nAlso, it would be nice if the whole screen view was in a full windows.\n\nLOVE the graphic work witch makes it nice and cosy. Sound is nice, maybe have the cartoons say some fun stuff :-)\n\nThat was my 5-cents.

But if you're like me and you're upset with the guys over at KR for going over to mobile devices only, then what better way to stick it to 'em than buy a game here on steam so similiar to theirs?\n\nIt is a SOLID game with plenty of hours-played in the bang for your buck area. Completionists beware, if you want to get all of the game's rather staggering 98 achievements, be prepared to dump in about 40 hours into this relatively simple game.\n\nAbout six levels in you'll notice that your towers just aren't cutting it anymore. You need to power them up using souls. That is, the currency you get for killing, having leftover gold, earning star ratings and choosing higher difficulties. So yes, there is some grind-factor to be had here, if you want to reach the upper levels. Have fun playing "The Wastelands" level over and over for hours (It has the highest soul output for your time in the game, about 2500 per playthrough).\n\nThat aside, once you've powered up your towers, abilities, and summoned demon you'll be an unstoppable fighting force that the game simply can't keep up with. I guess instead of balancing their towers to be suited for all levels, the devs just thought it would be better to make you stronger for time spent, like a traditional RPG. I don't like the idea, but I understand it.\n\n\nTDLR:\n\n-Play Kingdom Rush (also here on Steam) FIRST, and then if you want more play this game too.\n-This game steals a LOT of concepts, even towers, from Kingdom Rush.\n-It is a SOLID game and a good example of the genre.\n-There is going to be some SERIOUS grinding levels if you want everything (5 hours+)\n-Despite any complaints it's still a strong, functional, well-built game. No complaints.\n\n6/10","December 4, 2015","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short of the quick tutorial, you are left to the slaughter from the get go. I usually enjoy TD games and appreciate a good challenge.The pacing and balance are way off from the start. Normally you would proceed with the levels and upgrade as you go in order to be able to handle the higher levels, this one will give you two maybe three levels and will have you repeating those levels over and over again in order to obtain souls to upgrade (currency for leveling up towers and abilities) I belive this is left over from when this game was a mobile cash cow for real world currency.  Although there is a good deal of strategy to be used in tower placement, this game relies way too heavily of grinding in order to level up the towers enough to barely squeak by to the next level. The grinding has no enjoyment as well, because the upgrades themselves are very lack luster (+4% attack speed, that was well worth playing the same level four times! <--sarcasm btw)\nIt is a shame, the visuals are bright and pleasant with smooth animation and unique characters. Aside from the mind numbing grinding the game play has potential. This COULD HAVE BEEN a wonderful casual game, but if I sit down to play a game it should not feel like work, work is what I am taking a break from.","December 8, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then you'll totally like Evil Defenders!\n\nIt lies close to Ancient Planet in terms of visual beauty (except the little enemy characters...their faces look like a mouth mated with a potato...play the game and you'll see what I mean!), and sits just belo Prime World: Defenders in upgradablity.\n\nIts replayability lies in that upgradability...you can see how long it's taken me for one playthrough (give or take a few hours due to me getting distracted). Towers can be upgraded in game as per normal in this genre, with two tiers of abilities. Like Prime World: Defenders and GemCraft, though, towers also need to be upgraded between levels to boost their performance. The game balances this upgrade path with available currency (which you collect by winning levels), so that you'r pretty much forced to play all available levels to complete the playthrough, which I personally like very much - I'm not into overly-easy games.\n\nThere are 15 levels with 5 difficulties each, plus a challenge mode. You will need to complete all 6 of these modes per level to fulfil the upgrade path outlined above, so that's quite a lot of gaming right there.\n\nI loved the game, and hope there's DLC soon!

It has a lot of little tips of the hat to different sci-fi/fantasy elements, and is fun enough to make you want to keep playing the different challenge modes.

Overall gameplay is fun, however it bottoms out halfway through.

You have a handful of towers at your disposal, and each can be upgraded, but also specialized for AOE, single target, dot damage, etc. You have several abilities at your disposal as well, such as summoning a large demon to assist, teleport the enemy, lightning strikes. The game is rather short, as far as the number of levels, but in order to get through those levels, you will need to do some grinding. The grinding most likely takes place of IAP, since this is a mobile game conversion (it no longer has IAP, but you won't be strong enough to advance unless you grind out each level probably 4-5 times each, going through the different difficulty levels). Normally, that fact turns off a lot of people, myself including, but despite the fact the game is based on a mobile port, and you need to grind a bit, the game is fun enough that if you can pick it up for a low price (low price is the key here), I think it's still worth it. It's more of a diversionary game you can play for a few minutes mindlessly rather than an in-depth head-scratching tower defense where you figure out tons of strategies or replay maps endlessly trying to figure out the best path to take. The story is cutesy, but almost nonexistent, the graphics and music are pretty good for a basic TD game. I'd probably give it a 6 out of 10, meaning while I do recommend it, it's not with gushing enthusiasm, but it's a decent distraction for a few hours, and I found it addicting. There's not a ton of strategy here, and you are playing more in order to level up your towers than anything else.\n","May 29","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 6 different level each stage (Standard - Nightmare - Chaos - Hell - Inferno - Challenge). My logic is Inferno must be much harder than Standard, I'm wrong, Inferno and Challenge is much easier than Standard because you can upgrade your building to max level, and I can speed up to x4 from the beginning round, boring.\n\n2. There are 3 spells, Lightning - Teleport - Summon Evil. Lightning is useless even after you upgrade it to max damage, it only effective for low health enemy that ironically your tower can kill them easily, what's the point of this spell?\n\n3. Apprentice tower is useless.\n\n4. No hero, no additional item/spell that you can buy using gold, so the only way to clear high stage is playing Inferno mode at lower stage over and over, so you get enough gold to upgrade your building.\n\nThis is simple tower defense game, you don't need to think, just place Orc Cannon on front and Crossbow Goblin on back, and a Crypt on middle, and you'll win.\nCompare to another TD games, usually even you upgrade your tower to max level, you will lose if you use wrong tower setup.\n\nI still recommend this game because I like the concept and that funny character design. Buy it if there's a Sale! because you can buy better TD game with standard price.\n\n5.5/10","June 4","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
