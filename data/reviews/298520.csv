Just...see the trailer. It is more exciting to see it than read it.\n\n-The "Maps" are beautiful. Seeing how much different are the planets and spaces [literally] between them, is always welcome. Also in some maps require from the players to play differently each time.\nFor example in a specific VERY small map, I suggest you heavily to use mines and a shotgun :)\n\n-A very satisfying variety of weapons for you to select. From a "normal" Minigun, to a weapon shooting big deadly gravity balls, pulling your enemies inside it!!!\nAlso the weapons work very differently from each other, making you test all the weapons to see which combination suit you better. The weapons of choice is Minigun/Grenade Launcher. It is simple my Jam!!!\n\n-You can use 4 different perks: Rocket-Jump, Mines, Shield and Assist Drones. Again, you must test them to see what suit you better. Rocket-Jump is my choice. I just LOVE the awesome stunt I do with it!!!\n\n-OOOoOOOOoooOOohhhh yeaaaaaaahhhhh!!! Run, Jump, shoot while you travel from planet from planet because of the use of the rocket-jump, fly near a enemy and blast him with a grenade launcher, WOSKdlsuokootrkqwqdklsdkls *drools everywhere*\n\n-Wait for it.......waaaaait for it....JUMP AND SHOOT GRENADES TO YOUR SPOT AND SEE THE ENEMY GET DESTROYED BY YOUR TRAP!!!!!! OH YEAH!!!!\n\n-FInally the music is good. Very suitable for this specific game.\n\n[Cons]\n\n-Main problem: Not many people play the game right now. I am trying to find other player to play the game, but it is difficult. However the developers play the game sometimes [or daily, but I don't see them. I don't know] and this is a very positive in my book. They care and love their little gem.\n\n-4 Robots for you to select. Sadly I only like the first one. The other models are....not so hot to say. Need more exciting design.\n\n-Sometimes  my character get stuck to a platform and I am a easy target for the others.\n\n[Final Thought]\n\nThis is one of the best multiplayer games I ever played. It is fun, exciting, lot of weapons, beatiful maps, awesome stunts you can accomplice.

It looks amazing, it plays really smoothly, it has a very fast paced gameplay.\nThe player movement feels a bit strange at first, but you get used to it pretty fast.\n\nAbout the weapons: They are very varied and have very specific roles and situations to be used on effectively.\nYou only get to choose 2 weapons at a time. That means you can't adapt to situations without dying, choosing a different loadout and respawning. Level design doesn't give you that many situations either. The levels are very open arenas, made to showcase the awesome gravity gameplay. It's a bit strange to just walk and use the planet you're standing on as cover. But there's enough weapon variety for people with higher pings to have a lot of fun, without having to rely solely on accuracy to get some kills.\n\nThere's 2 main gametypes. The classic DeathMatch, and Orbital Warfare. The later one being the most strategic, requiring you to defend your structures while attacking the enemy base. While there is potential for tactics here, the matches tend to be very offensive. There's no tools to provide support roles (you need to kill enemies to repair structures), or to play defensively (the shield item lasts a couple of seconds and doesn't stop enemies). So you'll really need to coordinate with your teammates to create a good minefield defense, or a satellite based defense line. Otherwise, it ends up feeling like team deathmatch with some extra objectives.\nPlaceable roadblocks, a big permanent shield item that can cover an entire structure for 30 seconds but with a 15 seconds cooldown, big mines that follow the orbit of the planet it was deployed on, or an item that teleports you back to your base, could be features that might spice up that gamemode.\n\nThis is a very well crafted game. I really hope future updates bring some more maps to play on, and some sort of single player contents, for those days when we can't find online games.","August 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The vice is that, well, that’s about all there is to it. A paltry two modes, Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, are included. Deathmatch is self-explanatory; Orbital Warfare is a more strategic team-based affair that’s essentially King of the Hill in space.There aren’t too many surprises in level layouts, either. The six Deathmatch maps and three Orbital Warfare maps are pretty similar to one another.While there are numerous weapons to choose from, and finding ways of making them interact with the environment is enjoyable, the majority of them suffer a common flaw. They have this weird half-second delay in their initial firing - with the exception of the mini-gun, which has to spool up.The total lack of single-player content though, actually negatively impacts the multiplayer side of the equation to a fair degree.Mainly because, even a week and a half after launch, there are at most a small handful of servers available at any one time, and often none whatsoever. Without other people playing, a multiplayer online-only shooter is about as useful as a disconnected telephone.Orbital Gear can be a frantic shooter that pulls you in with its gravitational gimmickry, but lacks the forward momentum to keep me playing for long.Overall 6/10.","September 16, 2014","true","4.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The faster you go, the more stars you get. You need to collect a certain amount of stars to unlock the next one.\nIt's an interesting single-player mode, but I'd much have preferred normal Deathmatch/Orbital Warfare battles with bots instead. Still, at least there's something to do in single-player. I've increased my rating below.\nOriginal unedited review follows.\n----------------------------------------------\nThis game got onto Steam as a result of Who's Gaming Now?!'s free key for a Greenlight vote promotion. In truth, after playing this game for a while, I felt that it wasn't really needed - this game was fantastic, entertaining and it blew me away, and it could probably have gotten onto Steam by merit alone. (Though I would no doubt agree that WGN?! gave it the much-needed exposure it deserved.)\n\nOrbital Gear is a 2D space game with beautiful 3D graphics about fighting mechs (called 'Gears'). There are 12 interesting weapons with defining characteristics, 2 game modes (plain deathmatch and Orbital Warfare where teams destroy opposing team buildings) and 4 other mech utilities. A great variety of maps coupled with the weapon choices make for some interesting battles as you mix and match your gear (pun unintended) to get an optimal setup.\n\nWhat Orbital Gear has going for it is its rather fresh combination of 2D platform shooting and planet gravity mechanics. Flying (gliding, rather) around the planets, jumping around from here to there is a rather exhilarating and heart-racing experience. The gravity mechanics really shake up the game a lot, and are a very solid foundation to build upon. (I mean, because of all the gravity, you're firmly planted to the foundation.....never mind.)\n\nWhere the game (currently) falls short in is the fact that it's for now a multiplayer-only game. Now it's no secret that on Steam most multiplayer-only games are rendered lifeless within months, because everyone will be going back to their DOTAs, their CSGOs, their TF2s, and so on and so forth. As such, during the time I spent playing, I only found a maximum of 2 open games at any point of time, some with only 1 player. Developer Night Node has promised to add a practice single player mode in future updates, but for now I'd recommend being wary of this.\n\nDespite the major lack of single player shortcomings, the rest of the game already feels quite polished and well done. I'd recommend checking this game out with a few friends if you have the time. Oh, and the electronic soundtrack is surprisingly great, too.\n\nWhen to buy: With the lack of people in multiplayer, unfortunately I feel it best to buy it from bundles. The single player mode is like a snack - not very filling.\n\n8.5/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them? Like game giveaways?

If that wasn’t enough to convince you, read on.\n\nThis title is essentially an arena game set upon a 2D platform with 3D graphics, the twist revolves around the clever implementation of gravity around structures and planets, with which the players will use to maneuver their mechs. The system can be confusing at first, but very rewarding once a player gets the hang of it, I was pulling gravitational slingshot and performing swing-by shooting within an hour.\n\nThe guns themselves are fairly mundane and standard among this type of game, but the twelve of them do vary a great deal in terms of play style and tactics. There are four utility tools available as well, but I rarely see people use them to much effect in game.\n\nAs for game modes, you have the basic Death Match which is self explanatory. Then you have Orbital Warfare, a territorial tug-of-war in which both teams race to charge up their main cannons for a devastating blast. Lastly you have Orbital Trials, a single player time attack mode that pits you up against patrolling machines on a map with limited weaponry; this was added by the developers after much request from the community.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game was the lack of bots, so if you just wanted a private match with a friend or two, the arena would feel very desolate. Other than that I felt the community could do better with a few thousand more players, so it would be easier to find games during different hours of the day.\n\nThe asking price of 10 USD is fine, but if you find this under 1 USD during a sale, it would be a practical steal.","January 12","true","11.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

For example if you use a shotgun-esque weapon then you will be trying to close the distance on people and blow them away. I use a long range electricty weapon so i try to keep my distance while using my secondary weapon the phase orb to force people to move in the direction i want them to go. I have ran across some people who are really good at placing mines which was very effective against me. You can place turrets but i have not ran across anyone who does really well with them yet.\n\n\n-At night i have a hard time finding people online to play matches with which for me anyway makes the game worthless until someone comes online to play with which can be a long time since you are probably not going to log in and stare at the screen for hours until someone logs in. So more then likely you are going to log on and if no one is online playing you will close the game and try again later.\n- Single player seems kind of pointless to a certain extent and is not very much fun (Although i did score in the top 50 on one of the levels).\n- The maps get repetitive especialy in single player.\n- If the game had a bigger community i would think the $9.99 price tag to be fine but since the community is so small i think the game is worth 3-4$ at most.","March 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

It is ♥♥♥♥in' great! OG can easily keep up with its competitors & is in my opinion even better than those (TheShowdownEffect, Awesomenauts,...). Orbital Gear is a fast 2.5D side-scroll gravity multiplayer shooter. You play as a mech with a good variety of selectable weapons in a space environment filled with orbital planets. You need to run, jump & shoot while using the gravitation to your advantage.\n\nPros:\n+ great gameplay\n+ great weapons (UT,Quake)\n+ great controls\n+ great ost\n+ great multiplayer\n+ good graphics\n+ good sounds\n+ good singleplayer\n=> "orbital trials" ai bots & world leaderboard\n+ balanced & fun modes\n+ many host options\n+ 1click-host your own servers (no lags)\n+ totally worth your time!\n\nCons:\n- needs &deserves more players\n=> this game definately needs a SALE\n- almost no servers\n- i'd love to see more maps\n\nGrab a 4Pack (with your friends) and you don't need to find servers...","August 27, 2014","true","7.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","3"

A game that has great gameplay, unique, and creative. Do not focus only on the beauty of the game, but note also the gameplay.\n\nDo not just want to reap a profit by selling your stupid games and DLC. And at least this game has no F***ING DLC such as map and weapons, only a Soundtrack.\n\nOh yes, and for the soundtrack, gee crazy, cool cool and cool.\n\nRemember, if your game is good, then gamers will love your game. You just need to make a good game, and allow gamers to play it, not have to think of making your stupid DLC-DLC. DLC whose price is equivalent to the game.\n\nIf yours was a good game, then gamers will also give a good review. Perform your duty first, then you get your rights.\n\nHey man!!! look at this game. Only 2D, but is more cool and powerful than Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront 3 with a million stupid DLC.\n\nNight 10/10 for Node as The Developer\n10/10 for the Game\n8/10 for the Soundtrack\n10/10 for the Character\n\nOnce again, for all the game developers, especially for "Overkill Software" stop making stupid DLC, lest you referred to as "Good Game, Bad Developer".

The game is also easy to understand and I like how easily you can choose weapons after each death - Try different playstyles!\n\n--- It does not include single player (for example with bots) which is shame. It really needs more players to enjoy it. It is a great game but only has few servers so ping is not the best sometimes.","August 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There is fun to be had, BUT my word of caution is that the player base is small so at times servers can be scarse.\nThere is a gamemode aside from online play that allows you to run through the map and destroy as many small bots as you can trying to beat your best time which can be fun and easy to get into. Although that may not be enough content for 9.99 for some people which s understandable. My advice, wait till its on sale if you want to play it safe, that way you get it for a lower price and the player base may increase from new players coming in.","December 14, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not worth it otherwise.\nThis game has a lot of potential. But it rarely does anything with it. The gameplay mechanics are great, online and local multiplayer is fun, the many different types of weapons provide many different ways to play, and once you get used to the unique movement mechanic, it's an amazing feeling to use gravity to zoom around different "planets". But the game just doesn't feel finished. It lacks things that I feel are basic to this type of game. It has no "normal" single player (which I'll expand on in a minute), no minimap of any kind, and really only 3 types of gamemodes.\nSo, there is a type of single player, and it's not that bad. You just have to kill a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time, and unlock weapons as you go. But the annoying part is, this is the only type of single player. There's not any mod where you just pick a world and dificulty, put in bots, and just have a deathmatch. Yeah, there's that in multiplayer, but multiplayer has it's own problems. First off, it's hard to be a "noob" in mutiplayer. A good amount of these people have gotten pretty good and using the weapons, utilities, and maps fully to their advantage. Not to mention, the community is tiny. For the whole US, there's usually only one game going on at once. Only one. With maybe 8 people. Not a huge community. Yeah, multiplayer is fun, but since it's so small, they should add more gamemodes for single player.\nGamemodes are another thing. There are only three. One for single player, and two for multiplayer. I personally would love seeing modes like survival, juggernaut, etc.\nNow, as you can see, I am recommending this. That's because, with all this missing, it's still a good game. At least, it has it's moments. When you're playing locally with a friend, it's a great small game to have. And, like I said, the gameplay mechanics are pretty good. It just feels more like an early access game than a finished game.\nSo, overall, it's not a great game, but it's a good game. It can be fun to play sometimes, and it's a good game to mess around with friends. However, it feels like it's missing simple, easy-to-add things that would make it a far better game. So, feel free to get it, I'd just recommend getting it during a sale of some kind.","January 5","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hitaro9/recommended/298520/","hitaro9","Hitaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hitaro9/","182 products in account","Orbital Gear is a fun fast paced shooter with some really fun design choices.\n\nPros:\n[+] Guns are satisfying. There are 12 in all, and each one is very unique. Using a different gun feels like using a different class in Tf2, and each one has a satisfying hit. There are a lot of high impact weapons, so dieing is quick, but so are respawn timers so there's very little to no downtime.\n\n[+] Movement is great. It takes a little bit to get used to the gravity mechanic, but once you understand how to manipulate it in your favor, sling shotting yourself across the map feels really great. There are single player time trials to help you learn them.\n\n[+] High skill high reward. The nice thing about the game is that it's consistent. There's a lot of room to learn the movement system, a lot of room to learn how to position yourself relative to certain guns, aiming with projectiles has a ton of depth, and overall just being good at aiming + Reaction is very rewarding. Some combinations will seem overpowered, but then you realize that there are counters to most everything and most things are pretty balanced. For example, when I first got the game it seemed to me the gauntlet was the most broken weapon in the game, but after a couple hours you realize that it gets absolutely destroyed by any of the shotgun-esque weapons and overall just positioning.\n\nCons:\n[-] Very little lag compensation. Servers are player hosted, and even when playing with people who have relatively low ping, (like 20-50) you'll have people teleporting their locations. Super frustrating and honestly the biggest negative.\n\n[-] Lack of feedback. There's  no indication of whether or not you hit somebody else. You can shoot at someone multiple times and have no idea if you've actually damaged them. Not usually an issue since most weapons tend to be very high damaging, and most of the time 1-4 shots will kill someone (lending to the fast paced nature of the game, but would be a nice, easy fix.\n\n[-] Small Player base. I've checked other server regions a couple times, and asian /australian regions have no servers usually. American and European servers tend to have a couple servers running so if you live in either of those places it should be fine.\n\nVerdict: As of writing this the game is on sale for a dollar, and at that price the game is absolutely worth getting. I see it's also been in packs and bundles before for a couple dollars and that'd also be worth it. I personally wouldn't recommend the game for 10 dollars, but just a little bit off of that and its an amazing deal.\n\n","May 28, 2015","true","26.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gravity will pull you down on the planets which could make the game unpredictable. There's a quite big variety of weapons for you to play with ranging from grenade launchers to pulserifles etc.\n\nIt's no game you would play hours in a row but works really well in short doses. Also, without any bot support you are to rely on online players. At the moment there are still people playing but they won't be in the dozens but this would make a nice party game.\n\nOverall I found Orbital Gear to be a real fun and engaging game.","January 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At first, you have no clue what to do because the game is unclear about it, so you start with missions and you muddle through that because of the trailer you saw of the game was cool and it had good reviews. Then you look around and decided to try the online multiplayer and you have no clue what the heck is going on because everything is exploding you don't really understand the different weapons or the mechanics but you're having a ton of fun because THAT is what you saw in the trailer. (And then you go back to the missions and realize that they're actually practice for all the different weapon types)\n\nWhat is the game? You're a mech running around a bunch of planets in 2D, each with their own gravity, trying to shoot other mechs. There's a variety of options for guns, powerups and mechs. You can choose between two game modes or try the singleplayer missions for practice.\n\nGood Stuff:\n-Awesome gameplay\n-Great concept\n-Simple Controls\n-Actually and simply just fun to play\n\nWhat needs improvement:\n-Server lag, other people have mentioned this, and they're right, sometimes it's hard to play because of lag\n-Starting off you don't really understand how weapons work or what you're doing, and the game only partially explains what you're doing\n\n\nIf you give this game an hour, you'll understand the controls and what you're doing and you'll really love it, because it really is a great game.","July 31, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's always at least one or two servers with players online. No bots for singleplayer matches, but there is a sort-of singleplayer time trial with random alien things that shoot you.\n\nBe aware there are a few "n00b weapons" that require pretty much no aiming (Hornets and phase orb). But don't worry too much because they're quite low damage and with a bit of skill can be outmaneouvred completely.\n\nThe more skilled weapons dish out a lot of damage so it's quite rewarding to try using the harder ones. I found some weapons a little underpowered but maybe I was just using them wrong.\n\nGood variety of weapons too. Should suit lots of play styles.\n\nOrbital physics take some getting used to but it's really satisfying when you hit just the right angle and go spinning around an asteroid a few times without touching the ground. My best advice is to not fight the controls.\n\nWorst case scenario, mash random movement buttons and focus on pointing your weapon at nearby players.\n\nI only spent $1 on it but it is probably worth the full $10.","March 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And when I saw, that (on the sale) I can get a 4-pack of the game for 2€, I decided to buy and download it immediately. The download is only about 270MB, so that went quickly. I had a little trouble understanding the game at start, but I quickly got over it in the trials, and after I completed 3 or 4 I decided to go into multiplayer.\n\nNow, here begin the little issues, that may make you want to turn away from the game.\nThere isn't many players in the games - however, on my first try there were 10 people. HOWEVER, on the server I tried to join the weapon select menu didn't work at all, and I couldn't start playing. So, I tried again. 10 people again, this time I managed to actually spawn and play.\nThe weapon variety made it seem really awesome. You can play anyway you want, from melee boosting with gravity assists, through shielded sniping to a gravity ball, that flies through everything with a flamethrower while a satellite assists you from the air.\n\nNot only you get to choose two weapons, but also a utility:\n-Booster - allows you to, well, boost yourself and gain some speed, or redirect your flight. Particularly useful for avoiding the green "gravity balls", or for more advanced gravity assists.\n-Mines - never actually used that one, but I'll update it in the future. I guess the name is enough though.\n-Shield - Gives you, well, a shield, that can be activated and stays in place. It blocks some projectiles, but the mechanics are too weird for me to grasp it after an hour of gameplay.\n-Shooting Satellite - It's basically a floating automatic turret. Doesn't shoot fast and is easy to avoid, but has some nice damage.\n\nNow, the variety seems awesome, right? There's some issues though. Balancing issues.\nSome maps are small, and shooting a single "gravity ball" can kill half of the people at once. And if it doesn't, you can finish the floating mass with one of the OP weapons, or even a grenade launcher.\nSome maps, in exchange, are so big, that a weapon, which is basically a homing rocket launcher, can target every enemy on map due to spread of the rockets while firing, and a shield can protect you from most of damage.\n\nTL;DRGame is awesome, has some balancing issues and small glitches, DEFINITELY buy it if it's on a sale.","March 18, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, as most people say, is very fun to play. The gravity is essential to control, but once you get the hang of it, its very fun and challenging at times if theres a very skilled player whom you're playing against. The main problem Orbital Gear has (apart from lack of maps and weapons) is the comunity. There is rarely ever people in any and every server, so most people don't even care about checking. I propose that players who play Orbital Gear once in a while or very often but find the lacking community very boring make a group. Just add me and I'll add you to the group and we'll start spreading with time. This way, we can know who and when want to play together, and the game won't be as boring. If you are considering buying this game, I really recommend it. It is very fun to play and if we help each other make the community grow it will be less boring and more fun.","January 7","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Allow me to explain:\n\nIn Orbital gear, you are some sort of giant robot, walking the surface of suspiciously small worlds that are placed odly close together. Using gravity, you jump from world to world, and using a small assortment of devestating weapons you hunt down other mechs and turn them into spaceborn scrap. It's not a complex game plot-wise, to the point I'm not sure it even has an excuse plot, but that doesn't make it less fun. The gravity physics are a bit magnetic, a nescesary thing to make it so that the game is actually playable, but once you find out how to work around and against them, it's awesome. In one match, I was able to launch myself into orbit, got a gravitational boost from 3 planets, exploded an enemy with my flamer, and killed myself by launching myself out of bounds. It was awesome.\n\nNow for the part that makes it terrible: there are no players! I hovered arround for ages, just experimenting with the game physics and waiting for someone to join the server, and when one finally did, it was this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose entire strategy boiled down to, "Hide and use the seaker missiles to do my work for me." Later I managed to get a game going with something like 6 people, and it was awesome, but that was the exception rather than the rule. Another complaint, one that wouldn't be so bad if not for the first problem, is that the single player mode sucks. I honestly didn't even know there was a single player mode at first until I clicked up the time trial option, and even then it's kind of a crappy game mode. If they had taken the time to create a single player mode that's just like the real game but with AI opponents I wouldn't have any complaints about this game, but instead it's so multiplayer focused that it can't stand up if nobody's online.\n\nVerdict: I love this game, and the only reason I could complain is not enough people love it for more to love it.

Haven't had a chance to try multiplayer yet bet the trials alone clearly indicated we are working with some glorious game mechanics.  Swinging around the orbits of little planets lends itself perfectly to the run and gun gameplay.  The graphics/explosions/particle effects are all dialed in nicely.  Some great special effects on display with enemy attacks.  This is Soldat in space, as has been said.  Best purchase of Holiday sale.\n\nUpdate: Just got into some hectic multiplayer and Orbital Gear did not disappoint.  This is a perfect game as is according to my own gaming criteria.  But the monkey mind says, maybe some dlc that gives customization options to your char., maybe a lighter faster class or heavier class more hp and some "rpg" options would get playerbase more invested.  Gameplay is perfect but without customization I fear for longevity.","December 22, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is an adrenaline rush, it takes a little practice to get used to the gravity but there is nothing like slingshoting around an asteroids while trying to land a hit on someone also slingshoting through asteroids, there's 12 weapons which all in all are pretty well balanced (although that shoots little black holes that can pull you in is a little annoying) and you have the option to pick different suit upgrades (double jump stuff like that) which makes for a nicely varied experience. highly recommended 10/10 moon rocks.","May 31, 2015","true","18.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can jump from planet to planet with a cool gravity effect that pulls you towards the orbs that you walk around in circles until you jump to another one.\n\nSo, you have to jump from one orb to another and avoid/kill enemies that are doing the same thing. You can also destroy buildings and repair them and jump on other types of platforms as well.\n\nThere are many cool weapons to choose from, you have a primary and secondary weapon that you can choose each time you respawn after death. The graphics are really detailed and nice for an indie game and everything works well. I think its worth it for any fan of multiplayer pvp games to try it.\n\nI will play more to see what else there is to discover, but after my first match I can say it is a good game and worth your time.","August 25, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Fast-paced fun. Highly recommended.\n\nHowever: there is basically nobody playing on the public servers... so if you buy this game, get the 4-pack and give copies to your friends. Otherwise you'll have nobody to play with. Since there is no single player mode and no bots, having opponents is a requirement.\n\nThe game has two modes: a free-for-all deathmatch mode and a team mode based around capturing objectives. The deathmatch mode is fun and works well but the team mode feels incomplete. For example, there is no direct feedback when you hit a target with your weapon. It's also nearly impossible to find enough players to organize teams... so practically speaking, you'll only ever play the deathmatch mode with your own friends.","May 31, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Controls are not intuitive, as sometimes one button will make you move left, and other times will make you move right. The utility jump button sometimes boosts you further up and other times sucks you down to the ground for no explicable reason. But the worst part is it a multiplayer game that doesn't have a single person playing. You can do time trial levels where you keep replaying the same 4 limited levels in the game but with a different gun each time you play them, shooting the same 1-2 types of guys.

Tell your friends about it! Buy it for them!\n\nLong answer:\nThis is probably one of the best VIDEO GAMES i've ever played. I caps VIDEO GAMES because it does exactly what games should do. It adds something new to the world of gaming. A completely different challenge to master. It has examples from other videogames but this game puts its own spin on things. I got lost in this game for hours and I will continue to do so.\n\nThis game pushes you to the edge of your seat. Flying around makes you cackle like a maniac. Flying by people and raining down hell from whichever weapon you see fit for your play style. It really is a great time when you have a full server of chaos everywhere you look. All while orbiting around the planets strategically placed throughout the maps dodging death at every moment.\n\nI wish more people played it much like everyone else has stated. I think if people put down their big AAA games they would see there is a wonderful gaming experience to be had in the smaller games. The ones that test the waters of something new while still remaining familiar to anyone who jumps in.\n\nIf you stuble accross this game please give it a chance. Also tell your friends!

Sounds simpel, and yes, sometimes it is just that simpel. But the planets you jump on have gravity that effects everyone, meanning you have to take into account that if you jump you might not move up, or if you miss a planet you may end up slingshotting yourself halfway across the map. The offline time trials provide a fairly good introduction to the base mechanics but i found that trial by fire in multiplayer did more for me. Because it is really in the multiplayer aspects this game shines. The weapon and map variety is also nice. So far all the levels seems fun and with great opportunities for frantic combat. The guns also seem different and handle different with i quite like. That means that every gun will require a unique playstyle and offer different challenges.\n\nTo sum up\nGameplay: 8/10. The gameplay is excellent if you are looking for a fun and frantic little 2D shooter.\n\nWeapons: 7/10. The weapons are nicely varied and well balanced, i do however have some personal issues with the some weapons. Namely the Phase orb.\n\nSound: 6/10. The guns sound good, the music sounds good and the annoucer is not annoying. All in all, very good.\n\nLevels: 7/10. All the levels are small enough to put you close to the action while still allowing for breathing room.\n\nLooks: 8/10. Everything looks excellent. The background in the leves looks nice and fits with every level, pretty enough to catch your eye, inconspicuous enough to not be distracting.

I have yet to see video evidence of how people do these.\n\nMultiplayer's a random chaotic mess, which isn't bad.

It is fun for the sake of being fun. I'm not even that good, and yet, I still am laughing and having a blast whenever I decide to play it. It's fast, frantic, and wonderfully competitive, while being as simplistic as possible at the same time. I highly recommend this game. Get some friends together, start a Skype chat, and play. And now, until June 1, it's available for just a $1!\nPros\n- Even when running at maxed out settings, it runs ridiculously smooth. Plus it looks gorgeous and has a perfect, distinct style.\n- The controls, while at first are frustrating, quickly become very familiar.\n- The use of gravity as a main gameplay element was actually pretty well implemented. Not perfect by any means, but it works for a majority of stages in the game.\n- The variety of weapons and stages is great. Each stage and weapon feels distinct. Having a favorite pairing of weapons, and a utility (a sort of enhancement for the user's mech) and then proceeding to master that loadout, feels just like having a favorite Smash Bros. character.\nCons\n- Having controller support as an option may in itself sound great, but using a controller for this game sucks. It just doesn't work.\n- There are a number of different mechs to choose from from within the game. They all look different, with a great retro 80s 90s vibe, but the mechs themselves are just cosmetic, and don't really change anything. Plus within the game, they appear super tiny, so that was pretty useless.\n- Lack of replayability. Everything is already unlocked in this game the second you turn it on. Weapons, mechs, stages, everything.\nAnyways though, these cons are very minor as a whole really, and don't in anyway hinder the amount of childlike fun with this game. 9/10","May 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great range of weapons allows you to employ tactical and evasive gameplay, as well as laying traps, twitch sniping, and getting up close and personal. As stated above, it looks like it would be easy and straightforward, but the gravity system and the various types of weapons and what they do make it far more in depth than it appears.

The team-based gamemode of this. The idea behind this mode is great, but as soon as anyone gets a kill the entire server crashes, with it registering the same kill about 100 times per second, not only that, there doesn't appear to be any form of balancing with the teams as you can choose what team you go on without restriction if there's no-one on the other team.\nSecond isn't anything to blame the devs on, but more the games popularity.

The team-based gamemode of this. The idea behind this mode is great, but as soon as anyone gets a kill the entire server crashes, with it registering the same kill about 100 times per second, not only that, there doesn't appear to be any form of balancing with the teams as you can choose what team you go on without restriction if there's no-one on the other team.\nSecond isn't anything to blame the devs on, but more the games popularity. The game is at it's best in large multiplayer deathmatch servers. Of which there aren't many of. When I check the server browser I usually see 3 or 4 servers, and I've never seen more than 4 at once.

Each stage is unique in both appearance and layout, every single one is worth experiencing. The mechs themselves look okay at best (very N64-steez), but that barely matters since you view them from such a zoomed out perspective.\n\nThe sound effects are stellar, and the music is a fun, pumping, Tron-style track that matches the on-screen action to a T.\n\nIt just has one huge problem: No one is playing it. The only time there is ever a server is when me and my friends go make one to play with 4 players.\n\nSo fair warning; bring friends who you can hit up to play with you. You will almost never find active servers with more than 1 or 2 people in them, and even then the lag can be just agony.","August 8, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So i though hey they have gone to so much effort to do multiplayer ill give it a try but what do you know, there is no one online playing the game.

As it stands now however I'd say it's not really worth it and certainly not worth $10. Maybe $1-2 tops. The weapons are cool and there's nice variety there and again the gameplay and mechanics are great.\n\nI like how this game plays but good god is it lacking in content. I got a 4 pack for $3 and that was arguably barely worth it. There's only 2 modes you can play multiplayer which get old fast when there's hardly anyone online playing and no AI whatsoever.\n\nThis game could have more longevity if it had a survival mode or any sort of multiplayer mode with AI. As it stands now the only thing you can do in single player and with AI happens to be time trials. Doesn't get more basic than that.","February 26","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Ghost_Gamer/recommended/298520/","The_Ghost_Gamer","Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Ghost_Gamer/","32 products in account","ONE SENTENCE REVIEW:\n\nOrbital Gear is a 2D side scrolling shooter that does nothing new to the genre, bringing only a bare-bones shooter with bland visuals.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n\nOrbital Gear, at first glance, seems to be a cool 2D shooter. You jump from "planet" to "planet" while trying to aim at your enemies, with a handful of guns. That being said the actual game isn't all its cracked up to be. Playing Orbital Gear is like having a shiny present under your Christmas tree, only to find out that inside that present is an old dusty toy that you already given before. Nothing in Orbital Gear feels new or innovative as I was lead to believe with the description, screenshots, and a few gameplay videos I saw. To sum it up the main gameplay is a mixed between your standard sidescrolling shooter and Angry Birds Space. As you jump from "planet" to "planet" started to remind of the levels in Angry Birds Space, where once you fling the bird across the planet the gravity will be make you "slinghsot" to your target. Similarly to this game. You move around jumping from here and there shooting people left and right, while dodging bullets. Rinse and repeat. As this is the only thing you do in the game, at it gets stale pretty quick since there's only (a total of) 3 Modes in the game. One for Singleplayer and Two for Multiplayer. The singleplayer mode is basically a time trial where the goal is kill and get the stars before time runs out. Nothing special, gets boring quick. Now for the multiplayer portion of this game. There are 2 modes: Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, Deathmatch is pretty simple, nothing new or groundbreaking. Orbital Warfare on the other hand is the best part of this game where you join a team to protect your home planet and destroy the other, by either collecting power cores and fully powering their Doomsday Weapon or attack head on. This is an interesting mode not only because its unique but also it plays to the strengths of the game. Sadly though I am not recommending this game (currently the game costs a dollar less since its on sale) because the game is sadly dead. And this is the sad reality of multiplayer games once the flames of popularity slowly die down, so does the game. At the time of this review the game contains several servers (namely: USA, EUR, JPN, ASIA), and sadly to say ONLY EUROPE HAS PEOPLE PLAYING. There are no servers available in the other countries EXCEPT EUROPE. And normally there are only two (at the time of this review) and most of the time its almost always Deathmatch, meaning you'll probably never get to play the fun Orbital Warfare since no one plays it.\n\nNow the graphics of this game looks good, on screenshots. Sadly though its not really that great, for one when you select your "mech" you can obviously tell that the game is made with the Unity engine, sadly though this game doesn't fully utilize the engine, since the game: Dead Trigger 2 looks a lot better. The games textures aren't really that good either. While In-game the mechs may look cool and stuff, but at mech select screen (which is barely a select screen, more on that later) they look ugly and dated. The design of the maps aren't also that good. Some maps look cool while others just look like carbon copies, with just a different background.\n\nNow I rarely talk about this but, I feel the need to say this: the UI sucks. From the moment you boot up the game, you're greeted with a menu that looked straight out of a poorly made early access game. Go into settings or the Multiplayer select screens and you're greeted with the bumper triggers of on XBOX 360 controller on the top left and right. This makes me wonder if this game was created for the XBOX 360 but was rejected on the indie store and instead brought here on Steam.\n\nAnd lastly let me talk about its price. I converted it from my currency. So I'm estimating around 5-10 USD. Now let me ask you this is this game really worth it? For 5-10 USD you get a game that's practically dead with dated graphics and bad UI. Do you really think this is worth your money? You can probably spend that money on better things or on a Steam Sale.\n\nOn the end of the day, No. I do not recommend this game.\n\n","June 1, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A "Soldat" fast paced with non linear firing trajectories, gravity based levels, etc. Alright.\nYet you don't get a good game without a good production.\n\nVisuals are OK, though animations aren't really helpful at all. They're mostly doing their job, that's it. The sounds are bland. Musics are below standards, they sound like electro music from someone who just discovered how to make a synth work.\n\nI haven't found any bug yet, but that's the least of my concern : the game is nominated in the category "worse lag of the year in a multiplayer game", with around 1 to 3 seconds of lag between input and feedback. Figures it's VERY HARD to hit your own foot with this kind of delay, not to mention hitting an actual enemy player. I know multiplayer servers and network code are quite hard to handle, but you don't get to sell a multiplayer only game without a perfect network communication system. Nothing forgives that.\n\nWhatever the price is, it's not worth the investment.

Since "a" moves your character left RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER and "d" moves you right RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER, it takes a bit of practice to navigate around. When you're jumping from planet to planet, it can be annoying to have to think about which key to press to move your charactet the way you want. If you have the jump boost, that moves your character right and left RELATIVE TO YOU, which adds to the confusion. If you get that figured out, the movement is insanely good. It's fast paced, fluid, and alot of fun once you get used to it\n+ Art style is kinda cool, mid tier\n- Tutorial is not existant\n- No LAN, and private server refuses to work\n","June 23, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Interesting take on a platform shooter. I absolutly love the gravity, graphics and other parts of gameplay. It really helps to know people who have the game so that you can get a full multiplayer game going. Overall 9/10.\n\nAbout the gameOrbital gear is a paralax 3d platformer, with planets that each have their own gravitational pull. Bullets curve with the gravity, utilities create fast paced gameplay and bullets storm and explode. Mostly an online multiplayer game with simple but effective making. There are single player time trial modes which aren't good enough for long term gameplay, but good enough for practive. There is a local multiplayer also.\n\nMy thoughtsThis is a great game, the community is small but incredibly nice and helpful. I was glad to see that despite the small community I was able to get into a match within 5 seconds of joining online. The game goes on sale for cheap which is great. I bought the 4 pack for some of my freinds and family, so far my only regret is that I didn't buy two 4 packs. There are some good and bad things about the game, maybe the devs will update it some more.\n\nWhat it needsA health bar over each player would be great, knowing if a weapon is strong enough to kill someone is a must. It also needs bots, some of the maps are so large that two players can run around without seeing each other.\n\nThe goods and the badsGood\nEasy to learn to play\nHelpful Community\nFun\nGreat interpretation of controls on a round planet\nThe way that gravity affects players and bullets\nInteresting Concept\nSo many guns\nReasonably good gun balance\nGraphics are awesome\nBad\nControls can be confusing when a utility directional goes in a different direction than the movement\nThere is not an in depth, in game tutorial\nControls vary from map to map (ie. you dont need up/down on some maps while on others they are necessary)\nMech models are a little bulky looking in the selection screen, they look much better in game\nSmall community, usually one other player per game\nNo bots","June 23, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let it grow on you. The movement in my opinion takes time getting use to. I was navigating sloppily for a while, but it all pays off with practice. Nothing like it. Though the server browser isn't all that active, the single player challenges are addicting. They're tough but satisfying when you complete them. But good luck making a mark on the worldwide leaderboards. I came no where near the times listed. Those records are mindblowing so I play this purely for the fun, stopping to smell the roses. I only care about completing these and enjoying myself. That's more than enough. I could care less if the time aspect was here.\n\nThe music brings you deep into the game immediately. It's top notch.\n\nI also like how it's as fast paced as arena shooters like quake and unreal tournament, if not faster.\n\nAbilities like boost, shield, mines seem to be each as useful as one another if you utilize them well and adds that last layer of gameplay that's needed.\n\nThis is a very unique and original game but manages to be simple and straight forward at the same time. What I mean by that is that there are few gameplay aspects that collectively make up this game that wouldn't benefit from anything additional to that.  Why tamper too much with a great steak.

Interesting take on a platform shooter. I absolutly love the gravity, graphics and other parts of gameplay. It really helps to know people who have the game so that you can get a full multiplayer game going. Overall 9/10.\n\nAbout the gameOrbital gear is a paralax 3d platformer, with planets that each have their own gravitational pull. Bullets curve with the gravity, utilities create fast paced gameplay and bullets storm and explode. Mostly an online multiplayer game with simple but effective making. There are single player time trial modes which aren't good enough for long term gameplay, but good enough for practive. There is a local multiplayer also.\n\nMy thoughtsThis is a great game, the community is small but incredibly nice and helpful. I was glad to see that despite the small community I was able to get into a match within 5 seconds of joining online. The game goes on sale for cheap which is great. I bought the 4 pack for some of my freinds and family, so far my only regret is that I didn't buy two 4 packs. There are some good and bad things about the game, maybe the devs will update it some more.\n\nWhat it needsA health bar over each player would be great, knowing if a weapon is strong enough to kill someone is a must. It also needs bots, some of the maps are so large that two players can run around without seeing each other.\n\nThe goods and the badsGood\nEasy to learn to play\nHelpful Community\nFun\nGreat interpretation of controls on a round planet\nThe way that gravity affects players and bullets\nInteresting Concept\nSo many guns\nReasonably good gun balance\nGraphics are awesome\nBad\nControls can be confusing when a utility directional goes in a different direction than the movement\nThere is not an in depth, in game tutorial\nControls vary from map to map (ie. you dont need up/down on some maps while on others they are necessary)\nMech models are a little bulky looking in the selection screen, they look much better in game\nSmall community, usually one other player per game\nNo bots","June 23, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since "a" moves your character left RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER and "d" moves you right RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER, it takes a bit of practice to navigate around. When you're jumping from planet to planet, it can be annoying to have to think about which key to press to move your charactet the way you want. If you have the jump boost, that moves your character right and left RELATIVE TO YOU, which adds to the confusion. If you get that figured out, the movement is insanely good. It's fast paced, fluid, and alot of fun once you get used to it\n+ Art style is kinda cool, mid tier\n- Tutorial is not existant\n- No LAN, and private server refuses to work\n","June 23, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think at anywhere between 50% to 90% off it's fair game though. I can see developers making the game better over too too by adding something like CTF that could be a lot of fun with this type of game.","June 20, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is so easy to loses time playing this game i wanted to learn the controls with a friend and then 40 minutes later we had played a few rounds and i was in love. There are plenty guns and maps that all feel original and have little tricks to them. in addition to that the platforming is mostly solid, although sometimes you start flying off in the other direction for no reason (very rarely), but when you land a jump and use the gravity to propel you, it just makes you feel like the man. it also has a single player option for all you guys that distain other humans, but it is not even close to the liquid fun that is the multiplayer of this game. but before you can play with friends you have to get through the menu, which makes me incredibly happy to say this game has an incredibly easy to use menu.  It is super easy to host a game, which is great  because playing with friends is where this game shines. Finding a game with strangers  is hard and i have not been able to do so, but as i said before with options for local and online play you never feel you are missing anything if you can't play with randoms. so in conclusion i would not get this game if you want to play by yourself despite the fun signal player option, but if you have even thought about buying this game to play with just one friend do it it is worth the 10 dollars but if you can get it on sale you are in for a treat.

Since "a" moves your character left RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER and "d" moves you right RELATIVE TO YOUR CHARACTER, it takes a bit of practice to navigate around. When you're jumping from planet to planet, it can be annoying to have to think about which key to press to move your charactet the way you want. If you have the jump boost, that moves your character right and left RELATIVE TO YOU, which adds to the confusion. If you get that figured out, the movement is insanely good.

Interesting take on a platform shooter. I absolutly love the gravity, graphics and other parts of gameplay. It really helps to know people who have the game so that you can get a full multiplayer game going. Overall 9/10.\n\nAbout the gameOrbital gear is a paralax 3d platformer, with planets that each have their own gravitational pull. Bullets curve with the gravity, utilities create fast paced gameplay and bullets storm and explode. Mostly an online multiplayer game with simple but effective making. There are single player time trial modes which aren't good enough for long term gameplay, but good enough for practive. There is a local multiplayer also.\n\nMy thoughtsThis is a great game, the community is small but incredibly nice and helpful. I was glad to see that despite the small community I was able to get into a match within 5 seconds of joining online. The game goes on sale for cheap which is great. I bought the 4 pack for some of my freinds and family, so far my only regret is that I didn't buy two 4 packs. There are some good and bad things about the game, maybe the devs will update it some more.\n\nWhat it needsA health bar over each player would be great, knowing if a weapon is strong enough to kill someone is a must. It also needs bots, some of the maps are so large that two players can run around without seeing each other.\n\nThe goods and the badsGood\nEasy to learn to play\nHelpful Community\nFun\nGreat interpretation of controls on a round planet\nThe way that gravity affects players and bullets\nInteresting Concept\nSo many guns\nReasonably good gun balance\nGraphics are awesome\nBad\nControls can be confusing when a utility directional goes in a different direction than the movement\nThere is not an in depth, in game tutorial\nControls vary from map to map (ie. you dont need up/down on some maps while on others they are necessary)\nMech models are a little bulky looking in the selection screen, they look much better in game\nSmall community, usually one other player per game\nNo bots","June 23, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those people who are concerned with graphics in a game and nothing else, it IS a sidescroller shooter, meaning it is played in a 2D matter, similar to older Super Mario Brothers games. However, despite this, the graphics are pretty good for a game of it's sort. Singleplayer mode can be quite frustrating, challenging, and addicting, keeping the player drawn in for long periods of time. I haven't had any issue at all with the community in-game, as players rarely chat and are more focused on killing one another. The weapons are amazing, and pretty creative. Some are difficult to evade, and I've developed whole strategies for avoiding death by said weapons. The combat is also very good, as you can leap from planet to planet quickly, swiftly, and quite gracefully. I do reccommend this game to any FPS players, as this is a nice change of style, pace, and gameplay.\nThis game is worth the 10 dollars.\nEnjoy.","June 28, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let it grow on you. The movement in my opinion takes time getting use to. I was navigating sloppily for a while, but it all pays off with practice. Nothing like it. Though the server browser isn't all that active, the single player challenges are addicting. They're tough but satisfying when you complete them. But good luck making a mark on the worldwide leaderboards. I came no where near the times listed. Those records are mindblowing so I play this purely for the fun, stopping to smell the roses. I only care about completing these and enjoying myself. That's more than enough. I could care less if the time aspect was here.\n\nThe music brings you deep into the game immediately. It's top notch.\n\nI also like how it's as fast paced as arena shooters like quake and unreal tournament, if not faster.\n\nAbilities like boost, shield, mines seem to be each as useful as one another if you utilize them well and adds that last layer of gameplay that's needed.\n\nThis is a very unique and original game but manages to be simple and straight forward at the same time. What I mean by that is that there are few gameplay aspects that collectively make up this game that wouldn't benefit from anything additional to that.  Why tamper too much with a great steak.
