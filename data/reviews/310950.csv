Only having Xinput support on release when several large vendors of controllers/fight sticks/fight pads use Dinput is completely unacceptable. I will update this when it's fixed, but my god I shouldn't need to use some random 3rd party programs to get basic controller schemes to work.\n\n2/17/16 Edit:\nCapcom has heard this complaint and is working on it apparently. I will update my review when dinput is added, but until that point I still don't recommend purchasing the game.","February 15","false","12.8"," 1,806 of 2,288 people (79%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","79","806","2","80","44"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiffer/recommended/310950/","fiffer","Tony Stark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiffer/","343 products in account","As a long time Street Fighter fan I can not recommend this. The reason why... I can only explain it like this:\n\nImagine for a second that your favorite restaurant for making omelets was called Capcom. Over the years Capcom has made you the best damn omelets you can imagine. Some of them not as good as others, but generally speaking they are damn good omelets.\n\nHowever, today, you are promised the best and newest version of your favorite omelet. You are as excited as can be after ordering it, but after only a few short moments the chef comes out with an egg in one hand and a plate in the other.\n\nTo your surprise the plate is set in front of you, and the chef just takes the raw egg, and cracks it open onto the empty plate in front of you.\n\n"The ♥♥♥♥ is this?" You ask.\n\nCapcom replies "O trust us, this is exactly what you ordered!".\n\n"No, this isn't anywhere close. This is a raw egg."\n\nCapcom replies "Well sure, right now, but trust us, over the next few months it will be the best omelet you ever had."\n\n"Well that is all fine and dandy, but when I order an omelet I expect it to be finished after making the purchase."\n\nCapcom "O, we know that. But trust us, we have things planned!"\n\n"That's really nice that you have things planned, but this raw egg on my plate isn't even comparable to any other restaurant that serves omelet's! Not to mention, this is completely unacceptable based on your previous omelets!"\n\n\nMoral of the story, don't eat raw egg. Wait until its cooked. Especially if you ordered an omelet.\n\n\nUPDATE 2/23/2016:\n\nNow that I have had more time with the game (on PS4), Im going to give more specific problems with the game:\n\nSteam Store Page:\n-Still incredibly vague, and doesn't give enough information about the product. Capcom is selling this as a completed game with DLC plans, not as an incomplete game that is planning on being completed sometime in the next few months.\n-Aside from us diehard SF fans, the average consumer would have no clue what they are actually purchasing. This should clearly be listed as an early access title! Doesn't fit the $60 price tag for most consumers at this point in time.\n\nStory mode:\n- AI is absolutely terrible.\n-No difficulty adjustments\n-Extremely short. Out of the ~5 characters I have done, the average completion time when not skipping dialog and fight intros ends up being about 5 min. With only ~3 fights per character, that last at most 30 sec each.\n-No real replayability\n+This ~Might~ be updated at some point. Arcade mode ~might~ make it into the game eventually. A 2 hour cinematic story is planned to be added as well.\n\nSurvival:\n-Again terrible AI. Most fights can be won by simply timing jump in HP or HK -> knockdown -> stun.\n-Difficulties don't really appear to add any difficulty. Aside from Easy being 10 fights, and Hell being 100, its more about RNG and patience then it is about actually enjoying the game.\n-Awards for survival are minor, and don't really warrant the grind to complete...\n-Required to complete with every character to unlock 100%. Arguably the worst way to implement   color unlocks that capcom could have done\n+This game mode DOES have allot of potential.\n-The end of round perks are interesting, yet currently you get so much credit per round that you can always afford the most expensive upgrades for the next round (with exception to full health, which doesn't always show up).\n-Not really worth playing in its current state\n\nTraining:\n-Purely target dummy at this point in time. Not a Con by itself, but it is lackluster compared to the training options available in previous SF games, and most other fighters.\n+This is going to be updated soon\n\nOnline:\n-Connection issues still a problem, but getting better\n-No lobby support for more then 2 players, and no spectating.\n+This will be updated soon\n\nBugs:\n-Capcom still hasn't released a patch for those of us that are effected by frequent crashing.\n\nGameplay:\n++The game DOES play well, and so far looks to be balanced. Eventhubs early rankings also show a decent balance across characters.\n~~Neutral at this point, but as a player that has mained Vega since SFII, I'm still not sure If I really enjoy all the changes. This new Vega plays well, but I do miss his old toolkit, and especially miss him being a charge character.\n\nIn general, the people that have already purchased this game are really the only people I could recommend it to. For everybody else, if you are planning on playing primarily with friends (in a lobby bigger then 2 people), wait until the March update at the earliest. For those that are looking for the finished product with all its training tools and other features intact I would assume the June update and any unannounced changes might put this game in a position where it would be worth your $$$.","February 18","false","3.7"," 952 of 1,211 people (79%) found this review helpful 517 people found this review funny","79","952","1","517","60"

I'll give a free pass on that even though consumers *shouldn't* accept this practice, especially after so many betas.\n-The game is content light. Yes, this was known prior to launch but the multiplayer is supposed to be enough to carry it until this stuff is added later...except the multiplayer is currently jacked up.\n-Keyboard remapping...is currently non-existent. Yes, there are third party programs to get around this problem.

I've been playing Street Fighter since the first game hit the arcades here in 1987 when I was a child. I say this to say that I hold Capcom to a certain standard as a long time fan, and this release falls woefully short of their prior standards. This game is currently a full priced release without half of the content of previous fighting games in the series or of its contemporaries (Story mode, trial/challenge mode, a proper arcade mode, etc.), without proper support for fighting controllers/sticks, without basic PC quality of life features like key remapping for a keyboard.\n\nThis game isn't currently worth the price tag. Perhaps it will be somewhere down the line, as there's a decent core game here wrapped up in a shoddy package with a premium cost. Unless you have an abundance of disposable income there are better offerings for your hard earned currency.","February 16","false","5.9"," 359 of 459 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","359","459","11","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teakayzee/recommended/310950/","teakayzee","TKz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teakayzee/","152 products in account","Alright, I'm just gonna start off by saying that I really enjoy the core gameplay in SFV. It's very fun, the cast feels pretty balanced even though Capcom has only released one DLC char (Alex) so far, the mechanics such as V-Skill and V-Trigger make the game more interesting, and overall when things are working, they work really well in my opinion. I'm actually having a character crisis right now because I personally haven't found a single character that I don't enjoy playing. All that aside:\n\nSince this game was being rushed out for tournaments (under Capcom Pro Tour, to be specific), there were going to be things missing from the game at release.  This is what I and plenty of others expected while playing in the beta, but what we got at release was a mess that turned people away from the game and gave SFV a lot of bad press. And unfortunately, a lot of the bad press is still justified.\n\nSome examples SFV's issues:No D-Input support and no way to  configure keybinds without using third party programs (which makes no sense, since this game is ONLY released on PC and PS4. Why is there little PS4 controller support & no keybind configuration in the game from the jump??)\n\nArcade mode no longer present, and has been replaced (?) with "story mode" and Survival\n\nStory mode is just 4 or 5 easy, 1 round fights against the CPU tied together with some short illustrated cutscenes. Once you beat each chars story mode you are then able to buy their story mode costume from the ingame shop and you are also given Fight Money (which is the in game currency you'd use to buy costumes, characters, etc.). Overall it's not terrible, but besides getting Fight Money its a pretty forgettable mode.\n\nSurvival mode is another mode where you fight against the CPU, and was added as a way to get colors for each characters costumes and to gain even more Fight Money. However, on the higher difficulties (Normal & above) the AI goes from ridiculous easy to ridiculously difficult without warning. Also, if you lose (which you probably will, since they are all 1 round fights and later on the AI starts reading your inputs), you won't get anything at all for your efforts. Instead you just have to start all over again, which is frustrating to say the least. Also, there's a lot of stages you have to fight through, from 30 on Normal, 50 on Hard and 100 on Extreme difficulty. (However, Extreme doesn't grant you colors, only a Title and tons of Fight Money) So God forbid the servers go down or your internet cuts out. And to top that off? The colors you gain in Survival mode are  per costume, not per character. Meaning, say you have one alt costume for Ryu, but you somehow beat all the survival modes using his default costume? To get the all new colors for his alt, you have to do each survival mode, from Easy to Hard all over again.\n\nI personally haven't had a lot of bad experiences with the netcode, BUT when lag is present, the game turns into a practically unplayable slideshow with the characters teleporting around during the match. Your mileage may vary, however; some don't have a lot of issues, others have a LOT.\n\nCompared to USF4 (and other fighting games in general) it can take quite a while  to find a match. And when you do find a match, you then have to load in, which per fight takes about a minute on average. After the fight it takes about another minute to go back to training mode/main menu. This process ends up taking way too long. This isn't a hardware issue, but rather an issue with the game communicating with Capcom's servers.\n\nSpeaking of hardware, the hardware requirements in this game are way higher than USF4's. This honestly isn't a huge deal, but if you have a toaster hoping to easily run this game akin to USF4, prepare to downscale your game into oblivion in hopes of reaching 60 fps.\n\nRagequitting is an issue, since there isn't any real penalty for it in the game (which makes no sense, since USF4 just took points away from whoever quit...)\n\nTraining mode doesn't save your preferences after you quit the game/go to the main menu (Sounds kinda nitpicky, but this is another feature that USF4 has that SFV does not.)\nThese are just the things that are off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure there's more.\n\nMy opinion in a nutshell:This game is basically in Early Access. There's a bunch of features that are missing from the game along with a lot of weird design choices that are REALLY holding back it's potential, and because of this I'd have to recommend skipping or at the very least waiting on buying the game until much later, possibly June. Although to be fair, with a AAA game being released in a state like this, in retrospect I probably wouldn't recommend buying a game released like this at all. Which really, really sucks because besides the thousand papercuts that plagues SFV, it is a really fun fighting game.","March 22","false","102.1"," 184 of 247 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","184","247","3","6"

The game is beautiful. The gameplay is just as awesome. The characters are great and this will be the greatest SF game in the franchise's long history.\n\nSo why am I "not recommending" it? Because if you have not already bought the game like me then you are obviously not a crazy SF fanboy and are on the fence about the purchase, reading reviews. You should probably wait to buy then because what you get right now is a $60 demo. Beit a very pretty looking, fun $60 demo but the game is nowhere near complete and is still dealing with buggy issues.\n\nFirst off there are only 16 characters at launch and like 8 stages. The story mode they have on the game currently is horrible and so easy my 3 year old daughter could button mash her way through it. I'm also not a fan of the artwork for the cut scenes. It is very soft, pastel-like anime. The SF comics were big, bright and bold like the game. The cut scenes are def disappointing. Single play only has that, training and a survival mode which is actually pretty cool. Online is up and running and is cross-platform but they are still working out the bugs there and lobbies can only hold two people at the moment.\n\nI was one of the unfortunate ones to have the crash bug where the game would shut down after 15 minutes every time. I read the fix on the Steam forums regarding shutting down a particular file on the task detail menu and it worked, but still. That needs to be checked in testing ahead of time. The mouse cursor stays on the screen. Get rid of it Capcom, that's a no-brainer and easy to do.\n\nThey released the game early to make the EVO market, I get it. They will also be releasing a steady stream of content for years to come. Characters, stages, proper story mode, costumes, etc. The foundation is there. This game will be epic when it is finished.

And it's kinda what i'm trying to do here, but in the opposite way, it's the community the one i'm blaming today.\n\nI see plenty of negative reviews blaming lack of content, lack of arcade mode, lack of keyboard binding and PS3/PS4 pads support, creating refund threads trying to influence in other people, etc.  And i'm afraid it's only your fault. Capcom said, and warned about the content the game was going to have on release. They said, crystal clear, the game was not going to have Arcade and Challenge mode until March. They said the game was not going to have keyboard bindings, PS3/PS4 pads supports on release, yet people bought it without getting proper info about the game before tossing 60 ♥♥♥♥ing bucks at the screen.\n\nYes, 60 bucks is too much for the current content, but you can find the game for 30 bucks pretty much everywhere else besides Steam. The single-player content WILL came in a month, the pad and keyboard support WILL come, and you'll be able to unlock pretty much every piece of DLC will ever have BY PLAYING. Which is nuts considering we are talking about Capcom. I played for 3 hours and i got 20% of a character price already. There won't be any Super, Ultra or any other payed revision of the game. It'll be free this time. If you really don't feel like waiting a month, then don't buy the game and wait.\n\nCommunity ASKED Capcom to release it early with just Online and training, because Capcom Tour Cup is around the corner and with just those 2 modes people who really want to play competitive will have more than enough the first month. As i said before, it's only your fault if you didn't inform yourself about all this before tossing 60 bucks at the screen then blaming everything because you feel scammed. Your brain scammed you this time, not Capcom.\n\nThis is the first time, ever, that PC got a fighting game with cross-play. It was to be expected a couple of connection errors the first hours, because this is the first time Capcom did something like this. Yet you complained. I understand people against the new Naruto game, or MKX. Naruto devs lied to the community and didn't bring what they said they were. MKX was broken for half a year, they abandoned the game on PC and pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed up with the entire community, Warner Brothers style. But Capcom DID warn you guys. We knew what was coming from like 5 months to this very day.\n\n7 years of SFV probably won't be possible and the game will die because you can't read, think, or wait. You want keyboard bindings? Use Xpadder in the meantime. Want PS3/PS4 sticks/pads? Use Xpadder in the meantime or any Xbox peripheral emulator.\n\nAll because you couldn't inform yourselft before buying, probably Street Fighter will die on PC. And the real players who knew what the product was gonna be like, and really wanted to play, are the only ones being screwed here. Nobody talked about how good the gameplay is, how fresh the new mechanics feels. How good the game looks, how good the soundtrack is.\n\nI'm really disappointed today. The PC community has become so toxic, so elitist and so egocentric, they just doesn't doubt for a second to sabotage an entire game, it's community and it's developers, who probably spent years working 14 hours a day just to see how their game gets killed in 2 hours.\n\n\nMy most sincere congratulations, fellas.","February 15","true","52.2"," 1,331 of 2,084 people (64%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","64","331","2","94","171"

Capcom is persistent in doing this, they let ppl down rushing ports, charging for things that should come with the base game and specially believing that only by improving the netcore from the previous USF4 people are gonna be happy with the game, this is not the way you realease a title, this is not the game we deserve.\n\nAnd the only exclusives with the pre-order (that's 59.99 USD for me) it's a Chun-Li costume, a skin i'll never use, how about if you give me the soundtrack that's 12.99, that would be a nice exclusive you cheap ♥♥♥♥s.","February 15","false","46.4"," 252 of 382 people (66%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","66","252","382","16","7"

Calling it a joke would be inaccurate, because there's nothing funny about it. It baffles my mind that anyone could look at this game and think it was ready to be sold for $60. This game is an insult to everyone; Street Fighter fans, fighting game fans, and video game fans.\n\nLooking past the inexcusably absent modes (Arcade, Trials, 1P vs. CPU, etc.) what we do have is just pathetic. Character stories consist of 2-4 matches with braindead AI and lousy artwork. Online is currently broken. There's stuttering out the ♥♥♥, and it can take up to 10 minutes to find a match. Ranks can't be trusted, since there's zero penalty for quitting matches. For some insane reason, you don't pick your character on a character selection screen. Instead, you have to choose a favorite, and that's who you play. I don't know who the genius was who thought this was a good idea, because it's not.\n\nThe biggest insult, however, is Survival mode. ♥♥♥♥ Survival mode. You have to play this mode to unlock colors, and it's the worst grind I have ever experienced in a game. You play against a set of AI, which until the end basically just stands there while you destroy them. Then when you're close to beating it, the AI turns on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mode and reads your inputs, reacting to things no human could possibly react to. Not only does this mode waste your time, but it teaches you bad habits, which causes you to get destroyed online (if you're lucky enough to find a match). I'm almost certain that Survival is like this because they intend to sell the colors in the shop in March, so they can squeeze more money out of the poor individuals who already spent $60 on this catastrophe.\n\nThe worst part about Street Fighter V is that at it's core, this is one of the most solid fighting games I have ever played. When you have a match with a decent connection with someone at your skill level, it's about as fun as Street Fighter gets. It's too bad that you have to dig through the mountain of ♥♥♥♥ to find the gold.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","February 20","false","133.3"," 94 of 133 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","94","133","7","0"

My review will change when they actually release the game, in it's current state its an early access and a shiny polished turd, is still a piece of crap. There is no reason this game should be advertised as a full release when it is not, I don't know if it was because of presure from investors like sony to have it out at this date, but Capcom you done screwed up.\n\nThat mess out of the way, I will say from the games engine, the fighting mechanics I do really like where they are taking it, it feels like a step back to older street fighter and playing more on skill rather then a well timed ultra-combo. Changes to the characters are refreshing, my 2 favorite characters Vega and Ken have changed in ways I actually like and when this game is fully up and running I feel it has great potential.\n\nI am past the point for the steam refund policy and I probobly wouldn't because I do support some early access and I would just get it after it was fxed anyways, but I can't fault those who want to send capcom a message for this, if they had pushed back release date  and opened it for early access I would be less ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but this is not a full release quality game, and this isn't the 1st time Capcom has pulled BS with things like on disc DLC to site one example. Look Capcom, you are getting to a place where you can't screw up like this without taking your company down, for your sake I really hope this gets squared away. For the time being I am going to have to down vote, when the game meets the following I would say I could recommend it.\n\n1. Fix your servers, while some issue on this front are understandable, what we have here is not.\n2. Proper Controler bindings, I don't play with keyboard but I have heard a number of gripes and I have to say, the fact it dosen't recognize all my XBOX 360 controler inputs like L3 and R3, coincodently also available on PS$ controllers, should be mappable.\n3. Display optimization, I have finally got it to a point where it is palletable with 60 frames and I am not the only one seeing this, now I don't have the worlds best video card, but I can run some serious games with out this much issue and I have seen a number of posts complaining about this so I know it's not just me.\n4. Get a proper single player experience going, where the heck is the traditional arcade mode, with your servers dropping like crazy, this would at least satisfy some players, your story mode while nice so I can get the story is a cake walk. Not saying we need this to be difficult, it's nice getting the story especially for characters we are not good at but this is not a substitute for a real arcade mode, you know the thing that has been there since SF2 World Warrior. And you cant count survival, you loose one time and you have to start over with the sorry starting AI, you can't get a consitant challenge from the PC making it hard to improve your skills unless you are playing people, oh yea, the servers are still dropping like crazy.\n5. Challenge mode, seriously, not available until march?\n\nCapcom, get your heads out of your rear ends. You hold the rights to some of my favorite franchises and thats why this stuff pisses me off so much with you, I want to see you succeed, quit screwing up.","February 17","false","15.2"," 101 of 145 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","101","145","7","1"

Let's divide pros, cons and also neutrals apart to make things clearer.\nFirst of all, on many points, principal or secondary, Street Fighter V (SFV) looks really different next to Ultra Street Fighter IV (USFIV) which was for me and a lot of other people, a reference in terms of fighting. But anyway let's roll.\n\nPros.\n►Graphism ; More colorful, smoother and even better animated than USFIV. Let's also notice the camera and effects improvements especially on Critical Arts.\n►PC Gear required ; Well when they said NVidia GTX960 recommended I wasn't excepting to run this game at 60 FPS Max with 45°C degrees. It's quite overrated, so logically, you should be able to run it easily with NVidia GTX570.\n►Cross-Platform ; Great idea, nicely executed. You can play with you PS4 friend online even if you play on PC.\n►Gameplay ; The V-System is absolutely awesome, making this game way more offensive than USFIV. But still, I have to admit I am not okay with the Cross-up thing but I am pretty sure offensive and airborne players will love it.\n►Soundtracks ; Absolutely awesome, brand new progressive metal theme and orchestral revisited themes make some really nice quality music. Let's still note that some characters or stages themes are still bad but, ugh, music taste lawl.\n►Characters ; Okay, 16, now 18, maybe not enough if you compare with USFIV 44 characters roadster. But Capcom will publish returning and brand-new characters in the following months and years, so it's just a matter of time. Meanwhile, the stock roadster is still really interesting going from ultra-defensive zoner (F.A.N.G. or Guile) to heavy pressure characters (Cammy or Vega). Also, interesting characters are making their comeback like Rainbow Mika or Birdie.\n►Challenges ; Less numerous than the challenges in USFIV, but those will still teach you basics and important combos options for your character.\n►Tutorials ; This is an interesting concept for rookies and advanced players to make you understand the key features in this game.\n►Support ; Capcom say they will support the game for 7 years and they have also confirmed they will not create a "Super Street Fighter V" or "Super Banger Fighter V.2 Ultra Turbo Hot Ryu Maximum". Which means SFV should not been duplicated into different versions.\n►Online Ragequitters punishement ; Looks like they added a new system to punish them, it will block from doing ranked matches for 2 hours, which I think is a good punish to ragequitters.\n\nNeutrals.\n►Story mode ; Still, no arcade gamemod, which is kind of, ugh, bloody weird. So the story mode is basically a chain of 3 super-easy fights including fixed image cut-scenes and some animations where you can learn your character prologue to introduce him into the extended story mode that will comes out in June.\n►Fighter profile ; Creating an account is your first step. But, my big "meh" about it, is that you can't change back your country and also your time zone. It's a detail but make sure you made no mistakes during the time you create your account.\n►Fight Money and Zenny ; Fight Money is the in game currency you win by completing part of the solo part of the game and wining ranked matches, Zenny is real life money, and it's currently not avaible but it should be in no time. That's simple. With those you can buy story costume, alternative costumes, exclusives colors, titles and characters. Each characters like Alex, and in the near futur Ibuki ;3, will cost 100,000 FM or 600 Zenny, so 6$. Costumes cost 40,000 FM and 250 Zenny, normally, so 2,5$. Considering in USFIV, 5 costumes with a big load of colors was 5$, it's kind of meh, but the concept is okay.\n►Menu ; I got a bit lost a first, I looks like Windows 8.1 Welcome screen with the apps, so if you used to USFIV and classic menus don't jumpscare on it lawl.\n\n\nCons.\n►No Player/CPU and CPU/CPU game modes ; If you enjoy formal CPU fighting, you jimmies will be rustled because there is no such modes! I spend more than 2800 Ibuki uses, 900 Hugo uses and 500 Hakan uses in USFIV in Versus CPU, and now this kind of basic game mode suddenly doesn't exist anymore. The only way to do it is an informal training mode that doesn't, of course, save progress at all.\n►Options saving ; In other games, when you set up setting for a gamemod it normally will be saved next time you will use it. In SFV, all colors, costumes, training settings will not be saved so you a to set them up every time. Take note that this saving system was featured in USFIV.\n►Survival ; Salty is my second name but this game mode made me so salty. Why ? Because you need to complete the easy, normal and hard survivals to unlock colors, even you bought the costume on the shop for a few dollars. This is one of the biggest mistakes they made in SFV. If you don't want to bother with this mod, you have got to stay with only two colors on your costume no matter how much time you played with your main character. The problem is that this concept is awful for casual players (I am not a casual but intermediate level player), it means they can't unlock those colors for their favorite character. But check the following con and you will understand my salt, and your future salt, about this gamemode.\n►AI difficulty ; One of the worst thing with SFV. Going to 8 types of difficulty modes from 1-3 potato, 4 advanced potato, 5 weak but somewhat balanced, 6 perfectly balanced, 7-8 input reading competitive player. So basically you will have to fight input reading AI in survival to unlock colors during 50 rounds straight with no second chance! And no I am not exaggerating considering the other day at a french competitive tournament, a really advanced Vega player said unlocking the Vega's colors was an absolute hell of difficulty. M.Bison is bloody broken with the AI, it's like having a “No Fun Allowed” robot in front of you that just want you to change game.\n►Colors system ; You heard it earlier, it's awful, Capcom could have do way better because the awful survival is the only way to obtain some colors.\n►No support for keyboard inputs rebidding ; What a banger, rare are the games were you can't change your buttons so you have to play with “GHJK-BNM,”. You can use third party program but use at your own risk ;C\n►QWERTY keyboards club only ; If like me you own a AZERTY keyboard you have to swith between AZERTY and QWERTY when you're about to play SFV because some button will not exist like Heavy Kick.\n►Local PlayerVSPlayer ; You can't basicly on PC use your keyboard and your friend using his controller because the two controller will be set as Player 1. A lot of people seems to have this issue on PC like I saw on Reddit.\n\n\nTL;DR.\nGame with a great base and concept, unfortunately filled with awful annoying details that will leave you really frustrated and salty. Will, of course, upgrade this review in case of updates changes.\n\n→ 59/100","April 4","true","102.6"," 151 of 228 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","151","228","8","9"

I'm able to run this game at 60 FPS without any hic-ups or having to switch to the lowest settings possible playing on 5 year old hardware.\n\nThe main problem with this game comes from the spotty release. Despite having three weekend beta tests, playing online in the full release can lead to random disconnects and frame stuttering so bad that both players just start teleporting around at lightning speeds making it difficult to tell what is going on. It gets really bad if you try and play against overseas opponents, the current netcode is not fit for it. Not to mention I have had times where I’ve been disconnected while playing single player modes and forced to start over from where I’ve began while playing them.\n\nCapcom rushed this out so they had something for people to play at tournaments, so I would definitely wait for them to fix netcode and aim for a price under the current fifty dollars they are charging.","February 18","false","74.3"," 112 of 166 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","112","166","3","2"

Much more accessible than IV.\n+DLC that can be purchased with either in-game currency or real-type money (soon)\n+Looks dang beautiful\n+Online play works (much better than it did at launch.  Not one server problem for me in days)\n\n-Only support for XInput or keyboard, which the new SFV-themed Fightsticks are not (Use something like X360CE or Joy2key if using a PS3/PS4 fightstick)\n-Severe lack of single-player options (Arcade mode, Vs. CPU, etc); not worth $60 (yet)\n-Has story mode, but it not very in-depth.  Feels more like a build-up to the upcoming cinematic story.\n-Takes a little while to find an opponent in matchmaking (or maybe I'm just impatient)\n\nThe gameplay is good, but the overall game is severely lacking in substance.  Features that have been a staple of fighting games are absent.  Capcom has stated that such features will be available in March, but these features are what most people would expect to be available at launch.

The game is now slightly more playable for optimus based PC like mine. Althought it's finally using the correct graphic card, the game still has some random fps drop now and then.

Street Fighter V.. A Good game or Bad? Thats honestly how you find it..\n\nThe Good of the game-\n- Its easy to pick up and learn\n- Characters you remember from past games, along with some new\n- Classic feel at BASE level of other street fighter games\n- Music is actually good\n-Stages look nice, and have a good feel to them\n- Classic 1v1 Street Fighter\n-Decent tutorials for the game itself, and each character\n\n\nThe Inbetweens\n-Cross play while nice, causes problems as well\n- Both good and bad that you dont have an easy way to talk to someone. Really good so you dont hear stuff you dont want, but really bad when trying to find people, or ask questions.\n- Its not USFIV (I personally loved Super SFIV.. and AE and ultra kinda were eh to me..)\n- "Free DLC Characters" Not really free... but you can get with in game currency.. Wouldn't be too bad, but it seems to become hard to get more Fight money once you beat the few things you can do offline.. So.. have fun trying to play online to get them\n\n\nThe Bads of the game\n-Very Bare bone fighting game, especially for the price. I know DLC is coming to add story mode and such but still\n- No Arcade mode?\n- This is personal but.. I feel the game is wayyy to offensive of a fighter.. Even characters like Dhalsim, and Guile who are known as your defensive characters from games past, seem to have better skills suited for offensive gameplay style.\n- No true vs CPU mode- Granted you can do this in training mode\n- Automatic picking of your character in ranked matches.. Come on really? What if my favorite character is Chun Li, but I was trying out guile and wanted to play him in ranked.. I have to make sure to switch my favorite character? Why?\n- Friends list is pretty bad, along with trying to find games with them, I know this isnt steam or capcoms  fault at all, but SFIV felt so much better at this..\n- Roll back... DEAR GOD ROLL BACK.. Ive had this problem since the betas.. Again.. you have a fine example of how to do it, with Skullgirls.. and let us set network delays and show us pings.. but no.. Capcom loves its bar system.\n- Rematch in ranked? Seems nice right.. Well.. it auto gives you the same character again.. And its not an automatic best 2/3.. If you give someone a rematch in rank after beating them.. and they win.. They dont have to play the tie breaker if they dont want to.\n- This might just be me but visual looks of attacks.. I know everyone is on and on about "frame data" now, but some of these moves.. look unsafe as hell but are not, while others look safe and are not.. Chun Lis EX Legs being -2 (Mostly safe in the way this game works) is fine and all, but my god does it look like the move is punishable as hell\n\n\nLook, if you love Street Fighter you most likely already bought this game. For what its worth, sure its an ok fighter, if you already enjoy other Street Fighters.. Overall though I would not recommend this game.. I may love Street Fighter, but I honestly can say I do not find SFV fun..\n","May 22","false","145.2"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","43","54","4","3"

Duke Nukem, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, C&Q, Medal Of Honor, they all had the games that hit the finishing blow to them. And sadly, very sadly, as a Street Fighter Veteran since my childhood, As a guy who gave over 4000 hours  to Street Fighter 4 Series, this game is very very close to share the same fate.\n\nYesterday, when i was seeing this kind of comments, i was telling "this guys are stupid this game just came out just give it a time already!" "But after putting much hours and seeing the overwhelmingly awful situation of the game, few days is definitely not enough to put this abomination together.\n\nThis unfinished rubbish, had everything better in BETA, I'm sorry not Beta FOUR god damn diffrent Betas plus some hidden short-time ones and they worked better than the full version. This is a huge disrespect, and whats huger is the price of the game. 50$ for a game that has poorer quality and worse developers than free2play games and companies. I wish it was only the technical issue, but everything, just every aspect of the game smells like low-budget, carelesly done crap.\n\nENough of the exaggurated info, lets get to the mistakes of the game. First of all, currently it doesnt work, nothing, just nothing works right now. And thats not even the main issue, most of the techincal issues about servers can be fixed within a days. There are also frame rate issues, OFFLINE INPUT DELAY, No V-Sync disabling options. Stuttering, Teleportations, and every god damn graphic issues you can imagine. But thats not just it! The game itself  is "bad". Even without the techincal issues. I'm not talking about mechanics, I'm talking about the "FULL GAME" First of all, "Capcom Fighters Network" is a complete joke. Horrible design, annoying menu controls, and limited options is just the small part of its faults. So you want to invite your friend to the game and play with him ? If it was SFIV you click "invite" via Steam. But this, this feels like quantum physics to solve. First of all you click to causla match because you want to play 1vs1 with a friend, and no. It isnt there its just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ option to find random people randomly. Then without hope i clicked VERSUS because maybe they put it in there and no, its just a classic offline 1v1. Then i said ok lets create a lobby, because lobbies were actually working yesteday, and now they don't. So i created a lobby, and looked at the screen there are no options to invite, looked agsain with higer attention and NO!, there isnt one. i just pressed random buttons on my controller repeadetly and a very small sub menu appeared in the lower left of the screen called press (Y) for Lounge Options. and clicked it and i saw the "Invite" button. I was happy and i clicked to it, and i had no friends on the list. Because the game uses it's AMAZING (!) CFN system. Then i returned to the menu to go on a new amazing adventure! Adding a friend! Of course there isnt anything like this on the menu, whats fun with easy menu controls? You must click to CFN and you search for Rivals, you ASK your friend for their SFV tag, and add them to FAVORITES awkwardly. There are also no chat options so its a silent game, even no microphone! No voice chat, because it just distracts you from the heart of the battle right? And i invited my friend, oops invited my favourite to the game and my lobbyt gets shut down. So CFN system is really amazing! When you are in middle of a ranked game a distracting huge pop up says "This guy wants to fight with you! and when you return to menu there isnt anything, any exclamation marks. any pending invites so you must go on another adventure to find out. And you find out there is a notification board, hidden in the sub menu in the right (without an excalamation mark on the top of it) and you join the game that way!\n\nThe story mode is also amazing, i bet they also thought for 4 year old children to enjoy the game because stories are made of pictures that looks like children's coloring books. 3 picture for 100 speaking lines and you just hit a 1 round training dummy 3 times to complete amazingly deep storyline(!) for each character. So, isnt it amazing. And there is also an amazing survival mode in year 2016! Yaay! Bot punching for hours for some good old fight money!\n\nANyways lets speak about game quality cand competitive multiplayer. We have a full roster of SIXTEEN characters. It's a great number. Who needs lots of characters anyway you should main just one to compete better(!). Look at tekken TT2, it got released with 60 characters and only 16 is being played in competitive scene. So they felt like it's a waste of effort. Lets get their 50$ for nothing!  Graphics are not "stunning" its just mediocre. Some good, some bad. Music is the same, some good, some boring. Nothing like past games though. Graphics and Music was always amazing and top notch in past games. I like the ranked system, i like unique character design and V skills and thats all. Thats all i like. I hate the easiest combo system ever designed for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 year olds to learn and master. When i make the hardest combos in he game it feels like jabbing the opponent, i dont feel proud, i dont get hyped. It's just too simple.

I hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly missing juggles and lots of special moves and normals  which half of it has weird not-fitting hitboxes.\n\nMy last wish for capcom is shutting down the game and delay it to the june.

If you like to play people online like I do, I think you will have a good time.\n\nCombos are easier than in SF4 and it works out nicely because you are able to get into the mind games of one on one fights much quicker without that technique barrier holding you back. The gameplay feels great. Everything about the ACTUAL game seems to be great.\n\nThe features that are missing will be added someday.\n\nCons:\n\nThe features will be added someday, meaning they are not here now.\n\nThe game feels unfinished already and with survival mode being the only viable 1 player option right now, it's even worse because survival mode sucks.\n\nIf they fix the complete waste of time that is survival mode I would reccomend this game. It being hard is not my complaint. It is that it wastes your time.\n\nExample: In normal survival mode, fights 1-25 are easy, but you hit 25-30 and the difficulty ramps up hugely. So fights 1-25 just feel like a waste of time. If you lose on fight 29, you have to start all over again because its survival. Seriously, balance out the difficulty. I shouldn't be able to win fights 1-25 with crouching heavy kick. Then lose in some fight between 25-30 because the computer suddenly blocks, counters, punishes, and combos. It is the most jarring and frustrating part of survival mode.\n\nNot to mention the fact that you have to be connected to the server while playing it or it doesn't count. Imagine getting to level 48 in hard survival mode, and disconnecting from the server. That is a lot of time wasted.","February 21","false","20.8"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","47","67","3","2"

There's also a survival mode where you battle computer controlled opponents for a set number of matches in order to unlock colors for the character you complete the mode with. This is a poor substitute for arcade mode as it takes muuuuuuuuuch longer to get through. This is the first fighting game that has required grinding.\n\nThe online was barely functional at launch, and, though a little better now, is still horribly implemented. For example, there is no punishment for ragequitting. There was a sweet spot of about a week between when they fixed the unplayable launch servers and when people started realizing it was punishment free to disconnect. As of now I get rage disconnects on about 30-50% of matches I am about to win.\n\nThere is a Battle Lounge which you can use to invite friends or other players to battle. This would be where I spent the majority of my time if it weren't for the fact that the netcode in this game is horrible so my friends and I all experience constant rollback and framedrops when playing with eachother. I've spent more time troubleshooting this than should be necessary as I have fantastic ping in every other game I play with them.\n\nAside from the above mentioned modes, there's also a basic training mode.","February 28","false","73.4"," 68 of 104 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","68","104","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azombiebaby/recommended/310950/","azombiebaby","A Zombie Baby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azombiebaby/","115 products in account","I'm a big Street Fighter fan and I really wanted to be able to recommend this game but.. I can't. I don't do reviews so this is probably poorly done but as it's a game I know about I felt I could put down some informed opinions. If you want a brief summary, scroll down to the conclusion.\n\nCapcoms attempt to open the game to everyone has neglected the people who want depth in a game. If you're a die hard fan of the classic street fighter where basic is basic then sure this might be the game for you but if you want a game that's evolved and developed depth, you're better off waiting to see where they take this game or look somewhere else.\n\nFirst off, the game is multiplayer. That's it, if you enjoy playing randoms or have other friends playing this then you won't mind. If you enjoy a nice little single player mode to waste some time like me, then you'll be disappointed. The single player is rushed and poorly done. Clearly a last minute thought.\n\nThen saying that... It really feels like the netcode was a last minute idea (I'm not a pro in anyway about this subject). I would enjoy a more smooth online game play but whoever thought the netcode they've used was a good idea needs to rethink what gamers want in online quality.\nIf I had to choose between the small input delay of the USF4 online and the teleporting in SFV online play. I would choose a more polished USF4 online. Maybe I wouldn't care so much if it happened to both players and if it was temporary but its not. It mostly happens to the player who's defending... I don't need to explain why that's bad. Then once it starts, it doesn't stop it's there the entire match switching between whoever is defending.\n\nOnto the characters, these have good and bad points. I do love some of the character designs and I love the new characters that have been introduced. I thought it was a great idea to have characters that have clearly aged or changed in appearance and they've tested the water with a few but left the default Ryu and a few others the same as they were back when SF started, hopefully this can be changed with new outfits or better yet, mods.\n\nThe characters playstyles are also a good idea (there is also a bad point to this in a moment), each character has their own unique way to fight, despite aggressive playstyles being rewarded more than others you do feel a difference and I like this.\nThe problem I have with the characters is their move/combo sets.. There is no depth, when I go to play Bison who's been my main, I already know it's going to be HK spam until I've broken the defence because that is literally his safest and only worthwhile move. Yes, against higher level players I can't just spam it I have to adapt but at the core it is just HK and that's the feeling I get with all the characters, they have one good option and one good combo.. That's it, nothing else is worth doing because it doesn't reward you for playing any different.\n\nI do play other characters like Laura or Karin, I get bored just playing one character I like to learn all their basics then learn their more damaging/tight combos but their combos are either lacking or don't do as much damage as more simple combos I do with Bison. Which is actually a good idea and something I thought they would do. If you want to accommodate newcomers without losing the technical players. then just reward the basic combos and keep the more difficult combos. It doesn't need massively long combos but give it more than 3 parts to every combo (without the use of Vtrigger, even then that just becomes 4 parts of the combo).\n\nThe stages are also nicely made, the only downside to the stages which isn't a huge problem I'm probably just nitpicking but they're not all interactive. You have the one stage where you'll be knocked into another area of the stage or possibly knocked into a bus or get noodles on your head but that's it. It gives the impression that they spent 75% of their time on that one stage and then rushed the others.\nAnother issue with this is the restaurant that you can be knocked into (The other half of the stage) Is so nicely made, it gives a different atmosphere than when you're in the streets but you rarely get to see it unless you're always being pressured in the corner which anybody will know that's not where you want to be. It would be a great idea to have it switch between starting the game in the restaurant or in the streets.\n\nTo cover some points I'm seeing a lot of people make;\n\n1: SFV has had an insane amount of people register at Evo - This should be obvious and expected, if you've stripped your game down so much to accommodate people who aren't the most skilled at fighters then why wouldn't they all want to compete for that big prize? Having depth to a game up to this point never stopped new people competing and breaking into the spotlight, Capcom shouldn't have felt the need to take such a different direction at the least they could have incorporated a way to accommodate newcomers into the evolved Street Fighter we've become so used to.\n\n2: SFV still has depth with the Vtrigger/Vskill - You would think so but for an example, look at Biffotasty/Desks videos. Watch his SF4 videos and his newer ones for SFV. The SFV videos are plain in comparison, so much so that he's got creative by editing older SF games into the videos (Which he does so well). This isn't a dig at Desk in anyway, I love his channel and his videos you can always see the amount of effort he's put into every video. His quote in a video description of his sums it up:\n\n"It's disappointing that it doesn't but since Capcom have tried with all their might to remove absolutely anything that's even slightly situational or anything that might be considered difficult to perform, it's not at all surprising."\n\nAnd I'm not saying we need 100 hit combos we never did and with scaling, the longer combos in SF4 became a bit pointless. Only there to satisfy those who enjoyed the timing/technical aspect. I could give plenty of examples as to why these new simplified mechanics are a bad choice, including being able to mash combos.. Literally mash combos, I saw people in an arcade full on smacking the arcade machine and doing big combos. Then while I was practicing combos, I found that as Ryu I could do a combo, mash DP before the combo animation even comes close to ending and he would throw out the DP, seconds later. This causes problems with the whole negative edge (Will need to google it, hard to explain) aspect to inputs.\n\n3: The games still new - Ok, I can't really argue this considering SFV to date has been a glorified early access. They do still have time to fix where they went wrong but the big problem a lot of people/critics have pointed out is that this was the games "full" release.. The majority of reviewers and gamers might not bother coming back to the game in a years time to do another review. It would of been a smarter decision to do an open beta/early access so people (the pros) could play the game in prep for the big tournaments without the expectations of having a fully fleshed out game.\n\n\n\nOverall I really wanted to like SFV but I don't, I still have hope that they will change it's direction and because I am a big Street Fighter fan I don't regret buying the game. The characters, while really well designed (Seriously, Chun has never looked more beautiful), lack any depth to make each fight different from the last. The stages, while nicely done at first quickly fall apart (background FPS lower than the foreground FPS, only one stage being interactive). The new mechanics lack any depth for players to get creative. Then finally, the biggest problem right now.

In no universe should this game cost sixty dollars. Due to a lack of content, it should, at most, be worth 35, and I think that's being generous. I'm a massive fan of fighting games, and I was hoping to see our community and the fighting game market grow due to the potential success of this game. It is evident now that this will not happen, due to Capcom essentially fumbling with the FGC's most anticipated release since vanilla SF4 (also having a projected sales goal of selling 2 million copies and obtaining only 1.4 marks this as a financial failure, your potential purchase aside.)\n\nIf you're uncertain and want to try this game, I would suggest waiting a long, long time.

My cons list is bigger than before.\n- Servers are still unstable, sometimes data isn't loaded.\n- After further experimenting, found that netcode is garbage, even with 4 or 5 bar connections. I hate the rollbacks and teleports, along with the sound cuts. It's common on 5 bar connections to have animation frame skipping, which mess up the moves timing.\n- Input lag is high.\n- Rage quitting is still not properly punished.\n- Keyboard and some sticks still aren't supported. That's some extreme lazyness on the board.\n- Game still doesn't remember the battle request and training mode settings.\n- Graphics has lots of clipping. Super ugly.\n- Matchmaking is unoptimized, keeps matching with the same person and matches tiers/leagues that are too far away, for example Ultra Gold vs Silver. Also, still gives 1 bar connection opponents even if you chose 5 bar.\n\n=> Feb/2016:\nI was always a SF fan, since SF2. It's sad that this game hadn't the launch it deserved:\n- Unstable servers\n- Unreliable matchmaking (1 bar connections regardless of chosen settings)\n- No keyboard support\n- No support for all fighting sticks\n- Game doesn't remember some settings (battle request and training mode)\n- Rage quitting is not punished (with points withdrawal, for example)\nSome of these alone make the game unplayable for a lot of people.\n\nMake no mistake, though: this game is good. But what are nice graphics, awesome sound, interesting mechanics good for if you can't play the game properly? As for the netcode, it could be better: it is good at 4 or 5 bar connections, but not good below that.\n\nHope the game RISE UP to what it really deserves.

(it's literally 2-4 one round fights)  There is no arcade mode.  When you're not logged into the server, you do not get "fight money," which is a form of the game's currency.  The server has kicked me off SEVERAL times, which means I am not earning fight money, when that happens.  And I'll say it again; there is no arcade mode, which is highly unacceptable.\n\nThe general consensus is that this game was released, in its current state, so it could be played in fighting game tournaments this year.  But this is NOT a good release for regular joes who want to have what even amounts to a "competent" experience.  Right now, the game is pretty much just a multiplayer game, for all intents and purposes.  It is beyond disappointing, and it is in no way worth $60.\n\nBy the way...

If you're a longtime competitive Street Fighter player, then you probably already bought this and will buy/enjoy it regardless of any reviews.\n\nBe warned:\n\n> The combat is deep, but requires dozens of hours of practice to develop the muscle memory and skill to really even begin the game. Out of game research is almost required. What character buffs and meter abilities do are not explained in-game, along with some other mechanics. There is no tutorial beyond telling you what to press to block, punch, and kick.\n\n> There is no meaningful single player content. There is no Arcade Mode. Survival Mode is 10, 30, 50, or 100 matches in which your health doesn't restore, but after each match you may be able to buy random health or buffs. The AI is very simple until the last couple matches in which it goes from novice to expert, with nothing in between. Difficulty only increases the number of novice matches you do before reaching the 2-3 expert opponents. If you lose once, all progress is lost, no rewards are earned, and you start at the beginning.\n\n> Story Mode consists of 2-3 fights (only 1 round each) against AI which pretty much stands there and doesn't block, in which you're given full meter at the start. Cutscenes and fights included, each story is over in 5 minutes.\n\n> Earning rewards require you to be connected to the online servers, even if doing a solo/offline mode. Rewards are only earned the first time you complete a mode, and then can only be earned very slowly from online versus matches against random opponents. All costumes are bought from the cash shop. The only non-cash shop unlockables are colors.\n\n> Capcom advertises spending currency earned in-game to buy costumes and characters, but its very similar to a free to play game model. You earn a sizeable amount of currency if you complete Story and Survival modes, but then those no longer award currency, and currency earned online is a slow grind even for expert players, meaning you'll have to spend real money to get more than one or two characters or costumes in any reasonable amount of time.\n\n> The game is unfinished. This is a review of what the game is, now, at $60, and not what it maybe could be a year or two down the line. Various modes advertised such as a cinematic story (intended to be just over an hour long) and trial modes are not yet included and planned for later patches. All costumes are bought in the cash shop, which isn't live as of this review either. Capcom says they may consider an Arcade Mode in the future. Gamepad and fightstick support is also not added, and third party programs are required.\n\n> Servers are unstable. While the game isn't necessarily online-only, but it essentially is. Disconnects even in offline modes will boot you out of matches, reseting progress or ruining a local match. Online matchmaking commonly will match newbies with veterans, when the matchmaking is even working at all.\n\nThis game is really just an online VS mode, and thats what its designed to be and does a good job of it, if you disregard server issues. The barebones combat is excellent if you're a veteran or willing to invest in it. If none of the above bothers you, then its a good game for its target audience, which is the eSport FGC, or those very dedicated to getting into it, but anyone else will not enjoy what SFV has to offer.","February 20","false","21.3"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","1"

Why is it not labeled as such? This can't possibly be the full release. Tons of features are missing, the netcode gets really buggy at times, lobby matchmaking is terrible, and there's not even a basic anti-cheat system (to the point where you can just unplug your cable between when the game says "KO" and goes to the next screen to avoid taking a loss and maintain your win streak).\n\nLook, the core gameplay is solid as hell. It's street fighter, what do you expect? But in releasing this for 60 bucks, I expect to get a full, functioning game, and this is just a mess.

Now I did go in with the knowledge that the servers may be a bit wonky since the game is now public, but this is far MORE than just wonky. I don't understand how games that came out a long while ago(Battlefield Bad Company 2, Call of Duty 4, STREET FGHTER 4!! etc.) never had nearly the amount of problems that this game has. Street Fighter works with 2 people, that's all there is to it. Battlefield is a game that has a CONSTANT UPDATING ENVIRONMENT, that game when it came out ran great! This is a very unacceptable practice from any developer especially Triple A. Also, the limited amount of content doesn't really bother me since I'm more about trying to 1v1 and that's about it. But for people that actually enjoy single player content, this is just terrible, really really terrible. No challenge mode?

Capcom should be aware of everything after so many betas and testings, I feel like I've bought a teaser of the actual game.\n\nOk, let's go to the reasons of my bad review:\n\nNetworking issues after launch are common and understandable, but not addressing them in a period of 24hrs is unacceptable.\n\nNot having an arcade mode is simply... NOT STREET FIGHTER.\n\nLounges are there and not greyed out simply because PRETTINESS, Lounge doesn't work.\n\nYou receive notes and prizes as you play, but you can't know what they are because they havent been launched yet.\n\nStory mode...

I'm a fan of the game - since SFII - and I've enjoyed every release. But this one in particular is very unstable.\n\nThis game is focused to the pro fighting gamers, Not so bad so far, but they forgot the common user. Yes, Ono said "this game is basic to play but hard to master". They put a lame story mode - very different from USF4 that it had animated openings and endings - with bad quality drawings and a lame cpu difficulty in story mode.\n\nAlso the gameserver is really unstable: They try to fix every bug they find - the beta was awesome - but right now, even if they say they fixed it, it puts you waiting for a match every 5 or 10 minutes - even 15 - that is a game killer experience.  It this game is thought to be competitive via online, how is it possibe to have a terrible matchmaking service? Sometimes, the servers don't accept the game results, wasting your time in getting PL points.\n\nUnlike its older brother - USF4 - It doesn't have a search for ranked match in order to find opponents. It is awful and nasty. Why waiting for 5 to 15 minutes instead looking for people who want to play ranked? Imagination can help to fix things, but it seems that the programmers doesn't have a brain to solve constant problems in matchmaking.\n\nLobbies are still primitive. They work from time to time, So far you can invite ONLY ONE FRIEND to play. It is interesting to see FT3, FT5 or FT10. However, it is advised to ADD FRIENDS FIRST before creating the lobbies via CFN, Here is another mistake. In you have steam and you're my friend, I need to add you TWICE: Steam & CFN. Even in your case, to add me as a friend you need to repeat this process TWICE.\n\nAlthough arcade mode is not a must for me, several, LOTS OF PEOPLE are asking for it. And they're right. How a fighting game doesn't have an arcade mode?\n\nGraphics are not properly optimized for this game. Several slowdowns even offline kills the game.\n\nEven with the promise to include more characters, arcade mode and an almost 2 hours story mode animated via GPU, this game feels incomplete. I love this game, but the online experience kills it almost immediately. I looked this game for online, but it feels crappy. The netcode is perfect, but the frequence of the matchmaking makes you wish to find matches in USF4, where you find ranked matches almost immediately.\n\nSites like Gameradar, IGN and EGM were paid to do a review 24 HOURS BEFORE THE GAME WAS RELEASED. Now, where it goes those high scores? Really, I don't trust gamimg press anymore.\n\nFinal words: Like this game: Yes. Like the online platform: NO. Like the options the game has: NO.\n\nSo the qualification is NO. NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL EVERYTHING IS FIXED.\n","February 20","false","117.8"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","24","35","0","1"

So, Capcom is looking like this student and SF V the assignment.\n\nThe game has a lot of unfinished parts and what is done looks unpolished.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nThe Good:\n\nGameplay feels good;\nGraphics and physics looks really good;\nV-system is a really nice addition to the game;\nThe art style is a little bit darker than SF IV, I would say somewhere between IV and Third Strike;\nCrossplay\nThere is no El Fuerte.\nThe Bad:\n\nReally poor character driven story mode, the majority of them feels silly;\nSurvival mode aka grind mode (the ideia to have a survival mode is nice, but here it is very bad implemented.);\nNo versus cpu mode;\nNo arcade mode;\nSome scenarios are nice, but some of than are just a bunch of clichê, Compare Indian and Brazilian Stages from SF 2 to this SF and will get what I'm meaning. Back in a day they were much more original.\nSome lazy animations - Look at Fang's super.\nMatchmaking seems to be working for some people but for me is still getting around 15 minutes to find a match;\nLAG!!!!! I need to wait about 15 minutes for the game to find a 5 Bar match to me and when it does, that is a big chance that the match will be unplayable due to lag (teleports + rollbacks);\nA lot of different bugs - here is one that happened to me: http://steamcommunity.com/app/310950/discussions/0/405692758725659720/\nClipping models and textures:\n[img] http://s27.postimg.org/eyfs3bzyb/2016_03_04_00012.jpg [/img]\n[img] http://s27.postimg.org/7fs1gyj7n/2016_03_04_00004.jpg [/img]\n[img] http://s27.postimg.org/v85y68amb/2016_03_04_00006.jpg [/img]\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nI'm still waiting to see about the plot from the main story mode... I hope they fix some of the continuity problems from the game, like Nash (Once back in a day, Nash was Blanka, Nash was killed in an explosion with Bison and now he was killed again by an helicopter...so far, so good....And also it would be nice if one day we could see the names from Bison, Vega, Balrog fixed)\n\n\nI love the SF franchise and it is sad to me to make this review. Hope to see the game fixed soon, so I will be able to change my review.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nBullfrog","March 4","false","32.6"," 45 of 75 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","45","75","4","0"

I'm giving it a bad review because the game is literally unplayable. The servers are a disaster, the few functions the game should have had at the launch don't even work, if you want to unlock content playing the very limited single player content you just can't because the game randomly kicks you out of the game server, something that forces you to quit the single player mode.

I starved and saved for a full PC upgrade to play this game. I'm now running an i7 6700k and GTX 960. Coming from a crappy AMD APU which ran USF4 just fine, this means I paid quite a bit of money to step up for SFV, and all I'm getting for it is huge microstutters, even in singleplayer (offline) modes... and on the main menu.\n\nAdaptive Vsync, FPS locked to 60fps in RivaTuner. Feel like I've tried everything else. Wish I hadn't sprung for that season pass, by the time this game runs properly it will probly be old enough to be in the summer/holiday sales for half off.\nBy the way, I can't get my OSD to pop up (MSi via Rivatuner) ingame, so I can't get any diagnostics on why the train is wrecking.\n\nI really haven't logged much gameplay. Freezing up for 2-3 seconds in the middle of a match on a competent system... it's just unacceptable. But a few things I've noticed was that it looks feature-gutted in comparison to USF4. Graphics options, benchmarking utility... amenities in SFV are about as sparse as the character roster.\n\nAnd why is the announcer voice for a new online fight initiating SO LOUD no matter what you do to the audio settings? This ♥♥♥♥ is unchained.\n\nThe worst thing about Street Fighter V is that they already know how to make a game that runs properly.

What's more, there's supposed to be a story mode patch coming in the future (when??), so there's that too.\nThe online multiplayer matchmaking can only be described as frustrating. Huge differences in BP (SFV MMR) is common every game, and you'll often experience stuttering and lag, even with the highest connection quality search criteria on.\nCouple it with the abnormally high input latency, and you've got a frustrating experience if you try to have some competitive fun.\nOne other thing: The game does not value the player's time. The transition/loading screens are obnoxiously long and just adds to the frustration.\nCapcom shot themselves in the foot by releasing SFV too early, and who even knows if they're scrambling to set things right; They hardly communicate with the player community.\nI recommend not buying Street Fighter V as it is, right now. Wait until maybe Q2 2017 and see if the situation has improved.

To progress in the game you need to be connected to a server.  However the server connection frequently fails and thus you finally win something there is a chance of reaping the reward or getting plauged by a server connection message.  This is extremly frustrating when you are not good or new to fighting games.\n2. Matchmaking, right now is very slow.  The positive side of this is you can practice playing against the computer while you wait.\n3. Matchmaking is not doing a good job of putting me in matches with people of the same skill level.  I do well against the computer but then get destroyed against other people online.\n4. There is very little single player content, which is very bad when the servers aren't working.  Generally I would play the single player content while I waited for the multiplayer to get fixed, but since there was so little to do I wrote this review . . . while I am waiting for them to fix the servers.\n5. The mechanics are great and fun to use.\n6. The graphics are very good.  My gtx970 can run it on max settings at 60fps.\n7. The xbox one controller works well.\n8.  While it is still up in the air, it appears like the ability to earn fight money is extremly difficult after you beat the little single player section. It feels like players who are not good at multiplayer will most likely have to pay extra to get what the store has to offer.  In other words I don't think, as of right now, you win any fight money for losing at multiplayer and\nyou are not able to grind fight money in the single player mode.\n\nConclusion: I really enjoy the game and after they fix the server, add single player and the ability to do a match against the computer I would be able to recomend it.  I hope Capcom fixes these problems and gives the people who bought the game early some sort of perk for having those who paid practically full price practically serve as an other wave of beta testers (assuming that the plan on fixing these issues).\n\n","February 18","false","9.7"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","1"

Of course, but it's so maxed out on the scale of video game disappointments I can only liken it to real life disappointments.  You know that old adage that sex is like pizza, even when it's bad its good?  Street Fighter V is like the sex that isn't like pizza.  The kind you immediately regret and are pretty sure is gonna make you sick.\n\nIf there isn't going to be an offline tournament mode, then the servers need to be vaguely functional.  Am I too old?  Is this an age thing?  The offline tournament mode to me has always been "the game."  Sure I enjoy playing online against other players, but after I beat the "the game."  So that part being omitted feels like I spent $80 on the preorder and season pass to actually not even get what I consider to be the core game itself.  I've tried to keep an open mind though, because maybe this is an age thing.  Maybe I'm wrong here.  So I really tried to dive deep into the online mode, but the servers are just terrible. It takes 5-10 minutes on average to find a match.  I have to play something else while I wait and by the time it queues up, I'm not really in the moment anymore.  Another big disappointment is that I love the big cast of characters, but they cut way back.  Street Fighter IV added so many classic characters to what I thought was going to be the permanent lexicon of SF.\n\nThis game feels really thin and flimsy.  I'm not even addressing the ragequit exploit, because Capcom promises severe punishment.  If you're putting all your eggs in one basket, doubling down on online tournament play only, then doesn't that seem like a really basic, careless, obvious misstep?  That's the kind of lack of attention to detail and quality that permeates every aspect of this game.\n\nI'm pretty sure this only gets read by my friends.  If that is the case and you're reading this, then please come over and play this game any time you want before actually spending money on it.  I'll make time for you.  That's how bad this is.

Even knowing vanilla versions of fighting games almost always have growing pains.  Hopefully this game improves enough to make me remember to update this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Storm-/recommended/310950/","Storm-","Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Storm-/","452 products in account","I'm writing this review as a short review but also as a response to ZoSo, who was defending the release of this game. So let's get down to the nitty gritty of this:\n\nThis game is an unfinished product with incredible server issues on launch day. Yes, day one game releases are known for problems on release, but not being able to actually play the game is dumbfounding. Why does the server connection need to be such a priority? 16 characters is quite low for a fighting game of this caliber. Sure it means more focus on each character but if we look at what Mortal Kombat has managed to do with their roster (including X with three fighting styles per), then this is inexcusable.\n\nThe gameplay is fine, it's fun, it's the Street Fighter we know. Focus attacks are gone, and the EX meter is now a V-Skill meter, which makes for some interesting options during a fight. It reminds me of MvC3's short X-Factor boost. The prologues for the characters are what I'm currently focusing on, since I'm anticipating the intricate story mode similar to MK, and the style is quite appealing thus far. The soundtrack is nice, rock-style, and the graphics are decent, very in-tune to SFIV.\n\nMy issues with this game stretch far and beyond. To ZoSo - You're kidding yourself if you think Capcom won't re-release this game. They said that Super Street Fighter IV was the definitive version, it was the only one they'd do as far as an updated release was concerned. Then what happened? Ultra, that's what. MvC3, and within a few months what happens? UMvC3. Are we noticing a pattern here? Capcom can -say- they won't re-release but then as their current trend of business practice goes, they are the KINGS of rereleases. Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, collections galore. Anyone who knows their release history can attest to this. Once all characters are released, we're getting a new version. With more stages, costumes, etc..\n\nOn the remark that Capcom released this early because of fans wanting to gear up for a tournament: This should not be $60 then. Put it out there for $30 max, and if we want the other content later on we can opt to pay the other. Keep the beta up and running, actually, that would have been much smarter, or making this early access. Fair is fair. Also, why adhere to the fans in releasing a game early? When does that ever work out? Take a look at say, Spider-Man 3. Raimi gave into the fans and squeezed in Venom, and what a mess that film became. It's fine to take suggestions but it's better to go with your guts at the end of the day. If they knew this release would be too hectic then they should have held off, tournament or not. Some fans would be disappointed but there's always next year for the tournament, and the overall consensus would have been better for this title.\n\nHaving to wait for the characters and story and other modes is pathetic. Other fighters have a core version where you have limitations but can still play the game. For free, mind you. Capcom has to be aware of this by now...yet their greedy corporation just can't wait to charge full price. The point is - they had options. There were better conditions to bring this game to the public eye, better ways to adhere to the community...they took none of these routes.\n\n*Update*\nThe dev team are hard at work in fixing the server issue at the moment, so props to them for that. Still disappointed with this release, but I'm grateful for the fast action here.","February 16","false","1.8"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","25","41","4","0"

I have to use joytokey and it's really beginning to impact my experience online. But that isn't even half of the problem I have with this game. You have survival which is both boring and repetitive and a story mode you complete in five minutes. Needless to say this game is more focused on the competitive aspect of fighting games to rake in more money from the rising star that is Esports. Capcom, or more specficially Ono has stated that the game is supposed to "reset" the competitive scene of street fighter but anybody who starts at home online with ranked matches has to make their way up a "league" system. The problem with this league system is that you have to make your way through people who really don't know how to play the game. And if you're new to the game and you get beaten by these stupid habits you'll likely pick them up. Not only that but the matchmaking system is poor. I had a match against a platinum player while I was in super bronze. Not only is this bad for me, since I'm going to get beat pretty bad, but it's bad for the platinum player because they don't get much points from beating me but if I win and run with the points I could take over 200 from them. Potentally de-leaguing them. The whole point of a league system is to face people in  your own league and as your progress so does your league right? Well apparently not. The system may as well not be there. And now I'm in silver, high league players are more common and they always rage quit when you beat them. There are so many rage quitters on ranked in general which makes it extremely hard to make your way up while being a legit player. On top of the server issues. The core input lag isdn't a problem for me. That is until I have to use to joytokey which makes it ridiculous. Capcom have had 3 months to get in a decent rage quit punish and d input for pc. Which they have failed to provide. If I had the option to refund the game at this point I honestly would.  Inb4 "you're just salty" I'm really not, I used to play USF4 and sucked at it, ♥♥♥♥♥ing my ♥♥♥ beat all the time. But it was a good game I would reccomend.\n\nPros:\n-Good Visuals\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Nice Gameplay concept\n\nCons:\n-No D-input\n-Input lag\n-Rollback Netcode\n-Rage Quitting\n-Lack of content\n-Ranked being bad for your mental health\n-Pitiful Matchmaking\n-Gameplay and Mechanics are currently flawed\n-No really welcoming to new players\n\nI'm sure this will be a good game in time. But in it's current state Capcom really don't deserve your money for this. I love street fighter and the games capcom put out there. But I can't reccomend this game to anyone eithout being a liar.\n","May 15","false","429.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

If I could sort lobbies by timezone or region then I'd be able to waste less time.

Laggy connections don't benefit in any way from the roll back and just make the game really unplayable. On top of that, there is no way to filter out regions you don't wish to play against. I can set the connection filter to only allow 5 bar connections and it somehow still puts me against players from outside of the US and our connections are anything but a 5 bar connection...\n\nConclusion:\n\nOther than that, it looks like SF 5 will shape up to be a really great game in the future.","March 7","false","110.8"," 39 of 68 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","39","68","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/troosevelt/recommended/310950/","troosevelt","Teddy!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/troosevelt/","137 products in account","Disappointing.\n\nThat is the word I would use to describe the release of Street Fighter V, which while boasting a strong core game, is essentially another phase of Beta testing that costs full price.\n\nAmongst the many issues and lack of features, Capcom's failure to support a large number of common previous generation fight sticks is nearly inexcusable. Many recently released games of the genre support any Windows-recognized device that can register inputs, but perhaps the decision to incorporate XInput as their means to handle input devices is the real culprit here.\n\nDon't be fooled by "Full Controller Support" as a feature of this game; do your research and make sure your device will work with this game before you regret it.\n\nEither way, the fact of the matter is that Street Fighter largely does not support many PS3/Xbox360 supported fight sticks, so you can either choose to shovel out some more money for a new stick or use a 3rd-party application of dubious reputation such as XPadder, MotionJoy, or Joy2Key.\n\nAs an aside here, hilariously the game uses XInput display assets for all of the buttons (e.g. X, Y, A, B as seen on an XBox controller) despite the release being exclusive to PS4 and PC.\n\nBesides this, Street Fighter V is also lacking basic support for multi-player lobbies, instead limiting the "Player Slots" to "1" which nearly defeats the purpose of lobbies altogether.\n\nSpeaking of online features, connectivity remains shoddy for the time being, though Day-1 PC releases are prone to similar issues. Street Fighter V is no different than many of the AA or AAA game releases we're probably used to in terms of server stability until Capcom works with their networking teams to resolve them. Take this as you will, but don't expect strong connectivity between friends and other players for a while.\n\nMeanwhile the game is lacking a number of features that make this release feel utterly bare-bones, including a lack of an Arcade Mode, no "Versus CPU" mode (though somewhat mitigated by being able to set Training Dummies to complete rounds), no Challenge or Trial Mode (to be added in a later update), and a very lacking "Story" Mode that contains a handful of Best-of-One rounds against about 3 opponents in total. The Store is also another "to be added later" feature which is baffling considering the amount of content that Capcom has and will be preparing to offer up to users on a "Freemium" model.\n\nDid we mention bugs? Training Mode doesn't save your game settings, so enjoy having to set "After First Hit" every time you want to work on combos on a training dummy. Hopefully you didn't need to change the game's in-game language either, because you'll need to set that through an INI file on your system. If you prefer (or have no choice) to use a keyboard as your controller, get used to the pre-set controls because you can't re-bind the keyboard keys for any action in the game. Then you can note the numerous launch, login, application freeze, and otherwise game-breaking technical issues that have been reported on 15 pages (as of this review) through the game's official Steam Support page. One of the more ridiculous and yet somehow common issues reported thus far is that WACOM tablets connected to PCs appear to cause input and game stability issues, resulting in player being unable to type in any fields in-game and in worst-case scenarios encountering game crashes without any error reporting.\n\nI don't think I've mentioned anything good about the game so far, so to be fair it is important to note that Street Fighter V, when you actually get it to work and play without any graphical, technical, or input issues, is an incredibly fun and diverse fighter with a great cast of returning and new characters all of whom feel unique and familiar at the same time. While some may say that Street Fighter V seems more inclined to be friendly for beginner or intermediate players of the genre, time will tell. Regardless, the actual meat of the game is very refreshing.\n\nGraphically the game is excellent, boasting another nice take on the visual design that began with Street Fighter 4 with distinct and noticeable cues on special moves with a lot of flair. The sound design may be the standout factor here, where every hit, block, special move, and cheesy-voiced-lines sound on point and impactful. Drowning out the music when performing a Critical Art is a small but significant decision that brings an air of effectiveness to the action itself.\n\nI really want to like this game, but I also want it to work, not just for me but for the people and community that also want to play the game. Unfortunately getting past all of the chaff to find the actual wheat that Street Fighter should boast about is such an exhausting process. This feels like a game that needed another few months of development to be an actual, full-priced release.","February 16","false","41.3"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","21","35","2","0"

Maybe when march or future updates can improve on those, but the price just doesn't feel right at present.(The "ultra" moves last hit "scene" don't look as painful as it did in usf4)\n\nThe good things of the game are online competitive rankings, some new characters, new skills to master, boob jobs for all female fighters(maybe not a good thing), tight controls and some great lighting effects.(Anyone noticed how every character have huge feet bigger than their heads)\n\nI would recommend wait for a few months and see how it goes, at present feels like capcom is using us all as beta testers.\n\n*Update as of 2nd April 2016*\n\nThe March updates are in, shop is open, challenges and trials are here. Sadly not much we for the trials and challenges see before.\n\nThe shop is a letdown, skip it for there's not much in it or than buying alternate costume colors and story costumes.(They should have been unlocked when completed individual stories... at least to me...)\n\nAlex is a great addon, but we all gonna have wait longer for the long story or arcade mode. Some of us have more problems with online matches. I waited connection for 15 minutes and gave up, in beta at least I get to play with some japanese dudes within 3 minutes of waiting time. Depending on region some may suffer disconnection while playing the game and that means?\n\nIt's likely much more things ain't done on their side and they are bad with the fight money for now. So stay away unless you're confident that your region's network for this game isn't that bad. Just wait at least till late june to see how it turns out, it still feels beta now.\n\nUpdate as of 30th of April 2016\n\nAn icon of the franchise have returned!! Guile, an iconic character of the sf series is back(he appears to not aged at all, lazy designers) and free till the shop is up and running as intended or so as Capcom says... A new stage, sum of balances to the game, new titles, survival/story/trial/demostration for Guile. Also some puniment for rage quiters. (I cannot comment for that, I still cannot connect to any match within 15 minutes of waiting.)\n\nThe game just became more interesting with Guile, new strategies will be brought in to win with every character they bring in. But Guile isn't that new, he's came out in 1990 on those pirated beta arcade boards(Only 5 fighters to choose from). Officially in 1991 where street fighter 2 which he's one of the 8 fighters to choose from. I personally like Guile a lot(but I suck using him), when used well he's like an unstoppable tank to some characters in SF5. For season pass holders, we have these shop characters and stages without purchasing using fight money in future... The shop design is... well...not so great for a new entry to the franchise with empty spaces/ simple/ugly interface. I still cannot recommend the game at this point. This isn't an early access indie game, but it still feels like it with every updates...","February 18","false","5.9"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","2"

Seriously though, I'd hate to give this game a thumbs down because I love fighting games and I really enjoyed SFIV up until AE. But, it just let me down in a terrible manner.\n\nWhen the game decides to work, it's an okay game at best. Loading times are ridiculously long, not to mention there are a crap ton of loading. Finding a match takes an eternity. The netcode is absolute garbage and breaks this game. And when the netcode is broken, you're left with an AMAZING story mode and a survival mode with FANTASTIC AI /sarcasm. Really, if you're going to release a game strictly dedicated to online, make sure that feature freaking works! What the f*ck were all of those beta tests for?!\n\nGraphic wise, the game isn't as pleasant to the eyes as people make it out to be. I was never a fan of Street Fighter's super steroid art style for their characters. Speaking of which, Ken's model looks atrocious! There are clipping issues, the background stage's low poly, low textured, low frame rate is dreadful and very distracting to the fight that's going on. Have you SEEN the background models in Kanzuki Estate? Look at them and tell me they look good with a straight face.\n\nGameplay wise, it's meh.... it's okay... It no longer plays like a Street Fighter game.  Remember, this is strictly subjective. But, I feel like this game has a serious case of identity crisis. It doesn't seem like it knows what kind of fighting game it wants to be. Whereas Street Fighter IV was extremely technical, you had to play smart and very patient. This game feels super simple, non-technical and you just go balls in any time you want.\n\nHonestly, I really wanted to give Capcom another chance, especially with the Street Fighter x Tekken fiasco. But with sh*t like this happening, I find it nearly impossible to defend this company any longer. It seems that I'll be sticking with KOF and Tekken for many more years to come. I hope in the future that this game will shape up to be something great. But for now, I wouldn't want to see a trainwreck like this as the main event at EVO.","February 21","false","31.0"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","25","44","0","3"

I'm looking forward to challenge mode in a future update, but for now there is only story mode and survival mode. Survival mode is the way to unlock the colors. Story mode unlocks outfits, and it's way too easy.\n\nThe problem is if you mess up a single round in survival mode you have to start over. No matter how good you are, it takes some time to get through all those opponents (especially the 50 or 100 round sets). So it's quite annoying to lose on one of the last 3 rounds because the opponents suddenly get very strong. Or even worse, if the game server goes down (which it does often) you have to start over through no fault of your own.\n\nMaybe the game will get better when they add more stuff. Challenge mode sounds fun. I'm looking forward to some new characters. I'm also hoping to be able to buy the alternate colors when the shop is released. I really hope that survival mode is not the only way to do it.\n\nUsually when I find something like this that keeps me from enjoying a game, I cheat. I like to make my own trainers - but this game has anti-tampering software. So I can't even do that. All I wanted was to unlock some colors! I don't care about online ranking.\n\nTLDRSingle player mode has only story and survival. Neither are fun. One is frustrating. Can't unlock stuff. Can't buy stuff (yet).\n\nUnfortunately, there's really just nothing to do in the game.\n\nUPDATE:\nEven with the new updates, there's not much single player stuff to do in this game.

Does the core gameplay work? Probably the best it's been, to be honest, but the lack of content and the online being awful really drags this game down.\n\nRegarding single player and general issues, there's no regular vs mode against the computer (only survival mode which drags), all stories combined takes about an hour or so, hit and miss stick support and some weird changes or decisions that is up for debate to the characters (Vega / Claw isn't a charge character anymore, Bison / Dictator is more akin to his Alpha incarnation and Ryu is the only character that can parry)\n\nRegarding online, you're lucky to get a game on casual or ranked mode and if you do, you're more lucky to get a good connection. I can only get good connections in lobbies but then there's the issue of not gaining in-game currency in lobbies and even then, the amount of currency they give you for wins is absolutely stingy and basically forces you to buy a season pass if you want the content and don't want to waste your whole life waiting for games and slowly grinding for currency. I know Capcom said they'll be doing daily challenges soon but that still doesn't fix the issue of online being a trainwreck.\n\nI luckily didn't pay full price (£45 on Steam, I managed to get it for £25) but I still feel a bit cheated. Once more updates come out and they fix the glaring issues, I will have no problem recommending this game.","May 10","false","7.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Sure the gameplay is as solid and fun as ever, the problem is that there is hardly any of it. No arcade mode, no VS bots, both things provided by literally every fighting game worth a damn in the past decade. On top of that, the servers are crap, making online play impossible, and any controller that doesn't identify as an Xbox controller is next to useless. Basically unless you have some friends nearby and a couple of good Xbox controllers, you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck with this game.","February 17","false","9.4"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","30","54","0","1"

This is exactly why I don't preorder games, they send out a unfinished product like this that i can't even connect to. If I could connect online with out being disconnected in the middle of a fight just to lose all my progress I wouldnt care as much about the lack of story or arcade mode. Right now it is unplayable. I just want to point out this is a review of the game at this point in time. I would wait till the servers are working on this game. Alright Servers are working and I am having fun now that I can play online. I will still keep it rated down since arcade mode is a maybe now im kind of mad. The reason I loved arcade is it was a great way just to learn how other characters worked and something just to mess around on. The tutorial mode was pathetic and there are a lot diffrent thing that new people need to learn in this game.

For a full fledged $60 game, I would expect a lot more. Now they even have a season pass already planned, which should honestly be free for day1 buyers.\n\n(2) Online - For a game with so few offline game modes, the online portion suffers from poorly designed netcode, making online battles laggy and frustrating. On top of that, finding a match takes FOREVER!\n\n(3) Speed - The game has become much slower than its predecessors. I main with Ryu and dissapointingly he has become as slow as Sagat from SFIV. Another main gripe are some of the moves have been taken away from past characters, mainly Bison's Psycho Crusher... why Capcom?\n\nOverall, do not buy this game.

It is now wearing thin even for me how little this game came  with!!! People call it a beta but it is more like a free demo disc you would get with a magazine or something! At first i didnt care it had nothing other than training and online as it gave me time to get to know the new mechanics, learn new combos etc which i have done now but no thanks to the game itself! Street fighter games have never had good tutorials but this time was supposed to be different and was Capcoms main goal to bring in new players to the franchise. Im an experienced player and even i dont know what everything does! For example i have only just learned what a V-reversal is and even online i cant find a way to actually do them! Now the game itself doesnt make you aware of anything the V-gauge does apart from the usual brain dead ultra moves! In fact this game doesnt teach you ANYTHING that you will need ot know inb order to survive online. Yet again bare bones lazy Capcom expect you to live like the mega drive days and hunt for the secret knowledge like some sort of treasure hunt!!! Even other fighting games teach you how to play and since this doesnt it creates massive elitism within the community which quite frankly makes me sick and is poisoning this franchise which is supposed to be here for FUN!\n\nOk so the lack of any kind of training (other than how to punch move and jump) is bad enough but now we are gtting online turned off for whole days leaving you with nothing at all to do in the game, the store for costumes isnt out til March even though you can see the unlockable costumes on the CPU characters which is just seriously teasing you! Ken and Ryu were supposed ot be toned down in this version but yet again all the best scorers online are ken and ryus who dont even bother to learn a combos cos they dont need to with their OP specials, frame advantages etc etc, you cant even play against the CPU in versus?! No controller support for Pc other than xbox controllers even though this game is out for PS4 & PC only how does that make sense?! Online can be a mess with MASSIVE frame skipping making it unplayable, no penalty for rage quitters, no story mode at all the one they tacked onto it should have been left out as it wouldnt have been half as insulting as this piece of crap is (literaly 3/4 one round fights per character takes about 15 minutes to complete story mode with EVERY character!) and the list just goes on!\n\nNow the gameplay itself is definitely fun and some slight adjustments have been made to make it friendler to play for new comers but not much. I love playing the game but again it feels like some characters have an advantage over others which in a competative fighting game is just pure insanity!\n\nI CANNOT RECOMMEND this shallow embarrassing and quite insulting release of a game even though street fighter is my most beloved game, anime, manga and just in general franchise ever! Now if thats coming from a super fan what does it tell you about this joke of a release?! This seems like in another year it will be great just like super IV was to the normal IV. But how long can Capcom carry on this half arsed attempt at everything they seem to do these days? They were already struggling financially in recent years and if this is any indication to go by this may very well be the last street fighter well at least in their hands.\n\nSTAY WELL AWAY UNTIL THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY THEY ARE CHARGING FOR IT! DO WHAT THE REST OF US DIDNT DO AND SHOW THESE JOKERS THEY CANT OD THIS TO THEIR LONG TIME AND NEW CUSTOMERS BY NOT BUYING THE GAME! MAKE THEM DO THEIR BLOODY JOBS FIRST BEFORE WE GO THROWING CASH AT THEM!","February 23","false","68.5"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","19","33","2","0"

It's everything I could ever wish for in a fighting game spiritually and I feel blessed to have a chance to play this in my lifetime.\n\nAll of that said, do not buy this game. Regardless if you are a hardcore or casual, the way this game has been constructed and the lack of support around it in the first month is nothing short of an absolute nightmare. The game is still unfinished. The servers still do not work consistently. The netcode is inconsisent. There is a complete void of single player outside of a grindy survival mode and a braindead easy story mode that an infant could beat [and did, look it up].\n\nSo as of right now with as much time I have invested, unless you are an absolute die hard player like I am and have a good scene around you, do not support this shell of a game.\n\nAPRIL UPDATE:\n\nAlex and Guile have been welcome additions to the game.\n\nGame still has a few major issues. The ragequit punishment system implemented is not harsh enough and has not detered several offenders.

WTF!!!\n\nWhat have you been doing all this time CAPCOM!?\n\nSeriously, are you seriously releasing a game like this!?\n\nIt's even worse than the first version Street Fighter 4, NOT Super Street Fighter 4, NOT Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, NOT Ultra Street Fighter 4.\n\nLook at what we have in Street Fighter 5 at launch:\n\n- Story Mode: Capcom said they have done a new approach to this mode, which they actually did. Every character has more background to show, meeting and interact with other between each match through artworks and voiceover. And that's it! Still show no specific story, hard to follow what happens. Moreover, a joke of it is: ONLY 3 MATCHES PER CHARACTER!!! 3 ♥♥♥♥♥' MATCH!!! (and an epilogue) Everything ended suddenly before I could get used to the character. Oh and I couldn't adjust the Difficulties, not just this mode but EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥' MODE!!! (except training mode) I guess the default difficulty is the Beginner, 'cause I can easily got 3 perfect matches each character.\n\n- Versus Mode: I can't play this mode at all, even though I get a spare X360 controller. No matter what I use, keyboard or the controller, I could only play as the first player and was unable to activate the second one.\n\n- Training Mode: Hey, training mode everyone needs. Good thing it's still here.\n\n- Ranked & Casual Match, Battle Lounge: works fine to me, except long waiting time, one match with low-connect opponent jumping around and flickering and RAGE QUIT!!!\n\nThat's it! That's what we get at launch! The rest of them contain themselves in "This mode will be available as free update in March". YES! CAPCOM gives us an unfinished developing game, FOR 60 DOLLARS!!! What about other Features we deserve to get?\n\n- Arcade Mode: that's true, ARCADE MODE!! That's the best mode helping me getting used to the character and how to use them to fight another. And NO! the current Story Mode is a joke and definitely cannot use as an replacement.\n\n- Keyboard rebinding: YES!! I used AutoHotkey to config my usual control, but thanks to it I couldn't activate V-Skill.\n\n- Trial Mode: WHERE IS IT!? The mode tutoring combos for every character!?\n\n- Tournament Mode!!!\n\n- Turbo Mode: SF5 is pretty slow to the previous ones, and this optional choice is a good one for old fans.\n\n- Gallery Mode: The first opening movie, character artworks,... There are no mode for me to specifically see it\n\nSuch a disappointment! The only hope I have right now is the Story Mode update in June, and HOPEFULLY it's a complete story, not CGI movie replacing the current Story Mode's artworks.","February 21","false","11.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wpennie/recommended/310950/","wpennie","tomqq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wpennie/","73 products in account","I was nervous when buying this game because of its cost and the fact that the reviews I saw from the community were mostly negative and complained about the game. However, the reviews that were negative were given by the community, but companies like IGN were still giving this game good reviews. So if anyone is thinking of buying this game I will break down the pros and cons of this game at its current state.\n\nFirst off, I have had this game for a while now and it is one of my faveorite games. Street fighter 5, in its current state, shows few signs of an unfinished game. The training mode is better than ever before in a fighting game, and the online play is smooth and in my experience has not taken over 3 minutes to find a match. (when searching for good-the best connections) Survival on hard and hell mode are both very hard, but that isn't a bad thing in my perspective.  The colors that are unlocked by beating hard mode should be seen as a prestigious reward, which you can show off in online mode.\n\nThe main complaint from the community is that the game lacks a classic arcade mode. Capcom decided to direct the game towards a more competitive audience, and decided to leave out an arcade mode to be able to release the game earlier. However, the upcoming update which will include a character and additional story content is coming soon, which will add more depth to the current story mode and give the casual players something more their style. All of the core components of an arcade mode are there, capcom just decided to leave it out. This means that it is possible for them to release a classic arcade mode in the future. The amount of characters is also something that is commonly complained about. Because capcom designed the game to be competitive, a low character roster is ideal so that the characters are all balanced, and there is no clear top tier character. That being said, the characters are all unique and fun to play, while keeping all matchups fairly balanced so that the better player will always come out on top.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the money, and I can see this game being one of my faveorites for a long time.","June 2","true","82.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Stages seem to be very detailed, even including the occasional destruction of background objects. Fighting seems to have a good flow to it.\n\nUnfortunately, the game, as it is now, is pretty barebones in regards to content in the single player side. Story mode as it is now is comprised of three fights with one round each, which is, in my opinion, too little. There's not even a basic arcade mode with 8 to 10 3-round fights like before.\n\nCapcom also seems to have done away with a lot of supers that were avalable for returning characters. Most characters have only one super in the command list, which may have some slightly different gameplay element if done under V-Trigger. Whereas in USFIV, each character could have 3 or even more supers/ultras.\n\nNot to mention the occasional server trouble this game gets. Why oh why does this game need to log in to a server if we want to play story mode or survival with battle requests on OFF? And why does the game need to knock you out of the fight, into the menu if it loses its connection to servers during a Hard Mode survival run (on stage 34)?\n\nBuy it if you want the multiplayer. Or if you intend to get into eSports.\n\nForget about this game for now if you want single player. Gamers are better off waiting until the full story mode is released in june.","February 20","false","3.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

Read the top "positive" review for more information. I've only played 8 hours so far but plan to play much more. When the game network is up and running properly, the game plays great. The netcode is solid. I have a lot of fun, which is the whole point of playing a video game in the first place. Although, I am getting tired of game releases that are half finished, and quite displeased that it's becoming the standard.\n\nPersonally, I think $60 is a bit steep for the game in current state. Many months of free content is promised to be released, so use your own judgment to determine whether or not it's worth it. This game will continue to improve over the months and potentially years to come. Although the release was weak, I believe it overall deserves strong community support to continue improvement and success for a new generation of Street Fighter.\n\nI have a lot of fun with this game and I'm sure a lot of you will, too. Stick compatibility and game modes will be addressed eventually along with many months of (free) DLC, and potentially more. The game will constantly improve.

It wouldn't be right to recommend this game to anyone but hardcore enthusiasts or competitive players, FOR NOW. It's full of bugs, suffers from unstable servers and is missing important features.\n\nThe current story mode is pretty bad. The actual story is fine but the dialogue is embarrassing. I feel like it would have gone over fine as an anime, but could have benefitted from something more than just a direct translation. If you've ever watched a dubbed anime, you'll probably understand. It's also permanently set to "easy" difficulty with no way to change it, so getting through story mode is more like a mindless grind just to learn the plot.\n\nCapcom is trying to make this game something of an evolving foundation for them to build on. Which means it's currently imcomplete. The "store" where you use your battle points to buy characters and costumes isn't up yet. Neither is the upcoming challenge mode. So you have these modes that will be coming soon, but they decided not to bundle into the game at launch. That would be fine if we were still in beta, but this was a full price release. I'm okay with this since the game actually says they'll be available in March; others may not be fine with it.\n\nThere is no arcade mode. This pains me so! Not everyone wants to fight competitively online, not all of us have a friend over to fight against. Training mode just doesn't cut it. Survival mode is fun but it just isn't the same. Sometimes I just want to casually battle the CPU in the same old school way we have been fighting since the early 90's. Arcades in America are mostly extinct; the closest we get to that is Arcade mode. You won't find it here, and it leaves me with this itch I can't scratch when I open the game.\n\nVersus mode has no Vs. CPU mode, which would have supplemented the lack of arcade mode a bit. You can play the rest of the game with a keyboard, but versus mode requires you to have TWO controllers to fight. I have one controller and my friend had to bring his over to play since the keyboard wasn't an option.\n\nSurvival mode is enjoyable. You select your difficulty and battle anywhere from 10 to 100 opponents with a reward at the end if you don't lose. Unfortunately it pointlessly requires you to be connected to servers, so that Hard difficulty battle I was having where I had defeated 46 out of 50 opponents without losing got ruined when the servers decided to disconnect me. It immediately cancels the entire battle.\n\nOnline mode still suffers from server malfunctions, though Capcom seems to be working on it. Still, people can ragequit on you without suffering any penalties, and you don't get the win for it. Some victories won't even send to the server.\n\nOverall, this game is underbaked and could have used another two months in the oven. The characters are wonderfully designed and animated, the backgrounds are delightful and the gameplay is incredibly fun. Just give this one some time to see how it unfolds.","February 21","false","8.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

I'm more than aware of issues with online games at launch, but it's  nonetheless noteworthy\n\nBattle Loungues only support 2 players. It appears to still have King of the Hill functionality by moving the winner to the top of the pile, but .. you know, 2 players. That's it.\n\nNo trials for characters either, at least not that I can find. The menus seem to be a bit cluttered and clumsy to navigate (I can only Ready-Up online with my keyboard, not my fightstick for instance).\n\nSpeaking of Single Player, if you're having connection issues and wish to play offline, you won't receive any in-game currency for unlocking more stuff. Gotta be logged in for that. No animated cutscenes in Story Mode either, unless you consider a bunch of still frame drawings animated.\n\nThe game runs smooth, though. Much smoother than the beta. It even has the option of a 'Low Spec Mode' before you launch, which just automatically defaults the graphics settings to the lowest they can go. I tweaked them up to my liking, then restarted in Low Spec Mode and they were 0 again. It's probably best to find what settings work for you in the standard game so it'll actually save them, unless your computer can't handle anything above the basics.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to crap all over the game, but I can't recommend it right now. There's a deep game in here, sure. It's Street Fighter. But hell if a new player will be able to figure out the nuances without trials.

NO ARCADE MODE !! wait what? NO ARCADE MODE!!!!! - SF is all about the Arcade mode! choosing a character vs a character from another country - seeing this cool animation of the region of the character you're playing against.. that's basically the essence of SF ! weird move by Capcom.\n\n2. Lazy story mode - I'm a fan of manga - but the comics in the story mode are very cheap. not interesting. no deep background of the characters - looks like a temp mode.\n\n3, Online was better on Beta - now that's weird with no need elaborate.\n\n4, Challenge Mode - also .. should have been in the game since day 1 ( which is today) ...\n\n\nWhat I do like?\nIs the new system, feels more friendly ! I wish I could use my PS4 controller with the game but as for now it's not supported so I'm using my XBONE controller.\n\nthe graphics are really amazing - great job!!\n\nothet than that I need more to keep me in game longer than an hour, but that's just me,\n\n","February 16","false","43.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The game is good fun.  I know they will be adding more content later, but still it feels pretty bare bones.  Not everyone who likes street fighter follows Capcom and social media knows about this.  The mentality is still that if you pay 60 dollers for a game you get a substantial amount of content up front...not have to wait for it later.  I like how they will be updating the core game and let you get future dlc with money you can get in game.  That is a step in the right direction.  Turning off early adopters...we will see how that pans out in the long run.  I want Street Fighter 5 to do well....I don't want paying 60 bucks for a part of a game and have to wait for the rest  later to be the norm. I currently give this game 3 sad pandas and an ice cream float.\n\n****Original Review****\nThis is not how you launch the "5th" iteration of a flagship fighting game.  If you want to play this game wait a few months untill the rest of it is released or find a friend who already took to plunge.  Gameplay is fun...if you can actually play the game. :/  Currently I give this game 8 sad pandas out of 10.

I think Capcom will eventually fix it but it's a bit unacceptable with all Capcom's experiance in fixing USF4 for online. Only had 2 matches in one sitting for an hour.\n\nUpdate: I have been kicked off of Survivor Mode at least twice because of the spotty online servers. This irritated me as I was trying to beat Hell Survivor Mode and suddenly it was game over because their servers arent stable. You only get fight money if you beat survivor mode online and not offline.\n\n-Graphically unoptomized. The game lags on settings it shouldnt for my system, (I can run Batman Arkham Knight relatively fine in full screen or windowed, USF4 was silky smooth). Toning down the resolution and playing in full screen it is still laggy and unoptomized. Game lags when its looking for players to connect to in training stage - which I think they had this problem in a build of AE or SFxT I cant remember which. Once again, Capcom might eventually fix but only time will tell. Update: I made a few tweaks to my videocard and got it running smooth at a lower resolution. Some stages still have minor lag.\n\n-Weird gameplay decisions that are supposed to encourage casuals. As a long time USF4 player, I can assure you this game will eventually discourage casual players. I already see a new tier list forming after only a few hours of play. Capcom went into the wrong direction with this game IMO. The game feels like the older games Alpha, SF3 with a hint of SF4. Those games were not bad, this is like a hybrid of those.\n\n-No full story mode. Not a big deal with me, I barely care about SF's story. The story eventually always seems like it was written by a 12 year old on riddlin. Characters like Birdie literally transforming into Rufus lol. Like why??\n\n-Some of the music is terrible. Like SFxT level of annoying.\n\n-Update: Forgot to mention crossplay with PS4. Ive had matches where characters would jerk around the screen in a way I've never seen before.\n\n-Update: Despite the "new" ranking system, to me it's USF4's ranking system under another new name. Even they promised they would 'match you with other players of your skill' you will get mismatched on occasion.\n\n- In general, another borked port from console. Not worth full price. I bought it from another retailier for less and I still feel a little ripped off. I'll continue to play for fun on occasion but I wont take this game seriously like I did with USF4. USF4 took me years to get decent at. This game feels too easy and too exploitive - as in its really easy to win on a fundamental level.","February 16","false","37.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There's a disturbing lack of content for a supposed AAA title, that costs 70$.\n\nGameplay wise, it's fun, and much faster then previous SF's. I didn't really have any issues technically with launching or playing the game. That's about all that's positive. Oh, it also looks pretty.\n\nThe story mode is incredibly thin. It doesn't really offer anything in terms of cutscenes or a compelling story. You'll find yourself skipping over all the text just to get to the next match. From there, you'll probably head to training.\n\nTraining is also weak on features. The command list is paper thin as well, and only offers the absolute basic inputs for moves. Nothing to be found for possible combos, or links, or how properties change in V-Skill, or what counters do, crush counters etc. etc. So you're left being pretty uneducated after training mode. Which is strange, because Capcom has changed a lot of things in this version of SF, and you're going to want to spend some time in training to learn it all before you go online. Speaking of online....\n\nIt doesn't work. I routinely experienced log in errors, which completely handicaps the ENTIRE game. There's almost nothing to do offline, and even when you're offline, you're required to log in to the server. So the server shuts down, and occasionally takes your game with it. Your match is dead, sometimes the game freezes, and you're forced to shut down. It's a complete mess right now and isn't worth your time.\n\nThey've "promised" to fix issues, and update content at a later date, but the more people that buy this trash right now, will only push back that deadline.

Single player modes aside, it was clear from all the previews and promos before the game was launched that this was going to be a multiplayer focused title, as a fighting game should be.\n\nThere's in-game tools to let anybody #riseup to competitive levels.\n\nThe training mode is great, letting you set up post-grounded and blocking responses from the dummy, and lets you queue up for matches (with the option to set in rank, casual, connection settings) while you practice, so there's never any real down time.\n\nThe biggest tool the game provides though, is the replay mode. The CFN system tracks -every- recent batch of replay for every player online. That means you can download and watch all the top-ranking players and learn from them, as well as watching your own wins and losses to see what part of your game you need to work on. This is a very under utilized feature that beginners tend to ignore, but when used properly will let any beginner see what the next step of progression would be.\n\nThat and the continual free updates for modes, characters, and balance changes will continue to add value to this title.\nCasuals beware, this isn't worth full sticker price for someone who don't want to invest time and effort to enjoy gameplay, but for anybody else that wants to challenge themselves against others I would suggest this title to anybody who wants to get into the vast and deep world of competitive fighting games.\n\nThe amount of skill you can gain, the setups with all the unique cast of characters, the way the game works allowing for freestyle ways of playing... this itself would last anybody years for 60$.\n\nEdit: 3/28/16 - The game also now have a very nice demo mode where they will guide you through the entire system of the game, along with trials to better understand each character.","March 28","true","69.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

Turns out even on the logo screen the game is sinced to an online heartbeat. After killing the tether the network connection dropped, cleared the error, and game functioned just fine offline.\n\nAlso simultaneous opposing directions do not properly cancel like in every other fighting game I've played. SFIV always give priority to the direction towards your opponent, most other fighting games give priority to whatever key was pressed last (e.g. if you press right then press left the game recognizes left even if right is still pressed and vice-versa). Street Fighter 5 ALWAYS prioritizes right over left regardless of where your opponent is, regardless of what was pressed first. This makes charge characters annoying to play to say the least.","February 19","false","4.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

I played fighting games since the 90's and my first game was Street Fighter II. I love fighting games; I love their competative nature, and the deeper the fighting game the better. My favorite fighting game was Street Fighter III 3rd Strike, and KoF XIII.\n\nWith that being said SFV is one of the best fighting games I have ever played. Out of the new fighting games that just came out it is IMO the best one. Yes' SFV is lacking in content such as arcade mode, a decent story mode, and challenges; but if you want to play a good challenging game with great online I highly recommend this game. Capcom well release a free DLC for the modes that the game is lacking such as the challenge mode.\n\nThe game, on the surface looks simple, but on the conterary it is a deep game which needs a high skill level; it is easy to get into but hard to master. The easy part is with the simplified execution, the hard part is how the game actually is played. The game is a high risk high reward game that depends on reads and pressuring your opponent. There are no safe dragon punches anymore if you have to do a move you have to commit. The game demands from you to learn fundementals and neutral game; as scrubs and mashers get punished hard. Every character playes really differently from one another and that adds to the depth of the game. The V system is unique as it adds a different prespective to the game and how it is played because it changes how the characters are played.\n\nHopefully This Review Was Helpful.

I bought the game in April 2016 after some updates and only after reading many reviews and problems it had in advance. So before you buy it, here is what you need to verify:\n\n1) Does your controller/stick has a default plug and play driver for windows 10? If no, do not buy it. It is a risk your fighting stick won't work and a 3rd part software will be needed. My fighting stick is a Hori RAP V Kai (XBOXone, Xbox360, PC) and it is plug and play on windows 10 to all games. I enabled the d-pad button and it works just fine. WARNING: this worked fine for this specific arcade stick. So you need to do a little research in the reviews pages and on the Internet to see if it works with yours.\n\n2) Are you a competitive player? Do you like training a lot to improve? If no, do not buy this game. In its current state, there is no arcade mode, i.e., no offline things to do besides training. If you want to buy this game, make sure your objective is to train, get better offline, then test it on casual matches. After you have a solid performance on casuals, you go to ranked and start climbing the ladder.\n\n\n3)  Given you have a controller/stick that works fine and you want to go multiplayer, here is the game review:\n\nThis game is AMAZING! The new system mechanics makes it easy to train and learn combos. The timing for the combos is slower than on SFIV, but the game is incredibly fast-paced. So all you need to do is set up your combos and develop your REACTIONS A LOT! This game is easy to learn but incredibly difficult to master real-time execution. I mean, you can train perfectly your combos, but if you do not have a fast-reaction time, they will be useless. I'll all about the mind game lol. Throws are incredibly difficult to tech and the punish is hard on any error. So be pacient. You'll get better.\n\nYou can play with friends offline or online on a lobby, the game has both.\n\nBest thing of the online multiplayer: CROSS-PLATAFORM! I've fought many PS4 and PC players! Really nice. The matchmaking is good enough. Sometimes you'll get lag when fighting someone outside your country, but that's it. If you do not know if there are many people playing in your country, you should do a little research on the Internet to see how's it going, because you could end up lagged in every match vs other people outside your country.\n\nYou can farm fighting money and buy new characters when they are released.\n\nThat's it for the moment.\n\n","April 29","true","80.1"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","25","47","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectpencil/recommended/310950/","perfectpencil","PerfectPencil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectpencil/","291 products in account","This game is not worth the price they ask. Its not worth the price for DLC. And it's really not worth buying until on sale unless you're a diehard fighter fan. Honestly, this is a $20 game with a $10 DLC. Unless you're a long time fan of street fighter, consider this a thumbs down review.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan like me, I'll go into why it's actually really good and (maybe) worth the money.\n\nV trigger & Super out performs the old Ultra & Super combos. Over all this is a strong balance. V trigger replaces Ultra combos as the new "revenge" move, but unlike Ultras from SF4, V trigger is more utility and life saving, rather than a second version of Supers. For some characters v trigger is a "get out of jail" ability that lets you punish an overly aggressive opponent, and for other characters it boosts your standard attacks to allow you to push back harder and come back from a loss. The downside is they are really only available when losing and still need to be timed perfectly because they can be punished very easily.\nOnline play has improved quite a bit over SF4 (but it is still below standard to typical multiplayer games, regardless this is still an improvement) and you can connect to opponents fairly fast and play quick best-of-three games. By removing games for windows live, the whole service runs smoother.\nSimilar characters have been diversified more like we had in SF3 and then some. I'll use Ryu & Ken as an example. In the older titles these guys were essentially identical with just some damage numbers moved around. Ken's kick abilities were better while Ryu's punch abilities were better. In SF4 these two characters became more alike ... similar to how we had in SF2 and over all the diversity felt really cosmetic alone. Ultras and Supers were really the main thing to pull them apart. In SF5 though we have these two with CLEAR differences. Ryu now has a standard attack nullifier while Ken has a forward sprint (which is faster than the double forward dash). Ken also sacrifices some over all damage for extreme mobility. Ryu gives up reach and mobility for hitting much harder. For characters who are almost exactly the same, in SF5 they feel the MOST different than anything we've had yet.\nAside from a few glaring balance problems (looking at you Nash), the current line up is fairly well balanced against itself. I can say this even though popular opinion says my favorite character needs a buff, so that should say a thing or two. It's hard to go into more detail on this than to just say... for the most part it feels fair when you win or lose.\nThe new art style is also a big win for me. I really didn't care for the black ink look in SF4 and really REALLY missed the slick (high quality) anime from SF3. In SF5 they didn't let go of the "ink" thing, but they'd added more color. It looks and feels better as watercolor paint now and less like an "ancient japanese samurai scroll" or whatnot. It's asthetic, but it makes a difference I think\nOk, if you've gotten this far and you're thinking of maybe buying, I do need to lay out the really horrible ♥♥♥♥ just so you know what you're getting into. Lets be honest: This game is an unfinished product being sold as a complete one. Here is why...\n\nThere is no arcade mode. This is as basic and core to this title as health bars. It existed in Street Fighter 1 in 1987. There is NO reason for it not to exist now. It's lazy and Capcom should be ashamed. The only way you can fight against a new hero now is a pathetic story mode or vs another player who will whoop you hard. it's frustrating. Arcade mode served one HUGE purpose and that was to teach you the game so you'd be ready for a vs match. It's pathetic it doesn't exist at this point. The game has been out for 2 months and...\nThere is almost no one playing the damn thing. If I load up rocket league I get into a game within 20seconds or less. I can wait up to 5 minutes for a match in SF5. The only way to speed this up is to include higher ping players. If I want to play a slideshow fight vs someone from China I can expect to be in game in a 10 seconds and be frustrated beyond repair at the 11th second. There are no players because it is an overproced and unfinished product. It's lazy and lame.\nThe in-game currency (fight money) is extremely slow to earn and forces you to buy DLC if you want to unlock new characters. If you lose a match you earn ZERO fight money and if you win you earn 50. It costs 100,000 to unlike Guile, for example. That is extremely bad and/or predatory by design.\nExtras like alternative costumes barely exist right now. Alternative COLORS are also barely existent. Doing a color swap on a texture is just a few lines of code. Really, you should be able to buy an infinite array or colors but instead you get vomit yellow with snot green instead of the standard colors. Come on.\nThe current line up is EXCEPTIONALLY small. It seems Capcom wants to cash in on ever single aspect of their game on top of pricing it at 60 USD. Once all is said and done you'll probably pay 200+ to get "the whole thing" and that's just extremely bad business planning. Better to make the product Free to Play with this small array of fighters and then let us buy new ones at the current price. That would be fair AND it would mean more people would actually be playing.\nIn conclusion...Look... Street Fighter is a childhood love affair for me like Sonic the hedgehog. I spent over 400USD on SF3 at the arcades, and the main reason I did so was because of the arcade mode and playing my friends. One of my best friends and I play this a lot and I even went as far as to buy a 300USD arcade stick to play. I'm a dedicated fan. I'm a frustrated one, but still a dedicated one. For me the time I spend with my buddy playing this on his PS4 when I'm at his place or on my PC when he's here is pretty much the only reason I bought this. We both decided that Capcom vs Tekken was dumb and didn't bother. That game got trash reviews too, but what it came down to for me was the experience I would have with my friend sitting next to me. This game is stupidly priced but we have fun playing it together. The ♥♥♥♥ part is our favorite characters (Akuma & Sagat) aren't even in the line up and who knows if/when they will be added. Anyhow..\n\nThis all comes down to how much you already love street fighter. If you're the kind of guy to already have an arcade stick or play with friends then lets not kid ourselves... you're already going to buy this, you're just not happy about it. For LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE: Don't buy it. Go buy Skullgirls and play something where you can tell the Devs have TRUE PASSION for their creation. SF5 was not created out of love, it was created for executives and stock holders. That's what it comes down to.","May 4","true","14.0"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","25","47","0","2"

This paired with RANDOM end-of-round bonuses (including health recovery) and no continues makes this an extremely tedious, boring and difficult waste of time.

Inevitably, I'll be changing this to a positive review when it reaches its full potential.\n\nI initially wrote a favorable review of this game.  I was willing to overlook its shortcomings (the threadbare single player experience, the launch week server issues, and the toothless lip service paid to casual inclusiveness) because I felt that the gameplay and art direction were amazing, and I've always had a soft spot for Street Fighter.\n\nThen I started playing in the online cesspool.  It is a devil's playground of rage quitters and Alt-Tabbers.  It is the opposite of fun.  Even in casual matches, people will inexplicably disconnect before an impending loss.  The fact that Capcom went live with what is supposed to be THE flagship online competitive fighting game platform with no plan in place for rage quitting -a common practice now for a decade- is inexcusable.\n\nI also tried my hand at Hard Survival mode, which if you don't know, is the only viable single player mode that you have available to you.  Question: What is the most excruciating RPG grind fest that you've ever played?  Whatever it is, it's better than this.  At least in whatever RPG that you're thinking of you're rewarded in some small way for your efforts over time.  Not so with Street Fighter V Survival Mode.  After spending nearly an hour working your way through 49 opponents, which will range in difficulty from laughable time-waster to all-seeing input reader, you will walk away with nothing if you fail to defeat the final opponent.  I'm not sure if these instances are more or less discouraging than a rage quitter disconnecting on you, but it begins to feel like the entire structure of Street Fighter V is designed to punish instead of reward.\n\nThis is all in line with Capcom's time-honored disparity between what it says and what it does.  C̶a̶p̶c̶o̶m̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶s̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶r̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶a̶ ̶n̶e̶w̶ ̶c̶a̶s̶u̶a̶l̶ ̶f̶a̶n̶b̶a̶s̶e̶ ̶b̶y̶ ̶c̶r̶e̶a̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶r̶e̶h̶e̶n̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶u̶t̶o̶r̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶e̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶d̶e̶l̶i̶v̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶t̶u̶t̶o̶r̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶e̶f̶f̶e̶c̶t̶i̶v̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶t̶e̶a̶c̶h̶e̶s̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶w̶a̶l̶k̶,̶ ̶j̶u̶m̶p̶,̶ ̶b̶l̶o̶c̶k̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶t̶t̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶(̶i̶g̶n̶o̶r̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶c̶r̶u̶c̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶s̶y̶s̶t̶e̶m̶s̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶w̶a̶k̶e̶-̶u̶p̶,̶ ̶c̶r̶u̶s̶h̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶n̶t̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶V̶-̶r̶e̶v̶e̶r̶s̶a̶l̶,̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶f̶e̶w̶)̶.̶ Capcom censors certain female character animations because it doesn't want to make (presumably female) players uncomfortable, and then gives two of its characters alternative costumes wherein their breasts are hanging out of the bottom of their outfit instead of the top, one of whom might as well have come out of a Dead or Alive game.  Capcom says it wants to compete with, and possibly even eclipse, the detailed single player content present in rival fighting franchises (Mortal Kombat X is inferred), and then delivers poorly illustrated, poorly written, ultra-easy three-fight story modes for each of its characters, with a larger but probably equally disappointing narrative mode coming this summer.\n\nTo elaborate on that last point for a moment, if I were to turn on MKX right now and start a single player fight versus the computer (which I cannot currently do in any sort of meaningful way in SFV), I would be treated before the match to fully animated, engaging dialog between my character and my opponent, unique to whatever character combination is currently fighting.  I could then go into a special mode wherein I explore, in first person adventure style, a large gamespace solely for the purpose of unlocking and viewing extras with my accrued fight currency.  These extras range from additional costumes, to extra gameplay finishers, to concept art, most of it fully annotated by the developers.  Now I'm not a Mortal Kombat guy, but they have set the bar for single player content and attention to detail, and Street Fighter V is so far removed that I doubt that its development team can even realistically SEE that bar.  They can't even get their character models to stop clipping on the character select screen (̶l̶e̶t̶ ̶a̶l̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶f̶i̶x̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶r̶e̶a̶s̶t̶ ̶j̶i̶g̶g̶l̶e̶ ̶w̶e̶i̶r̶d̶n̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶P̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶ ̶2̶ ̶s̶i̶d̶e̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶'̶s̶ ̶b̶e̶e̶n̶ ̶p̶r̶e̶s̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶s̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶f̶i̶r̶s̶t̶ ̶B̶e̶t̶a̶)̶\n\nIn all, I can no longer recommend this game to a casual player. I've been playing fighting games since Street Fighter 1 on my Commodore 64.  This is the best -and worst- that Street Fighter has ever been.  The game's one redeeming quality, its gameplay, is marred by a toxic online competitive scene and infuriating single player AI.  You might have some fun, but it won't counterbalance the frustration and disappointment.  You can have more fun for 60 dollars elsewhere.","February 26","false","171.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its a completely different game that doesnt require a learning curve like SFIV. Graphics are the best that ive seen in a SF game from Capcom and the changes they made are pretty understandable. But when comparing this Episode 5 version to the last hands down SFIV is still my cup of tea. The game favors those who want to get in the game and play fast and learn things quickly its just not as satisfying and rewarding as I felt in SFIV. Its still a brand new game but Id hold out on spending that 60 bucks and just stick with SFIV until they add or balance the game. But this series WILL Never replace SFIV in my opinion.

Capcom will support this game for at least 5 years as well.\nI will edit this review after the update which will come in march ( including Proper Story mode , challanges , shop etc. ) and the cinematic story mode will be released as free DLC in June, 2016.\nOf some aspects, I compared this game with "SF III" and "SF IV"   Here's Honest Review About This Game :\nPros :    It's Street Fighter Fellas ! ( One of the biggest Fighting Game Series )\nModels are more realistic, but the animations are slower than SF : IV . ( NOTE : It's made by U4 )\nRevenge Gauge and Super Art are now called The Critical Art ( CA ) which is a new system with interesting Animation\nCross-Platform : You can play it with your friends on PS4\n16 Fighters , and there are 6 More coming in a year with the CapCom plan ( You can buy them with 100k FightMoney (FM) *Per Fighter , Or In-Game currency ( Zenny ) / Or Buy Season Pass)\nThere's No , ULTRA , ARCADE , or something like this ... you buy it, then you'll have it until the Next Street Fighter (6 ? ) comes\nVoice And Music and themes are great , the Japanese voice actors are way more better than the English ones (in my opinion)\nReplay ! : you can see pepole's repalys and key display and you can fast forward and rewind the moving frame to analyze the action or combo ( if you save the replay )\nRecording playback in traning mode is very impressive   Cons :\nNOTE : Before The March's Update    No  Proper Story Line\nNo Challange Mode\nNo Vs. CPU\nNo Shop\n*** These four items will be fixed by march's update ( i hope so, i don't consider them as drawbacks, but since i'm writing my HONEST review, I actually do!!! )\nNetCode  : So about the netcode ... I heard so many complaints, as i was reading about the netcode ... this game actually has a very good netcode, but maybe the problem is matchmaking! Because if you have a lagging problem or a dropframe rate or a rollback, the matchmaking really depends on these things!\nNOTE : FYI, this game dosen't have any offical server. The online mode will only connect you to each other, so it depends on you and your enemy's network status :\n1 . You or your enemy have a pocket loss while connecting to each other * Some protocols or the DNS may be blocked or something\n2 . You or your enemy have Potato PC. So when he has a drop frame rate, you can feel it on your game play and your enemy or your fighter ... it's GGPO's doing actually\nI have got a single tip for those who want to search; try searching for people between 2 - 5 ( for some people, it takes ages to find a match ) so do this and you will be better .. But actually , numbers don't matter ... They're not correct as they said! Like you will go to a game with 5 connection bars, but unfortunately you have a massive lag or rollback or etc ... , so it depends on the stability of the connection ... sometimes I have like 200 - 300 pings with some guy in The United States ( consider me as a European ) but there's no serious lag ... so we can play\nNo Direct Joystick , Stick Support ( In-Game Funcation )\nBattle lounge problems (Sometimes it 's got problems with joining or finding , .... )\nNo Online Traning ( I want to have some practice for an unlimited time with my friend, like coaching )\nWe really need something like friends list , not a just "add to favorites"\nwhen you go to the favorites section, you see so many people online in the menu or at the CFN ( Capcom Fighters Network )  when they are actually offline , but you will see them online ... so it's wrong. I personally see tons of people online when they're not!\nThe invation message must be something like a pop-up box , intsead of the "Go to your message log". It's so much easier.NOTE : I can't say anything about the story, because now we don't have any story! ( we have 3/4 mission prolouge )\n\n* The features which you can fell free to list as pros or cons :    No Parry ( Except that Ryu And Zangief Have 360 Degree parry ( not better than ryu )\nIn-Game Currency ( Zenny ) For those who don't like having to spend Real Money in the game\nThat'll be all for the "So So Features" for now. I'll update them soon.   ** This part is good for who wants to know about community in this game\nOthers will perfect you sometimes\nYou will get stressed sometimes and make many mistakes\nThere's no voice chat and actually no text chat either ( it's normal in fighting games )\nIf you want to play with someone, try to play friendly. But there's no taking it easy or something! People will always ( not lame people! ) try to hit you and punish you in the right time!\nTry finding someone friendly, at least you guys are friends ... ( some people hit you and they blame you .. don't play with them ... maybe you can't beat them today but if you try, you will beat them tomorrow )\nNOTE : I once got beaten by a guy like 10 - 1 , but the day after, i defeated him like 16- 6 ( with 2 perfect ) ... so that's the point I'm trying to make.\nDon't get mad , find your problem and work on it ...    *** Since it's a fighting game, I add this part called " Tips " ... Some extra things    Youtube ! : Don't forget to check there for understanding the game ( frame traps , link , combo , CC ( Crush Counter ) , Hitconfirm and ... ) there are a lot of helpful videos there ... just search for it\nBe patient ( i mean it ... seriously ) This game needs patience and focus to get good at\nDon't spam the buttons ( I've done it about a million times, but I still have problems with it sometimes )\nBlock , Punish !\nWatch your enemy, analyze his/her movements, find his/her weakness and use it against him/her !    Rating : 7/10 ( Considering the lack of contents )\nIf you can wait and not a huge fan of the fighting games , buy this game after the update ( follow the news and .. )\n\nThanks For Reading ! ❤️ ^^\nEnd .\n_____________\n\nIt's My Second Review\nI will write my review on this system\nHelp me in the comments if you see something , or have any ideas.

It's better than Alpha 3, but not quite as technical and smooth as Third Strike's fighting system. As we all know, this game is not complete and is quite expensive for an Early-Access-online only game. The Net-code is horrible and will randomly disconnect you from the server (there are no rewards in offline play). Currently, the game offers poor optimization, and story mode is currently underwhelming . This game seems rushed and I doubt it will be completely fixed by the end of the year. If you're a hardcore SF fan, this will be fun in short bursts. If you're not a hardcore fan, this won't be the SF to win you over unfortunately.

Matches are not frequent enough for my taste, but they work out fine.\n\nI'll recommend the game when the following issues are resolved:\nPS4 fight stick support is still missing (all DirectInput controllers aren't supported natively) - they've indicated they're working on this\nStill some remaining server issues - fights not being reported to the servers, disconnects, fight profile data not showing\nRage quitting is not punished - if you face someone in Ranked online mode with a huge win streak, odds are about 90% they'll disconnect before you're awarded the win if you beat them. - This is going to be implemented, but for now, be sure to record every ragequit; Capcom has indicated that they'll be retroactively punishing too\nSo if you're looking into buying this, I'd hold off for now if you want to be sure you'll get your money's worth. On the other hand, everyone is getting a head start on you in experience, and you'll face a much tougher opposition online later.\n\nAlso, be aware the not all content is in yet. The following are still missing but will be added for free:\nProper story mode - there's a 2-4 fight story mode for each character now, but it's too easy and only a prologue\nTrials/challenges - a combination of a tutorial and a showcase for what characters can do, as was in SFIV\nThe shop - a way to spend your fight money (acquired from winning pretty much any type of fight) on new characters or costumes (or by spending actual money on it)\nLobbies that support 8 people instead of the 2-player maximum it has nowSee here for a schedule of the release of those features[images.onesite.com]","February 19","false","39.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I remember walking into Scandia Family Arcade and Fun Center in 1991 and seeing the GIGANTIC Street Figther II arcades with lines dozens of teenagers deep. I've been hooked ever since and I've loved every iteration. Alpha, 3rd Strike, EX, Versus... doesn't matter, I've been in all the way.\n\nBut Street Fighter V's launch is seriously lacking features and that's a huge disappointment. It's super refined, it's gorgeous on my PC, and combat with friends can be fun, but I've had constant server issues and there is zero ability to challenge the PC/AI in a simple 2 out of 3 match. Why? What's the point of that?\n\nI'll revisit when the game feels more fleshed out, probably when the "cinematic story mode" drops in June. I can wait.

The game was supposed to launch in June but Capcom wanted to launch it in 16 February for the Capcom Tournaments and pros to learn the game earlier. That means the game is kinda like an early-access game all the features, characters, actual story and good online experience will be added in future updates for free. All the DLC can be unlocked with in-game currency and that's good. A lot of past fan favourite characters were in the game and Capcom is carring for their fans. The little story modes were made in a small period of time only for introducing the characters story for the actual story in June. Also an Arcade Mode will be added in March so what's wrong with the game? Amazing game mechanics the best out there stunning graphics survival mode actual story mode like MKX's in June 22 characters in September challenges trials arcade mode and shop in March. Now they just want to communicate with fans to fix the game before it's final form and there's nothing wrong about it!

I understand, Capcom tried to bring normal (casuals) players to street fighter universe but what they displayed in street fighter 5 is absolutely unjustifiable.\n\nThere is no challenging mode or trial, that would teach you basics and advanced stuff. If you want to learn another character you need to stick to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu and training mode.\nWhat they actually did, is that you can faceroll your controller and throw amazing,super,mega combos. Just like in tekken. Or soul calibur.\nThis is just my opinion, but if you wanted to throw flashy/higher damaging combos in previous street fighter titles, you needed to spent your portion of time. Not anymore. Here comes the new call of fighter 12.\n\nThere are numerous other things, like holding neutral ground, poking, footsies etc.. It seems like nobody was thinking about these mechanics too much. Or maybe the actual character rooster is too small to see any kind of exicting stuff.\nCompated to previous titles it just seems.. boring.\n\nIm not going to mention the utterly broken, unfinished stuff like rage quitting without being penalized. Was is so hard to implement automatic lose to player who will leave in middle of the match? Just like every other multiplayer game has it?\n\nThe most funny thing on this is how capcom are trying to throw responsibilty on their playerbase. What a great idea. Street fighter 5 playerbase fall into category of infamous league of legends community.\n\nTLDR: if you are tired of Street fighter 4, then with SF5 you can have a little bit of fun. Especially at home, with some friends, just chilling and beating each other. Is it worth 60 euros? Hell, no.\n\n+ solid, fitting soundtrack (especially some stages!)\n+ Crossplay\n\n- dumbed mechanics of game\n- zero singleplayer content (survival is not game mode, its a time consuming trap for innocent players)\n- Capcom being Capcom\n- everything else\n","March 1","false","16.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

All is well in that regard, however SFV still has a ways to go in fixing the outstanding issues.\n\nI would like to review the merits of the combat, but performance of the online components must stabilize first.\nStay Tuned.\n\n**I want to love this game, but capcom currently makes it [Difficult]\nI own every version of street fighter, sometimes the same version multiple times on multiple formats.\n**[Capcom is steadily fixing the issues]\nI fkn love SF overall, StreetFighter is probably my favorite game OF ALL TIME...but this version, SFV, is still struggling to work, as of feb 25th 2k16.\n\nPros:\n-My xbox360 madcatz arcade fightstick t.e. works with no issues.\n-The game is gorgeous.\n-Music and sound are also fantastic.\n-Flawless performance on max settings with my mid range pc. (i5 g2020 2,9ghz. 8gb, 1920x1080 60hz GTX 770)\n-Gameplay seems really fun.\n**-I actually like the story (prologue) mode, its the most exposition yet in a SF game; you get a solid glimpse into their backstory, its goofy but quite good.  It appears to lead in to the announced June Story Update, which is cool.\n**-[Fight request now works]\n**-[I can now add my friend through CFN and play 1v1, its fixed!]\n\nCons:\n-$60 retail for a stealth-mode "early access" game.\n**-If i Alt-Tab when there is lag, it moves all the lag to the other player instead of splitting it between us.\n**-[a fix is being worked on] Players can quit out of a ranked match to NOT LOSE POINTS, denying you the winning points as well; this is a major issue.\n**-[Arcade mode is being considered] No Arcade mode.\n**-Threadbare Tutorial.\n-No Trials or Combo Challenge mode.\n-No mouse support.\n-No keyboard rebinding.\n-Cant change sound channels from 32 to 128 within the game.  (i shouldn't have to edit an engine.ini file)\n-Cant turn off Vsync.\n-Why have a CFN id at all?  Rocket League doesn't need one for cross platform play.\n**-[can host/join lounge but it FREQUENTLY crashes out]\n**-[Fight request frequently fails to upload results] I read this is a display error and results do update correctly if you look at the history.\n-If a Battle Lounge is "full" or "no longer exists", THEN REMOVE IT FROM current and future SEARCH RESULTS.\n-I'm stuck using the same char every fight since you must choose a 'favorite' before searching for a match.    (this applies to Fight Request, but not Lounge and Casual since it is a setting there)\n-Can't random character select.\n-Game loses framerates if you change gfx settings without exiting the program fully and rebooting; if this is required just make the game demand a reboot instead.\n-Steam in game streaming 'watch' feature has a gfx error where you see a seperate red/blue/grey version of the graphics.\n-XBOX button prompts despite being ps4/pc exclusive.\n-I can "unlock" the *ability* to spend FightMoney on costumes in story mode, yet cant actually buy them because THERE IS NO SHOP at launch.\n**-[loadtimes are better now]  Transition times still take forever though.\n-Seperate pre-order costumes on Amazon, BestBuy, GameStop and Steam, so there is no way to own them all unless you buy the game 4 times, which is silly.\n-Why isnt a character's entire movelist shown on ONE page, also why scroll down at all?   its needlessly fiddly.  Just show all the moves on one fullscreen page.\n-Why is A.I. braindead for 95% of 'survival mode', then gets difficult on the last few fights?\n-Why must i play Survival mode to unlock colors?  You must beat it on easy & normal & hard, seperately & FOR EACH COSTUME.  Shouldnt i be able to put it on "hard' difficulty, beat it, then get all the colors?   Who wants to be grinding A.I. matches?   We all bought this for 1v1 versus!   Unlocking colors is dumb anyway, just give us everything.\n-No Ibuki, Gen, Guy, C.Viper.

After you're done with the bare-bones "story" scenarios with ...just...\n\n...AWFUL AI that poses little to no challenge (You could seriously jump around like an idiot spamming HK and finish every fight to be had)... you're left with what the game is currently being sold as.\n\nA primarily online fighter until they finish the game.  Well, uhm.  I can't really say anyone else on my friendslist has this to check direct challenges out (if that's even a thing, and I doubt it since it's all server-based) but I attempted to get into a ranked fight or a casual fight for around 45 minutes, and even spent significant time going through "story" with myself flagged for an online challenge, and I gotta say, there's a severe lack of online multiplayer.  Like, a 100% lack.\n\nThen the servers tanked.  USA region.\n\nIn short, it's an online MP game with no online MP, depending on where you're at apparently.\n\nWill edit review when this gets fixed, but at the moment, there's really absolutely no reason to buy it.  At all.  :|\n\nNot sure how people are recommending it.  It's busted.  It's a busted $60 game.  If it could be played, it would undoubtedly be a recommend, but anyone recommending an online game you can't play online is being AWFUL generous, I think...\n\n\nEdit on 2/21/16: Having a blast online; after Day 2 it was much improved, though about half of my matches the past 48 hours were thrown out at conclusion (Failed to upload to server, no LP gain/loss, no Fight Money, essentially no reason to be playing ranked), but again, seems to be a work in progress, as this comes and goes.  Also had weird periods where the first fight in a match would run at about 2/3 speed, then straighten out for Round 2, but again, comes and goes...\n\nStill far too inconsistent for me to recommend yet, even on an online-only basis.

Right now it features standard online and local play, 1 extra game mode and a training room ONLY with a small-ish roster of 16 characters. Street Fighter V will feel like a traditional console release by the end of this DLC wave in August (with 6 new characters, multiple new free game modes/options,/features, new costumes and stages added, as well as many updates in March and the free story mode dropping in June). It will feel like a truly complete super full game likely sometime from April to June of 2017, with further additions on top of that.\n\nThe reason Street Fighter V was launched this way was because the gameplay was complete but the modes weren't and many dedicated Street Fighter fans like me want to play it right away. This way the developers can built the extra modes, characters and content while getting feedback on the gameplay of the game. In the long run this continuous development cycle will produce a better game than traditional "one off" developed games or DLC on and off development. But for now, the game isn't anywhere near that point.\n\nBefore I continue, I will offer a warning: If you aren't a super dedicated Street Fighter fan, don't have a console Gen 8 controller/fight stick/fight pad or newer, and don't have a remotely modern PC, don't buy this game yet. For the 1st group wait for more content, for the 2nd group wait for support to be added in March, and for the latter group, wait until you have a PC that can run this game at a consistent 60 frames per second.\n\nIf you don't fit into any of these 3 categories I said not to buy this game, I recommend you get this game.\n\n\\\n\nNow onto the 2nd controversial part, the character DLC. You can get every DLC character for 100k with an in-game currency called "fight money," which is easy to acquire (or you can pay $6 in real money). In less than 2 hours of gameplay I beat all 16 character's story mode and survival mode on easy and got roughly 250k fight money. If you play the single player modes, play online, and do the daily objectives (these haven't started yet), it is incredibly easy to earn fight gold and having enough fight money to buy characters with fight money will be easy. You will have so much fight money left over it will be crazy.\n\nDLC stages will be available similarly, although the price of them is unknown. In addition to that, there will be a plethora of costumes, roughly as many as MOBA's have in the future, that you can get. Note that a few rare costumes will only be available via real money.\n\nFor the last controversial thing is the negative reviews. Much of them came because of reasons previously stated as well as the online not working very well for the 1st 24 hours. That has been mostly fixed.\n\nFor some reason of all the Steam releases in the last year this game got blown up the hardest for this. Newsflash: Fallout 4 wouldn't run properly on people's PC's for month; CS:GO's online was flat awful for at least a month after launch. Mortal Kombat X had inconsistent frame rates, tons of bugs, crashes, and online that doesn't function. Developer support for that game was dropped entirely recently with no patches coming in half a year for the PC release... and that game has a 17% higher rating than this game for some reason.\n\nMany of the people who feel scammed by this game were simply uninformed consumers. Capcom clearly communicated this, although the amount of people who pay attention to these things is pretty small sadly. That is why I wrote this review.... to inform fellow consumers so they can make the best possible decision on whether they should get this game, or when they should get this game, as well as encourage them to do some research.\n\n(Note: If I glossed over anything important or missed something, inform me in this review)\n\nOn to the actual game review:\n\nPros:\n-The 16 characters are amazingly diverse. There's a character for everybody to enjoy, with 6 more to come in the next 7 months and more after that!\n-The gameplay is incredibly smooth. This game has the content of an early access game yet the gameplay of a fully realized and finished AAA quality title.\n-This is the best initial release of any Street Fighter ever and it isn't even close. In fact this is one of the best Street Fighter games ever.\n-The DLC policy is amazing if you understand how it works (I covered this in an above section). All future game modes and features will be free, and being able to afford the DLC characters with in-game currency is relatively easy (although you could pay real money for them still).\n-The visuals on most of the stages and the character models are incredible. Running this on max settings 1080p now is a blast. The graphical leap IV to V may not look like much from gameplay videos, but seeing it in person is night and day.\n-The net coding is brilliant. Across over 400 beta matches I had only 1 game with lag (against someone on the other side of the planet), and that wasn't even that bad. There's not a ton of buffering either like other online fighting games.\n-No random frame drops to report (sadly after MK X I have to report such things as positive instead of "100% necessary to even be recommended").\n-The gameplay issues Street Fighter IV had are long gone (such as strong attacks trading with weak ones), and the gameplay is more simplified, yet the game mechanically is deeper and feels more rewarding for good play. The gameplay balance in this manner is very good, and the game feels deeper than IV already.\n-Japanese and English voice options for the whole cast or each character individually. I'm glad this is becoming standardized in fighting games.\n-The best Street Fighter soundtractk ever. This soundtrack is much better than I anticipated it would be.\n-For Street Fighter fans this is the game you've probably been waiting for in regards to gameplay.\n\nNeutral:\n-This game is well optimized for most modern PC's (including mine), but some people are still having issues with it. Hopefully the March update fixes that.\n-Character story mode is basically a visual novel teaser for what's to come. The gameplay in it isn't really gameplay. Sort of a trade-off there.\n-If you don't play the game much, unlocking the fight money to get DLC characters may take a while in a year or so.\n-The training mode and tutorial are well put together, but lack features. The training mode lacks some features for practicing specific techniques and moves, and the tutorial while covering most things for beginners missing a few things here and there.\n-I like the pre-game and post-game character dialogue as well as the voice actors in both languages, but I wish there were more lines for every character.\n-Unlocking alternate colors is locked to Survival Mode. While I enjoy Survival Mode, I'm not a huge fan of that.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of support for many pre-8th Gen Gaming controllers/fightpads/fight sticks. This will likely largely be fixed in the March patch, but for now it is a bit of a letdown for many gamers using older controllers.\n-The graphics of some of the background characters in stages are somewhat disappointing. Some of the background characters move at 60 fps, most at 30, and a few at around 15. Some of the background details are also pretty low res. This will be upgraded, but for now it is sort of disappointing to see on a few stages.\n-Right now it only supports lobbies of 2; it will be 8 in March but right now it isn't suited for rotation play.\n-Have to unlock color variants in Survival Mode seperately for alternate outfits. This is an unneeded grind.\n-Match load times can take up to 15-20 seconds. If you got an SSD, store this game on that to eliminate this con.\n-Not a game recommended for newer Street Fighter fans right now or people trying to get into the series. You'd probably would enjoy Ultra Street Fighter IV right now.","February 17","true","23.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","1"

Like several people have mentioned here it actually does feel like an early access title. Sometimes even worse, considering that most early access titles are actually PLAYABLE. I've been unable to play more than 5 matches at most since the game's launch and even those were after I got tired of waiting in a queue for almost an hour and making my own lobby. Factor in the constant disconnects and errors regarding sending data to their server, and you've got your standard utterly broken-at-launch online title right here. Yes, I've noticed many people have had way more luck than me with getting matches, but the fact of the matter is MANY have not (feel free to check out any popular/common gaming forums to get a better feel of the current situation).\n\nBesides the broken online play (which is BOUND to get fixed eventually... I hope...), you all should be fully aware that SFV is the most barebones fighting game I've had the displeasure of playing when it comes to offline modes. You can't even do standard VS. matches with a CPU, which has been the most common and basic feature in a fighting game since the very inception of its genre. Then there is an utterly useless training mode and laughably-short and cringe-inducing 5 minute-long "story" battles for each character, which can provide a small distraction before they are never used again. The survival mode is the only offline single player component worth a notice, but be warned that it kicks you out if you get disconnected from the server, which is very often. Yes, you lose single player progress for disconnecting from the server.\n\nLong story short, this game is not worth buying at all in it's current state, not even for die-hard fans of the franchise, UNLESS you have people on hand to do local matches with. Let's see if patches and the many future scheduled updates fix this mess. Till then, shame on you Capcom.","February 17","false","8.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

Even some early access games are in much better shape than this.\n\nThere is no Arcade mode or even versus CPU mode, which is something that has been present in games since the days of Street Fighter I.\n\nYou're thrown into the tutorial without the ability to select settings on PC and said tutorial mode is also lacking. and speaking of settings, no option to connect my PS4 fightstick!? The game only launched on PC and PS4. Why the hell does it only support Xbox controllers and sticks? You had one job Capcom!\n\nThe use of V-Skills/Triggers is not explained properly at all. Not everyone is going to play with Ryu, Capcom.\n\nThe "Story" mode is laughably short, with no option to select difficulty. The voice acting is cringeworthy, the presentation is horrendous and replayability is ZERO.\n\nThe training mode is also lacking. There is no explanation on what a specific characters V-Skill or V Trigger does, even in the command lists.\n\nOnly Survival mode is worth playing as of now. But you lose all progress if god forbid Capcom servers are on the fritz, which they are more often than not.\n\nOh, and you also lose single player progress for disconnecting from the server. Perfect!\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nUnless you have friends on hand to play with, tough $hit! Battle lounges are finnicky at best and as for finding a Ranked or Casual match, I wouldn't know! I haven't been able to play a single one of those since launch.\n\nI've had the game searching for a match since before I started writing this review, which was over an hour ago.\n\nIn that time, I've read three chapters of a book, read through my entire Feedly feed, had food delivered, ate that and then took a dump. Oh, and finished writing this review I guess. Weirdly productive, I know!\n\nBut as I sit here writing this, the game is still "Waiting for your opponent..."\n\nI have not been able to play a single ranked match since launch.\n\nAnd yet, Capcom says: "Matchmaking is now working as intended and users should be able to find online matches without much of a wait in both Ranked and Casual mode."\n\nCapcom, matchmaking is not fixed. It is the exact opposite of that and then some. As of right now, the game is just a match-finding simulator, and not a very good one either.\n\nShame on you Capcom for exploiting our love of Street Fighter and giving us this piece of garbage.\n\nFor the love of all that is holy, please fix this pile of horse crap!\n\nEdit:\n\nI should explain that, technically, the game is amazing. I've had the pleasure of playing matches against friends in versus mode and battle lounges. The graphics are great and controls are amazing.\n\nIt's a shame though that I cannot level up or gain any LP because the match making component is broken.\n\nThe 14 hours I have on record playing this are from leaving this on decicated search for a match overnight. and yet, it did not find a single match! Match making remains broken 5 days after launch.\n\nI have tweeted several times to SFVServer, emailed capcom and also posted on their upates on the capcom-unity forum.

Although it is inexcusable for a fighting game to release with major standard features missing and a host of launch issues, I think the number of negative reviews don't do it justice. The fighting mechanics are brilliant - hard-hitting, "meaty, easy to pick up and play, good selection of characters (i.e. they're different and not "too much choice"). It is much less technical in terms of execution and combos than (Ultra) Street Fighter IV, making it more accessible. The characters feel refined, and have smaller move lists. There seems to be less emphasis on execution and combos than on fundamentals, which is a good idea but I personally find long combos to be more fun. However, the game has more juggling than Street Fighter IV despite the removal of Focus Attacks, which makes it more accessible. I can definitely commend Capcom for this.\n\nMy primary concern was initially with performance. The game is locked at 60 FPS - i.e. the game logic is tied to the framerate because that's how fighting games work. But if you can't get 60 it goes into slow-motion at 30 FPS usually. My "PC" (Alienware Alpha - i5-4590T, custom GTX 860M, 8GB RAM, v300 SSD) can run the game fine on Medium-High settings at 60 FPS. I also haven't encountered any server connection issues that plagued the beta and its release.\n\nThe online is generally solid and the game plays really well overall. There have been some more comprehensive tutorials added in the "Challenges", and even tutorials for each character. There are also 10 trials for each character, but as I said the execution barrier in this game is non-existent compared to SF4 series so they're significantly easier. The major downside to this game is perhaps the Survival mode, which has 4 difficulties which require you to fight through 10, 30, 50 and 100 AI fights respectively; with the difficulty increasing as the rounds go up. This is an extremely frustrating mode and is how you unlock some colours and additional fight money, and is done on a per character AND per-costume basis. The AI is ridiculously cheap on Hard and Extreme, and even on Normal in the last few rounds. It is time-consuming, boring and grindy and in desperate need of updating. Unfortunately, as it stands, it is the only substantial piece of single-player content besides the short character stories.\n\nI definitely trust Capcom and they have been releasing updates every week. More content will be added in the future for free - much of which can be purchased with in-game fight money. And the content that's here isn't bad at all. Sure, it needs CPU versus and a more comprehensive story mode, but overall it's good. It is a multiplayer focused game as you'd expect, and it has cross-platform play with PS4 so it's easier to find matches, which is definitely commendable. The downside to this game really comes down to content and some optimisation issues. In its current state however it's passable, but not for £45. I picked it up for £25 and don't regret it.","March 5","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But after all that time, rage quitting still goes unpunished. Of my last five games, I lost three, and of the two that I won, the other player quit.

As it stands this game is very much incomplete with basic fighting game features with promises to fix things next month in a content patch.  What we have at launch is a story mode which is embarassingly easy and feels tacked on in the last minute if you see the content of the story and the laughable quality of the artwork. Seeing as how we're keen on giving Capcom a free pass on the quality of their single player story mode that leaves the online multiplayer and local multiplayer. I don't have any real experience with local multiplayer yet but in regards to the online mode the netcode is worse than USF4's which is to be expected considering it is a cross platform game but that alone doesn't excuse Capcom considering they've had a beta for six months. While It's commendable that the dev team has focused a lot of attention to balancing the game it's absolutely deplorable how they treated the rest of the game.\n\nWith all that said, unless you're playing local vs. mode or if you have a group of friends that will play with you you should consider waiting until March when the patch arrives with much needed online matchmaking features, more single player content, and a plethora of bug fixes which should have been fixed during the beta.\n\nThe foundation for a good game is there but I can't in good conscience recommend SF5 to a new player unless they already have people diving in with them until all these issues are addressed. When that day happens I will be happy to change this review but until then, it's just a shoddy rush job.","February 16","false","16.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The characters, the music and the world Capcom had built all those years ago at arcades captured my attention and hasn't let go. It's always been fun finding out how best to utilize your character and kick the butts of Ken players around the world.\n\nOn a serious note, I'm put off by the business model of Street Fighter 5 and how Capcom handled its launch. It's a 60$ retail game with microtransations on the way next month. That may not seem bad as currently there are 2 DLC characters available for free, sounds good right? Well in June Alex and Guile will be gated off by a paywall along with 4 other characters for an as of yet undetermined price. Now, you could acquire these characters with in game money but that requires you to spend hours grinding through survival mode which is always a blast /s. If Street Fighter 5 was free to play I could understand the decision to hold characters for ransom. But it costs SIXTY FREAKIN' DOLLARS to play this game!!\n\nI'm frustrated because I want to love SF5, but this experience leaves me disappointed and cautious of purchasing another Capcom product. Even when the TURBO DELUXE HYPER ULTRA ARCADE CAMMYS SWIMSUIT EDITION comes out I will stay away from this product.

Oh. Well. Um....\n\nAll joking aside, I'd have issues recommending this to someone like myself, the casual player. (read: scrub that needs to git gud lolz)\n\nThe single player content is severly lacking at the moment, with a basic arcade mode completely missing. I do understand this is a console game, so an arcade mode shouldn't be expected. The AI is about as stable as Bobcat Goldthwait, often going from perfectly times pokes and counters to 7-10 seconds of standing there like a complete dolt doing literally nothing except waiting for you to hit them. Reminds me of MK2's AI, which is a 23 year old game that ran on a 6Mhz processor. Story mode is best described as cute; it feels like a tacked on afterthought. And survival mode relies on the current state of the AI, so it's really not difficult.\n\nThe lack of controller support is extermely frustrating to me, as I have a controller I used in SF4 that is not recognized in SF5 at all. I'm pretty sure that Windows has API's that allow you to inerface with the rest of the universe. I mean, it's just a bunch of things that turn on and off. Like a keyboard, only with less letters. I'm forced to use a wired xbox 360 controller with the analog shoulder buttons, which makes it pretty annoying. This is basic stuff really, so I'm not sure why it didn't happen.\n\nOnline play is a bit spotty right now, but mostly works. I still get occasional lag spikes, but that has been fairly consistant for me so it's likely my connection. The disappointing thing for me is the lobby games are 2 player only and about 1/2 the time I can't connect to other players' lobbys for some unknown reason. The same players continue to show up every time after a refresh of the avalable games, but it will tell me it's either not there anymore or it's full. Ranked games wait times didn't seem to bad to me. I would get into a match within a minute or so each time, so nothing too big to report there.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but all of these problems seem to sit on top of what is actually a solid game. The actual gameplay is very   good. Characters feel balanced, but more important they all feel accessable. You loose a round to someone online and you don't get mad. Instead you want to fight them again so you can figure out how to counter their game plan.\n\nI would never have considered playing Dictator in SF4; I dislike charge characters. However, with links being a great deal more relaxed from SF4 and the inclusion of non-charge moves to the character I actually enjoy playing him. And I've been a R.Mika fanboi from beta, which is a drasticly different character. It's that accessability that appeals to me. I might even try Sim at some point.\n\nIn conclusion, casual players will probably have a hard time getting into this game bacause of the slim offline play options. Which is sad, because the actual gameplay is rewading and engaging without being overwhelming. If online is your thing then this game is a treat. It's deep and rewarding. I'm going to have to go with a no on recommending it though; what you're spending your $60 on right now is an extended beta. I will change that when/if the actual full game is available.","February 24","false","109.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I'm a huge street fighter fan since 1991, and this is the first time I have the chance to play this series on launch.

So, for as long as capcom refuses to even acknowledge these problems, I can't recommend this game for the PC, no matter how much content they may add in the future.","February 22","false","137.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The actual play is very good, with enough changes to make it feel considerably different from IV. I had long since before accepted that Capcom was mostly out of ideas, hence the art style looks like IV (but more polished), and much of the music is (again) remixes of SF2. That's fine. What I can't forgive is the terrible online play. IF you manage to connect, you'll be annoyed by the experience of trying to find a lobby or match. Which you have to do, because for some asinine reason they decided to omit an Arcade Mode for you to play in while leaving Fight Request On. Your only one-player options are Story and Survival Modes, both of which seemingly have no real difficulty settings for AI skill. Which means your one-player experience is beating up on a very, very weak and not-fun CPU. As a further insult, on the many cases where it fails to connect, the game reminds you that you can't get Experience or Fight Money in offline mode, and hence, nothing you do will mean anything. You would think that after the super-extensive Beta testing of this game, they might have all this figured out by launch, but you'd be wrong. Game developers making sure the game they've already been paid for is functional at launch is Old Economy thinking. That said, the game is pretty, and, when it works, is actually fun. The problem is this: do you want to spend 10 minutes screwing around and waiting for the server to connect every time you want 90 seconds of play? As of right now, this makes Mortal Kombat X look like a brilliant example of online play. At least MK X had a worthwhile one-player mode! Wait until it's on severe discount and they get the kinks worked out. All I got for pre-ordering was one whole costume for a character I never play.","February 16","false","2.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

One thing that is still bothersome is the netcode. The rollback netcode is an improvement since SF4 and it helps reduce input delay, but the display lag is ♥♥♥♥ing nuts. On top of the 4.5 second built-in frame delay (8 frames for PS4).\n\nI wouldn't recommend the game right now however, wait a few months when Capcom tweaks a few things and adds a few more characters. I might change my opinion by then.","May 21","false","134.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Graphically the game looks pretty good, I'd say a little better than four. However.. online is still broken. I can't play against anyone and more annoyingly my stats aren't going to be recorded until the servers stop ♥♥♥♥ing up.\n\nGameplay wise its streetfighter, it's a tad faster than I remember, but then again I haven't played four in years. However, while I like fighting games, this is a bit of a letdown coming from greats such as Blazblu and guilty gear earlier this year. No arcade mode, a really pathetic "story" mode that averages out to literally 3-4 fights with each character, and just weird omissions all around. For instance, in most fighting games you can go to versus mode and fight against an npc. Here? nope. You literally can only fight against another player. If you want to practice you have to use survival mode or the story. And really, all of this is magnified by the fact that the servers are still offline for a lot of people (including me). It sucks because the fighting is fun (using an xbox 1 controller) but AGAIN this is hampered by the fact that in 2016 Capcom didn't release a game with more controller support, so a lot of people have had to use third party programs to set their keybindings. Honestly I'm not sure about this game. If you're a fighting fan who doesn't mind no aracde mode, no real plain "versus" mode, or an actual story then pick this up I guess? I love fighting games but I'm seriously debating returning this title.","February 16","false","2.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

A lot of features weren't available during the early release which are available now. The core game is more or less there for you to enjoy. More or less every controller you can think of will work with the game, whether it's a pad or a stick. I personally use the xb1 and the dualshock 4 controllers [d-pad].\n\nCapcom will slowly release new characters with a new game model where there won't be more SFV games, but rather any additions will be tacked onto this one. That's not to say there won't be a SF-VI but until then this is the only game you'll need (no ultras).\n\nFor those familiar with the game, you will notice the new features very quickly. A big ones I like is the V-Reversal function. A mechanic that allows you to get out of frame traps, corners etc...\n\nThe graphics looks pretty good. The art-style is on the cartoony side perhaps as a reference to the original 2D sprite design of the game.\n\nFor those new to the franchise, this iteration of street fighter is a good place to start your fighting career :). Just keep in mind that to get good, you'll need a good deal of practice so until then don't feel too bad if you've lost a match.","May 17","true","101.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Do not buy this.\nDo you want a fighting game? You might want to consider reading more before buying. And please make sure to read more reviews before deciding whether to buy this! Use this as a second opinion!\n\nThis game is not feature complete. There is no real story mode; no real singleplayer. There are no lobbies (there is something called a battle lounge, but its 1 on 1). There is no challenge system and while I have not played survival, its pretty quick and lame from what I have read. All this stuff is coming in the free March update. The games mandatory tutorial does not tell you much aside from that your fists can punch, you can throw out a fireball if you are Ryu, your legs can move and kick, and you can block stuff. The tutorial, however, fails to mention more crucial things: did you know you can quick recover from a knockdown into a roll by double tapping left when you hit the ground? You can also quick rise by double tapping down. They acknowledge throw breaks, but don't tell you how to do them, which might seem like its common sense to most people but someone brand new to the series wouldn't get it. The tutorial overall is just very vague for a game that is trying to bring new blood into a niche genre.\n\nAs a fighting game, I'm enjoying this. I think right now its a solid experience if you want to hop in, train, and fight live players. I play them pretty casually, so I'm no expert at the systems present, but it does change quite a bit from the last title I spent time with (SFIV). The new Variable Gauge system creates more identity to the characters, as activating your V-Trigger will alter your moveset, giving them new properties or creating new moves entirely. Every character now has a V-Reversal while allows them to escape pressure through a knockdown as well as a V-Skill that alows characters to dissipate projectiles or other perks unique to the character. The Variable Gauge system changes a lot from the last system, but people who have played the Alpha series or Third Strike might feel right at home with it.\n\nLinks and execution in this game also feels much easier than 4, making it a breeze to get in and start practicing your bread and butters until your thumb or wrist hurts. This also means this game is very accessible to new fighting game players, so long as they take the neccessary steps to get outside information, have a proper mindset, and a willingness to learn from their mistakes.\n\nOverall, I think Street Fighter V can only get better from here on. At $60, its a very tough decision for a lot of people. If you wanted a feature complete game, you should wait until March or maybe April at the latest before jumping into the fray. If you know all this, and don't care, you have a fighting game that is very solid when the servers aren't acting funny. Here is hoping Capcom keeps it up and makes this game fantastic, because it has the potential to survive for a really long time if they play their cards right.","February 27","true","25.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

My issues is just with the online mode. For most hardcore fanes, arcade and story mode is pretty much worthless. But, if you intentionally release a beta game with the intentions of the professional scene I feel that online mode should work. For the last month of purchasing this game, I haven't been able to play online mode. It just keeps telling me to continue in offline mode. I haven't even been asked to make an id yet. Pretty lame.

There is no arcade mode, an emphasis on choosing one character and a story mode that does not challenge you or enhance the gaming experience in the slightest.\n\nHowever, once you get a taste of the game play and see how the fighting system is balanced you will feel like you are not only playing the best Street Fighter yet but an entirely new take on the game. Getting into ranked matches and graduating from rookie to bronze and so on, brings a reward of it's own as you get to fight fighters that are at the same level as you and the survival mode provides it's own brand of challenge (always starts really easy but on the hard and hell levels spikes in difficulty providing an challenge that is very addictive).\n\nYes, a few things have to be improved but this game is the most balanced first release of a street fighter series yet. Every character is actually fun to use and learning their unique styles adds to the game's scope. It is always good having your best character reserved for ranked matches but playing versus with many of the characters has provided hours of fun. I look forward to the updates but there is no game at the moment that I look forward to playing more after a hard day's work. It really is the best Street Fighter in terms of game play I have ever played and I started on champion edition on the SNES.","March 2","true","266.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

There really weren't any combos, or v-triggers, or ultimate moves- but the game was fun. It had a soul that was undeniably evident, and it oozed with the love that Capcom clearly put into making it- this explains why I would constantly have to wash my hands after handling slimy joysticks and buttons... probably had nothing to do with pizza grease. Anyways, I purchased Street Fighter 5 because of my love for the originals. Sadly, however, the game has become a money-making shell of it's former self. I don't know how one of my favorite childhood games has been twisted into such a steaming pile of perverted, shameless, hollow, forced, half-baked, sewage boy excrement. Unfortunately, I forced myself to play it for longer than 2 hours, so I could not get a refund for the worst-spent $60 of my life... besides for that one time I bought Charles Barkley's Shut Up and Jam. Only difference is- I wrote them a letter when I was around 10 years old and they actually gave me a refund.\n\nChowd- out.","May 13","false","11.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

If you are interested in single player game modes then I would suggest holding off on purchasing this game until that content arrives, but if you are mostly interested in online then you would find a lot of enjoyment with this game. With that said, there are still some things to consider.\n\nThe biggest issue in my opinion is that this game (A PC and PS4 exclusive) lacks Direct input support on PC. This means that all of your PS4 arcade sticks won't work on this version of the game, you will need a stick that has X input (360 stick) or use third party software to get your direct input stick to work. Doesn't sound like a huge issue, but I have experienced noticeable input lag with using anything but Joytokey. Maybe your system will work better with the some software over others, I don't know, there are several of these sofwares but Direct input support has been promised on launch day by a Capcom representative and they haven't mentioned it since. For all the players who like to play 2D Fighters on keyboard, there is no key mapping, so you're stuck with the default mapping.\n\nThe next issue I'd like to mention is Ragequitting. Capcom's solution to ragequitting is laughable at best. These types of games will always have ragequitters and many games have implemented very capable systems to handle the issue, but Capcom's solution has taken too long to be implemented and has the posibility of locking out people who genuinely disconnect from the servers for up to two hours.\n\nAgain, the gameplay is solid,  but if Capcom would just do a better job communicating with the community about the issues in the game and when we can expect certain things to be fixed instead of constantly giving us the silent treatment I think the game would be doing a lot better.","May 9","true","183.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

But, is that really enough to outweigh the lack of content?  I'm about 100 hours into the game right now and Figured I would write a review to explain why I think this game is great.\n\nPros:\n-Great visuals\n-Fantasic fighting mechanics (V-Gauge, V-Reversal, and V-Trigger)\n-Very solid fighting and easy to learn, hard to master. Definitely my favorite fighting game so far.\n-Monthly updates adding new characters, stages, and costumes.  (In my opinion it makes me want to play it longer)\n-Great soundtrack (the usual with capcom)\n-Cross Platform play with PS4 players (Wish more games did this)\n-You can keep up with your favorite pros with the CFN (Capcom Fight Network)\n-The new characters fit very well and don't feel out of place.\n-Great voiceovers (both english and japanese)\n-Capcom has said "No More" to the "Super" and "Ultra" variants of street fighter and will add to this game monthly.\n\nAnd now the cons:\n-Lacking in content from day one (Even though capcom warned everyone this will be the case)\n[Only up to 18 characters, 7 stages, no arcade mode option, the "story" mode which is basically a prequil to hold everyone over till the story update]\n-Only 18 current characters (even though I having less to learn at first so you aren't trying to learn 40 different matchups with your character like Ultra Street Fighter IV)\n-Every once in a while, you'll get put in a server with a 1 bar connection even though you put 5 bar only.\n-Even though capcom updated it to prevent ragequitting without punishment, I still find rage quitters in the Silver ranks.\n-This is little but the battle logs don't even work yet.  I would like to see what i'm getting hit with the most in my matchups to maximize my practice.  You will, eventually, be able to see your match-ups per character vs character and look at the numbers if you'd like.\n-Searching in matchmaking takes WAY too long.  I'm patient but jeeze.  Sometimes it takes 5 minutes or so to find a match.  Then after that, you go through long loading screens.\n-The Army of ryu players.  You know there are 17 other characters right? Why not try them out.\n-Problems with DInput not working.  So if you have a DInput fightstick, you have to do some work arounds to get it running.\n\nNow I know a lot of you out there will think that this game should be $60 dollars because of the lacking content.\nI can understand where you are coming from with that but capcom told us before launch that it was going to be this way.\nWhere capcom is missing out on the 30 character roster, they made up with it by giving a great and enjoyable game to play.  One other thing I wished they did was included a character VS Character intro.  Kind of like Mortal Kombat X.  That was next level.\n\nAnyhow,  If you are comfortable with only playing multiplayer or playing vs your friends on the couch, I would totally buy this game.\nIf you want more content, wait until July.  By then the storymode should be out and hopefully an arcade mode.  I say july since capcom likes releasing their updates on the last day of the month.\n\nall in all, I really enjoy this game.\nThey have a friendly community.\nBut beware of the rage quitters.\nHope this was helpful.\n","May 15","true","107.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomnook/recommended/310950/","tomnook","Seagal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomnook/","75 products in account","Normally I don't bother with reviews, but for Street Fighter 5 I felt like I had to. This game has launched in such a sorry state that it has to be mentioned as many times as possible.\n\nWhat Capcom is trying to sell you here is a broken, bare boned game, along with a promise of future content updates for 60$. Standard and expected modes are missing here. Arcade mode, Vs. CPU, a proper tutorial mode, etc. About 75% of the game is "coming soon".\n\nWhat's included in the package is Online mode, Local VS, Training, Survival, and Character Stories.\n\n- Character stories are mini stories that feature poor quality illustrations, and anywhere from 2-4 single round fights. The fights are the same every time, and the A.I. does little more than just stand there as a punching bag. For clearing a characters story, you unlock the ability to purchase an alternate costume for the character in the store. The store however is not available and is "coming soon". You should just automatically unlock the costumes, and it's even more insulting that you don't when most characters are fighting in the story mode wearing the alt.\n\n- Survival mode is exactly what it sounds like. You go through a number of opponents depending on difficulty. You can also spend or gamble points off your score to help you advance, which is cool. For completing the each difficulty of survival you can unlock character colors. However, It can be a frustrating experience with how unstable the game and servers are at this time. Disconnects are frequent, and if it happens you're automatically taken back to the main screen and all progress is lost.\n\nThe rest of the modes are pretty standard affair and need no explanation. It would have been nice to have a proper tutorial mode though, which is absent. They have a mini tutorial when you first start the game, which consists of just a quick explanation of what each button does and how to move your character forward, really basic things like that. It also tells you how to use v-trigger ability, but has no explanation beyond that. Nothing is explained really. It's like they expect you to know everything already, or you will search out community forums just to learn basics. Proper character tutorials and combo training, etc. needed to be included.\n\nGraphically the game is average. I'm running on max settings, and the game holds a locked 60 frames per second with no issue. The characters and effects look nice, and are animated well. The same can't be said for the stages and backgrounds however. The quality is poor and they're noticeably blurry.\n\nAnother visual issue I instantly noticed was the physics. Particularly the breast physics. Breasts jiggle on the character select screen on the 2P side only. Why the 1P side isn't working is a very noticeable eye sore. Jiggle is just as inconsistent and head scratching while fighting as well. For example, a character like Laura should have very noticeable jiggle in both of her costumes, but she has little to none. Rainbow Mika has little to none. Cammy has none. These characters should all have very noticeable jiggle with their outfits. Meanwhile, Chun-li in her cop outfit is jiggling around like crazy, when in reality it should be more subtle in that outfit. The level of jiggle should be dependant on the costume. Little details like that are important. Especially when you have costumes that draw attention to the characters breasts. I like those kinds of costumes very much, but make sure you get the breast physics on point.  Give Team Ninja's boob guy a call if you need help!\n\nThe number of control options is also a big problem. Out of box compatibility is for X-Input devices only right now, so controller and arcade stick options are extremely limited without jumping through hoops. Keyboard keybinds can't be changed either for people who enjoy that.\n\nAlso in my short time playing I've encountered a soft lock where the game went completely unresponsive, numerous disconnects, and even an error message after closing the game. This too much for < 3 hours of gametime. Seems like the game could be buggy and unstable.\n\nJust to leave on a positive note, the fighting itself is fun, as is the varied and unique 16-man roster. I personally only play as female characters in fighting games, and the girls here don't disappoint. There is a lot of sex appeal and fanservice, which I love. So big thumbs up for that, but they still need to get in touch with Team Ninja or something and get those jiggle physics on point.\n\nAs for my recommendation, I can't in good conscience recommend this game. I'd highly recommend waiting till June so all the game modes are added in, and all the other fixes have hopefully arrived, before even considering a purchase. Personally I would have requested a refund if I hadn't bought from GMG.\n\nComputer specs -\ni7 4790k\nGTX 980\n16 GB","February 16","false","8.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Capcom is trying to sell an early access game like it's complete or something. Story mode is plain nonsense. It has no content in terms of a "story". You can finish all 16 characters' story in like 30 minutes. It has no arcade mode. So you can't fight in single player. It has no player vs AI option. So you can't fight in single player again. It has only tutorial and a useless 'Survival' mode. And the game has like 16 characters. More will come with Free DLCs. LOL.\n\nCapcom says it is a competitive fighting game. Let's look into the competitive side of the game. While i have like 180 LP or something, i encounter a player with 1500 LP. Is that your understanding of competitive, Capcom? And when a higher ranked player beats the beans out of me, i must wait for another 5 minutes to find a match. 5 MINUTES. If it is your sight of competitive, oh you have a long way to go i must say. And there's one more thing i will say... Oh wait. If you want the full review, you have to wait for the update which will be released in March. Funny, right?\n\nIt is a bad game.

So far I'm incredibly pleased.  I'm pleased because I knew ahead of time that the game was going to be released in a bare bones state due to players wanting to have a hands on experience before the big tournament that's just around the corner.  That being said I knew ahead of time that the net issue was going to be a bust.   I woke up at midnight for the release knowing full well I would not be playing online.  As dozens of people I've played with over at SFIV world came piling into SFV the prediction came true.  I'm not even mad, nor should the average player.  A rush like that is what it is and any release launch with such a tremendous following that not only has a casual interest but also a vested career interest is going to have its hiccups.  Many of the hiccups were explained ahead of time by Capcom.\n\nThe lack of support for controllers, pads can be overlooked.  I've stucked with my 3rd party tool since Street Fighter IV, Yatagarasu and had no issues in V.  Capcom said that support for all of the variety of controllers and such would come.  Being forewarned about your purchase is key and the responsibility of the player.  When I saw Story Mode I was pleased but mistook it for arcade mode.  I complained and then found out that things like arcade mode and other modes would come in the near future.  That is a huge bonus for me, but I had already resigned myself to the idea of playing the game in its bare bone state up until more content came.\n\nThis game is a project alongside Capcom.  Capcom has laid out an insanely good foundation with this game even with the issues at hand.  The issues at hand will be fixed, pure and simple.  Our community has in a lot of ways forgotten the variety of amazing games that have had rocky starts and when it comes to cross platform it's even worse I can imagine.  So far given the Beta's consistent play I'm impressed.  I barely knew the difference between PS4/PC if I did at all.  The players and Capcom are going to be working together on Street Fighter V.  Play the game to earn the DLC, show your investment in the game by playing and spreading the word.  What we have is a blueprint for what could be another amazing series in the Street Fighter universe.  I sincerely hope that impatience and ignorance (Not knowing) do not ruin it for many players.  That would be stupid (Willfully ignorant).\n\nGraphically I think the game looks amazing.\n\nGameplay:  I came from Ultra, it feels right at home with solid changes that I'm getting accustomed to.  It feels a bit slower with more thought involved.  With easier combos it's a nice step toward more player diversity in strategy in my opinion.\n\nAudio:  I.. can't remember music, but the quality is good?\n\nI don't do reviews often outside of games I adore and I've been a Street Fighter fan since SFII in the arcades.  SFV has some solid gameplay in my opinion and the fact that I can work toward what I want in the game gives me a reason to keep sharpening my skills.  For many of the naysayers that are upset about the controller support, key bindings, current content I would advise other readers to disregard them in favor of knowing that those players had every opportunity to know ahead of time what they were getting for sixty dollars.  I purchased the game for 45 dollars, due to the fact that I wasn't a huge fan of paying so much for so little at one time.  Also I'm almost always broke!\n\nSo patience please and fight on!","February 16","true","89.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huffmandickings/recommended/310950/","huffmandickings","Huffman Dickings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huffmandickings/","281 products in account","MAY 31ST UPDATE-\n\nWe got Guile a month ago. I've been wondering how long they can keep squeezing characters on the very last day of every month. When a dev says "this month" and it arrives on the very last possible second, you know this developer has no integrity whatsoever.\n\nSo another character should have arrived today and.... NOPE. "June." Not even a surprise.\n\nGuile is actually a good character, but he wasn't much of a stretch in terms of design space. C'mon. It's Guile. It's a 20 year old character. They're just tracing over the older sprites and models at this point. His Critical Art is barely even animated; just a large Sonic Boom particles.\n\nGuile plays very well. Don't buy this game.\n\nMARCH UPDATE-\n\nSo we got the update on the last week of March. Two things:\n\nAlex: actually a really well designed character both visually(well sorta... that hair..) and mechanically. Can't complain except that you have to buy him from....\n\nThe Store: it's awful. First, every action you take has to be ratified by a 3/4th Congressional majority and then approved by the Capcom server which, as you can imagine, takes for ever. You can now buy colors and costumes, with NO PREVIEWS so better head to youtube while the store loads or whatever it's doing while I'm staring at the "Connecting..." screen.\n\nThey also enabled 8 player lobbies, so there's that. Notice a pattern here? Well if not, here it is: THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE AT LAUNCH. And even if they were, this is still not a 60$ product.\n\n----------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW-\n\nOver by where I live there's this poppin taco joint called Los Burritos Tapatios. They got THE BEST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tacos I can find in like a 40 mile radius. The meat? zesty. The lettuce? perfectly crunchy in a way that compliments the meat. Spicy, with some hot sauce on the side.\n\nJust an great place as a quick lunch go-to, and my lady love em too and we don't even have to think about it. Hungry? We're going to Los Burritos Tapatios.\n\nSo what if I went there one day, and ordered my 3 tacos, 1 with chicken and 2 with chorizo (Love chorizo). And paid the same price and everything. Waited the same amount of time. They call me up and give me HALF of a chorizo taco.....\n\nThe rest of the chorizo taco, as well as the 2nd one, I can pick up in a couple weeks. The chicken (I'm ambivalent on chicken, but I gotta have it: I need that extra protein/carb ratio) I can pick up sometime in June.. but no specific timetable.\n\nAlso I have to eat the taco I have before I can get the hot sauce when I come back in two weeks, otherwise I gotta pay for another taco.\n\nNow is it STILL the same amazing, tasty, delicios taco? ABSO-F***CKING-LUTELY. Actually, it's better. It's a LOT better than any taco I got from them before.... but there isn't a lot THERE, and I paid for THREE TACOS.\n\nSo would I enjoy the taco I got? Yes. Would I RECOMMEND my friends go there and get these tacos??

You see the Beta wasn't broken and allowed me to play it. Now I press start and the game tabs you out a few times till it manages to work it's way to the main menu. I mind you it's going at 10fps. Once at the main menu you try to turn the settings down and... oh wait! You're already set to 240x100 with everything at the lowest and you're now getting 60 in the menus but only 10-20 in game. You can be running 980ti in SLIx2 but that won't help you here cause you're going to lag. I have a 960m and an i7 4720MQ. This system was far more than capable of running the game at max settings 1920x1080 and achieving 60fps at the same time. Buy the game around late march if you really want it. That is the real release date.\n\nEdit 1: I loaded up my desktop and I can play the game now. It has a GPU with roughly the same power as a 960m although it is still better. And it's AMD. The problem so far seems to be Nvidia's drivers that have caused the slow down in SFV. Currently running a Radeon 7870 and an i7 5820k @3.8Ghz. Though after putting some time into the game I see that the connection is terrible to everyone. I have 6Mb/s upload and 60Mb/s download. My ping is usually 20ms near me and across the country it is 50-60ms. (1 frame is roughly 16 ms in a 60fps game). The netcode for SFV (GGPO) uses rollbacks to give a smooth or seemingly lagless environment online. The problem with that is capcom totally has it messed up. So you're Ryu and you throw an EX fireball from full screen and the other player is hit by your hadouken. Then in a fraction of a second the player teleports from in the hit stun of the fireball to in your face. Their health literally goes back up, you lose the EX bar and they do a full punish. I am not kidding... this is how online is. Now USFIV has been out for a long time and the netcode, as bad as it was, was polished to a degree so this comparrison is a little unfair. I could, in USFIV, play someone from Japan with a 3 frame lag online connection (which is really good) and it would be impeccably stable. I can't play my friend in the same room online without lag in SFV.\n\nHere is some more info.\nMy friend has dual 860ms in sli and an I7 4720MQ. Both of our laptops supprt wireless AC and so does my router. The connection over wifi from my router to either of our laptops is sub 1ms. So stop complaining that wireless creates lag. It might on wireless B but wireless N and AC are pretty safe bets on not being the cause of a bad connection. And my desktop is wired directly to my modem. I've tested it and the connection problems are not on my end and usually not on another persons end either. The game is simply laggy and nearly unplayable online. Even the best connections will have teleporting. Buy it in March if you really want the game when the problems have a good chance of being slightly better than they are now.","February 15","false","147.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","17","33","2","0"

Overall, its just not very good IMO.\n\nMost USF4 players I know transitioned just fine, they're into it and they claim they love it (tho hardly any of them are ever playing it). However this review is my opinion. Myself and a few others i know who played a lot of USf4 agree, its just kinda dull. I doubt this game will have the same following and impact that USF4 had, my guess for the FGC is, this game will be dead and replaced with another franchise afer a year or two, because SFV is just a bit flat and very unpolished.\n\nI wish i could sell you my copy..Hell, I'd trade you for a virtual farm game","April 29","false","7.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","19","37","2","0"

Getting a match with a random player (casual or ranked) is better than Street fighter IV as you can choose to automatically enter a match only if it has a high quality connection! A well needed feature that we never got for Street Fighter IV. But the wait time in between matches are really bad. They need to cut introduction segments like "Here comes a new challenger!" if that somehow slows down loading time. Or pausing the searching for games feature as soon as you move into settings in training mode. A paus feature in those menu's would be a much better design choice.\n\n* Story mode is not finished.\nYou can't set the difficulty, there's no challenge at all and only between 3-5 matches per character.  There's no animation to convey the story and the still images feel lackluster, rushed and more like a proof of conscept than something usable in a release title. There are lots of cheap fan artists around that are really good. There's no good reason not to hire those people. However, this game should not be bought for it's story mode, so it shouldn't be a deal breaker even if it's very lackluster. Also, they are going to add more to this mode later on.\n\n* Survival mode\nThis is the only mode that's worth playing singleplayer. The game mode itself is quite nice. The only bad design choice is that if you choose the hardest difficulty, you still have to fight super easy opponents the first 20-40 matches. Other than that, it's quite nice.\n\n* Some joysticks does not work and you can't remap the keys.\nMy Street Fighter Tournament Arcade Stick does not work. I had to make a workaround by remapping the button with the third party software JoyToKey.\n\n* Game crashes\nIf you experience a complete crash to windows every 15 minutes, make sure you don't have a wacom tablet connected. After it's removal it hasn't crashed once.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n* Inputs are easier that SF4\nNo more 1 frame combos.\n\n* Less comeback mechanics\nIf you played good until the end there's no risk of your opponent getting lucky with a random ultra like SF4.\n\n* It's less rewarding to do random risky moves.\nThe game overall forces you to learn footsies as it does not reward you with high risk high reward random moves.\n\nCompared to Street Fighter IV:\nIt's hard to say at this point how good it is compared to SF4. It's different. The core gameplay seems great but question is how deep the skill level is. It's defenetly not bad and it might be quite deep once we get to know the game and after a bit of tweaking from the developers.\n\nStreet Fighter V feels like an early access indy title but I guess Capcom is to proud of a company to put that tag on their game. It probably would benefit them though as people would be more willing to check back later to see if it's better than before.\n\nConclusion:\nThe core gameplay is ok. There are lots of other great fighting games on steam that give you a lot more for your money than this one, so I can't really recommend it unless you're a Street Fighter player who want's something new.","February 17","false","46.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Getting a match with a random player (casual or ranked) is better than Street fighter IV as you can choose to automatically enter a match only if it has a high quality connection! A well needed feature that we never got for Street Fighter IV. But the wait time in between matches are really bad. They need to cut introduction segments like "Here comes a new challenger!" if that somehow slows down loading time. Or pausing the searching for games feature as soon as you move into settings in training mode. A paus feature in those menu's would be a much better design choice.\n\n* Story mode is not finished.\nYou can't set the difficulty, there's no challenge at all and only between 3-5 matches per character.  There's no animation to convey the story and the still images feel lackluster, rushed and more like a proof of conscept than something usable in a release title. There are lots of cheap fan artists around that are really good. There's no good reason not to hire those people. However, this game should not be bought for it's story mode, so it shouldn't be a deal breaker even if it's very lackluster. Also, they are going to add more to this mode later on.\n\n* Survival mode\nThis is the only mode that's worth playing singleplayer. The game mode itself is quite nice. The only bad design choice is that if you choose the hardest difficulty, you still have to fight super easy opponents the first 20-40 matches. Other than that, it's quite nice.\n\n* Some joysticks does not work and you can't remap the keys.\nMy Street Fighter Tournament Arcade Stick does not work. I had to make a workaround by remapping the button with the third party software JoyToKey.\n\n* Game crashes\nIf you experience a complete crash to windows every 15 minutes, make sure you don't have a wacom tablet connected. After it's removal it hasn't crashed once.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n* Inputs are easier that SF4\nNo more 1 frame combos.\n\n* Less comeback mechanics\nIf you played good until the end there's no risk of your opponent getting lucky with a random ultra like SF4.\n\n* It's less rewarding to do random risky moves.\nThe game overall forces you to learn footsies as it does not reward you with high risk high reward random moves.\n\nCompared to Street Fighter IV:\nIt's hard to say at this point how good it is compared to SF4. It's different. The core gameplay seems great but question is how deep the skill level is. It's defenetly not bad and it might be quite deep once we get to know the game and after a bit of tweaking from the developers.\n\nStreet Fighter V feels like an early access indy title but I guess Capcom is to proud of a company to put that tag on their game. It probably would benefit them though as people would be more willing to check back later to see if it's better than before.\n\nConclusion:\nThe core gameplay is ok. There are lots of other great fighting games on steam that give you a lot more for your money than this one, so I can't really recommend it unless you're a Street Fighter player who want's something new.","February 17","false","46.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, and the framerate feels smooth.\n\nHowever, anything that requires online mode is pretty much broken right now...constant disconnects, and extremely slow server response time if you can actually stay connected.  There's also a general lack of polish.  The store and arcade mode 3-round AI fights are missing.  Configuration options are minimal. (no benchmark to make sure your settings allow a full 60 fps, no option in versus mode to hold start for pause, only player 1 can choose to return to character select in versus mode, etc.)  Training mode options are unintuitive, and the shortcuts using RS are sluggish in taking effect.  The tutorial is terrible.\n\nI'll be happy to change my rating when Capcom irons out all the wrinkles, but in its current state, it still feels like a beta.\n\nUpdate: Server performance has improved significantly.

I'm honestly regretting it right now. You can read it in a plethora of reviews here, but I'll say my piece, and like many others, will update once things have settled down.\n\nServers:\nWow. This is...just wow. I got in loads of play time, and I mean LOADS while in the beta for this game. Everything worked wonderfully, not a lot of lag regardless of platform or location. Now, on "release" I can't even log in. When I do finally log in (and stay logged in long enough to try anything) nothing works. I spent a solid ten minutes sitting waiting for it to find a ranked match. So I tried to make a private room to invite a friend...nope. Always fails. There, essentially, is no online functionality right now. None at all.\n\nSide note, no online prevents you from getting rewards in...\n\nStory Mode:\nWow. Just. Wow. This is truly a terrible thing to behold. I'm pretty sure I've seen six-year-olds draw more detailed pictures of SF characters. I mean, seriously Capcom, what the actual heck? This is the laziest excuse for a story mode I've ever seen. Titan Fall has a more fleshed out story mode in it. Why not just give us an arcade mode instead? I know, I read that story mode wouldn't come with the games "release" but still...dang.\n\nControl:\nWell, I mean, if you want to mess with Joy2Key, yeah. If you like playing on an XBone controller, sure. Controls great. For real though, why would you "release" a game that you can't even re-bind things. That's some BASIC funtionality right there. Ouch, Capcom...ouch.\n\nSound is great, I like the in-battle visuals. But, that won't make up for everything else.\n\nOverall:\nYou might note I always say "release", and that's because you are paying full price for a broken beta of a game right now. Capcom put out Street Fighter V: Early Access, and I am not okay with it. If they had even had working servers, this review would be COMPLETELY different. I could put up with a LOT of garbage if it meant beating the snot out of my friends all night. But...NOTHING works.\n\nTraining mode. Training mode works great.

I will never giving a fighting game a bad review for its poor story as if a person shows up to a fighting game looking for a engrossing story they have purchased the wrong game. The flaws in this game for me that are the deal breakers are:\n\n- Servers not working at launch (some people argue that this is to be expected this is not to be expected this game was in beta for awhile capcom had more than enough time to get it right)\n- Lack of single player content, no traditional arcade mode? I mean really how hard is that to put into a game as others have said it makes the game feel unfinished\n- 1 character constume, (2 if you count the 2nd that is locked into story mode ONLY, even after clearing story mode)\n- Two menu's on the game locked out saying "coming in March as a free update" to me that clearly means that not all of the game was ready for the Feb 16 launch but corp Capcom said LAUNCH the game, FIX it later.\n\nI will take another look at this game in March, but as of right now there is no way I could ever recommend this game to anyone in its current state.","February 16","false","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's still however, no mention of fixing the fps issues (which I "fixed" by upgrading to Windows 10...) or any other PC specific bugs, is still lacking single player content and still boasts the same f2p-like economic model (4€ for premium costumes, all released one month after release, Capcom definitely learnt something out of SFxT apparently).\nThe game is definitely in a better state than one month ago though, and is still a blast to play, but you shouldn't probably buy this at full retail price, especially if you were planning on playing it casually in single player.\n\nThe game in its current state is a massive disappointment. It is riddled with bugs and issues (it took me an hour and a half to get it "working"), and even then it suffers from frequent random framedrops despite the GPU/CPU being barely used.\nContent is abysmal, no arcade mode, no trials, no VS against AI, story mode is ridiculously short, and the artworks used are very hit or miss, sometimes looking completely amateurish. A lot of the unlockable content is also locked from the game like a free-to-play would do (costumes and characters will cost a ridiculous amount of "in-game" money), which I find baffling for a fighting game that retails at full price, and the shop is not even available until march.\nNow the gameplay itself is undeniably great, even despite the casualisation of the mechanics which I'm okay with, but the only thing the game offers is basically online VS, which doesn't even work properly as of now.\nHopefully the game will look better in a few months once it gets all of its functionalities and rid of its issues. Until then, the game is far from being worth its $60 pricetag.","February 16","false","69.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

So I was disappointed because I wanted to practice up vs the CPU. But all is not lost like people say it is. There is a well thought out Survival mode. Which normally I shy away from, but they have taken the idea and revamped it. There are health boosters, extra gauges to fill your v trigger, 2x Damage, and other boost you can choose from all in between rounds. But they come at a cost! You have to spend the points you earn playing each round which effects your overall point total in the end which is used to unlock skins and other kick-nacks. In addition to all that you can chose between 5 different levels of AI difficulty. All and all its a nice alternative to a classic story mode. I can say its refreshing.\n\nI would say this game is worth checking out right now, every relevant complaint is one that will be addressed soon, the near future. or immediately. Also, I have the recommended settings and the game runs great at 1080p.","February 16","true","79.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Its incredibly diverse cast offers toolsets for every playstyle from defensive and calculating to viciously aggressive. The game is strategically deep and deeply rewarding; a variety of modes offer offline ways for players to learn the game, and it boasts some of the best online netcode yet (only to be rivaled by GGPO-netcode games). Pay no mind to the ant-minded, short-sighted negative reviews about launch day problems - this is the world's premiere fighting game that boasts the absolute best the entire genre has to offer you, and it is going to get better and better for free for years to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/recommended/310950/","tuturuu24","Nichole24 - Brb Tropical Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/","503 products in account","Alright so I wrote this review while I had the flu and didn't really cover as much as I wanted to, so let's get down to it because this deserves a proper review.\n\nFirst off lets address what is in the game currently:\n16 fighters\n10 stages\nPrologue Story Mode\nSurvival Mode\nTraining Mode\nOffline 2 player\nRanked Matches\nCasual Matches\n2 People Battle Lobbies\nReplays\n\nWHAT IS NOT HERE BUT IS COMING:\nTrials\nArcade Mode\n8 player lobbies\nCinematic Story Mode\n\nWe have known about this far before the game dropped, yet several people bought the game and are upset about the lack of single player content currently despite the fact that Capcom did not make any effort to hide its absence, this information was circulating eventhubs, capcom unity, hadoken, shoryuken, facebook, twitter, etc.\n\nBut let's talk about the characters. There are currently 16 characters in the game with 6 more planned as DLC that will be released from March to September. Of the 16 in game, 8 are from SF2, 4 are from the Alpha series, and 4 are brand new characters. Some of the characters have seen heavy changes in both their visual design and in gameplay style, such as Nash and Dhalsim, while others have remained mostly the same such as Ryu and Zangief.\n\nIn regards to the DLC, each character will cost $6 or 100,000 fight money. Fight money is a currency you make in game by winning matches and completing various activities in the singleplayer. For point of reference, it would take close to 3, maybe 4 hours for even an amateur to beat the prologue story mode and easy survival mode with all characters. Doing this will net you close to 300,000 fight money, enough for the first 3 dlc characters. Currently the other thing we know we can spend fight money on is the story mode costumes unlocked in the store by completing prologue story mode with that character and purchased for 40,000 fight money. These can only be earned with fight money and not real life money. Premium costumes will also be coming to the store and these can be purchased only with real life money, I believe about $4.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game is ridiculously solid. You'll probably notice instantly that this is not Street Fighter 4 and you can not play it like Street Fighter 4. Whether this makes you happy or sad depends on the person. For new mechanics we have v-skill, v-trigger, and v-reversal. V-skill is a move used by pressing MP+MK and does not spend any meter. What it does varies per character but generally builds your new v-gauge. V-gauge can be used on two thngs: V-trigger and v-reversal. V-trigger expends your entire v-gauge and its effects vary per character, but generally turns the tides of battles very quickly. It is used by pressing HP+HK while your gauge is full. V-reversal uses 1 meter of the v-gauge and is use by pushing forward and 3 punches while blocking. It will generally knock the enemy away or have you perform an evasive maneuver. Either way its great for escaping pressure safely if you can't otherwise.\n\nAnother major mechanic is the inclusion of crush counters. For those familiar with Blazblue, it is similar to a fatal counter. It occurs when you counter the opponents attack with a specific normal, generally a heavy attack, from your character. The crush counters do more damage, apply more stun, build v-gauge, and leave the opponent wide open for attacks. Learning what moves do crush counters and how to combo off of them is a very important factor and leads to perhaps one of the bigger shifts between SF4 and SFV.\n\nSFV is a more defensive and punish based game. That's not to say rushdown pressure isn't important or that its useless, but it adds things to be considered. Normals in this game have so far been noticeably safer and less prone to punish on block than other games. This game seems to encourage making reads to counter your opponent ahead of time or otherwise making them whiff. There are still tons of unsafe things in this game to be sure and its all the more important to know what they are and when to use it. With how fast stun is built and the inclusion of crush counters, matches can be ended very quickly by someone who has completely downloaded their opponent.\n\nI wouldn't say this is slower than 4 at all, but it has been called simpler. And it is. SF4 had so much stuff to consider its ridiculous. This game definitely focuses on returning to the basics of street fighter and emphasing commitment to your attack and general control of the field. Mindgames and fundamentals are the focus here. A lot of people are talking about jabs, whether they are more or less useful than in 4, personally it seems its just as important, just in a different way. You can not confirm light attacks into medium into specials fadc into ultra in this game. If you jab, you jab and thats mostly it. They have horrible damage and limited combo potential. But they are fast and great for interrupting things with long start up or grabs, their original purpose.\n\nIt is far to early to speak on terms of the balance of the game, everyone has their picks for most broken, for me its Bison, but we really need to wait and see on that one. So far it seems everyone has at least some tech they have to make them viable.\n\nAs for the single player content there is not much to say. Story mode is basically 2-3 battles with whatever character you pick with dialogue, plot, and artwork between each battle (1 round and ridiculously easy, starts you out with full meter). Survival mode has Easy (10 rounds), Normal (30), Hard (50), and Hell (100). Easy nets you your character's 3rd color, normal is 4-6, and hard is 7-10. The ai is busted in survival. Its basically brain dead easy and never moves or blocks much for about the first 25 or 30 and then it suddenly spikes to Ryu doing the Evo Moment 37 daigo parry into combo into critical art and giving you random rng on health supplements. Hopefully they'll sell colors for 10,000 fight money come march or something.\n\nThe netcode is really solid when ther servers aren't down, which is more frequent than I like, but its still the first week. Follow @SFVServer on twitter for live updates on what they are working on  currently, planned maitenance, and server status.\n\nOver all this is an amazing games if you know what you're getting in for and do your research and love fighting games and multiplayer. If you're in it for singleplayer content wait until March or June, simple as that. If you're wondering why the game was released in the state it is, its because people asked Capcom in swarms to release it early in time for Evo and the Capcom Pro Tour. Capcom did this for the FGC and long time Street Fighter fans and its sad to see them receive so much flak for it, especially since they didn't hide the state of the game. Hopefully people will come around once more single player content is added. Capcom is finally listening to the fans and also letting us get dlc created after the game launched for free,  and I don't want that to change.","February 17","true","173.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","3"

I won't list them all, other reviews detail them more in-depth than I could but I will try and highlight some of them.\n\n\nExpanded Summary:\nIf you are a fighting game veteran - will go straight to the multiplayer mode and training only - then this is worth getting as released. There were several things rushed about this game but the base gameplay and training options weren't. The tiers are very tightly packed as of this writing (only standout is Zief being weak at high levels) The training mode won't teach you anything about fighting games but if you're a vet, the options are great to play around with.\n\nDO NOT GET IT RIGHT NOW if you're interested in anything else, aren't used to fighting game theory, and/or want to use a DirectInput device. While 3rd party software will let you use  a DI device, this will add in a bunch of measurable delay. Capcom has confirmed that this will be addressed so don't forget about the game because of it, you'll only be denying yourself a great experience.\n\n\nNotable things that may persist even after the planned patches, will update as needed:\n\nNetcode -\nFantastic, except for an exploit which can offload any lag to one player over another. If you're starting to win but then suddenly get some stutter on your end while they keep reacting beautifully, it might be suspect. This is mostly an issue against PC players. Does not seem to be prevelant at my current tier (Super to Ultra Bronze) but may be an issue with higher ranked people.\n\nRagequits -\nThey don't count as a loss. Once again, will be more prevelant with higher ranked players but just know that I'm not seeing a lot of it. I'd predict that this was done because of early server issues. Major issue if not fixed after the content update drops in a month.\n\nArtificial Load Delays due to Always Online -\nGame checks in with the server for every load. Some of this is unavoidable, but shouldn't be the case for something like training. Your mileage may vary but it may be an annoyance if you're used to SSD wait times.\n\n\nOverall, I'm recommending this game because of the sheer amount of personal enjoyment I've experienced and because of the quality and balance of the base gameplay.\n\nReview will be updated as necessary.","February 22","true","64.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

Not ideal, but they plan on fixing it in the future.\n\nMissing features - This was announced, and if you dont like it pretend the game comes out in March, if you preordered the game before this was announced you would have paid anyway, I like having 2 weeks to earn some FP before the stores open.\n\nArt style/Graphics - There has been footage and screenshots for ages, I dont understand peoples sudden problem with it.\n\nServer issues - Games with online features more often than not have issues on launch. This is not a problem exclusive to SFV.\n\nThe store model - It works for League of Legends and if its what they need to not release DLC or a SFVI in a years time I support it. Plus free content for playing the game, which im going to do anyway.\n\nKeyboard mapping - This sucks and from what I have seen it wasnt common knowledge before the game came out, this can be fixed through a 3rd party program and from what I have read they are going to fix this in the future.\n\nEasy AI - Go play on the ranked servers theres pleanty of people with the same issue you can take out your frustrations on.\n\nLong story short the fighting feels fantastic and what more do you want from a fighting game? Would you rather have an  early story mode that feels gross?\n\nThey gave us a little taste of whats to come and I want more, sure the game Is a little bare right now but what I have seen I love (other than the server issues which they are quite actively talking about on twitter) and this is more than enough for me to toy around on till the free March update which will probably feel like a new game.","February 16","true","52.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The netcode is a million times better than it was at launch and right now far exceeds anything the sf4 netcode was ever capable of. As has been said a thousand times before, the competitive portion of the game itself is incredibly solid. There is a very good reason why this game is shattering attendance records at tournaments and events. The game is good, period.\n\nSo.... should you buy it?\n\nIf you like street fighter already, yes. If you want to get into competitive fighting games, also yes. However, outside of those two demographs there really isn't that much reason to pay the entry fee. Unlike blizzard games, or most mobas, street fighter is missing a compelling universe. If your into fantasy, story, characters, collecting stuff, or just about anything outside of winning there really isn't much here. People might say that sf4 is better in this respect, but they are wrong. Arcade mode is really the only thing that seperates the two in terms content beyond competition, and sfv just decided to split all the arcade mode content into two (significantly less interesting) forms.\n\nSo the main weakness in street fighter v is the same weakness in the entire series. If you like street fighter you will love this game, if you don't like street fighter then this game will not change your mind: at least for now. Capcom has a reputation for long term support and multiple re-releases. So when the game is inevitably re released under a new name (as a free content update, that’s a promise the community would never forgive if broken), maybe then it will be worth a second look.","May 18","true","133.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The re-inventions to a lot of the cast has made the game really nice as everyone feels viable. The netplay (when the servers are up!) is top-notch and on a good connection feels amazing. That said, the package surrounding the game at launch feels super bare-bones and there are some really questionable decisions made with regards to earning colors, having a laughably bad story mode, X-Input only (I'm sure glad I have to use Joy2Key for a game made in 2016!!!) controller support, etc etc etc.\n\nThe one really damning thing though is that at launch the game does a TERRIBLE job at teaching new players at how to play. Fighting games are notorious for this but if you want new players there should be a robust tutorial and not require players to search Youtube for what a V-Skill is. Apparently this might be fixed in the future but first impressions are pretty important. Stuff like this spreads pretty quickly.\n\nDespite my gripes I still recommend it but really only after they've patched a lot of stuff. The base game is fantastic and I feel like it's the best SF since Third Strike. The problems can be fixed but at launch it's maybe not so great.","February 23","true","95.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tharimrattler/recommended/310950/","tharimrattler","tharimrattler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tharimrattler/","7 products in account","This game is fantastic. Capcom managed to make it rewarding to vets, while making some tweaks to make it easier for new players. Overall this is a rock solid product, and instantly one of the best fighting games out there.\n\n\nPunching and kicking people in the face has never been more satisfying. Street Fighter V feels like an expansion to the Alpha series. Alpha counter is back, powerful level 3 supers are as potent as ever, EX moves feel like Level 1 supers, big counter hit juggles and combos are a core part of the gameplay, and much of the cast got their start in Street Fighter Alpha.\n\nThe V gauge system is a welcome change and adds nice variety. This bar governs your ability to alpha counter (aka V Reversal) and V Trigger. You must choose which to use your bar for, which adds a nice layer to the game. Activating V Trigger will spend your whole bar and you cannot V Reversal. Alternatively V Reversal costs 1 chunk of V bar so you cannot activate V Trigger. Offence or Defense, it's your choice.\n\nMany things are just like you'd expect in a street fighter game. The low/overhead/throw mixup game is present, along with things like Trip Guard, Negative Edge, pianoing, frame traps, etc. However, a few key changes were made that players will need to be aware of. Super Grabs can combo. That's right, Zangief can headbutt you and hit confirm into grab super. You cannot die from block damage (except supers!), you take white recoverable damage from blocking medium or hard attacks, and alpha counters can be baited and grabbed with fast recovering attacks.\n\nCurrently you can play training mode ( which has lots of tools for creating situations you would want to reproduce), VS mode, story, survival, and a few online modes. The game has cross platform matchmaking PC to PS4 which hasn't been done before. Capcom is still making improvements on the infrastructure of the online platform, and they are being very transparent about that via @SFVServer which is great. My overall experience so far has been positive. Many online matches feel very smooth, and things are only getting better.\n\nA couple of things I'd personally like are to make ranked matches 2/3 and allow player 2 to rematch between matches. Overall those are small complaints though, and this game is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.","February 24","true","295.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Trying to do things like find where to see replays or turning off notifications was confusing at first.  It works, but it can be streamlined.  One week out connectivity issues are mostly dealth with but stat pages don't seem to work.\n\nReally, as long as you've got the patience to learn and study from your mistakes there's no reason pros and casuals alike can't enjoy this game.  The systems and techniques that pros like to use on one another are there, and for the casual player the motion inputs have been simplified and the frame windows widened.  And if you're mid-tier it just seems like the best of both worlds.\n\nI understand some are dissapointed in the amount of alternate modes / extras in the game but, in the games defense, we did know exactly what would and would not be in there before the release.  If this were SFxT or MVC3 you would be able to point to obviously shady practices but in this case Capom is selling a online-based fighter with extra content to come at a later date and has not presented it as anything more than that.  If that's not enough for someone that's ok, but it's up to the consumer to investigate what is and is not present in a potential purchase, so make sure you do that before you consider buying.","February 24","true","39.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Unfortunalety, and surprisingly for the best combat system in the series for newcomers, there's not much content that allow people to learn the game (no single player,  etc.).\n\nA lot of people have been complaning about the amount of characters... but to me, it's all about quality over quantity. Personally, there were a lot of characters I never saw being played ... and a lot of them felt the same. I think capcom made the right choice by reducing the roster of characters but making sure they all felt different.\n\nIn summary, if you enjoy fighting games, you'll enjoy this one.

coming from a mostly casual fighting game player\nI'd like to gradually get better at this game\nSo this is here to look at the game at a casual point of view\n----------------------\nStreet Fighter V, I've been pretty hyped for this game for a good while (4-6 months)\nWhen I recieved this game I was very excited to get into the fighting of the game\nAnd I can safely say the actualy FIGHTING for a FIGHTING game is good!\nIt is remarkably fun to work with\n----------------------\nThe fighting in this game is obviously fun but...\nYou are a bit limited to what you can do in the rest of the game\nDon't get me wrong, this game is still pretty great!\nBut the game lacks things other fighters usually have\nThis game is still not complete and characters are still coming out\nI really hope that in the future they will add more\nThe current modes you can fight in is:\nStory, Versus, Survival, Challenges, Training, Ranked Match, Casual Match, Battle Lounge\nhttp://static.capcom.com/unity/haunts/Menu_Challenges.png\n----------------------\nSTORY\nThe story currently is very plain and simple\nIt has drawn pictures without animation and dialogue with voice acting\nThis is also where you recieve your story mode costumes (I'll explain this later, just bear with me)\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE\nCapcom wil be releasing a full and complete story mode this June!\nOr atleast it's said to be released in June\nhttp://www.eventhubs.com/news/2016/feb/13/story-mode-street-fighter-5-will-feature-over-hour-cinematic-content-possibility-exists-future-story-expansions/\n----------------------\nVERSUS\nThere really isn't much to say here, every fighter usually has a versus with two players fighting each other on the same computer\n----------------------\nSURVIVAL\nThis is not the most liked gamemode\nSurvival is where you will choose one of 4 difficulty settings and a character to fight with\nYour 4 options are :  Easy   Normal   Hard   Extreme\nYou may choose any character in the game to fight with\nYou will have to fight enemies for a varied amount of time and recieve credits to get you temporary upgrades for the next enemy.\nWhen you complete one of these you recieve Colors for the costume you are wearing\nThis leads to extreme grinding\nEasy= 1 new color for the costume you're wearing\nMedium= 3 more colors\nHard= 3 more colors\nhttps://ryanmarkel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/STREET-FIGHTER-V_20160217234353.jpg\nThese battles are treated as any other: beat the enemy and win\nDepending on what difficulty you chose will change how many battles you will have to fight.\nEasy= 10  Medium= 30  Hard= 50  Extreme/Hell= 100\nThe upgrades you get are completely random which makes this unfair\nYou could be at level 29 and desperately need a full health recovery but instead recieve a low health recovery and lose everything!\nThese can be very time consuming and if you lose at that level 29 or level 49 or even possibly 99, you get nothing back.\nI honestly get bored of this mode rather quickly\nBut some competitive players might enjoy this\n----------------------\nCHALLENGES\nThis is in some fighting games\nThis is where the game teaches you combos for each character and currently they have 10 combos for each character you could learn through challenge mode.\n----------------------\nTRAINING\nThis is where you play as any character and...well...train!\nYou fight against a non moving CPU where you can establish your own combos, or train already known combos.\nYou are able to set up a good amount of CPU options.\nhttp://www.streetfightergod.com/#!training-mode-guide/aw4u9\n----------------------\nRANKED & CASUAL MATCHES\nRanked matches raises your LP when you win.\nYour Rank depends on how high your LP is.\nPlatinum = 7,500 LP\nUltra Gold = 6,500-7,499 LP\nSuper Gold = 5,500-6,499 LP\nGold = 4,000-5,499 LP\nUltra Silver = 3,500-3,999 LP\nSuper Silver = 3,000-3,499 LP\nSilver = 2,000-2,999 LP\nUltra Bronze = 1,500-1,999 LP\nSuper Bronze = 1,000-1,499 LP\nBronze = 500-999 LP\nRookie= 0-499 LP\nThe Higher rank you are, the more LP you lose when you...lose\nWell, it's a bit more than just that\nLets say you are a Silver rank and you got paired up with a Rookie\nIf you beat the Rookie, you get a little bit of points and the Rookie loses a little bit of LP\nIf you lose, the Rookie gains lots of more LP compared to what you would get if you won and you would lose much more LP then he would if he lost.\nCASUAL\nCasual is a less competitive mode for people who don't really wanna rank up that much\nThis mode is a bit more focused to get you fight money (I'll explain this later)\n----------------------\nBATTLE LOUNGES\nFind battle lobbies according to your search settings\nFor example\nI wanted to find someone with a high internet connection stability and on a PC\nyou can find a lobby with these settings\nyou can somewhat compare this to how the Lobbies work in Skullgirls and Guilty Gear\n----------------------\nThere are still 2 things I haven't covered\nThe Shop, Fight money and Fight Request\n----------------------\nFIGHT MONEY\nFight money is acquired from:\nStory Fights\nWinning Survival modes\nCasual Matches\nRanked Matches\n----------------------\nSHOP\nThis is where you spend your fight money\nYou can buy:\nTitles\nCostumes for characters\nColors for those Costumes\nStages\nCharacters\n----------------------\nFIGHT REQUESTS\nWhile you are playing some of the game modes, you are able to press the start button and select battle settings and wait for someone else with those settings to fight you at any time\n----------------------\nCONCLUSION\nStreet Fighter 5 feels amazing to control but few options\nThe way to unlock colors can be annoying\nNo arcade mode\nCurrently incomplete story and still characters coming out\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone willing to pay $60 for this game\nIf you are kinda not really thinking that it's not worth it yet, you're not wrong\nThe Season pass costs  $30\nIt will give you all upcoming characters and stages\nFor now, to people who are not really sure on buying it, you might be a bit dissapointed\nI'd recommend buying it (If you're not sure on buying it) when the story comes out and a bit more characters too\nOr wait until the summer sale","April

Providing a functional game for the home market was clearly secondary.  This is not a $20 'preview edition' like MGV: Ground Zeroes, this is supposed to be a full AAA release.  Capcom has said many of these things will be patched in later, but that does not change the fact that for now you are paying full price for a multiplayer beta test.

There's still however, no mention of fixing the fps issues (which I "fixed" by upgrading to Windows 10...) or any other PC specific bugs, is still lacking single player content and still boasts the same f2p-like economic model (4€ for premium costumes, all released one month after release, Capcom definitely learnt something out of SFxT apparently).\nThe game is definitely in a better state than one month ago though, and is still a blast to play, but you shouldn't probably buy this at full retail price, especially if you were planning on playing it casually in single player.\n\nThe game in its current state is a massive disappointment. It is riddled with bugs and issues (it took me an hour and a half to get it "working"), and even then it suffers from frequent random framedrops despite the GPU/CPU being barely used.\nContent is abysmal, no arcade mode, no trials, no VS against AI, story mode is ridiculously short, and the artworks used are very hit or miss, sometimes looking completely amateurish. A lot of the unlockable content is also locked from the game like a free-to-play would do (costumes and characters will cost a ridiculous amount of "in-game" money), which I find baffling for a fighting game that retails at full price, and the shop is not even available until march.\nNow the gameplay itself is undeniably great, even despite the casualisation of the mechanics which I'm okay with, but the only thing the game offers is basically online VS, which doesn't even work properly as of now.\nHopefully the game will look better in a few months once it gets all of its functionalities and rid of its issues. Until then, the game is far from being worth its $60 pricetag.","February 16","false","69.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cymen/recommended/310950/","cymen","Cymen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cymen/","192 products in account","The game currently offers terrible value.\n\nThey delayed the story mode of the game to summer and the character-stories that are in the game last 5 minutes each with ca. 3 fights and a few still-images. Seriously. There is currently no arcade mode. Or challenges. The tutorial is nothing but a button-check and explains nothing about the mechanics of the game. The movelists do not list any framedata and do not mention all properties of a move (such as armor or projectile invincibility).\n\nThe game also lacks polish. You can see glaring clipping problems with almost every model. Hair and chainst go through their own body. The game is not well optimized and you need to edit .ini files to tweak the game properly. There are no advanced graphics options. NO REBINDABLE KEYS! The game also does not support all peripherals that it should and even for PC fightsticks, you may need to install a work-around. The main menu is also a joke. There is tons of dead space and 20% of the actual menu is taken up by an image. If you are using a controller, you have to make your way around that image to get to the option you want. You cannot spontanuously decide which character to pick, you have to pick it beroe even starting the match-search.\n\nIf you can see past all of that and only care for online, the game has some terrible disconnection problems currently. The worst part of that is that you can't even waste your time with the story mode because you won't be able to earn fightmoney, the in-game currency while offline. So you lose out on currency which you could later spend on characters. Oh, the online store is also still unavailable.\n\nIF you can connect to the server, you won't be happy with the lobby system which currently only supports 2 players, making a lobby almost pointless.\n\nThe downtime between matches is way too long. When it finds a game, you will be taken through SEVERAL loading screens, from the overly long "Match Found" to black to the character select (where won't selevt your fighter, you need to do that in the menu beforehand lol) to white and THEN to the match. After the match, you have to watch an animation and then wait for every point to be added to each profile. Then black, then back to the menu. It is insane.\n\nNow, for those who keep bringing up the argument that we should ignore offline content and not expect a story from a fighting game, please check the other games of the genre released within the last few years.\nMKX may have been a disappointment in many respects but it still has tons of content. Hours of cinematic story, daily/weekly/monthly towers with unique modifiers, the crypt, arcade, challenges like Test Your Might and party modes like Test Your Luck.It even had more online modes like King of the Hill.\nGuilty Gear Xrd has an expansive tutorial which does not only explain buttons and the basics of fighting games but teaches you every mechanic in the game. It even introduces option selects in the tutorial. That game also has tons of offline content such as a story for every character AND a story-mode. It also has Trials etc.\n\nFanboys will say "But SFV will build up on this!"\nKiller Instinct which will also come to PC with crossplatform play released with little content initially BUT it didn't ask for full price, it was only 20 bucks! And that game fullfilled that promise later on with a MUCH lower investment on the consumer side.\n\n\nAt this stage of the game's lifespan, I CANNOT recommend it. At all. If offers virtually nothing for the full pricetag and it is obvious Capcop rushed this game out so it will be present for Capcom Cup.\n\nThey shipped an incomplete game and want to make you believe that we should be thankful the rest will be free. We already payed for all that content, they simply delayed it and shipped an Early Access version of the full game.","February 16","false","55.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So I was disappointed because I wanted to practice up vs the CPU. But all is not lost like people say it is. There is a well thought out Survival mode. Which normally I shy away from, but they have taken the idea and revamped it. There are health boosters, extra gauges to fill your v trigger, 2x Damage, and other boost you can choose from all in between rounds. But they come at a cost! You have to spend the points you earn playing each round which effects your overall point total in the end which is used to unlock skins and other kick-nacks. In addition to all that you can chose between 5 different levels of AI difficulty. All and all its a nice alternative to a classic story mode. I can say its refreshing.\n\nI would say this game is worth checking out right now, every relevant complaint is one that will be addressed soon, the near future. or immediately. Also, I have the recommended settings and the game runs great at 1080p.","February 16","true","79.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Its incredibly diverse cast offers toolsets for every playstyle from defensive and calculating to viciously aggressive. The game is strategically deep and deeply rewarding; a variety of modes offer offline ways for players to learn the game, and it boasts some of the best online netcode yet (only to be rivaled by GGPO-netcode games). Pay no mind to the ant-minded, short-sighted negative reviews about launch day problems - this is the world's premiere fighting game that boasts the absolute best the entire genre has to offer you, and it is going to get better and better for free for years to come. Get on the streets.","February 17","true","62.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/recommended/310950/","tuturuu24","Nichole24 - Brb Tropical Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/","503 products in account","Alright so I wrote this review while I had the flu and didn't really cover as much as I wanted to, so let's get down to it because this deserves a proper review.\n\nFirst off lets address what is in the game currently:\n16 fighters\n10 stages\nPrologue Story Mode\nSurvival Mode\nTraining Mode\nOffline 2 player\nRanked Matches\nCasual Matches\n2 People Battle Lobbies\nReplays\n\nWHAT IS NOT HERE BUT IS COMING:\nTrials\nArcade Mode\n8 player lobbies\nCinematic Story Mode\n\nWe have known about this far before the game dropped, yet several people bought the game and are upset about the lack of single player content currently despite the fact that Capcom did not make any effort to hide its absence, this information was circulating eventhubs, capcom unity, hadoken, shoryuken, facebook, twitter, etc.\n\nBut let's talk about the characters. There are currently 16 characters in the game with 6 more planned as DLC that will be released from March to September. Of the 16 in game, 8 are from SF2, 4 are from the Alpha series, and 4 are brand new characters. Some of the characters have seen heavy changes in both their visual design and in gameplay style, such as Nash and Dhalsim, while others have remained mostly the same such as Ryu and Zangief.\n\nIn regards to the DLC, each character will cost $6 or 100,000 fight money. Fight money is a currency you make in game by winning matches and completing various activities in the singleplayer. For point of reference, it would take close to 3, maybe 4 hours for even an amateur to beat the prologue story mode and easy survival mode with all characters. Doing this will net you close to 300,000 fight money, enough for the first 3 dlc characters. Currently the other thing we know we can spend fight money on is the story mode costumes unlocked in the store by completing prologue story mode with that character and purchased for 40,000 fight money. These can only be earned with fight money and not real life money. Premium costumes will also be coming to the store and these can be purchased only with real life money, I believe about $4.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game is ridiculously solid. You'll probably notice instantly that this is not Street Fighter 4 and you can not play it like Street Fighter 4. Whether this makes you happy or sad depends on the person. For new mechanics we have v-skill, v-trigger, and v-reversal. V-skill is a move used by pressing MP+MK and does not spend any meter. What it does varies per character but generally builds your new v-gauge. V-gauge can be used on two thngs: V-trigger and v-reversal. V-trigger expends your entire v-gauge and its effects vary per character, but generally turns the tides of battles very quickly. It is used by pressing HP+HK while your gauge is full. V-reversal uses 1 meter of the v-gauge and is use by pushing forward and 3 punches while blocking. It will generally knock the enemy away or have you perform an evasive maneuver. Either way its great for escaping pressure safely if you can't otherwise.\n\nAnother major mechanic is the inclusion of crush counters. For those familiar with Blazblue, it is similar to a fatal counter. It occurs when you counter the opponents attack with a specific normal, generally a heavy attack, from your character. The crush counters do more damage, apply more stun, build v-gauge, and leave the opponent wide open for attacks. Learning what moves do crush counters and how to combo off of them is a very important factor and leads to perhaps one of the bigger shifts between SF4 and SFV.\n\nSFV is a more defensive and punish based game. That's not to say rushdown pressure isn't important or that its useless, but it adds things to be considered. Normals in this game have so far been noticeably safer and less prone to punish on block than other games. This game seems to encourage making reads to counter your opponent ahead of time or otherwise making them whiff. There are still tons of unsafe things in this game to be sure and its all the more important to know what they are and when to use it. With how fast stun is built and the inclusion of crush counters, matches can be ended very quickly by someone who has completely downloaded their opponent.\n\nI wouldn't say this is slower than 4 at all, but it has been called simpler. And it is. SF4 had so much stuff to consider its ridiculous. This game definitely focuses on returning to the basics of street fighter and emphasing commitment to your attack and general control of the field. Mindgames and fundamentals are the focus here. A lot of people are talking about jabs, whether they are more or less useful than in 4, personally it seems its just as important, just in a different way. You can not confirm light attacks into medium into specials fadc into ultra in this game. If you jab, you jab and thats mostly it. They have horrible damage and limited combo potential. But they are fast and great for interrupting things with long start up or grabs, their original purpose.\n\nIt is far to early to speak on terms of the balance of the game, everyone has their picks for most broken, for me its Bison, but we really need to wait and see on that one. So far it seems everyone has at least some tech they have to make them viable.\n\nAs for the single player content there is not much to say. Story mode is basically 2-3 battles with whatever character you pick with dialogue, plot, and artwork between each battle (1 round and ridiculously easy, starts you out with full meter). Survival mode has Easy (10 rounds), Normal (30), Hard (50), and Hell (100). Easy nets you your character's 3rd color, normal is 4-6, and hard is 7-10. The ai is busted in survival. Its basically brain dead easy and never moves or blocks much for about the first 25 or 30 and then it suddenly spikes to Ryu doing the Evo Moment 37 daigo parry into combo into critical art and giving you random rng on health supplements. Hopefully they'll sell colors for 10,000 fight money come march or something.\n\nThe netcode is really solid when ther servers aren't down, which is more frequent than I like, but its still the first week. Follow @SFVServer on twitter for live updates on what they are working on  currently, planned maitenance, and server status.\n\nOver all this is an amazing games if you know what you're getting in for and do your research and love fighting games and multiplayer. If you're in it for singleplayer content wait until March or June, simple as that. If you're wondering why the game was released in the state it is, its because people asked Capcom in swarms to release it early in time for Evo and the Capcom Pro Tour. Capcom did this for the FGC and long time Street Fighter fans and its sad to see them receive so much flak for it, especially since they didn't hide the state of the game. Hopefully people will come around once more single player content is added. Capcom is finally listening to the fans and also letting us get dlc created after the game launched for free,  and I don't want that to change.","February 17","true","173.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","3"

There is really not much here to attract the casual player or one that is not interested in simply just playing matches over and over online.\n\nMost fighting game enthusiasts would take a new game 2 or 3 months early if they could only play simple online ranked matchmaking with the promise of fleshing out more content for a richer experience in the coming year, as long as they fulfill that promise and add things of actual substance i can recommend this game, or I'd have to be forced to change my review to negative as even though I'm completely in love with the system mechanics and flow of SFV (a much more stripped down, reminiscent of older games yet with the right modern sensibillities well worked in) the product is completely barebones at launch and will only appeal to die-hards that are content with duking it out over and over again.\n\nEven for competetive players, there aren't things like only training mode or lobby features here at launch. But with the approach to treat the game as a developing platform similliar to Killer Instinct, I can give this a TENTATIVE recommend, with the proviso they do not drop the ball as the continue to add features and content to this game.","February 18","true","115.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And if your using a 360 or One controller for some reason it contantly thinks you're pressing up on the analog stick and will just randomly start going up on the menu screen or make your character randomly start jumping(which is terrible for me because I am strictly a pad playing scrub), which has cost me some matches. It might just be that I'm using bad controllers or something, but I don't think that's the case because I tried 3 different controllers to test it. But, then again, all the controllers i used are like a year old, so I don't honestly know if it's the games fault or mine. But, other than that, I think the game is fine, challenge mode is okay, online matches are fun, but the nedcode is a bit iffy right now so just hope for good connections, plus you can look for matches while you're doing other stuff in the game like the challenge mode or trainning mode which is pretty cool and helps you when you are about to die on the challenge mode because it resets the level you're on after the match is over. The game doesn't have an arcade mode or a vs cpu mode, so that kinda sucks, but the level of entry for this game is pretty low so you can enjoy yourself playing some online matches. All in all, I recommend it for people who like fighting games online, but if you're not into that, I'd say wait until July to get it, that way you have all the offline features and you will get some new characters that aren't in the game yet.","March 7","true","158.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The re-inventions to a lot of the cast has made the game really nice as everyone feels viable. The netplay (when the servers are up!) is top-notch and on a good connection feels amazing. That said, the package surrounding the game at launch feels super bare-bones and there are some really questionable decisions made with regards to earning colors, having a laughably bad story mode, X-Input only (I'm sure glad I have to use Joy2Key for a game made in 2016!!!) controller support, etc etc etc.\n\nThe one really damning thing though is that at launch the game does a TERRIBLE job at teaching new players at how to play. Fighting games are notorious for this but if you want new players there should be a robust tutorial and not require players to search Youtube for what a V-Skill is. Apparently this might be fixed in the future but first impressions are pretty important. Stuff like this spreads pretty quickly.\n\nDespite my gripes I still recommend it but really only after they've patched a lot of stuff. The base game is fantastic and I feel like it's the best SF since Third Strike. The problems can be fixed but at launch it's maybe not so great.","February 23","true","95.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tharimrattler/recommended/310950/","tharimrattler","tharimrattler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tharimrattler/","7 products in account","This game is fantastic. Capcom managed to make it rewarding to vets, while making some tweaks to make it easier for new players. Overall this is a rock solid product, and instantly one of the best fighting games out there.\n\n\nPunching and kicking people in the face has never been more satisfying. Street Fighter V feels like an expansion to the Alpha series. Alpha counter is back, powerful level 3 supers are as potent as ever, EX moves feel like Level 1 supers, big counter hit juggles and combos are a core part of the gameplay, and much of the cast got their start in Street Fighter Alpha.\n\nThe V gauge system is a welcome change and adds nice variety. This bar governs your ability to alpha counter (aka V Reversal) and V Trigger. You must choose which to use your bar for, which adds a nice layer to the game. Activating V Trigger will spend your whole bar and you cannot V Reversal. Alternatively V Reversal costs 1 chunk of V bar so you cannot activate V Trigger. Offence or Defense, it's your choice.\n\nMany things are just like you'd expect in a street fighter game. The low/overhead/throw mixup game is present, along with things like Trip Guard, Negative Edge, pianoing, frame traps, etc. However, a few key changes were made that players will need to be aware of. Super Grabs can combo. That's right, Zangief can headbutt you and hit confirm into grab super. You cannot die from block damage (except supers!), you take white recoverable damage from blocking medium or hard attacks, and alpha counters can be baited and grabbed with fast recovering attacks.\n\nCurrently you can play training mode ( which has lots of tools for creating situations you would want to reproduce), VS mode, story, survival, and a few online modes. The game has cross platform matchmaking PC to PS4 which hasn't been done before. Capcom is still making improvements on the infrastructure of the online platform, and they are being very transparent about that via @SFVServer which is great. My overall experience so far has been positive. Many online matches feel very smooth, and things are only getting better.\n\nA couple of things I'd personally like are to make ranked matches 2/3 and allow player 2 to rematch between matches. Overall those are small complaints though, and this game is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.","February 24","true","295.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Trying to do things like find where to see replays or turning off notifications was confusing at first.  It works, but it can be streamlined.  One week out connectivity issues are mostly dealth with but stat pages don't seem to work.\n\nReally, as long as you've got the patience to learn and study from your mistakes there's no reason pros and casuals alike can't enjoy this game.  The systems and techniques that pros like to use on one another are there, and for the casual player the motion inputs have been simplified and the frame windows widened.  And if you're mid-tier it just seems like the best of both worlds.\n\nI understand some are dissapointed in the amount of alternate modes / extras in the game but, in the games defense, we did know exactly what would and would not be in there before the release.  If this were SFxT or MVC3 you would be able to point to obviously shady practices but in this case Capom is selling a online-based fighter with extra content to come at a later date and has not presented it as anything more than that.  If that's not enough for someone that's ok, but it's up to the consumer to investigate what is and is not present in a potential purchase, so make sure you do that before you consider buying.","February 24","true","39.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

coming from a mostly casual fighting game player\nI'd like to gradually get better at this game\nSo this is here to look at the game at a casual point of view\n----------------------\nStreet Fighter V, I've been pretty hyped for this game for a good while (4-6 months)\nWhen I recieved this game I was very excited to get into the fighting of the game\nAnd I can safely say the actualy FIGHTING for a FIGHTING game is good!\nIt is remarkably fun to work with\n----------------------\nThe fighting in this game is obviously fun but...\nYou are a bit limited to what you can do in the rest of the game\nDon't get me wrong, this game is still pretty great!\nBut the game lacks things other fighters usually have\nThis game is still not complete and characters are still coming out\nI really hope that in the future they will add more\nThe current modes you can fight in is:\nStory, Versus, Survival, Challenges, Training, Ranked Match, Casual Match, Battle Lounge\nhttp://static.capcom.com/unity/haunts/Menu_Challenges.png\n----------------------\nSTORY\nThe story currently is very plain and simple\nIt has drawn pictures without animation and dialogue with voice acting\nThis is also where you recieve your story mode costumes (I'll explain this later, just bear with me)\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE\nCapcom wil be releasing a full and complete story mode this June!\nOr atleast it's said to be released in June\nhttp://www.eventhubs.com/news/2016/feb/13/story-mode-street-fighter-5-will-feature-over-hour-cinematic-content-possibility-exists-future-story-expansions/\n----------------------\nVERSUS\nThere really isn't much to say here, every fighter usually has a versus with two players fighting each other on the same computer\n----------------------\nSURVIVAL\nThis is not the most liked gamemode\nSurvival is where you will choose one of 4 difficulty settings and a character to fight with\nYour 4 options are :  Easy   Normal   Hard   Extreme\nYou may choose any character in the game to fight with\nYou will have to fight enemies for a varied amount of time and recieve credits to get you temporary upgrades for the next enemy.\nWhen you complete one of these you recieve Colors for the costume you are wearing\nThis leads to extreme grinding\nEasy= 1 new color for the costume you're wearing\nMedium= 3 more colors\nHard= 3 more colors\nhttps://ryanmarkel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/STREET-FIGHTER-V_20160217234353.jpg\nThese battles are treated as any other: beat the enemy and win\nDepending on what difficulty you chose will change how many battles you will have to fight.\nEasy= 10  Medium= 30  Hard= 50  Extreme/Hell= 100\nThe upgrades you get are completely random which makes this unfair\nYou could be at level 29 and desperately need a full health recovery but instead recieve a low health recovery and lose everything!\nThese can be very time consuming and if you lose at that level 29 or level 49 or even possibly 99, you get nothing back.\nI honestly get bored of this mode rather quickly\nBut some competitive players might enjoy this\n----------------------\nCHALLENGES\nThis is in some fighting games\nThis is where the game teaches you combos for each character and currently they have 10 combos for each character you could learn through challenge mode.\n----------------------\nTRAINING\nThis is where you play as any character and...well...train!\nYou fight against a non moving CPU where you can establish your own combos, or train already known combos.\nYou are able to set up a good amount of CPU options.\nhttp://www.streetfightergod.com/#!training-mode-guide/aw4u9\n----------------------\nRANKED & CASUAL MATCHES\nRanked matches raises your LP when you win.\nYour Rank depends on how high your LP is.\nPlatinum = 7,500 LP\nUltra Gold = 6,500-7,499 LP\nSuper Gold = 5,500-6,499 LP\nGold = 4,000-5,499 LP\nUltra Silver = 3,500-3,999 LP\nSuper Silver = 3,000-3,499 LP\nSilver = 2,000-2,999 LP\nUltra Bronze = 1,500-1,999 LP\nSuper Bronze = 1,000-1,499 LP\nBronze = 500-999 LP\nRookie= 0-499 LP\nThe Higher rank you are, the more LP you lose when you...lose\nWell, it's a bit more than just that\nLets say you are a Silver rank and you got paired up with a Rookie\nIf you beat the Rookie, you get a little bit of points and the Rookie loses a little bit of LP\nIf you lose, the Rookie gains lots of more LP compared to what you would get if you won and you would lose much more LP then he would if he lost.\nCASUAL\nCasual is a less competitive mode for people who don't really wanna rank up that much\nThis mode is a bit more focused to get you fight money (I'll explain this later)\n----------------------\nBATTLE LOUNGES\nFind battle lobbies according to your search settings\nFor example\nI wanted to find someone with a high internet connection stability and on a PC\nyou can find a lobby with these settings\nyou can somewhat compare this to how the Lobbies work in Skullgirls and Guilty Gear\n----------------------\nThere are still 2 things I haven't covered\nThe Shop, Fight money and Fight Request\n----------------------\nFIGHT MONEY\nFight money is acquired from:\nStory Fights\nWinning Survival modes\nCasual Matches\nRanked Matches\n----------------------\nSHOP\nThis is where you spend your fight money\nYou can buy:\nTitles\nCostumes for characters\nColors for those Costumes\nStages\nCharacters\n----------------------\nFIGHT REQUESTS\nWhile you are playing some of the game modes, you are able to press the start button and select battle settings and wait for someone else with those settings to fight you at any time\n----------------------\nCONCLUSION\nStreet Fighter 5 feels amazing to control but few options\nThe way to unlock colors can be annoying\nNo arcade mode\nCurrently incomplete story and still characters coming out\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone willing to pay $60 for this game\nIf you are kinda not really thinking that it's not worth it yet, you're not wrong\nThe Season pass costs  $30\nIt will give you all upcoming characters and stages\nFor now, to people who are not really sure on buying it, you might be a bit dissapointed\nI'd recommend buying it (If you're not sure on buying it) when the story comes out and a bit more characters too\nOr wait until the summer sale","April

The mechanics are all in and stuff, but it lacks a huge amount of stuff a fighting should normally really have day one. It doesn't even have an arcade mode (!). Supposedly, things are coming in the future but for a full price title it gives you nothing for your money. The story mode is merely a prelude that even a baby can finish (literally) and the tutorial teaches a new player by far not enough. If you search for fighting games that actually give you great singleplayer content and also have great tutorials, look for the Guilty Gear/Blazblue series or check out Skullgirls.\n\nBut there are also more reasons, even for online only players, that should just not be in a game which had like 5 betas and had no notion of being not finished. Basic stuff like training mode actually saving your settings. Matchmaking is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up and so is online playing, with some people being unable to play at all and horrible rollback on matches that could actually be fixed with very quick patches. The game also has horrendous loading times, where you sometimes spend more time on the loading screen than in the actual game. Also, the game STILL doesn't have D-input support which makes the vast majority of controllers or sticks not useable without using third party programs. And to top it off, pc version lacks both, keyboard rebinding and an option to turn off v-sync. Could go on and on about what's wrong, but if you are unsure better wait for a few months where it will hopefully be in a more finished state.","March 23","false","100.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vadder-orca/recommended/310950/","vadder-orca","Ibuki da gawd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vadder-orca/","174 products in account","This game has some of the most satisfying feeling combat. The animations and sound effects are just right, making it feel extremely meaty. Very satisfying to land hits in this game. The Characters are all pretty different thanks to the v skill and v trigger system. Ken and Ryu are not just simple copy and paste jobs this time around.\n\nLack of single player content be damned - this is some of the most intense fun online experiences i've had in a while and i'm someone who is relatively new to fighting games (started with usf4 in august last year). The more lenient combo system really helps to get down the basics and bnb's (bread and butter) of a character really fast, while the game still offers plenty of depth with footsies and general mindgames.\n\n\nOne thing though - for players who are starting out with sf v as their first fighting game:\n\nThe tutorial will not really be helpful for you, at all. You will have to search online and in the steam guide section to get you started. You will also need a lot of frustration resistence, because being a beginner means you will get blown up a lot at the start. It will take a time for you to get a feel for the flow of the game and when to press buttons and when not etc. Don't get discouraged, it will get better if you put in the time :). Also, now that the game is new, it's probably one of the best times to enter because there are other new people as well. When i started out with us4 it was 8 years or something into it's lifecycle, so people with 1000hrs playtime were much more common then people with low playtime or even beginners who just started out, too.\n\n\nCapcom is in it for the long run with this game. Content WILL come and this game will be played for years to come.\n\nIf you aren't flustered by the lack of sp content right now on launch and only care about the online (which admittedly does have some server probles at the moment,let's hope todays maintenance fixes some of them) this game is imo well worth the money - considering you'll get thousands of hours out of it. Or you could always join at a later date,when more content has been added. In the end it is up to what you value the most i guess, but this is a fine game at it's core that was a bit rushed but feels just so good to play.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to every fan of fighting games and newcomers, because now is the best time to join and learn. Later on people will already be pretty good and have figured everything out, making it harder for you to start.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for sparring partners you can also just add me - i'm always on the look out for more people to play lobbies with.\n\n\n\nTechnical Stuff:\n\nI have a pretty powerful rig, so running this game with max settings in windowed borderless mode (with borderless gaming app 8.4) in 60 fps is not a problem. I do play without AA though, because i think the one that the game offers is WAY to aggressive and introduces some weird ghosting/smearing artifacts or something. Game looks much cleaner with AA set on low and because of the constant 60 fps jaggies really aren't noticeable in motion.\n\n\nI also did this to get rid of the motion blur while still having the other effects from the post processing apply:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/462cch/how_to_adjust_the_individual_postprocess_options/\n\n\nCharacter models in this game are ace. Looking at them in the char select screen is just a treat - which makes the obvious clipping in some animations all the more disappointing. Backgrounds are pretty hit and miss. There are some cool ones, but generally they have pretty low res textures, 30 fps animations which stick out and super low poly models.\n\nSoundtrack is in my opinion pretty good. I turned off usf4 music nearly right away, but in this one i really like hearing a lot of the tracks, this is subjective of course, but i think they struck a good balance between the classic and modernized stuff.","February 22","true","265.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oowaah/recommended/310950/","oowaah","oowaah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oowaah/","214 products in account","Once again, Capcom comes out with great core gameplay, a game you really want to play because of how well it plays only to botch literally everything else about it.\n\nDo we even need to talk about singleplayer content? Probably not, for 60 dollars it has literally nothing in terms of singleplayer content. I highly doubt much will change with the cinematic free dlc coming in June. Absolutely unacceptable for a 60 dollar game, especially for people who don't play fighting games for the competative aspects.\n\nNow the crux and the biggest complaint with this game.\nThis game has some of the worst programming I've ever witnessed. In a game that really requires stable connections and good netcode to even function (like most twitch games), they really dropped the ball. In a world were they easily could have licensed a version of GGPO3 (which works really good with Rising Thunder another 2½D fighting game) but instead opted for their very own netcode. Huge mistake.\nWe left the old delay based netcode and finally entered the rollback based netcode, but in return we get some half ♥♥♥♥♥ product that have some of the dumbest decision making ever. They went out of their way to literally let the lag in a game be burdened by the person with the best computer/connection creating what most people by now know as one sided rollback. I dont know what they were thinking but they thought wrong.\nThe netcode suffers from other kinks, like extreme rollback from people that are just the street over which makes literally no sense. This type of rollback has also made it fairly impossible to play with people/friends across continents as you can not set a specific delay and it will just rollback really hard.\nIts not good.\n\nThe matchmaking is pretty much not working. Capcom (geniuses that they are) decided to mimic League of Legends more rank based matchmaking, because everyone knows you should always just copy whatever is most popular/makes most money currently. It just doesnt work. The rank is useless as the game will still put you up with whoever is most available.\nThere doesnt seem to be much hidden MMR (or ELO) and LP (the in-game point system) doesnt matter at all, just like the ranks dont.\n\nThere is three different ways to play online. Ranked, Casual and Battlelounge. Ranked and Casual are just matchmaked (ie just sitting in que waiting for the game to pair you with someone to play with), but battlelounge is a game the player creates and people can join. This works the same as endless lobbies in SF4. At times it makes sense to play lounges because you might want to learn a new character but not play people who are "really trying", well lounges isnt the answer. For some reason Capcom have gone out of their way to make sure you cant play them.\nWhen searching for lounges it will pop up a list of available games, the problem? The ping bars (which indicates how good of a connection you have to said person) load forever and 95% of them will never show up.\nNo worries one might think because you can also see what country the lounge starter is from and in that sense be able to pick and play a lobby via that to ensure less lag. No, because flags simply wont show up and will just show the usual "SFV" flag. The only thing that shows up properly is the rank of the player who made the lounge, but what good is this when I have no idea if he is from China, the US, Brazil or whatever else I know for certain I cant play with? It's basically a crap shoot of joining a lobby, then leaving because they're from a continent you cant play with and then trying again, but as salt in your eyes Capcom have done such a poor work at the programming that you will get stuck on black screens of loading and other error messages leaving out of lounges which makes this whole procedure extremely annoying and not worth the time.\n\nNow for the social aspects. What is there to say? For a game that thrives on community interaction they've made sure you can't communicate with anyone. This time around there is no friends list, only a "rival list". It's sort of like a friendslist but you cant talk to them, only send them invites. This means if you want to interact with other players you have use external sources to make that happen. I guess they were scared people would use a messaging system to talk ♥♥♥♥ to people, but thats honestly a dumb decision considering if you make a decent friends list with decent features (only friends cant messages me) it wouldnt be a problem. There is literally no steam integration into that game as Capcom decided to use their own platform so you can not invite friends over steam like pretty much any other game.\n\nCapcom has once again went out of their way to make a barebone experience that while the core game is fantastic, the surrounding parts are complete garbage. This game needs some serious Quality of Life changes to be sure to survive in the future. The only sad part is that games that really do well in the core gameplay AND in the features department cant hold no candle because it simply isnt Street Fighter. I think it's time the Street Fighter name and Capcom take a hit to their credibility if only to show this isnt acceptable for a 60 dollar game.\n\nAll of this culminates in what I can only explain as frustrations with the developer. They havent acknowledged almost any of the things pointed out above. Instead, just silence, with the monthly update on how hype we should be about the newest character coming. I'd rather have no more characters and a functioning game instead. Capcom is a developer with a bunch of great IPs but are a bunch of greedy suits trying to put out the least amount of effort in return for the max amount of money.\n\nI dont recommend this game, but I'll continue playing it because it is Street Fighter, which is quite sad.","May 14","false","86.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The netcode is a million times better than it was at launch and right now far exceeds anything the sf4 netcode was ever capable of. As has been said a thousand times before, the competitive portion of the game itself is incredibly solid. There is a very good reason why this game is shattering attendance records at tournaments and events. The game is good, period.\n\nSo.... should you buy it?\n\nIf you like street fighter already, yes. If you want to get into competitive fighting games, also yes. However, outside of those two demographs there really isn't that much reason to pay the entry fee. Unlike blizzard games, or most mobas, street fighter is missing a compelling universe. If your into fantasy, story, characters, collecting stuff, or just about anything outside of winning there really isn't much here. People might say that sf4 is better in this respect, but they are wrong. Arcade mode is really the only thing that seperates the two in terms content beyond competition, and sfv just decided to split all the arcade mode content into two (significantly less interesting) forms.\n\nSo the main weakness in street fighter v is the same weakness in the entire series. If you like street fighter you will love this game, if you don't like street fighter then this game will not change your mind: at least for now. Capcom has a reputation for long term support and multiple re-releases. So when the game is inevitably re released under a new name (as a free content update, that’s a promise the community would never forgive if broken), maybe then it will be worth a second look.","May 18","true","133.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Supposedly one or two months if it isn't delayed.\n-No stage transitions except the one they paraded around before release\n-Alex's legs are on backwards half the time?\n-What's with this 8f of input lag anyways?\nBasically anyone who isn't wholly devoted to the multiplayer experience will be disappointed as all they have to play would be a boring short storymode, a horribly stupid survival mode, and training mode. Even if you like the multiplayer you're probably going to be disappointed.\n\nPersonally I have issues with lag online in quite a few matches and even offline oddly enough.\n\nBesides these issues we also have a variety of annoyances.\nKen still looks pretty terrible.\nFight money accumulates extremely slowly past the first chunk so if this game lasts a while it's going to be a pain buying characters.\nController support is not anywhere near as good as USF4 was.\n2P has to politely ask 1P to go back to character select.\n10 trials per character ain't much compared to SF4 again.\nGame does a poor job of explaining itself to new players.\nFrame data not readily available in game, probably due to the $$ you can get by selling a guide book with that.\nRelease schedule for DLC characters seems to be "Oh god it's almost the end of the month just release whatever we have"\nGuile looks like a mall cop.\nIt's seriously a full price game?

An automatic loss, a decrease in rank, giving the win to the player that was CLEARLY rage-quit against. THOSE are deterrents. Not picking a punishment and applying it... sometimes), when some of the characters are patched again(the only character I have a real gripe against right now is the one I seem to face the least, and that's Birdie and his headbutt uppercut that seems to have a very wide and nonsensical hitbox), and, of course, when there is a mode for casual players to "get gud" at(sorry, survival mode is a mess, and though they tried with the trials, and some of them are realy useful, I'd love if there was a sort of "real world" application, a way to teach a player when to use it, even thugh that's a very personal thing and not at all needed), that's when I can start really enjoying the game. As it is, it just seems like I'm never on the verge of enjoying the game, because there are so many glaring problems that are fixable, that should have been priority(I mean there are latency problems left over from the BETA, which you'd think would have been solved by now), and just... weren't. Ignoring the fact that there is no real single player mode, you'd think that the modes offered would be at least functional,and if they were, it'd just come down to a matter of taste - whether you like the core game, or you don't. For me, it's the fact that the functionality is off, that makes it hard to continue to play it... even if I want to see what happens with the rest of the DLC characters.\n\nMaybe i'm just griping because I'm tired of getting rage-quit on when I win knowing nothing real substantial will happen to them, losing to very high ranking players, dealing with a perfectly running game in one round and then a laggy mess in the next two, having no real single player mode to play when I just want cpu practice... or Birdie's wide range headbutt.

The game is good, period.\n\nSo.... should you buy it?\n\nIf you like street fighter already, yes. If you want to get into competitive fighting games, also yes. However, outside of those two demographs there really isn't that much reason to pay the entry fee. Unlike blizzard games, or most mobas, street fighter is missing a compelling universe. If your into fantasy, story, characters, collecting stuff, or just about anything outside of winning there really isn't much here. People might say that sf4 is better in this respect, but they are wrong. Arcade mode is really the only thing that seperates the two in terms content beyond competition, and sfv just decided to split all the arcade mode content into two (significantly less interesting) forms.\n\nSo the main weakness in street fighter v is the same weakness in the entire series. If you like street fighter you will love this game, if you don't like street fighter then this game will not change your mind: at least for now. Capcom has a reputation for long term support and multiple re-releases. So when the game is inevitably re released under a new name (as a free content update, that’s a promise the community would never forgive if broken), maybe then it will be worth a second look.","May 18","true","133.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Controllers, which aren't Xinput-based, don't work plug and play / without a third-party app. The game has several audio bugs and online often malfunctions and presents errors.\n\nThe game lacks single-player game modes, such as Arcade mode, which are present in other fighting games. Certain game modes are awfully designed and not fun. Earning costume colours is a pain in the ***. Ranked matches online are contaminated by rage-quitters who aren't punished. The system that is supposed to punish them often punishes those, who people have quit on, which is ridiculous. The netcode isn't the best, sometimes all the rollbacks are put on either player and not on the other. One player has a flawless match while the other sees nothing but rollbacks/lag which results in an overall terrible experience.\n\nStreet Fighter V has terrible optimisation when it comes to input lag. Players suffer from 8 frames (~0.13s) of input lag which is unacceptable in a fighting game.\n\nCapcom cannot keep what they deserved the players, such as DLCs and the deadlines of those. They continuously fail to meet expectations. They tease players and then let them down. An in-game store called "Zenny Shop" has been delayed since March.

But this is far from being a simple, shallow game.\n\nThe game ships with 16 characters to chose from, four of which are newcomers to the series, and Capcom plans to add more through DLCs (it’s possible to win them by playing the game). Although it sounds like there’s too few when compared to Ultra Street Fighter 4, we should remember that SF4 also had less than 20 fighters and that all the game changes and new characters were added through re-issues of the game at full price which fragmented the player base. The decision to make the game a basis to add new content on to over time is far better than the Capcom’s earlier practice with the series and we fully support it.\n\nVariable System is a completely new addition with which every character gains an additional set of moves. Namely, the V-scale will fill up as you get hit or perform a chosen character’s specific move, and it has a different number of increments for each fighter. By filling up the scale, you’ll be able to activate the so-called V-trigger which enables your character to perform a specific move and temporarily strengthens his special attacks. Also, now you can block an opponent’s relentless assault, followed by a combination of buttons with which you can unbalance your opponent for a brief counter-attack window. This whole system is great and you’ll spend a lot of time discovering all of its applications and finding new move combos with familiar characters.\n\nThe current campaign is a sore excuse for a story-mode, because it isn’t a challenge like the former Arcade mode, nor does it last long – it takes about ten minutes to go through each of these stories. Although Street Fighter was never primarily a solo game, some players might be bothered by this “bare-bones” release from Capcom. But still, the game is mainly targeted as a multiplayer game for playing with friends or online, and for which there’s no lack of modes.","March 1","true","23.8"," 31 of 63 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","31","63","3","0"

Stay away for now. If you have less than two hours of playtime on Steam, it is possible to refund the game.\n\n-Do you prioritise casual multiplayer (offline or online) with friends? I'd still say recommended... with some caution I will elaborate near the bottom of this review.\n\n-Do you prioritise multiplayer and\or competitive aspect of fighting games? Preferably with the intent of improving your own game? Most certainly recommended... with some caution.\n\nCompared to previous titles and the franchises reputation, Street Fighter V introduces several rather radical changes to movesets and approach to balance as technical layers have been beheaded one by one, favouring good old fundamental babysteps over technical, extravagant and flamboyant balls. Everyone has only one clear set of normal moves as opposed to normals and close normals - the latter only working at essentially point blank range as the name suggests, almost everyone in the cast has an ability dedicated to bypassing or neutralising projectiles outside jumping, many characters' moveset has been drastically changed compared to their previous appearances, heavy attacks can inflict "crush counter" which opens up even more damaging combo opportunities for mistimed buttons or missing reversals up close, execution barrier has been reduced a lot that even someone who has never played a video game before can in theory dish out decent damage with little training, and the jump from understanding basics to being able to use said basics is far less pronounced than before. It does not mean anyone can learn the game in 10 minutes and level up to sponsored tournament player, simply even that 10 minute training can force even little bit of respect even against competent player by sheer damage output potential from mistakes. It hardly makes up for lack of knowledge or experience in other areas. After all, no amount of simplification can beat experience and good understanding principles.\n\nSpeaking of mechanics, each character has their unique V-Skill, V-Reversal and V-Trigger which uses the new V bar, which is gained by taking damage or using V-Skills. V-Skills range from eliminating damage with the right timing to moves which can bypass projectiles (and doubles as attacks) to "armoured" moves or extra mobility. V-Reversals use the same V bar and activated by pressing forward during block and three punches (or kicks depending on the character) at the same time. These serve as a way to halt or escape pressure. When V bar is full, V-Trigger is available and its activation varies from countdown timer with new special moves, enhanced special moves, or even single-use special move by itself. To give an example, Ryu's V-Skill improves his projectile speed, damage and stun, adds charge property and at max charge breaks defence. Zangief's V-Skill allows him to essentially suck an opponent closer from afar, allowing him several potential applications to close in the distance and deal some nasty damage. It slightly resembles the FADC mechanic of Street Fighter 4 functionally without drastically lopsiding use of bar for mere combo extenders to most of the cast, as V bar is always reset inbetween rounds.\n\nSo far SFV is pretty damm well balanced and each character has all the necessary tools to win. The cast has also good focus on quality, each character has their own gameplay vibe and strenghts even if some fall into similar archetype. While 16 characters may seem little compared to (Ultra) Street Fighter 4, it reduces the unnecessary memorisation what to expect from other character's tools to get started, and the cast will be expanded as time goes on. Right now it does favour a little bit too much of hitting buttons in random order for victory especially against people who are not as experienced, but as time goes on and people figure out common blockstrings, frametraps and applications of normals, the likelihood of losing to random masher goes down drastically. For those struggling to deal with nonstop pressure, block and V-Reversal is your friend. Looking beyond infancy gimmicks, online specials and bar brawls, match dynamics and causality become crystal clear and encourages making your own decisions, whether it is simply baiting out something that may or may not come out, or bringing your own game to the opponent ramming speed style.\n\nCrossplay deservers wonderful mention too. PC and PS4 users can play together, tossing platform split down the drain. Casual matches have been added alongside ranked matches and searching matches is pretty effortless.\n\nBut now we get to the fun part everyone has been awaiting and snarking beyond ridicule since the game was released. For every force there is equal but opposite force, for ying must come yang, for every attempt to sound smart on the Internet must come the awful truth nobody really cares.\n\nAbove the solid diamondmine of gameplay and mechanics lies huge pile of ♥♥♥♥ and rasputitsa's worth of mud to sludge through. Forget quickly fixed launch server issues. For a major release from a major publisher funded by major company, the game is hollow as termites' favourite vacation spot. Capcom Pro Tour explains it a bit but considering how often poor if not even outright broken releases are (rightfully) crucified and burned on whim... eh. SFV is far from broken but simply hollow. I do not care much for single player content in fighting games, but even on the genre's nonexistent SP standards SFV anchored its own foot somewhere in the Atlantic. The story is essentially ~15 minute slugfest against AI as competent as squirrel on drugs trying to fly jet at mach 3, which leaves us survival mode and training with dummy set to AI as only way to play the game without involving human opponent.\n\nThe game forces you play a very quick tutorial once you start it. Not a bad idea but it too much to ask to extend that to training mode? No explaination how each V-Skill or trigger works and frame data must be looked online as opposed to having it in the game like Mortal Kombat X had, or how to do different quickrises. Googling information in this day and age is really, really easy and honestly inexcusable, but is manual too much to be asked?\n\nBattle lounges are currently only 1on1 right now. No spectating allowed, no multiple players, no actual chat, nada. You have predetermined chat messages which while serve their purpose, Guilty Gear Xrd came out on PC recently which allows actual chat in lobbies, matches + supports 4x matches at the same time. Between matches the hangtime worse than on the moon. Imagine someone padded War and Peace with even more text. Character selection feels like someone on the developement team was very fond of screen transitions and animations and stretching them out as much as possible. Capcom Fighters Network is just lacking: no chatting between users and it does not tell if user is actually offline.\n\n(And speaking of balance, there is at least one character that has really awful options to escape pressure. How bad? They are not as much escapes as desperate attempts to hope the opponent doesn't know how vulnerable they are. Sticks out like a rusty, sharp nail covered in goo in otherwise balanced set.)\n\nTo Capcom's defence the "proper" single player is set to be released in June for those who care about it while challenges and store and (hopefully) arcade mode should come out some time March. It seems extremely unlikely they suddenly stop giving a ♥♥♥♥ despite all odds.\n\nAs much as the game release went through stereotypical evil overlord game publisher checklist of missing good release station by few counties, multiplayer and gameplay is still 100 carat diamond. Once they add better lobbies, even if they may not be (disappointingly) be to Guilt Geary's standards, the game can flourish for years to come.","February 22","true","172.6"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","25","51","4","0"

Don't buy this game for what it "might" or "could" be. If you have any doubts you probably don't need this game.\n\nEven with all it's problems I actually recommend SF5 over USF4. Vanilla SF4 and SFxT are both better in their own ways, but both those games are also dead online. So, for a full package that includes online I recommend SF5 over 4.\n\nWhy? SF5 takes out alot of the stupid and broken from previous SF games and manages to provide a surprisingly balanced cast. Usually the only victories or losses that feel unfair are due to lag. The online experience itself is fantastic (if you live outside Asia; the game has been having problems in this region for some reason) compared to any other fighting game on PC except maybe Skullgirls. The gameplay is easier to learn than ever while a solid level of depth is maintained in the footsies, spacing, and mindgames departments.\n\nThere are performance issues, content delays, missing features like customizable keyboard bindings, and singleplayer content that is either too short (story) or too long (survival). Still, SF5 remains a strong contender for my favorite game in the series. If only Capcom can get everything together.","April 10","true","135.0"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","17","35","2","0"

I get the same warm feeling that I had when playing Street Fighter II in the arcades back in the early and mid 90s. If you set your parameters correctly, the online experience can be very good too. It's nice to be able to play in practice mode while queued up for a ranked or casual battle.\n\nIf you want to fight against AI opponents, wait until June when Capcom has said they will release the full single player campaigns. Otherwise, this serves as a good entry point for newcomers to the fighting game genre. It took me around 10 hours of practice to start winning a few battles in rookie and bronze. Now I win as many as I lose but am trying to improve.

Yes, for sure it's incomplete, and I'm looking forward to the full story-mode version coming in summer (which I think will help promote longevity for this game), and yes, I want arcade mode with incrementally increasing difficulty, which I imagine they'll add at some point (but for now I don't think they've made any promises on this? Correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nSo, here's the deal. Really, what this game needs is a Dummies Guide to How to Enjoy SFV, starting with making good use of training mode, of course, but also going on YouTube for basic, intermediate, and advanced guides. Learn about footsies, combos, crush counters, and man does this game open up as something you can perfect not just for weeks, or even months, but potentially years. Watch tourmaments on YouTube for inspiration. There's so much you can engage with outside the game that can help you enjoy it more when you load it up.\n\nAnd I'm serious. I can see this game as possibly dominating the genre for 2, maybe more, years to come.\n\nThat being said, again, I understand the mixed reviews, and I think it comes down to what kind of player you are. If your like me, and you can get obsessively hooked into training, perfecting, and really learning the details, I have no hesitation in recommending this game to you. I'm only a few hours in and I know this game is going to be with me at least through summer 2016, almost certainlyu longer, because story-mode will be a great new thing to get into in June. However, if you're the kind of player that likes a story, or plot, or a sense of immediate advancement when you game, then I wouldn't recommend this game to you, yet, and advise you to wait until the summer update.\n\nAs for the finer details, the game works fine (I had a problem with needing to unplug my WACOM tablet, but that's all), the frames are silky smooth, the servers are working fine for me, and I'm OK with waiting times for games as I'm happy training while I wait, which is usually around 2 or 3 minutes. I haven't bothered playing the mini-story modes yet.\n\nMy personal score at this early stage in my play is 7 out of 10. I imagine this might increase to an 8 or 9 when the summer update drops. Oh, and buy it on Amazon. It's only £22 there, and you get the steam key. For that price, it's well worth it.","April 2","true","32.9"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

Will be very specific here. If you enjoy reading, you'll enjoy this review lol.\nSo, let me make this clear. SFV is a game that is getting a ton of hate for its lack of single player content and shakey online server. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this is okay, nor am I justifying them releasing this game at this price point. To be fair, I think you should use other specific sites to purchase this game for a lower price. However, I still think this game is worth a recommendation if you're willing to do some legwork and be patient with Capcom.\n\nPROS -\n-Crossplay. No matter how small the steam community may get, the PS4 community will probably stay active with this game, which will mean you'll always fine players to play against.\n-The games netcode is absolutely amazing! Don't get me wrong. This is not a game where every match will be flawless, but the majority are really good. Don't play on wifi though, and try to play against people in or near your country for the best online experience.\n-The roster may be smaller than USF4, but it means a better balance. Varity of play styles. From shoto, to zoning, grappler, semi grapplers, unorthidox characters, etc.\n-The game looks good for a fighting game. It's by no means a graphical masterpiece, but it does look good.\n-Upcoming FREE content if you choose to get fightmoney to buy this content.\n-Easier to do combos. This is a positive in my eyes due to combos being difficult don't really show skill in terms of competitive fighting games.\n\nCons-\n-Biggest con is the lack of keyboard, mouse, and controller support with dinput. This is absolutely unacceptable on launch. How in the world did this game not add dinput support despite also being a PS4 title WITH crossplay? I don't care what you say, this is just not okay. Please, if you have dinput controllers, use either joy2key, xpadder, or x360ce to emulate it to a xinput.\n-Lack of single player content on launch. This is not a huge con in my eyes due to this mostly people a really silly complaint to me. Arcade mode may be unavailable, but survival kind of makes arcade irrelevant to me. Story mode is crap, but what street fighter had a great story mode? This is a very minor complaint to me because it's just not as bad as people make it out to be. However, if you don't like multiplayer in a fighting game, don't waste 60 on this.\n- Server issues. This is due to its launch, and I give it the benefit of the doubt with it only being day 2, and it receiving way better server management than before. Found many games today that worked fine for the most part.\n-Battle lounge is unstable. Can disconnect often.\n-Although most character models are fine.. Some just look weird. Mostly Ken's character model. His face looks awful, and his hair looks like bananas (literally).\n-Hitboxes on many moves seem shorter than the animations show. This has been a complaint since the beta of the game. This isn't a huge problem. This is just something players have to adapt to.\n-Losing the chance to gain fight money due to server issues where you simply cannot gain fight money after completing certain objectives offline.\n-Getting kicked from offline modes while online due to server disconnects. This shouldn't even be a thing, especially in survival mode where you're forced to replay the entire survival mode from stage 1 due to a server issue.\n-Rage quitters are not punished for leaving games. Ranked games can be saved if rage quitting and preserving your record and points. This is horrendously stupid. This makes ranked ultimately worthless. Penalize leavers, Capcom.\n-Stages are in 30 fps. This is due to console hardware having to run stages at 30 and ultimately having to tie framerate for crossplay.\n-Some reported glitches regarding characters gaining max meter and v-trigger meter at the start of a round/match. WHAT?!\n\nSo overall, I think SFV is a good fighting game for competitive online play. I think it'll be even better once we get the march update, which it's been shown that we'll be getting PC keyboard and controller support soon. This is all amazing, but ultimately, this is an early access 60 dollar title. However, I enjoy the game regardless of these issues. I don't recommend this game if you want a story or single player experience. I do however emplore you to try this game if you wanna get a good fighting game to play for its online. The servers are slightly shakey but are clearly getting better, and will ultimately be even better by this week.

I sincerely hope things will change for the better and I'll update my review accordingly, but this is how things are right now. 0.4 hours on record, how can this be a fair review?! HATER! You may think.\n\nI played AE, v2012 and Ultra together for about 1300 hours and 1400 more on vanilla Street Fighter. I'm a huge fan of the series as a game and as a universe, and I happen to walk on this Earth with open eyes and ears. This is harsh reality:\n\nThe game launched in early february, and aside from the serverside problems making the game pretty much unplayable online in the first few days (which is quite average about every online game launch), the PC version suffers from several problems, outrageously disrespectful consoleport overlooks that just makes you want to see a motto on the title screen: CAPCOM - "We don't care".\n\n- You are given a default keyboard control setup. You cannot use any other buttons. Good luck playing with WASD + GHJK + VBN (or something like that). The game doesn't even recognize any other buttons from your keyboard. Non of them. Funny enough the game doesn't even recognize keyboard as a keyboard, it says for J that it's "right trigger" etc.\n\n- You think, "oh nobody plays with a keyboard" (well, I did, for about 7 years as quite an expert) "I'll just use my controller". Most of them aren't supported, so either you set up a 3rd party controller software, or you are pretty much done with the game at this point. Ironically, X360 PC controller works flawlessly. This is a PS4+PC exclusive game.\n\n- Online matchmaking is horrible. It can take up to 10-15 minutes to find an opponent, and if in the meantime you'd dare to play for example, in training mode, well you are stuck with the character you used there. You may think, "oh I just want to play against my friends". Online privates lobbies, called "lounges", are 1v1 only without live spectator mode or just simply waiting in line, and even finding and connecting to each other are seemingly impossible for many people, for no reasonable explanation.\n\n- It's not really a negative for me since I bought SFV for online play and tournaments, but as of right now, SFV lacks any kind of singleplayer content that isn't training mode (no online for this either, recorded CPU moves are bugged when you set it to playback) or a 100 level survival mode. Everything is coming later, a full cinematic story mode, character trials, whatever. I'd be completely okay with this and bought the game knowing this, because it's an E-Sport title. But since it controls, matchmaking and online play in general is simply not functioning at all, what there is nothing left to play. I wouldn't want an Arcade mode normally, because I wouldn't care to play if I could play online. Even if that would work (and it does not), I'd still have to give up my 7 years used control scheme or use 3rd party software to fix it, and I refuse to do that. Get your sh....t together CAPCOM, NOW!\n\n- And on top of all this, the PC version also suffers from unexaplained fps issues, that randomly limit your frame per second (it is absolutely critical to have a stable 60 for this game) to 20 or 30 or 45 or something, and you'll never go above that. Some people get it after a specific amount of time played (memory leak suspicious?), some people say it gets fixed if they disconnect from the server (note: everything works only if the servers are up, except training mode).\n\nBut I said. Okay. They messed it up. It happens. Far more often with CAPCOM than it should, far more often nowadays in general than it should, but okay. CAPCOM seemed dedicated enough, they made it a PS4-PC crossplatform exclusive game, I can expect decent support, communication and patches. On the first day they relased a capcomunity blogpost that they know about the problems, they'll patch the server up, they hear our asking (seriously we have to ASK?!) for decent keyboard and controller support.\n\nUp to 5 blogposts were posted since february's early launch, patches were relased... and stuff got "somewhat" fixed... on PlayStation 4. PC got nothing, and the most disconcerning, disrespectful and hatred generating thing they are doing is seemingly completely ignoring that PC version even exists. Nobody, from CAPCOM replies to PC problems since that blogpost, nobody from CAPCOM support even cares to mention PC problems in the technical patch blogs. About a month passed and here we are left in the dark with the belief that PC version is indeed abandoned, just like SFxT was that never got fixed, and the same silence and ignorant denial happend there.\n\nAnd most of these problems didn't even exist in 3 different beta phases, and after 7 years of non of these experienced in the (well supported) IV generaion of Street Fighter, it's just unbelivible what state SFV is in right now, with no sign of change for the better on PC. I want to belive, yes, I do. But CAPCOM sure acts like I shouldn't.\n\nEverything above is written because it is how it is. If this isn't helpful for you as a review based on which you make a decision of spending money on it at the time you are reading this, you are either a blind fan fueled by hatred towards anyone hurting your precious, or just... you know what? Waste your money however you please. You don't like what you read here, then you build your own proof, get yourself burnt, go ahead.","March 3","false","2.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

Alot of work. No DirectInput controller support, so you need to use a 3rd party add-on/program just to get controller support, possibly with input lag. Game is super finnicky with graphic settings and framerate, it's fine in full screen for the most part, but avoid playing in windowed mode unless you have a really beastly PC. Then there's the game itself... extremely barebones unless you really like spending all day in training mode. The online functionailty is a joke, Battle Lounge doesn't even work right, I can't look up Fighter ID's from Steam users, says they don't exist, and battle lounge invites don't work either. There's just not much going for this game until Capcom fixes it. This release is so half-♥♥♥♥♥, I can't get excited at all for this game. It's a real shame.\n\nGraphically, the game looks like ♥♥♥ just like Street Fighter 4 did, but just more high definition. Character models are ugly, completely lack the charm of classic Street Fighter 2D artwork and sprites. Far as 2.5D fighting games go, Guilty Gear Xrd is leagues beyond this game, and it uses an older version of the Unreal Engine at that.\n\nAs for audio, most of the character themes and rearrangements are pretty whatever, except for Zangief's theme which actually sounds really good. Character voices are pretty good, in English and Japanese, I'll give them that. HIt sound effects are nice and chunky, very painful sounding, so that's good at least.\n\nThen there's the actual gameplay... honestly, it's "Modern" Street Fighter at it's core, very slow, floaty, extremely guess and win heavy, and honestly there just isn't a whole lot to this game, it''s like Street Fighter, except now it's trying to be sorta like BlazBlue by giving everybody their own "unique ability", but honstly it's not all it's cranked up to be, it's just really gimmicky. Most overrated fighting game series of all time.. But people praise the hell out of it because it's Capcom and Street Fighter, it's "instant classic" status, when there are so many other fighting games out there that do what Street Fighter does but way better. The only difference this time in SFV is if you guess wrong, you really pay for it, and you can't be pressing buttons ever or you will regret it. If you wanna be good at this game, you gotta know when it's your turn, but it's really hard with the way this game plays.\n\nThis game has priority like Street Fighter 3 Third Strike with grounded normals, which is one of the dumbest things ever implemented into a fighting game, because now you really don't want to press buttons when a fierce/roundhouse will blow up your weaker/faster pokes. It's very risky trying to poke with your jabs and mediums most of the time.\n\nOverall I think this game is just really boring fighting game design, you can do way better than this game and I don't think this game was worth the wait. Will it better in time? Who knows, but my expectations for this game were already very low to begin with.\n\nIf you want a fighting game, I highly recommend The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition which you can get on Steam, hell, wait for a Steam Sale and grab the KOF Triple Pack for cheap. Much more bang for your buck, and it will run on any ol' toaster really.","February 16","false","11.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

This is coupled with the fact that people choosing to play with the Keyboard cannot currently customize their controls, these two facts are rather concerning and have been acknolwedged by Capcom who is aiming to amend this issue in the first update, as for now you will just have to use a third party program to get your controller to work.\n\n\nIf you can stomach that and are looking for a really solid fighting game, I would personally reccomend it. A lot of the new and returning characters feel fantastic with the games larger windows for combo links. There is also less of an emphasis on charge mechanics which may have intimidated newcomers, which could be seen as a pro or a con for certain players. The new netcode for the game is amazing to experience when playing against someone with a good connection and is currently the best I've experienced (I unfortunately won't be seeing MKX's new netcode any time soon :(  ).\n\nThere is a really good game to be found here which may have potentially had its reputation tarnished by a terrible launch, with the teams at capcom aiming to give us something new with PC - PS4 crossplay (which mind you also works really well and gives players a larger pool of opponents).\n\nAs future updates roll out I would like to encourage players to consider changing their reviews once the game has fixed any issues they may have had with the game at launch.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope you take what I have tried to convey here to heart and take your time with deciding if this is the game for you.","February 16","true","49.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

FIX IT, FIX IT NOW!" - The average PC Player.\n\n\nThis game is great, was it worth $60 on release? Probably not.\nWill it be worth $60? I believe it will be, this game shows a lot of promise.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPros\n• Great new mechanics.\n\n• Great new system and playstyle.\n\n• Fun new characters, with all new abilities and new combos for old characters.\n\n• Actual developers that communicate with their players and try to meet the majority of what the players want.\n\n• Cross network play (PS4 x PC).\n\n• Requires players to have a good execution, mechanics and skill. But it's easier and more fun to learn then any other fighting game I've played.\n\n• Very satisfying to see your progress and skill level improve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nConsThe PC Community, they are a bunch of whiners.\n\n• People who complain about having to use a 3RD Party program to get their sticks or controllers working, are lazy (and they are probably to lazy to also read and find out that this was required for the game, its not Capcoms fault your sticks manufacturer didn't release a new driver).\n\n• People who complain about a system not yet placed in but is under development to penalize people for leaving a ranked game, are stupid.\n\n• People who are constantly bashing on all the hard work the developers and Capcom put in to meet the demands of the PC community, and then still demanding more are greedy and ignorant.\n\n• Lack of game modes (Capcom has announced they are making more but as of the date of this review not very many to choose from).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOverall this game is very fun, and I am very excited to see how Capcom adds characters and continue to improve it, because they have already made very good changes that were requested by both communities.\n\n8.5/10 from me.","March 20","true","47.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningWildVidya/recommended/310950/","RunningWildVidya","RUNNING ★ WILD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningWildVidya/","154 products in account","This game needs work. Alot of work. No DirectInput controller support, so you need to use a 3rd party add-on/program just to get controller support, possibly with input lag. Game is super finnicky with graphic settings and framerate, it's fine in full screen for the most part, but avoid playing in windowed mode unless you have a really beastly PC. Then there's the game itself... extremely barebones unless you really like spending all day in training mode. The online functionailty is a joke, Battle Lounge doesn't even work right, I can't look up Fighter ID's from Steam users, says they don't exist, and battle lounge invites don't work either. There's just not much going for this game until Capcom fixes it. This release is so half-♥♥♥♥♥, I can't get excited at all for this game. It's a real shame.\n\nGraphically, the game looks like ♥♥♥ just like Street Fighter 4 did, but just more high definition. Character models are ugly, completely lack the charm of classic Street Fighter 2D artwork and sprites. Far as 2.5D fighting games go, Guilty Gear Xrd is leagues beyond this game, and it uses an older version of the Unreal Engine at that.\n\nAs for audio, most of the character themes and rearrangements are pretty whatever, except for Zangief's theme which actually sounds really good. Character voices are pretty good, in English and Japanese, I'll give them that. HIt sound effects are nice and chunky, very painful sounding, so that's good at least.\n\nThen there's the actual gameplay... honestly, it's "Modern" Street Fighter at it's core, very slow, floaty, extremely guess and win heavy, and honestly there just isn't a whole lot to this game, it''s like Street Fighter, except now it's trying to be sorta like BlazBlue by giving everybody their own "unique ability", but honstly it's not all it's cranked up to be, it's just really gimmicky. Most overrated fighting game series of all time.. But people praise the hell out of it because it's Capcom and Street Fighter, it's "instant classic" status, when there are so many other fighting games out there that do what Street Fighter does but way better. The only difference this time in SFV is if you guess wrong, you really pay for it, and you can't be pressing buttons ever or you will regret it. If you wanna be good at this game, you gotta know when it's your turn, but it's really hard with the way this game plays.\n\nThis game has priority like Street Fighter 3 Third Strike with grounded normals, which is one of the dumbest things ever implemented into a fighting game, because now you really don't want to press buttons when a fierce/roundhouse will blow up your weaker/faster pokes. It's very risky trying to poke with your jabs and mediums most of the time.\n\nOverall I think this game is just really boring fighting game design, you can do way better than this game and I don't think this game was worth the wait. Will it better in time? Who knows, but my expectations for this game were already very low to begin with.\n\nIf you want a fighting game, I highly recommend The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition which you can get on Steam, hell, wait for a Steam Sale and grab the KOF Triple Pack for cheap. Much more bang for your buck, and it will run on any ol' toaster really.","February 16","false","11.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predasus/recommended/310950/","Predasus","Predasus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predasus/","170 products in account","I have devoted well over 4000 hours into the multiple versions of Street Fighter 4 (  Raptr Profile for Proof[raptr.com] ) on various accounts.  I’ve spent thousands of dollars on peripherals, attended numerous local and regional tournaments, and developed a healthy case of arthritis/carpal tunnel in the process.  I think it’s safe to say that I feel uniquely qualified to weigh in on how this new game stacks up. Street Fighter is by far my favorite game series, and sadly this latest iteration is the sorriest excuse for a Street Fighter game, let alone a fighting game, that anyone has ever been subjected to...\n\nThe blatant and clearly intentional omission of content, the lack of stable online play, and a crystal clear (but luckily failed, for now) attempt at a money grab are all inexcusable.  You can barely call this worthy of being considered early access and that is a HUGE step backwards for the series.\n\nAfter the masterpiece that 4 became online, Street Fighter 5’s online experience is the worst online I've encountered IN A VIDEO GAME, let alone a fighter where timing and fluidity are PARAMOUNT.  No filtering for fights by region.  INSANE and GAME BREAKING rollback on moves during matches.  TERRIBLE menus that DO NOT FUNCTION months after release.  These are all completely and utterly inexcusable in 2016.\n\nIf this was Street Fighter 4 on release, I would have been STOKED, but this is STREET FIGHTER 5.  A game that follows one of the most competitive fighting games of all time, ULTRA Street Fighter 4.  WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY START OVER SO FAR BACK?!  Oh that's right, to sell the characters and modes we really want back to us using their STILL non-functioning zenny store for real cash.  All of this while raking in the money from their sponsored tournament series that is the entire reason this game was released in this state in the first place... I'm SICK over the greed behind this game and you should be too.\n\nIt makes me so sad.  Capcom, you let us down and I’m not talking about Ono.  I know he loves this series with a passion many will never know.  It’s the corporate fools and investors that forced this abomination upon us, I’m sure completely against his wishes.\n\nI loved this series!  I loved the fighters and how they all had unique style and charm.  I loved the systems in 4.  The unique ways Ultras worked in conjunction with Supers and EX moves to give you multiple paths to crushing your opponent.  In 5 the game's only decent feature is the actual fighting, and it is still one dimensional and uninspired when compared to 4.  Throwing what worked in 4 away almost entirely and starting over with stubby, nonsensically hitboxed moves.  There is almost zero UMPH and the sloppy, stale, and recycled animations do little to ease the pain of playing this game for longer than an hour at a time.  I could lose myself playing ranked matches in 4 for 8 - 10 hours in a blink.  This is just not that game...\n\nThe character models are NOT an upgrade to 4 despite the engine change, and in some cases 4 looks equivalent or BETTER.  WHAT THE F CAPCOM?  Blurry textures, uninspired backgrounds, locked FPS, lack of PS4/PS3 stick support, boring repetitive music (RAASHHIIIDOOOO?!?!?! WTF?!), and the list goes on...\n\nFor me, Street Fighter 5 is now the most disappointing game release I can remember.  I know they will probably get there with whatever iterations they decide to add over time, but the way this was released felt more underhanded than Daikatana for N64.  I will never forget this.  I will NEVER trust another Capcom product, and I will not be playing this game until it settles into what it was truly meant to be.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nI will keep tabs and update as I go but for now this is one of the worst games to play online, period.  And trust me, there isn’t much to do offline to save it from itself.  Disappointing is not the word.  Soul crushing, greedy, and completely tone deaf are more appropriate descriptors, and even those feel hollow in the face of what we truly paid 60 dollars for.  Sorry Capcom, I know this might not be what you intended, but my trust has been shattered… Never again… :(","May 9","false","262.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

The game had a tough start due to server issues and missing content, but now as the March update rolled in; it has now become a little more fleshed out and has fixed most of its problems.\n\nThe game is really fun for fighting game enthusiasts, it will however take time to learn for beginners to learn how to actually play the game. You have to out think and out play your opponent, you have to work for a win or you're going to die... and quick at that too.\n\nThe incorporation of unique "V-Skills" and "V-Triggers" really makes every character in the game unique and will require you to actually learn how to counter those things.\n\nThis game is definitely a must buy if you're a fan of any fighting games, this one is absolutely fantastic. Sure it still has some missing content, but it's fun nonetheless.\n\nPros +\n\n+Trial Mode (learn characters)\n+Unique Character Skills\n+Beautiful Animations\n+Great Fighting Mechanics\n+PS4 and Pc Cross play\n\nCons -\n\n-No Arcade Mode\n-Takes a while to find ranked matches\n-Weak Story (Free Cinematic Story Update in June)\n-Lots of Rage quitters\n-Too many people complaining\n-Too many people not wanting to learn the game\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nStreet Fighter V is a great fighting game, if you like fighting games and want something to have fun in, then this is the game for you, but it's still missing features so expect updates later on in the future.\n\n8/10","April 13","true","111.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","1"

It's now day 4 and the servers are still borked, battle lounges don't work, ranked doesn't update, there's no penalty for rage quitters, the connection filter doesn't always work, the down time between matches is Herculean.\nThe game is great but it's hamstrung by an abysmal and broken backend that is both convoluted (CFN) and somehow also lacking basic features that other FGs like Guilty Gear have (8 man lobbies and a rematch button to name two) and should not have been launched in this state.\n\nIf it gets fixed I will alter this review accordingly and I thought it was fair to give them a few days at least before giving it a thumbs down but as much as I want the game to work and be enjoyed by new and old players it simply doesn't function in a way most people would find acceptable right now.\n\nEdit: Capcom fanboys out in force I see. I encourage anybody considering buying this to check out the @SFVServer twitter and see for yourself how many issues the game has been having.\n\nPeople need to know when a game isn't working anywhere near intended, get a life and stop defending piles like this. I can play Super Turbo on Fightcade for free with much more ease and stability than SFV and its implementation of GGPO is better.\n\nStay free people who think Street Fighter is the only fighting game ever made and think Capcom can do no wrong.","February 19","false","199.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
