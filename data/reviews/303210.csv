I'm having some trouble coming up with what to say about it. Let's go ahead and look at things I felt during this game, because I think that's the kind of game this is. It's out there to make you feel something.\n\nI felt curious, intrigued, puzzled, confused, worried, guilty, nauseous, desperately lonely, depressed... I felt unreachable.\n\nFor someone who struggles with depression and social anxiety this game really hit me hard. I'm uncomfortable. I want to cry. The level in which you back away from the stage.... and the floating island... and taking shots at the machine... This game has the ability to move you to your core. I've never worried about "triggers", but if I did... I'd put labels all over this one.\n\nMost of all I feel like... I'm glad I've played it. Not many things in this format can stir such an intense emotional reaction. It's almost the feeling I get after finishing a really good book. It's an emotional hangover of sorts. I'm going to go take a bath, get some hot chocolate and a blanket... and cry. I'm going to wallow in my loneliness for a while because the sadness provide a beautiful striking contrast to my good days.","November 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 1,018 of 1,096 people (93%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","93","018","1","44","15"

But if you haven’t watched the trailer – don’t watch it, just buy it, and remove any expectations you have!). If you are a creator of *anything*, you should play this game. If you still want to know if the game is worth getting, here’s my experience with playing it:\n\nI first played it in an empty office at 3am, I... usually get in the office when everyone is leaving and leave when everyone arrives the next morning. I’m bad at people sometimes. When I downloaded it - I don’t really know what I was expecting, but I decided to have a doodle pad next to me\n\nI started off by writing about the game, and then a portrait of the person described, and then about myself...  The cute imagery on the notes soon turned to darker scribbles and tearstained mush. I don’t know any media that’s ever made me feel this way. The last time I cried this much was when my dog (and best friend) was to be put down.\n\nAlone, in an office, 4am, listening to the ending song on repeat, uncontrollably sobbing. For a place that I felt the most alone- I suddenly didn’t feel that way anymore. These however, were not sad tears.\n\nFast forward 2 months to remote Sweden. I met an amazing developer, who we shared similar thoughts, feelings and origin stories about game / solo development. I forgot why, but we were talking about creative anxiety, and showing people our games. On the spur of the moment I said “I need to show you this game, you will understand it”. I had longed for someone I could talk about this game with, (and I felt guilty fanning to the developer about their own work), and, weirdly enough it was an empty office at 3am – in the woods, but it was just the two of us. Alone together.\n\nWhat came after was what seemed like the longest hug. The morning sun started filling up the room, and it was just the two of us just sobbing, paralyzed by emotion. It’s hard to describe such an intimate moment, but seeing a person cry like you cried a couple of months earlier is surreal.  I don’t have a good memory, but this is one that I will remember and cherish forever.\n\nI’ve been making games for 10 years but never released anything because I’ve been afraid of what people might think. After playing this game, I realized everything will be okay. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be okay.\nAnd that to me is the best gift that anyone can give.\nPlay this game or gift it to someone special <3\n","October 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 1,135 of 1,263 people (90%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","90","135","1","66","39"

Do not go in expecting The Stanley Parable or anything like it. Second, this game is not fulfilling, it leaves something to be desired, but that is also its intention. Last, this game feels intrusive. I feel like I just read someones insanley personal diary. I played this in one sitting and its not the kind of game you say 'wow that was fun and enjoyable.' I am speechless, I am uncomfortable and I'm going to be laying awake thinking about it.

I didn't know what to expect when I started playing. I bought the game because I enjoyed Stanley Parable. I just bought this, without hesitation. I didn't even look at the store page untill after I finished the game. At no point during this whole thing did I know what to expect. After the end, I'm still not sure what to expect... I'm puzzled. I remember thinking that it doesn't make sense for this thing to have a pricetag. Everyone should have this, play this, experience this. But maybe not. They wouldn't get it. Not the way I do. Not in the exact way I do. I guess I don't get it. I was brought to tears by this thing. I feel like... I feel things. I'm rethinking things. This is not your everyday game experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallifreyb/recommended/303210/","gallifreyb","gallifrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallifreyb/","43 products in account","I finished this game about an hour ago and I still feel a mix of being both emotionally charged and emotionally drained. If you like games that make you feel something, then you will like this. Don't look up anything more about the game until you have finished it. You need to experience it as something completely new and unknown. It will only take you about an hour and a half to complete, but I have a feeling it will stay with you indefinitely, so I don't consider it a short game for that reason.\n\nIt's very different from the Stanley Parable, but if I didn't know it was made by the same person, I would've linked back to it. There is a similar feeling of unease to both games. Sort of like an outer body experience. But where the Stanley Parable has a lot of humour and light heartedness, the Beginner's Guide feels intensly sad and desperate. And it really did make me feel that way. There were parts of the game that made me want to throw up, and other parts which I played with a constant stream of tears on my face. It was a solid visual interpretation of anxiety and depression.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting the Stanley Parable 2. I think that's where a lot of the negative reviews come from. This game has one ending, and there aren't places where you can change things or veer off track. If the game tells you to do something, it won't progress until you do the thing. And it's more like an ineractive movie than a game. You are simply listening to a story while you walk around the scenery. There will be people who won't like the game for that reason. And there are other people who will find it hugely effective and immersive, as I did.\n\nIf you have finished it, here is my interpretation. (And please please please only read this if you have finished playing.)\n\nCoda and Davey are the same person. The game is about a lonely man talking to himself. Davey is struggling with the fact that he's too afraid and anxious to show his work to people, but at the same time he needs validation, attention, and to be loved and understood. He's trying to understand himself through his creations, and he's trying to figure out if other people will see who he really is through his work. But he is wrestling with his own anxiety, which causes him to cut himself off and leaves him with only himself to talk to.\n\nUltimately it's about the things that we all create. Whether it's games, drawings, writing, food. Or even our friendships, relationships, conversations, our existence and place within the world. We are all creating all the time, tangible things like art, and abstract things like thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Do we hide these things from people because we are anxious they won't like us. Do we share them with people because we need to be understood, and does this cause us to share too much. Do we only create things to understand ourselves. Will that even help us to know ourselves if we aren't showing them to other people? A one way conversation can only go so far, afterall.\n\nIn the end Davey has realised that he wants to experience the world with others instead of alone. He is sharing his various creations and has even provided an email address at the start to invite discussion. His games that once involved conversations by himself have now been opened up. We provide the answers to the qustions that are asked. We read the notes that he wrote, imagining no one would ever see them.\n\nI'm still undecided if the ending is happy. I don't know if he is only showing the games because he is desperate for validation. Or if it's because he has decided we are all better when we open up, and share our creations, our thoughts, and parts of ourselves. He doesn't seem to be at peace with himself in the end. But what's clear is that he has overcome a huge amount of anxiety.\n\nThat's my take on the game. Everyone else's interpretation might be very different, but I think that's partly the point of it. It was a very charged insight into the human condition, and I loved it. I would love to hear other people's interpretations too.","October 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 306 of 359 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","306","359","10","3"

ALSO, AND FOR GOOD MEASURE, IN CASE YOU SKIP THIS LINE, TOO-\n\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\nThe Beginner's Guide will inevitably polarize the slice of gaming public that plays it (as evidenced by the reviews trickling in). And that is as it should be. It's a game about the death of the author/programmer, and it is deeply ironic, confusing, and sad. It also questions the cultural desire to canonize some things as "art" and discard others, as if there's some apotheosis of meaning to be found in a so-called grand narrative.\n\nThe hour and a half narrative experiment features a narcissistic auto-narrator named Davey Wreden who tries futilely to grasp the meaning behind a collection of unfinished micro-games that his friend, Coda, presumably made, stored away, and forgot about. The player explores these little interactive abstract expressionistic games and observes as each programmed space gets increasingly desperate, dreary, and claustrophobic. Most of the time Davey annoyingly lectures about the meaning of each game, which actually violates player agency in a way few games manage (and I think that that might be what makes so many people uncomfortable. It certainly made me uncomfortable). Whereas most games contain programmed boundaries for the player--and the meaning of the experiences in these games unfold based on the choices the player makes or is impelled to make--in this case the narrator acts as an extra constraining force that imposes meaning on works that otherwise feel deeply ambiguous.\n\nI feel the need to defend this game for precisely these ambiguities, as well as for Davey's constant need to fold those imposed meanings back in upon himself (something that I think we all do when looking at an art piece). Many of the criticisms leveled against this game range from thoughtful (e.g. unlike Stanley Parable, which forces players to reflect upon their choices by showing how games constrain mobility, this game spoonfeeds meaning to players and holds their hands during the experience) to irrelevant (e.g. why pay this much for a bunch of unfinished games?). I'm interested some of these responses because so many of them showed that the game caused a stir, and the most compelling of those responses were ones that almost couldn't decide what to think. Stanley Parable was a complicated game because no other game before it had intentionally done the work of exposing the boundaries of the game world. No other game had discussed so completely how games are such powerfully rhetorical devices (a discussion we need to have more frequently, especially given the legacy of brazen violence in video games that comes, in part, out of a history of military involvement with the games industry).\n\nBut The Beginner's Guide is something different. Instead of forcing players merely to reflect upon themselves as they engage with the game world, it also asks that the player recognize how one's interpretation of an artwork is colored by personal experience, and that as a consequence it is always already misguided to attribute an absolute intention behind an authored piece. So what do we make of Davey, the actual author? Leaving aside for the moment that the auto-narrator is nothing more than a mirror (or picture, or simulation) of Davey, the author of the game is always inaccessible and non-existent. Once the product is out there, it is up to the player to decide what it means. In other words, everybody's interpretation of a thing is simultaneously subjective (lonely) and socially constructed. That makes meaning both dynamic and intersubjective. Because Davey is an added constraint on the player (metaphorically figured in-game as imprisonment), the player is left to wonder what the hell they just experienced. Was it someone else's loneliness? Was it a desperate game designer crying for help? Was it a massive cliche about how tortuous the creative process is? Or was the game just forcing us to ask these questions in ways we never have before?\n\nThe player sometimes occupies multiple subject positions in order to feel loneliness and uncertainty. For example, the player is at one point a student in a lecture hall. With the exception of a professor at the podium confidently spouting off pseudo-intellectual nonsense, the entire lecture hall is empty. The camera shifts to different seats two or three times before settling on the professor, who perceives behind the lone student in the auditorium (his pink cube head reading "listen" on all sides) a massive black hole sucking in everything around it. Meanwhile, the player gets to choose what the professor says. Yellow highlighted phrases are what the professor would actually say to his students. The grey options, always vulnerable or crass or self-defeating, are the honest ones. Maybe I found this scene so touching because I teach college, too, but it confused the hell out of me because at this point in the game I was so critical of Wreden for being an absolutely pompous jerk, and yet I found myself needing to fold this moment back in upon myself. More than anything, that's the sort of confusing push and pull that makes me endorse this experiment.\n\nI recognize that my review might come off as a little ironic, since it seems like I'm attributing absolute meaning to this game. But I'm not. I am just offering a way of thinking about it, and a lot of people might find this way misguided and stupid. That's fine. In the end, it doesn't matter if people do or don't like this game, because what it did is it elicited a confused response that didn't before exist. The cool thing about meta-narratives in games right now is that they suggest game designers are starting to leave behind the tired narratives of hyper-masculine men lugging around heavy weaponry through destroyed cityscapes. Instead, gamers now have to think about how lonely the experience of playing a game is. They have to reflect on the types of questions games are able to raise in ways other media cannot. The possibilities are utterly exciting, and I for one look forward to what developers come up with next.","October 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 324 of 386 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","324","386","7","18"

Both in real-life and in fiction there is a person, definitely not your average man but an enigma who pursues a field in art or similar, for example an expressionist (or in simple terms an artist). Such people instead of speaking their thoughts and feelings, they put it into their work, in such a expressionistic sense. Take for example the 'Scream' painting by Edward Munch, although not immediately obvious the painting portrays "nature's scream" as Edward has coined it, one day Edward walked down a bridge, and the sun began setting in a bright red color, at that moment he sensed nature's scream hense the blood red skies in the painting. This exact same situation occurs in The Beginner's Guide where Coda expresses his thoughts and emotions into his games, his games can be interpreted as art of sorts.\n\nThe narrator desperately tries his best to dig deep into the true meanings behind these mystic games, just as a normal person would to an expressionist's painting, but when he does pick them apart for what they really are it's just captivating. We're talking about the psychology that came when Coda created such games, and from my perspective Coda had a lot of thoughts contained. Coda didn't put much thought into his games when it came to an overall objective of a game, but instead he had messages. Everything in these games are designed the way they are for a specific reason.\n\nI also feel like this game reaches out to those experiencing anxiety, depression or isolation rather. Some of the messages left behind to me are the epitome of such a person experiencing the above.\n\nThis game is certainly not for everyone, casuals may gain little or nothing from such an experience, but if you're a creative individual or pursue things like creative arts this is for you.","October 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 204 of 258 people (79%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","79","204","258","27","2"

This isn’t really a problem, neither for my point of view, nor for what everybody else seemingly thinks about this game. Suffice it to say that I’m not in the camp that calls this the apotheosis of narrative games.\n\nBefore I qualify that statement, let’s back up a bit. Because The Beginner’s Guide heavily relies on the fact that you’ve played The Stanley Parable, and because of this, it’s nigh on impossible to talk about this game without spoiling both it and The Stanley Parable. If you do not wish to read how I discuss the flaws in these game, don’t continue beyond this paragraph. To you I merely say that The Stanley Parable makes a promise that The Beginner’s Guide does not keep. The Stanley Parable was an examination of what a game is and isn’t and how interactivity plays into that. The Beginner’s Guide attempts to superficially be about game development, but is in actuality a breakdown of a human being and how his outlook colors your own perception of what you experience. Everything after this will be spoilers.\n\nSo let’s recap The Stanley Parable: It’s a game that relies on the player being aware of what it wants to tell you. If you follow the instructions of the narrator to the end and think that’s all the game has to offer, you’re gonna have a bland 15 minute walk through some offices. If however you realize that the game is about the choices you make and how it’s difficult for developers to account for all the meaningful choices you should be able to make in a game versus the actual limited palette you get to choose from, you’re granted a lot of freedom to explore this concept, because Davey Wreden successfully mapped out all the choices you can make, no matter how trivial or insubstantial they may seem. This was the genius of The Stanley Parable, it made you think about why you play games and why you play them in the particular fashion you are playing them. Depending on how many endings you found on your own as opposed to reading guides, it says a lot about who you as a gamer are and possibly indirectly predicts what type of games you’re attracted to. It spoke directly to you as a gamer and made at least me more aware about the things I do in games, the methods I employ to discover all these new and unique worlds.\n\nThe Beginner’s Guide takes some of the cues fromThe Stanley Parable and implements them for completeness’ sake. Narration is the key to both of these games and since The Stanley Parable relied so heavily on you defying what you were told to do, The Beginner’s Guide has multiple cases where trying to do anything other than what’s expected of you will result in narration leading you right back on track. Ostensibly, there’s no way to “break” the narrative, and believe me, I tried my hardest to do exactly that.\n\nSo if the narrative is this important this time around, what exactly are we being told? We get to experience a bunch of little “games” as they’re called, though in all honesty, none of them are games to speak of, since they have no mechanics, no challenges and no failure states. They’re simply interactive pieces that serve to illustrate certain points or thoughts of the person who made them. We’re told that this person is not in fact Wreden himself, but some other person called Coda who created all these short little vignettes without the intent of ever releasing them to the public. We’re supposed to analyze the work of Coda, to get to know this person from his/her work and in some way become familiar with their thoughts, since apparently this person believes that all his/her work is only part of a unified whole, there to express his/her inner workings.\n\nWhat seems like an interesting idea is unfortunately undone by the actual point the game wants to drive home. See, throughout the game, none of the interpretations drawn from these “games” come from the player. They’re directly told to us from the narrator (Wreden himself). As such, we get to see a second-hand interpretation of the work of someone else and what that work might say about that person. In actuality, the game never was about Coda. It was always about Wreden himself and how his interpretation was dead wrong. This creates a hairline fracture in what the game is and what it tries to tell you. The game wants to be seen as an apology to Coda for Wreden’s wrong interpretations into Coda’s “games”. For this to be true however, it makes no sense for Wreden to introduce us to Coda’s games in the way he does. This whole idea of Wreden sharing Coda’s work and then coming to the realization that his interpretation was wrong and maybe the reason why Coda stopped making his/her “games” breaks my suspension of disbelief, because the narrative is already written in stone, so to speak. So my involvement with the title has no bearing on Wreden’s realization, hence why before he published this game, he must have already been aware of all of this.\n\nYou see, there are elements missing for this scenario to be believable. By making it personal, it opens up a plethora of questions that first need to be answered before I can believe what I’m being presented with. I don’t know if this Coda person is actually real or if everything I’m shown in this game is mere fabrication. Or if Coda is supposed to represent Wreden himself at a different stage, since there’s a good chance that might be true, if the telephone conversation with yourself has any meaning. The problem with this is that for it to resonate with me, I would’ve had to know Wreden and by proxy Coda personally. Because my interpretation of a person will always be different if I relay it to you than your own if you actually meet and interact with that person. Remember all those people who wronged you in some way, who you can’t stand for some reason or another? They have friends who love them for who and what they are and if you were to give your interpretation of that person to their friends, you would be met with confusion.\n\nSo why exactly doesn’t The Beginner’s Guide work? Because it’s interactive. The ultimate irony of this title is that the interactivity – no matter how limited it may be – undercuts the narrative it wants to present to us. Because the interactivity plays no role for the player. The interactivity is there for the developer’s sake, not the player’s. That is admittedly an interesting idea, but the idea already spells out why I as a player am not engaged by the interactivity. I’m not part of the narrative, I’m being told something, in a very clear and explicit manner, directly through narration. And it doesn’t tell me anything through gameplay at all. Even the weirder “games” feature basically no gameplay at all, and what little gameplay we do see has no bearing on what that particular “game” is trying to tell us.\n\nThe Beginner’s Guide is basically the interactive version of an abstract expressionist painting, where the creator desperately wants to make you believe that the work in question has meaning when it really doesn’t, or when it only tangentially touches upon what it intends to say but never actually expands on the central premise. It’s like wanting to get to know Zdzisław Beksiński from his apocalyptic paintings and then finding out that he’s actually quite a nice guy to be with, with a sense of humor that clashes with what his paintings show you. Fittingly, he was also a person who despised other people interpreting things into his work. Or to put it more bluntly, The Beginner’s Guide is artsy for artsyness’ sake, without any redeeming qualities on the gameplay front.","October 4, 2015","false","1.5"," 987 of 1,443 people (68%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","68","987","1","39","63"

Through its narrative and interactivity, The Beginner's Guide provides insight into game design – specifically insight into game designers and the games they work on. Developer commentary, rather than being a separate bonus, is integrated directly into the experience as Davey walks the player through the game while telling them a story.\n\nOn the surface, this blend of hand-holding and storytelling makes the game play out rather like a documentary. However, the interactivity of the game is vitally important to the experience. Despite how little my choices actually meant to the game as a whole, I was stricken by the feeling that I am actually an important piece of the overall experience; stricken by the realization that a story told only has value if someone is there to listen. I needed only an inconsequential amount of agency to still feel like I, as a gamer, mattered to the game I was playing – and that's exactly what I got.\n\nWhat really hooked me was feeling like Davey was speaking directly to me. Not to me as a character, or even necessarily to me as a player, but to me as a person. It was a remarkably human feeling, and I can safely say that no other game I've ever played has validated my existence to quite that degree. It didn't take long before I was completely invested in the experience I was having.\n\nImagine, for a moment, having a conversation with your favorite game designer. If such a thing doesn't exist, imagine having a conversation with your favorite author, movie director, musician, or entertainer. While playing The Beginner's Guide, I felt like I got something akin to what I'd imagine that to be. A direct line of communication from game designer to gamer through the game I was playing.\n\nI felt like I not only got insight into the game I was playing, but also into Davey as a person. And it was a reminder of the people who give me the experiences I indulge in on a daily basis.\n\nBeing so casually reminded that there are actually human beings, with lives, experiences, and stories to tell, behind every single game I've ever played was… an eye-opening experience, to say the least.\n\nAnd it's left me with so many questions.\n\nDo those people design games with the explicit intent for them to be played? Do they show every single game they've worked on, or are their drives full of unfinished or scrapped projects (if those don't get deleted outright)? Do they make games for business? For profit? Or simply for the joy of it – whether it be their joy as a game designer, or the joy others feel when playing their games? Or do they make games because… it's the only way they can reflect on themselves and grow as people?\n\nI write because it allows me to look at myself objectively and learn from myself. And I didn't even realize that's why I write until I had this experience. Could it be that many game designers actually do the same thing? Are their games, like eyes, windows into their soul?\n\nThese are questions I never asked myself until I played The Beginner's Guide.\n\nNow I can't stop asking them.","October 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 152 of 205 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","152","205","4","2"

(Davey Wreden)\nGenre: Walking Simulator, Story.\nPrice: $9.99\nPlayed on: GTX 650, Core i3, 1920x1080 Res.\n\n"You desperately need something and I cannot give it to you. I literally do not have it."\nThe Beginner's Guide is a narrative driven game where you as the player get to explore the many creations, they're not really video games as seen by the screenshots above, they are just creations made by a man trying to describe how he feels through making these creations.Or is he?\n\nThis review is hard to write because there is no good way to describe this game, it's very different to anything I've played to this day and I feel like different people will come out of it thinking different things, that's not anything new, people have different thoughts on games all the time  but  this game is very different from that. This isn't a fight between is the game good or is the game bad. It's more of what the game means to you.\n\nThroughout the game, you see all kinds of enviroments and walk through them. They are all very linear and they are all unique and pretty odd. I wish I could describe these enviroments but I really don't want to spoil the game and each one of these enviroments are super important  to the game and again, I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nI found the game oddly satisfying to play even though I usually don't like fully narrative games. The game just works, it's not a game to be critizised and it's not really meant to be rushed or played slowly it's just a  very very very  distinct game compared to other games I've played. Some people might not conisder it a game, some people might consider it a breakdown of a man.\n\nIn conclusion, The Beginner's Guide in my opinion should be bought and played without knowing anything about it, some people might not like the game, I feel like some people will like this game more than others and vice versa  because  the game has so much to discuss and to talk about while having almost nothing to confirm. This was a weird review to write just because this game is so unique.\n\nI recommend The Beginner's Guide only to people who want a story, no gameplay, no quests, no weapons, no fighting bad guys. Just a weird emotional crazy story.\n\n\nFor breaking my mind slightly with just a narrative, I give The Beginner's Guide a 9/10.\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curation page  here!","December 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","56","67","4","2"

I felt like I was at an interactive one-man show, a cooperative poetry slam, something very unique and interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, the mystique and charm of the story began to wear thin as I neared the end. My initial suspicion of contrivance came back in force as I reached the saccharine climax of the story.\n\nAs much as the sentiment is echoed in so many negative reviews, I genuinely wanted to like this game. But I simply cannot ignore the egotistical nature of the story. As I see it, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The game is a true story, and the author is actually seeking to reconnect with this person. Besides my own cynicism preventing me from believing such an enigmatic yet loosely described person existing outside of shallow fantasy, I cannot believe that the developer is so fiercely ignorant as to charge money for such a supposedly heartfelt message. Which leads me to 2.\n\n2. The game is a work of fiction. In which case, the game is not only manipulative; it also loses pretty much all of its value when you realize it's just a hollow sentiment dressed up as a cry for help. But there's one more possibility.\n\n3. The game is an experiment dressed as fiction. There is no community support on steam as I write this review. This could just be a glitch, but it got me thinking about the possibility that this is all just a means to send a message, but not the one stated in the game's conclusion. Is it a daring critique on the medium, or a thoroughly callous misappropriation of player trust? I’m not sure, but I suspect we’ll find out after the reviews start coming out.\n\nI admit, the third conclusion is far-fetched, and assumes a lot about the developer’s character, but I struggle to find an explanation for how thoroughly disappointed I am with the game’s conclusion. It might just be that the game is either a naïve cry for attention, or a vacuous and misleading experience.\n\nEDIT: More directly and succinctly stated:\n\nIs it 'artistically viable' (lacking a less robotic term) for a creator to slice their heart open in front of an unwitting audience, and expect them to forgive the shortcomings of the actual work in lieu of their suffering? Is that honest? Is it right for me to criticize that person for how they feel, when what they really need is support?\n\nIndeed, does the fact that I'm considering these questions openly mean I have no right to pan the work, since it's given me some artistic insight?\n\nUltimately, I have to stick with my gut reaction: This is a moving piece, but pouring an emotional deluge over an unsuspecting audience should not be praised when so many works can do the same with more subtlety and grace. I do not know the man, I do not resent his suffering or seek to add to it, but I definitely do not want to be charged to experience what eventually amounts to an unfiltered look into his emotional issues.","October 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 146 of 230 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","146","230","4","19"

Therefore, I'm going to go ahead and recommend this game despite its length and lack of interactivity. That being said, this game is for a very niche audience. I would not recommend it to the general gaming audience.\n\nNote of reviewer: I make games for a living, and this game talks about people who make games. As a result, the messages in this game are going to reach people like me. It will not mean as much to others.\n\nNote on the game: This game deals with depression and people pleasing, which could be uncomfortable for some players. Be sure you're ready for some heavy material before diving in.\n\nActual review:\n\nWhat more needs to be said than what I already said? This is a rather heavy examination of some of the psychology that goes into creative works. There are parts that feel very contrived throughout. I didn't actually feel like I was looking at what I was told I was looking at. People don't really make games exactly as presented here. Nonetheless, there are facets of it that ring painfully true for anyone who has attempted creative work like this. It'll get you to think about your relationship not only with your work, but with other people's work. For that, I think this game was overall a success.\n\nIf you're considering getting this game, I suggest you find someone who has played it and who knows who you are first to see if they think you'll get something out of it. Otherwise, you may find yourself disappointed.\n\nSteam offers a refund for any game you've played for less than 2 hours. As this game is about 90 minutes long, this means that theoretically anyone who buys it could get a refund after playing through it. Please don't do this to indie developers. If you buy this game, keep it in your library. If you're not willing to part with $8-10 on 90 minutes of entertainment, then... well, maybe these kinds of games just aren't for you.","October 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 78 of 116 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","78","116","6","3"

I do not recommend it for the average gamer. It is, in places, visually interesting. The narrator (and author) is actually a decent voice actor. It seems to attempt a deeper meaning than is readily clear and it may be compelling for some to think about. There are many theories and ideas about it's meaning popping up, and it has created some interesting conversations. There is some value in generating this kind of open table discussion, so far without any input from the author, but it boils down to third-party speculation about one individual's personal head space. Interesting for a philosophical symposium, but ultimately futile. Most reviews and threads I've read about it could be summarized with the statement "Because I do not understand it, it must be deep and meaningful."\nThe author seems to have a message he wants to convey, but struggles with how to convey it. I think this was a rather personal game, made as a message, or apology, to a specific person. There is an extant interview with the author that backs this theory. The narrator is a sort of devil's advocate, playing as the person he wants to apologize to, while the fictional second character is the author himself. A kind of role-reversal, as if to say "See, I know how you feel, and I'm sorry."\nIn any event, it didn't leave me with a good feeling. The parts where the second character was railing at the narrator for needing a purpose or point in a game, felt like the author himself railing at gamers in general. In fact, it gave me the feeling that gaming itself is a futile waste of time and life. A strange message to convey in a game, and a depressing notion for a gamer. Even the part with all the notes left by fictional gamers felt like a condescending mockery of gamers in general, as if we are all a bunch of selfish, immature cretins demanding that the emotionally complex genius of a developer gut his poor soul for our entertainment. It seems to me The Beginner's Guide to disenfranchising your customer base. A feeling of unease, almost nausea, builds throughout. There was some potency in the final sequence, but mostly I was just glad for it to be over. After all that, the mopey song at the end just felt like cynical manipulation.\nWhat I think in a nutshell: the few negative reviews for The Stanley Parable really got to him and this is the result, a figurative middle finger extended to gamers. I could be entirely wrong, but that's the feeling it gave me. If it were free to play I might recommend it, but no one should pay actual money for what amounts to an expiremental, self-indulgent foray into a game developer's emotional state, personal life, and thought process. The message I got was -- making games is hard, emotionally taxing and psychologically draining for the tortured genius. Though a game may be published, it was not made for you, but is simply an expression of the author, a catharsis of artistic talent and technical skill which you do not deserve and could never possibly understand. It reminds me of juvenilia, the kind of poetry that teenagers write; deeply personal, self-centered, overwrought tripe that has little to no value for most other human beings.","October 7, 2015","false","2.3"," 504 of 838 people (60%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","60","504","838","35","28"

I often find myself yearning for deep stories and intersting ideas when it comes to games, and I really thought this was going to fulfill that, especially after reading the plethora of recommendations and watching the interesting trailer.\n\nI went into this game knowing that it was only going to be about an hour and a half long, knowing that it was going to be nothing more than a visual novel-esque experience/game.\n\nWhat I was really looking for in this game was something to make up for that, with all of the praise it's getting in the reviews, and all of the recommendations describing it as a deep experience, that is what I was expecting.\n\nWhat I got was an interesting story, but it felt very shallow, forced, and like it was trying to be something but didn't really know how to do it. Yes, I understand what it is trying to do, and I really wanted to like it, I overlooked a lot of the cheap things like the corny voice acting (that I don't believe was trying to be corny, it was trying to be dramatic. If it was trying to be corny then it was uncalled for anyways) and the fact that some things were immersion-breaking. Yes, I know it's fiction, but the point of getting into a story is to suspend disbelief, and a during most of this game, I struggled to do that, it just didn't feel meaningful.\n\nEdit (Side note about appealing to game developers):\nI've also heard that this was a game that would be appreciated by game developers even more so. As someone who has created several projects using various engines and / or programming languages from GML to Unity to raw Java to the Source Engine itself (My Dota 2 mod can be found on my page, although I would hardly even count that as evidence of my work, as it involved little to no programming and was mostly like a map creation than anything else, which is what I would classify these "games"), which is what is featured in this game. HOWEVER, I think this only DECREASED my enjoyment of the game! The game has you go through a collection of "games", however I can hardly classify these as games at all! Rather, they seem to just be maps / mods made with the source engine! And the time frames that were given for each game? Hardly seemed realistic at all! Yeah, it was made by one guy, but like 6 months for map with a house where you click on things to clean them up? I could whip something like that up with no engine in less time, let alone using the Source engine itself! The only explanation I can think of is that he had a lot going on, like a full time job and what not, and he wasn't a full time developer. Not to rant or act as if I know a lot about game development, I still have a long way to go to even consider it a side hobby, but with this knowledge, I feel as though my suspension of disbelief was only harder to achieve!\n\nIn the end, I was expecting something impactful to make up for the lack of other content. I see people praising it for being impactful, invoking emotions like sadness and awe at what was done. But for me, I was left with disappointment, as I found myself feeling nothing more than as if I was trying to make myself feel something about the game because I just dropped money on the thing and wanted to get SOMETHING out of it. It wasn't a meaningful story for me, and it almost seemed like a waste of money.\n\nThis is not a bad project, it was interesting in a sense, but even after trying to force myself to experience some sort of response and looking for at least some kind of interesting interpretation, I am left with little to nothing. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who would feel the same. And for that reason, I can't recommend this for the price it is charging.\n\nI am still looking for a reason that this game is getting praise, however. If you feel that I am wrong, or disagree with what I said, please feel free to leave a comment on here and share that with me. I am interested in why this game is getting such high praise from people.\n\nTL:DR - This game was disappointing for me, it did not invoke emotional response and could not hold my suspention of disbelief. I can see what it was trying to do, but the drama felt shallow and forced. Thus, not worth the money.","December 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 293 of 497 people (59%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","59","293","497","14","19"

It wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't fun. I feel like I just watched someone go through therapy, and while it was engaging I don't feel like I should have paid money for it. This was Wredens anxiety about The Stanley Parable's popularity made into game form...at least thats what I made of it. It was so personal I almost felt intrusive, but then I reminded myself that Wreden was the one that put his psyche on display for the world to see for 10 bucks, and looking at it that way kind of made me mad. I'm a bit put off by the fact that this guy thought his dilemma was so special that I would pay money to experience it. Had I known thats all this "game" was I wouldn't have bothered. He could have at least had the decency to make a game around his very self-centered theme, instead of just making a (kind of boring) walking tour.\n\nI think the thing that bugged me the most early on (and pretty much put this "game" in the "psuedo-intellectual hipster BS" category) is the way Wreden keeps referring to his (or Coda's, whatev) creations as "games", and rambling on about what makes them so special. Art may be subjective, but games are not. There are a few rules as to what makes a game, and The Beginner's Guide had none of them. There was no way to fail or succeed, you just went along for the ride...in fact it kind of reminded me of a dark ride. It honestly would have been no different as a non-interactive movie.\n\nAlso, and this is just me personally, but the heavy-handed "moral of the story" was not very revelatory to me. I could even identify with it, having been on both ends of the dilemma, but it wasn't something worth making a whole "game" about.\n\nIts an interesting experience but I wouldn't call it a game...or pay money for it.","October 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 117 of 192 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","117","192","0","4"

Now you may ask why I compare this game to Stanley, and while you may be right, since they are different in a respectful aspects, similarities are impossible overlook. And they are not bad. I thoroughly enjoyed Stanley Parable and I instantly 'marked' it as incredible, unique, and a very memorable experience. Maybe my mistake was expecting more of a same with a bit of variety from this one, but unfortunately for me I was wrong.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this game is bad because it's not Stanley, but I can't help but notice that the game tries to tell a story in a unique, but rather hollow way. I have to admit, certain moments left me speechless, and the story is quite intriguing, but it's not anything special. Why others people give this game such a high praise is beyond me, but I feel like the game has different impact which differentiate from a person to person. When it comes to me, story didn't pull me as much as I thought it would, but that's okay, and I'm more or less satisfied with what I got for the amount I paid.\n\nThis is not a bash on a game, given that I left a positive review, but merely a NOTE to NOT expect Stanley Parable 2. Just get into this game, and let it tell you its story.

I understand that Coda isn't real, but I still don't know if I'm settled on how I think Davey relates himself to Coda. Is it his subconscious, his artsy side? Is it all just bullcrap made up to sell a game? I dunno. But to some extent, that's not totally important. Whoever's struggles were being described, they felt real, almost too real. They made me feel literally uneasy. At times I looked away from the screen while the narration rolled, not because I was bored but because I was feeling awkward. I felt like someone, whoever they were, was opening their soul to me. And without actually knowing the individual, I just felt wrong. More importantly though, the issues being described just hit home. The depression. The loneliness. The need for validation. The creative dead ends. The destructive clamor for me to create more, more and more stuff. The closing people off. I've been there. I get it all. And I say that as someone who doesn't work in game design. A lot of my free time is spent doing graphic design work. And I've felt almost all of those things. And it burns and it hurts, and it's uncomfortable being reminded of that.

When I finished the game I felt swindled. I do not understand what is so great about this game and I feel like I'm being trolled. I'm going to sit here and not recommend this game. I don't know whether I'm missing something or just didn't comprehend something properly, which is not out of the question, but as a whole, almost every element is not what I would call a game worthwhile playing.\n\nFirst off, you can just watch a play though as the game is so linear that there is no point in actually buying it.\n\nAll you do just walk through a linear path of unfinished levels supposably made by someone the developer knew. The dev tells you about a fake relationship he had with that fake person who does not exist. Meanwhile he talks a little about the mechanics of the levels which symbolise his emotions and the correspondence he made with the made up person. Making this game in some way gave the developer some sort of emotional outlet to their success with "The Stanley Parable" and how people responded to that... However that means nothing. Whether you know that going into the game or not it doesn't change anything.\n\nThe game tricks you be telling you this person exists, and by the midpoint it is confusing as it's highly doubtful that this person would act in the way they did. Throughout the game the dev explains how each level works and talks about the made up person and their relationship with them. The levels are mostly unfinished or basic and contain some sort of gimmick like having to walk backwards.\n\nThe game throws some subjective art, words and level design to try to evoke emotion out of you but ends up being pretentious. Combined with how basic and short the game it makes you feel cheated by the end of it. I didn't enjoy my experience with it and I don't think there is any real content in this game that is worth your money.","March 27","false","1.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazmuirl/recommended/303210/","kazmuirl","KazzualGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazmuirl/","270 products in account","I have been wanting to give my take on this game for a while. I suggest playing the game before you read this, or any reviews for that matter.\n\nI, like many others, went into this 'game' with Davey the narrator walking me through, introducing me to a man named Coda's art. By the title, I assumed this was going to teach me how to begin making games. It started out really confusing, and almost boring, as Coda's first set of games were just him goofing around with the development, not making finished products on purpose. Ok, i've seen many unfinished games before so nothing special. Davey starts giving his interpretation on these games, how raw they seemed, and in my personal opinion, I wasn't following the hype he was putting out. It sort of reminded me of those English classes that questioned any and every part of a story, as if every word spewed is some shakespearean masterpiece that we just don't understand yet. When Davey expressed his worry with Coda's prison games, it put Coda in a light that made him seemed troubled, and made me feel sorry for him. Of course, hearing it from a supposedly 'reliable' narrator with no reason to lie, would give me no other word to believe, as the viewer is under the impression that these two people know each other quite well by now. At this point, i'm subconsciously applauding Davey for his unsolicited concern with a friend. Between the door puzzle, lamposts, and seemingly eerie atmosphere, I started coming up with my own idea of who Coda was through his games, similar to what Davey did.\n\nHere's where it gets sketchy for me: Davey shows us an infinitely looping cleaning game by Coda. He says "This is the first game he actually called me up to show me." At the beginning of the game, when Davey is telling us how he and Coda met and became 'friends'. He admits he was being a little pushy and over zealous with getting to know this guy. This is implying that every game shown to Davey was solicited, giving no reason for them to have to be playable or coherent in any way, if he was never planning on releasing them. It leads me to believe that Davey is being a little over dramatic with his diagnosis of Coda. It makes me wonder if they are actually friends, or is Davey just some guy that Coda met and asks him to see his games?\n\nThings get a little more intense as his games get more personal and self destructive. Even though by the end of the game we are exposed to the fact that Davey has some problems of his own (his constant need to be the hero of someone else to compensate for his own shortcomings), we can't ignore that some of Coda's games did touch some topics that made you question his emotional health.\n\nWhether this game was a true story, or elaborately staged, it was phenomenal and thought provoking. I'd recommend to anyone that doesn't mind interactive stories with not much physical involvement on your part.","December 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

That’s all up to interpretation, as are many aspects of this game. You are narrated by Davey, the maker of The Stanley Parable. This game isn’t to play like Parable though. This is a slice of Davey’s life where he talks about his friend Coda. This game is almost a memoir in that respect.\n\nI’ll just get gameplay stuff out of the way real quick: It plays like a source game without guns and you simply walk around just like in Stanley Parable. I feel that this is only a game because Davey knows this best as a medium to get this story out.\n\nAnd he is right for that, because the main “plot” of the game is to talk about Coda and his games. But it’s what the games mean and how the player and Davey interpret them. He gives the player a model of what he is talking about, which is a really rare thing in storytelling. From after this paragraph there may be game spoilers that reveal what actually happens in real life. Anyone reading this review to decide whether to get this game can stop here. If you want a story that can make you feel something more than any work of fiction can, absolutely get this “game.” It’s really thought provoking and special not only to those who play it, but to Davey himself.\n\nThe Beginner’s Guide is very thought provoking. It starts as Coda’s very first map, one for Counter Strike. Davey talks about why it’s significant that this is his first map. Davey says that Coda can crank out little games with abstract ideas, so he gives us all these games to play. Each of these games has a theme, and overall Coda puts in themes that stretch across the game. One game can allow you to only move backward. So to move through the level you have to turn away from what you see, or “the future,” and this represents how the character can’t see the future they are working toward. One of his other games is a product of many versions of a prison level. Each level you try to get out. This is where Davey starts to notice that something is wrong with Coda, and he is expressing that through the game he makes, so he talks to him about it.\n\nIf you want my explanation for the events of the game, continue reading. Otherwise the review and summary of the game is over.  I feel that what happens at the end is the result of a misunderstanding, and Davey himself said he sort of pushed Coda to make more. Coda never really wanted to show his games, and since Davey’s source of moving on is validation he cannot understand that Coda never wanted to show them off. Now I’m not as clever as Davey or Coda so I’m glad he sort of interpreted the games for me, which is where I got this idea.","October 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","0"

It isn’t a game. Games are closely linked to game theory. Someone looses, someone gains. Can we all gain? Sure, but it really hasn’t asked or answered, what if there was only yourself to play the game with?\n\nThis “game”, rather title, or art work, is not worth it. It’s not worth the $20 or the $10 or whatever it is currently listed at. Being a one in a life time experience, there’s no price tag to be placed on it.\n\nSure, someone, or a group of people had to come together, piece all the parts together, and that work should justify being paid.

Heck, even if I did, I couldn’t be in the same room as them. This is an experience you have to see for yourself and by yourself only. You might have looked at the “gameplay” on YouTube to see if paying money for this game is worth it. Simply put, you should come to your own conclusions while “playing” this title. In the next few sentences, I would usually be inclined to talk about the key ideas of the title or game. With this, I couldn’t. It would wreck it. Gameplay is not even a word I’d see myself using in this review.\n\nThat being said, you should probably talk to a psychiatrist before and/or after “playing” this “game”. If you would be unable to distance yourself enough, I think it could damage you. This title is dark, really dark. I am being quite serious. This is not a joke, or a pun on my name. You should prepare yourself, or know that you would be able to distance yourself from what you will see, and hear from the narrator.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618152270\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618152646\n\nWhile I’d recommend that any person could play Stanley’s Parable, you have to be a select few to “play” this title.\n\nIn the Stanley Parable, you could walk around, “play” and be done. You would completely miss the whole meaning of the game, the actual content to the game and still be ok. (hint: it's about a view on modern games). Sure, what you see on the screen is a game, or something worth paying money for, but that is not why you should be there. There would be a lot of things I’d place in this review (like my many other popular ones), but I simply can’t. It just wouldn’t do the title justice. Perhaps you have finally picked up on that point. You shouldn’t be reading the reviews, just go ahead and try it.\n\nWhat you will leave with after tinkering about in this title are the many questions left unanswered. One being, is the author of this title actually “Coda”, the person who makes the parts in the game? Why did it take this long to package this all together? Where is “Coda” now? What’s with the three dots? And… I should probably stop there. There’s a lot I’d be willing to talk about, but not before you sit down and “play” the “game” by yourself.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618129499\n\nI will leave this review with this question: What does self actualization even mean, and what is it worth?","February 6","true","3.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Putting together a project like this isn't free: it takes time and effort and talent and I have no particular animus about paying the price of a Big Mac Value Meal for something like this. And minimal interactivity that stretches the definition of the word "game" doesn't bother me, so long as I feel like I've gotten something important out of the exchange.\n\nThe Beginner's Guide is a guided tour through the collected works of an independent game developer, Coda, narrated by one of his friends. The narrator, Davey Wreden, discusses at length his relationship with the developer and the games, and talks about how he wrestled with the meaning and significance of each of them individually and as part of a greater whole. He tries to make sense of Coda's mental state, his motivation for creating, and how his works relate to himself and the world at large. These ruminations make up the bulk of the material. This in itself is not bad, per se, but the reason that I cannot recommend this game is because the ruminations come with no payoff: it's a shaggy dog story with no conclusion and precious little food for thought.\n\nThe only emotion that this game made me feel was mild anger and annoyance: by the end, it becomes clear that we are not listening to a story about how someone's games reveal the depth of their humanity, but instead a story about a passive-aggressive, petty, cruel, self-centered game developer and his emotionally fragile, self-loathing friend--though judging from the way that Coda treats Davey, "friend" is perhaps a debatable term. This game contains no heartening insights, offers no "a-ha" moment, does not leave one with hope for the future. It is two troubled people's dirty laundry aired in public, as emotionally deep as a pothole. I came away feeling contempt for Coda and embarrassment for Davey.\n\nTechnically, there is nothing the matter with the game: the price is fine, it runs flawlessly, looks fine, sounds fine. The script is fine, the pacing is fine. But the story, such as it tells, instead of serving to uplift the human spirit, drags it through the mud and leaves one feeling unclean. Rather than embrace our shared humanity, all I wanted to do in the end was avert my eyes from the embarrassing spectacle.","October 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 224 of 408 people (55%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","55","224","408","13","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linesinanotebook/recommended/303210/","linesinanotebook","blanknotebook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linesinanotebook/","40 products in account","The Beginner's Guide is an important title. It is also a flawed title. It amazes and induces deep catharsis at its best, and removes you from the experience at its worst, but regardless, it is an important title. Leto Atreides II has written an excellent criticism of its failings, but I disagree with a few of those. I still contend that The Beginner's Guide is daring in ways that The Stanley Parable wasn't.\n\nAt its heart, this is a very different game from The Stanley Parable. Where the latter game is, in my mind, a heady critique of the illusion of player agency and artificial "freedom," The Beginner's Guide seems more concerned with delving into the act of creation, rather than the creation itself, and in turn the true "ownership" of that creation once it leaves its author's hands.\n\nThe author, in this case, is the enigmatic "Coda," and is also the game's primary concern. Wreden plays a fictionalized version of himself, acting as your guide through Coda's many odd and striking interactive pieces. What initially offput me was the frequency with which Wreden interjected to present his own interpretations of the events on screen, even going as far as to change aspects of the game for the player's convenience - tearing down walls and bypassing labyrinths, speeding you through sections that weren't meant to be sped through and even, as you learn in an enormous revelation toward the end of the game, placing lampposts to impose an "goal" to many of Coda's games. To a certain extent, it felt to me like Wreden was violating these personal spaces of Coda's without any means for him/her to object; there was something dirty about the whole thing. And it's those moments and revelations in which The Beginner's Guide truly becomes important, as a visceral, personal plea to consider the human behind the games. It's a piece which cannot be appreciated in a single playthrough; going back through with full knowledge of those revelations is essential to understanding Wreden as a character, and even as an artist himself.\n\nLike any work, The Beginner's Guide is not without its flaws. There are certainly red herrings and curiousities strewn about several of the games which ultimately lead to nothing, and the game's linearity hampers the pace in several of the more open sections. There are also a few games that seem to be leading toward an idea, but ultimately fall short (then, perhaps that's the point?) There are a few more minor gripes, but they're largely overshadowed by the fantastic ideas at play.\n\nSome will not connect with this game. Some will inevitably compare it to The Stanley Parable and dismiss it for being so linear. Those are perfectly valid opinions. But if the discussion generated here is any indication, its release is certainly vital in some respect.\n\nI still think frequently about what I experienced in this game. I find myself coming back to the themes and my own reactions to them again and again, and it feels as though something in me has been moved profoundly. That, to me, is the mark of great art.","October 5, 2015","true","5.6"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

Its just my opinion.  I do not think this is a good game.\n\nThe game presents a story of the narrator interpreting the creative work of a friend who ultimately cut contact with him over his interpretation of the works and mis-assumption that creative works are necessarily a reflection of their creator.   Not enough information here is presented to know if the story is true, or what parts of the story may or may not be accurate.  As such, I am taking the game on face value, just the story as it is presented.\n\nThe game presents no real meaningful discussion on its premise, just imagery and an emotional narrative about how the narrator felt about the 'games' his friend made and how it caused a falling out (or more accurate to say, interactive creative works absent of themes of play structure).  The problem is that the story just seems to boil down to two people who did not really agree or understand each other about one of their creative expressions, and nothing more.  You are not given enough information to make any sort of reasonable assumption on what transpired, or gain insigh about how the two interacted.  The Beginner's Guide presents no meaningful discussion of its own on the topic either.  Its 1.5 hours of someone saying 'this inspired me then I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the guy who made it.'  Does it seem like I'm repeating myself?  I can't think of how else to say it.  Theres nothing else to the story but that.\n\nThe 'games' made by the narrator's friend are shown to you in game and you are free to poke around them, but they aren't particularly meaningful or thought provoking.  Maybe its because I don't identify with the presented themes of idolization, creative burnout, drama, social anxiety, or whatever else people seem to see in this game.  Maybe it's because the presentation is too shallow.  The narrative states that the 'games' made by the narrator's friend were never made to be shown to other people.  This probably explains why.  Maybe its because the themes seem to be the struggle of an immature person who isn't very good at figuring out his life or approaching things logically, perhaps why the game is titled 'The Beginner's Guide'.  This isn't a jab at the creator if the story is true.  Young people are immature because they are inexperienced, emotional relationships cloud logic, and so forth.  Thats just how things are, and that's not a character flaw on anyone.  But its not a situation that appeals to me.  I see it and on top of the narrative and presentation being too thin, it just does not appeal to me.\n\nSo overall, I don't recommend it.  I bought the game at $6 and felt like the narrative presented was so lacking that my time was wasted.  I requested a refund.  I cannot believe that he would ask $10 for this title, and I don't even think it would be worth your time at $5.  The value of your dollar is up to you, and my opinions often run contrary of popular ones.  Feel free to dismiss my review, and if you buy The Beginner's Guide I hope that you enjoy yourself even if I did not.\n\n\nI want to put this last because it is somewhat tangential to my review.  To top off the rest of what I have said, the non-fictional potential of the narrative puts the game in a possibly negative light.  The narrative says that the games presented in The Beginner's Guide are ones that the narrators friend explicitly forbade the narrator from sharing and that he put them in the game as a cry out to the friend who severed contact.  This puts the act of putting them in this game into moral and legal question.  Obviously the narrative is, once again, incomplete.  The narrative states information about events that occured at just one point in time, and that may have changed in events not included in the narrative.  I can only assume that permission was given or legal concerns accounted for, because otherwise The Beginner's Guide shouldn't be on steam.  If it was the creator's intent to evoke this reaction with the story, it seems strange.  Am to assume that the narrator's story is true and the creator of The Beginner's guide has done something reprehensible and immorral?  If not, why is it trying to make me think it is?  It seems underhanded, and just underscores how the game is so badly lacking.","January 6","false","2.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","2"

But this premise is completely hamstrung by its underwhelming execution. Taken as a work of fiction, the story is clumsy and unsure of how to develop itself past the first 30 minutes. Taken as a work of non-fiction, the narrator comes off as an unsympathetic, self-centered/self-pitying, uninteresting jerk. The emotional aspects of the work lack subtlety and border  on melodrama. The narrator's lack of voice acting talent makes the weak script come off as overly whiney.\n\nThe visuals and "set design" are fantastic, though.

Effectively utilising a "House of Leaves" like layered narrative in a way I've not previously come across in a game, The Beginner's Guide examines the need for social validation at its extremes, here in the context of the games developer and the player. Throughout it feels like a deeply personal work from its creator (whoever that may be!), and at times you almost feel like you're actually trespassing on someone else's personal space (just as the narrator is doing to Coda). Like Davey Wredon's previous "The Stanley Parable", The Beginner's Guide pushes the boundaries of what a game can be in adopting storytelling techniques not commonly seen in games.

It is designed to make you think about yourself and, for lack of a better phrase, the human condition. What made the Stanley's Parable great was a combination of factors. First off, a great narrator and dialogue. It kept you interested in the game, and the humor he offered kept you engaged during those long, empty hallways you went through. It made you forget about the boring parts of the game like that. Secondly, the options. When you chose a path, you chose it, and when you would ultimately learn what that told you about yourself, it made sense, because YOU chose it.\n\nNow to this mess. It is completely linear. Not inherently a bad thing. You follow the narrative of the creator, also the narrator, a very uninteresting man (I think the goal was for it to be more relatable that way), through his friend's games. The problem is, with all of this, through the 90 minutes you play it, you play through EXTREMELY uninteresting landscapes, with nothing but the narrator's boring, dreary voice the whole time. The whole game I was just thinking, "Okay I'll make it through this part THEN it will be interesting." It never did.\n\nI made it to the end of the game. But WAIT! It could be worth it if the message is just strong enough! It could tie it all together! No. Literally, (without spoiling anything), it does not share a message, but rather just tells you everything you saw in the game was wrong just for the sake of putting a spin, and then it's over. Nothing learned. Nothing gained. I just played through the game for a twist at the end so I can say, "MAN I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNINTERESTING AND CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO MY LIFE."\n\nIn the end, the message I took from the game was "Don't judge a book by it's cover. Or it's contents. It's all wrong. Ask the author what it really means." Obviously someone's work would convey something about them or the meaning, but this tells you to do the opposite and just, not think.\n\nI'm really disapointed in this game. I really wanted it to be great. But it wasn't.","October 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Two of my favorite game developers.\n\nI wish there were an option for giving this a sideways thumb as I can't easily recommend my experience with this game and it is a game. I'm not about to have that argument. But its.. lacking. I feel personally, that these things have been said before.\n\nNow, is this game art? Are games art? I don't care, I'm not here to tell you that. What I can tell you is that this is an interactive guide though some builds of games that “coda” made while a narrator explains what the build is, what it was and what his own interpretations of why design choice “X” was made over design choice “Y”\n\nIts hard to explain; and despite what you've likely heard. While it does not make sense on its face, around the 1 hour mark I felt I had an understanding of what the narrator was trying to convey. At least, to my satisfaction. In short, being creative... as well as existing derives its meaning from those who give it meaning. There is no external force pushing you forward, there is only you and your decisions living in the now, the present.\n\nWhy is that there? Ask 10 different people and its likely you'll get 10 different responses.\n\nIts a reflection piece summed up best in a quote from BioShock 2 (which I know Ken Levine had nothing if very little to do with BioShock 2 forgive me) made by the character Eleanor Lamb\n\n“Love is just a chemical, we give it meaning by choice”","October 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

Unlike SP, where you are given a story which you can shape and remodel as you make several choices, you're left here with a really linear storyline you can't interact at all with.\nThis game is basically like this:\n"Here's the story, walk to the end and remember to solve a few puzzles while you're at it"\n\nThis game is so OBSESSED with its unique and only story that you can actually explore a bit the surroundings of some maps, only to be told by the narrator itself that basically "doing X won't take you to Y" several times, as if it had been done just to mock off everyone who was waiting for a game akin to SP (!).\n\nSo yeah, this is a BAD game with a GOOD plot, that fails where The Stanley Parable succeeded: creating a game whose main focus was the story while still retaining some bit of entertainment and/or extra stuff and such to make you actually WANT to play the game even with its lack of proper gameplay.\n\nIn The Stanley Parable, you get to hear very hilarious humour as you make the story itself yours, familiarize with the only other character in the game and still find the usual morale at the end;\nIn The Beginner's Guide, all you get is jogging time with an obnoxious narrator that actually laughs at your (pitiful) attempts at finding something to make the game more... gamey.\n\nAnd just for the record, one could think that comparing this game to The Stanley Parable might not be a good idea, but then again, this game would still be just a walking simulator with a story that either gets to you or bores you to death while you can't find anything else to entertain yourself with in there.\n\n5/10","March 27","false","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Unfortunately I am kind of disappointed by it. I was prepared that it probably would be a little weird at times like TSP, but after playing the game I was left with this feeling like 'that was it?!?' 'really, that was it??!??'. I have been walking around in this game, hoping it would eventually lead to something, or the game would start right after this very long introduction, but no. So, curious to know if I was the only one out here with this feeling, I started reading some reviews and comments, everyone seemed to praise this game. It apparently made most people emotional, reflecting on their lives and so on.. But a fair number of people also experienced this game same way I did, glad it's not just me. So it's hard to say if I would recommend this game to anyone simply because there's no way of telling if you'll like it before you play it. It seems to me you have to experience the entire game to see if it does something for you personally. I checked 'No' because of my own experience and because I think he should release it for less money, like a symbolic 1 euro/dollar/pound/.. I know this sounds really cheap, but yeah I do think I paid too much for this. But as for now, I'll just let it all sink in for a while, maybe play it again someday, maybe not.","October 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","28","49","0","0"

I related to this game as an creator, as an author, as fan of someone else's work, as a friend, as reviewer and the most importantly, as a human being. I was wondering what people think about me when they read my work. How they try to "catch" the glimpse of an author between the lines.

I did, and an hour and a half later I felt very satisfied with my experience. So why am I not recommending this game? Well that's just it. It's not really a 'game.' Perhaps if this game was $1.30 or even free I'd recommend it, but it's not. Spoole's Law (that's what I'm calling it) dictates that for every dollar you spend on a game, you should get at least one hour of quality play time. This doesn't even come close to meeting that.\n\nOk, so this was genuinely enjoyable. At some points it felt reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I was alright with that. Problem is, this game is incredibly pretentious (among other things). I feel Davey did a genuinely rude thing by making this, and I don't want to reveal why because it would ruin the experience of the game. Many people are overreacting and saying this game is deep, or really sad, but it's painfully obvious those people just stretch their reactions to garner respect/attention. I saw one Irish guy cry over this game. Really? I guess part of the reason I'm incapable of seeing this game as sad is that I've gone through something similar to Coda. Worked down to the base level I've struggled immensely with depression, and I'm mostly past it now. I'm sick of these ♥♥♥♥ing morons putting on the facade of "oh, this is sad because blah blah blah" shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. If you can't relate to something, don't even pretend to understand it. This game is much better as a character study of a depressed game developer telling his story than a pretentious think piece of a rude friend who tries make everything about himself.\n\nI'd give this game an 7/10, but it's not worth the money right now.

There’s a lot to process and possibly more than I think I’ll be able to get to here. I’ll be interested in replaying it and seeing where things stand from there, but for now this is what I’ve taken away from the game.\n\nI heard good things about The Beginner’s Guide but not any details about what it was. At first I assumed it was a video game about being a rogue leftover part of a game in the middle of being made (The Magic Circle, I think) so as it turned out I knew even less than I thought about the game. It’s by Davey Wreden who made The Stanley Parable, a fantastic game which my brother introduced me to the demo of by insisting it was entirely different to the game itself. It was and the game is something fantastic to experience. This is a little along those lines as far as using the mechanics of a video game to tell a story.\n\nThe game stars one speaking character; Davey Wreden. He narrates the games which make up The Beginner’s Guide, acting as a kind of documentary of the works of a person called Coda. Coda’s a character whose personality and backstory is only provided by the commentary of Davey and the designs you walk through. I guess in a way you are the third character as the audience member walking through Coda’s world, curated by Davey.\n\nTo start off with, you’re wandering a Counter Strike map designed by Coda and right away there are things wrong with it, only visible once you start moving within the world. I knew a few people who tinkered with CS back in the day and it places this designer firmly in the era of people modding games that I know of. The errors look like they could be due to a first-timer learning what they’re doing but Davey tells us of recurring themes in the work of Coda. There are floating boxes, strange cubes and dead ends. It’s alienating and within or without the fiction it’s entirely on purpose to set the tone. We are not a person in the world, we’re a witness to a game being designed.\n\nOnce you have had a bit of a search and heard what Davey has to say, we skip ahead in time to the next project of Coda’s. It’s a space game with a non-working gun and an actual maze. Again, it’s something an amateur or an artist may have made and Davey has his own insights. The look of the levels are oddly charming in the same way that I find using the old graphics as to see how the original looked back in the day. There’s a moment where you die and Davey talks about Coda’s intent simply be that you die, only he experienced a bug which he replicates. You’re elevated into the air and can see the maze, the ship, all without a ceiling and the edges of the game world. There are sharp corners on the background and space itself is just a box you’re in. This is important, this change of perspective.\n\nThe narrative of The Beginner’s Guide is presented through the game’s mechanics, but on several levels. One of the next games is one where you play a character who can only move backwards through a level. This section is something which I could imagine standing on its own easily enough and has messages unique to the game as well as to the greater narrative. It reminded me a little of Passage which was a game asking whether you want freedom with loneliness or companionship with restriction. There was no right answer in that game. This one the restriction’s a little more linear and you switch between the ability to see what’s ahead or the ability to move without seeing to navigate. Again, this is important. All of it is. There are puzzles, but not many, this is more of a journey than anything else, but a ‘walking game’ which uses the minimal mechanics of the game to its’ advantage. In games like Dear Esther, you would be in awe of a heavily detailed world but at a loss of what exactly to do between chunks of narration. Here, the worlds are small and bite-sized, the worlds can be as small as a single room or massive and awe-inspiring.\n\nDavey talks of the grander designs being experimented with and the meaning behind it all, as well as his experiences with Coda in real life. His interpretation of things like the series of small prison games, the domesticity of one game. There are recurring styles presented and some aspects evolve which reflects Coda’s growth as a person. His voice is only really experienced by little floating circles in one level and the dialogue options in a handful of games. Otherwise we’ve got the mechanics and Davey’s accounts as all you have to go on.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see and for ninety minutes as a documentary, fake or otherwise, it makes for a great use of the medium. The games themselves are fairly small and definite works in progress, but there’s something which has inspired the narrator and hearing his analysis of it helps drive us through. And this is where we get to the spoilers.\n\nI don't know how this community is with spoilers, so I'm going to link to my site where the rest of the information is. There are a couple of flips in the narrative where it made me think deeply about one thing, then turned it round and made it all new again, all in a really short game. It's impressive and sticks with you. As I said, this all goes to spoilers. I hope you don't mind being shielded from them by me linking to my site here.\n\nhttp://fakedtales.com/2015/10/15/the-beginners-guide-review/","October 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

What an amazing experience.\n\nThe beginners guide hit me hard. I've seen such a tragic story told in such a creative way. Coda is a game developer. The story is told through narration over every game he has made. Link's between his games and his life are made by the narrator. The narrators just tells the story so incredibly well and it had me hooked the whole way through. I can't go into too many details about the story due to spoilers but I loved it.\n\nThere's not really a whole lot to the beginners guide aside from the storytelling. Gameplay wise there isn't really anything apart from a walking simulator. But if your looking for a game solely for the story, like me, then the beginners guide is definitely for you.\n\nThe biggest issue with the beginners guide is the game is very short taking only around 1.5 hours to complete. But I feel this length is perfect. The story is told without rushing and any longer and I would have gotten bored.\n\nHonestly I had no idea what I was expecting when I went into the beginners guide, but i'm so glad I purchased it. It's an incredible experience that will probably go down to me as being the best storytelling in a video game.\n\nObviously this game isn't for everyone.

It's quite a sad story, but it does get kinda boring and it almost felt like it was shrouded with pseudo-intellectual talk that isn't worth the $6.50. If you're thinking of buying this game, all you do is walk around in unfinished levels while the narrator talks about his feelings and thoughts about Coda and his game development. Each "game" is merely just a different level that either makes no sense, requires cheats to pass obstacles or is a metaphor for some emotion.\n\nHowever, I just couldn't get immersed in it. I do sympathise with the narrator, which is exactly why I feel bad about requesting a refund and  giving this a negative review, but that doesn't mean I hated this game at all. In fact, I think buying it did give a positive outcome in some ways, it was insightful - at times. But I didn't find it worth my time.\n\nAlthough that could be because I've already passed a point in my life where these thoughts and emotions are unnecessary, or that I have different problems and emotional struggles that require more work rather than what the narrator is suggesting.\n\nYou may like this game and be able to learn a lot from it. I couldn't (for a number reasons) which is why I'm leaving this review, as well as the price of the game (as a low-income earner) leaving me expecting more as I didn't gain much joy or experience from 2 hours of walking.\n\nAt least some people will find something of value in this story/experience.

He's right about one thing; he has some emotional issues he needs to sort out.\n\nIn conclusion, your door puzzle wasn't that fascinating or challenging, which clearly you wished/hoped/thought it was based on\n1. your repeated use of it (despite trying to defuse the obviousness by confronting the issue head on through your naration) and\n2. your "notes" you left in your game about how difficult the challenge is and oh goodness developers please help!\n\nUltimately the best word to describe the game brings us back to "Contrived".\n\nThe Stanley Parable was great. Fantastic even. Borderline genius (but not genius).

But it is certainly not worth 10$, probably not with 5$, maybe 2.50$, and I would probably recommend it if it were free.\n\nI also want anyone going into this game to know that they might not have some sort of moving experience from it. The tropes and ideas it displays are all things any mature person has probably already encountered, and hopefully worked thru, displayed in a somewhat interesting way and new way. The sort-of underlying meanings and morals of the story are nothing new from your after school specials, just communicated differently.\n\n---That's pretty much it for the main review but I do have my own interpretation as to whether one might get something special out of the game, so if that interests you read on.---\n\nIt seems to me the game indulges two sorta psyches.\nIf introversion and extroversion were laid out on a scale of 1-10 (since very few are complete introverts of extroverts)\nWith the lower spectrum being introversion and the higher spectrum being extroversion, the game caters to those who land on the outer edges of the scale.\nSo if you are a 1-3 introvert, like have legitimate difficulties interacting with people,\nor a 8-10 extrovert, can't stand to not interact with people,\nthen I think you might have a deep experience with this game.\nHowever if you are someone more so in the middle, like I feel myself to be, then there's not much for you in this game.\n\nAt least that's my interpretation.","December 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you're looking for a fun game then don't bother, as it essentially lacks any game mechanics. It's quite short, meaning that the $10 asking price will not be worth it to many people. It also is very different from The Stanley Parable, and in fact it is very far from comedic, so fans of that might wind up disappointed as well.\n\nIt's a game that is difficult to explain without revealing some aspects of it and spoiling the whole thing, and it's best to go in totally blind. Blind faith is hard to sell, however, so if you're not willing to take a risk don't bother. It appeals to a niche audience that finds the medium of video games capible of being captivating and telling good stories without being a traditional "game," and this particular story heavily benifits from having some limited interactivity. If that sounds pretentious or uninteresting then stay far, far away. Others, however, might find something that resonates with them, as I and several others have.\n\nIt's an ambitious game, but it's also very small and personal. It finds a balance, and it's beautiful. It might even be the best "walking simulator" game to date, although that might not be fair because it's so different than any of those games that came before it.\n\nIn short, don't buy it unless you are fine with spending $10 on a story. It is, however, a damn fine story if you can buy into it.","October 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But I was moved & had experienced something real within a game enviroment. Something that doesn't happen so often. Most of the time we are aware that our feelings are being manipulated by the media we have chosen, be it music, books, films or games. "The Beginner's Guide" is both art & a form of letter, thrown out there for the right ones to get.\n\nIt is not really a game, but in a sense it is a puzzle. If you expect a game though, you may be frustrated with what it offers. It is nothing like the "Stanley Parable". In fact to link the two titles together, as many promotions and trailers have done, is a huge mistake & doesn't do this title any favours. This isn't for everyone.\n\nIt starts off almost like a documentary & ends on a highly personal, emotional note. Like someone opening a floodgate of inner thoughts that aren't even filtered or sorted, & you're left with sorting out your own emotional response to it.\nIt is a unique experience, for better or for worse, depending on how you take it, or what you read into it.\n\nIt made me think about what I love so much about games generally. That you usually have clear goals, even if they sometimes are hard to achieve, you have goals, solutions, you reach an end. You feel accomplishment. Unlike life, which doesn't have clear goals, a given path, right or wrong, even when you might think it does. Life and all it's variables are infinitely more complex than anything else we experience, it's the sum of everything, and it continues on until we die, whether we follow lines & achieve goals along the way or not. That's why playing games can be such a comfort at times. Little pieces of clarity amids the sometimes chaotic feelings one has as a human being.\n\n"The Beginner's Guide" is not comforting to experience, but it feels important, & it enriched me. And therefor I recommend it.","January 17","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then this game is for you.\n(Please note the game wouldn't launch for me. I had to check the Steam forums and add launch parametres -novid -window -noborder to get it running.)\n\nLet me start with the bottom line.\nIs this game suitable for me?\nDon't expect anything like The Stanley Parable, it's nothing like it.\nThis game isn't meant to be fun or enjoyable, it's rather supposed to make you think and feel. I'll let you decide if that's for you.\nIn terms of gameplay, this is very much a walking simulator. As the Steam store description says, it has no play mechanics, no goals or objectives. It is basically a guided tour. You walk around, look and listen, and click on stuff.\n90-120 minutes gameplay, and no replay value.\nIt touches on themes of creativity, friendship, depression, anxiety, obsession, dependency, and projection. If it clicks with you, it will keep you thinking for a long time. It will remind you of people you know, maybe yourself. Remind you of situations you've lived.\nI said earlier that it's nothing like The Stanley Parable. But inevitably, people will compare the two. They both are "games about games" and they both feature walking around listening to narration. And in a way, the two are related. You can't help it - the same person is behind both.\n\nThe fiction of The Beginner's Guide (TBG) is that it's a guided tour by the developer, Davey Wreden. "Davey" (I use the quotes to denote the in-game Davey Wreden) narrates directly to us, the players, as he takes us through a compilation of small games made by a friend of his nicknamed "Coda". "Davey" says he compiled and released these games, in the form of TBG, in order to encourage Coda to start making games again after he stopped, and to help him out of a depression.\n\n"Davey" clearly admires Coda's work, pointing out all sorts of ideas, patterns and themes in Coda's games, and wondering at the thoughts and feelings that gave birth to them.\nThrough the tour, we get to know Coda and "Davey" better.\n\nIt's difficult to say much more about TBG without spoiling anything. What I've written above will have to be enough for you to decide if you want it.\n\nNow I'll continue with my opinions on the game with major, complete spoilers.\n\nSPOILERS FOLLOW.\n\n\nNo, seriously, there's major spoilers after this. If you're at all interested in TBG, don't read any further.\n\nAre you sure?\nOkay, I'll continue now.\n\nReally, really sure? No going back after this. I just want to be certain you know what you're getting yourself into.\nAlright, here we go.\n\nTBG really is about The Stanley Parable. Rather, it's about Davey Wreden's conflicted feelings after the huge success of TSP. On the one hand he felt a sort of disconnection from his creation because it was in the hands of so many people who saw their own meanings in it, and on the other hand he craved every bit of admiration that came his way. "Coda" and TBG's version of "Davey" are two sides of the real-life Davey Wreden, and TBG's "Davey" is also an avatar of the masses.\n\nWreden details his post-TSP feelings in this blog post:\nhttp://www.galactic-cafe.com/2014/02/game-of-the-year/\n\nBut what I also liked about TBG is that it also has a much broader interpretation. Several in fact.\n\n"Davey" fawns over Coda's games and finds all kinds of meaningful, intellectual, emotional themes in his works. But they're really nothing but a bunch of unoriginal, unfinished games. "Davey" projects his own anxieties and depression onto Coda, becoming dependent. This shows between the lines in his narration, and then is practically blared at us by the end. One of the game's poor points - Wreden abandons all subtlety and spoonfeeds us at the end of the game.\n\nSo it's about overanalytical fans who see meaning that is not there, and ascribe their own emotions to an artist's work. "Stop putting lampposts in my games" was the most chilling line in the game.\n\nTBG is also about perspective in relationships. This is apparent in The Tower chapter, where Coda addresses "Davey" directly, making it clear that he does not consider him a friend, that "Davey" makes him physically ill, and that "Davey" seems to think this is all about himself. This comes as a shock because "Davey" makes it seem like he and Coda are good friends, throughout the games.\n\nOn top of that, TBG is about how we sometimes go about helping people in all the wrong ways, because we make assumptions and act selfishly while thinking we are being altruistic. It's about how we put emotional lampposts in peoples' lives.\n\nTBG may be heavy-handed, but I feel that's a result of the weight of Wreden's frustration that he felt compelled to portray and lay bare.\nAnd in a contradiction to itself, TBG will make you assign your own meaning to it. It's inevitable.\n\nYeah, I'd say I recommend this. It's food for thought, and it's an admirable portrait of a creator.","March 26","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Slow paced and disappointment in character development do make the title quite fitting as you could interpret it as ''existentialism and introspection for dummies''. It's interesting and it makes you long to know what is behind the next door but every time it just leaves a bitter taste because it could have been so much more and with a little more thought it surely could have blown some minds (including mine) but it just feels so shallow and ultimately even kind of boring.\n\nThe two characters involved (Coda and Davey) feel relatable but the development just isn't there to make them feel like real people you can actually root for or against. It's kind of interesting while the game lasts but I just feel like another 1.5 hours where more depth and better pacing (though the strange pace does feel kinda cool) was implimented could have made this more complete. Just like this review would've been even better if I didn't just repeat the same two points but actually added something more to it instead of just making it seem that way by being constructive the second time around.\n\n\nBut you can still buy it so you can brag to your friends about the esoteric meaning you've found in this, I mean surely they'll respect you for it no matter what because it's an interpretation of ''art'' which makes you seem ridiculously deep to all of the other attention♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nFree this game would be a 5.5/10, for the price at which I bought it; 2/10 unfortunately. Would not recommend but if you can pick it up for -90% you could definitely do worse for that money.","October 6, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Shallow, short analysis of the themes and recurring icons throughout the pieces you explore. And none of it really has any effect on the greater story. Things start to move along eventually... a few minutes from the end.\n\nGiven the "chapters" are supposed to be an indie developer's work, they're all pretty small and reuse the same few assets over and over throughout the game. This isn't an expansive or visually impressive work. It's trying to get by on its storytelling alone, and that story falls well short of the price point.\n\nIt felt more like something you'd find on sale for $2.99 three months after a game jam when the developers had polished up a proof of concept... And that's about all I'd recommend paying for it. Given that it's an hour and a half on rails, I'd say you'd be better off spending your money on a movie ticket and catching something with a much more developed story like Scream 5 or one of the Jackass movies.","December 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The first map Coda made was loaded up for me to walk around and observe- a very small Counter Strike desert map with some floating crates and odd things like that. From there, The Narrator goes on to show you the rest of Coda's games that he made in the order that he made them, showing the months and years they were made between loading screens. Some games required to be modified so one can actually get somewhere instead of being stuck forever, and I'm just going to skip to the last game that Code made that The Narrator showcased.\n\nIn the last map, Coda blamed The Narrator for what happened to him and how he tried to "help" by showing all of his games to His friends and how they genuinely showed fascination at his work. Coda just didn't want him to interfere with his personal work and at the end of the map, which is IMPOSSIBLE to beat without either having to modify it or just have a lot of time on your hands (scratch that, it really is impossible to beat unless you have hax).\n\nSo in short, Coda blamed The Narrator for all that has happened to him and has stopped making games since, and He is genuinely sorry for whatever he did to destroy his privacy. It slowly delved more into sadness as more delicate topics were touched upon that weren't supposed to be rummaged through and nobody knows why Coda puts the same things into each game (if you play the game, you will find out what I'm talking about).

Unfortunately, it seems that my expectations for the game overhyped me and gave me a very different idea of what this game is really about.\n\nThis game is a story.  It's not really a game in any traditional sense. It's an aparently true story about the developer of the game and his friend, and the relationship they had, and the games that they made.  When I say this isn't really a game, I mean that the only real mechanics of the game are walking around and hitting button promps every now and then.  While you do these things, the game's narration plays in the background and adapts to your actions.  Some of the 'levels' of the game are actually pretty intresting, and I have to admit, the ending of the game got me.  However, this game can be completed in like 2 hours with very little replay value.  It's more like a library of levels, or like reading through the letters of two pen pals.\n\nI would recomend this game only if the premise of this game interests you and if it's on sale.  I would say this is a better game then other walking simulators like Dear Esther, but not an amazing game overall.  I don't regret buying it, but this game is not what I expected and not really advertised well (to be fair it would be very hard to advertise a game like this).  Honestly as I'm writing this review I think I'm convincing myself more and more that I enjoyed the game, but I'm sticking to my inital impressions.","April 24","false","1.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

Simulation, maybe. In games, you can do things. Make decissions, for example. In this "game" however, all you can do is walk along the path laid out before you and do what you are told to while listening to the narrator, who is trying to deliver a message while you walk. That message doesn't feel "delivered", but forced onto you. A lot of people wrote about this game touching them and speaking to them because they have depression and what not - yeah, so do I, pittily, but still this game is nothing but boring to me.\nSpoiler alert:  Not to mention that the whole "look at the depression and anxiety"-theme turns out to not actually be the message that the developer wanted to deliver, so to all those people who dug into that - sorry, but please replay the last chapter.\nSince every walkthrough is exactly like the last, the replay-value ist exactly zero.\nSorry, but I consider the money I payed for this wasted.","April 15","false","1.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

This is an experience, and truly a masterpiece in its own way.\n\nThere isn't a way to truly describe how this game will make you feel. Everyone is different, which is one of the story's themes ironically. At least that's how I interpereted it. If you get this game (and I whole-heartedly reccommend you do) please write down what you thought of it, have a friend play it, share your thoughts and experiences.\n\nThe atmosphere is superb, I was completely invested whilst playing, and while it was short for what it was, it never seemed to overstay its welcome. Although I must say at times, you really wish it would end, but not in a bad way. The tone gets a bit spooky, but don't worry, there is nothing actually scary. The atmosphere is just so good that you think there is! It's difficult to describe with words. which is why you should experience this gem yourself.\n\nFor its short playtime, I would definitely reccommend you wait for a sale however. Spooky Halloween sale is coming up, no doubt about it, so pick it up then.","October 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game, although being short, has a pretty powerful story of the Narrator trying to interpret the meaning of the many games and areas that were created by his friend.  Overall I would say that It is worth the price of admission (Basically the cost of a good movie!)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/osvaldo_crk/recommended/303210/","osvaldo_crk","Jovahkiin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/osvaldo_crk/","105 products in account","This is an apologetic review. I have to admit that my last negative review for this game was looking at it through the wrong scope, and after a long discussion with a friend and some research I can finally make a more educated analysis about the game. It will be long to discuss as many points as possible but I’ll make sure to add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nFirst of all let’s take a moment to read my past review and see why didn’t I like the game, and how is it related to other opinions here on the store page for The Beginners Guide.\nOriginally posted by Jovahkiin: This is not The Stanley Parable. You have no choice to make, this is as linear as it gets. I have no problems with linear games... If they are good. This game even get its few artistic "deep meaning moments" at times, but it's not a life changing narrative, with is what is being sold as.\n\nBuy if you don't mind an hour and a half, mediocre experience. To add to this, the game as no replayability. See a let’s play of the game, and get done with it.That’s it. That’s all I wrote on my first review for the game, and now we are going to discuss why I was wrong, and it all comes to this:\n\nExpectations\nWhile discussing, my friend and I noticed that everyone was being harsh against the game for not being like The Stanley Parable, not living up to its standards. To be honest the trailer is a little deceiving, it made me have a perception of a more open-ended game. Even I fell for the trap that are expectations. When you expect something that is very much different product you are very likely to end up ruining the experience for you.\nSo what can I expect from the game may you ask? Well, I was right about that one point, don’t expect The Stanley Parable, if you need more specificity don’t expect a funny open ended storyline. I also said to not expect a “life changing narrative”, this is also true, but bear with me for a second. SPOILER ALERT:  the story revolves around Coda, and Dave, and the deterioration of each other’s emotional health and relationship as friends within the events on the story. If you have looked for an answer for the story already, you may know that Coda is actually Dave, and Dave in the game mostly represents us the players.  Once Dave makes his GOTY awarded game, he went into a depression in which he writes in about here:\n\nhttp://www.galactic-cafe.com/2014/02/game-of-the-year/\n\nThe point I’m trying to make is that the story you see on The Beginners Guide is a direct reflection of the developer’s emotions at a point of his life. The game is not aiming to change the way you think from now on, it’s simply asking for a little empathy, a little bit of understanding. If you start complaining about how the lack of gameplay mechanics suck on this game, you are completely missing the entire point of the game. It’s not about you, it’s about Coda, and it is about Dave.\n\nI have apologize for my first review, I just didn’t knew… I also have to give credit to my friend Él Cabrony, which even after I convinced him that the game sucked, he agreed to played it anyways. To be honest I wanted him to play it, even when I told his it was bad, I think I subconsciously liked it and wanted to know his opinion about it. After that he apparently really liked the game and went on to have a discussion with me on what makes a game good, etc.\nGoing on a more general side on why you should play the game:\nThe game soundtrack is awesome!\nIt’s not too long of a game.\nThe ending is beautiful.Honest opinion of what I did not like about the game.\nI didn’t like the narrator shaping the story instead of letting the game tell the story by its own. But I guess that would clash with everything I said in this review about expectations. TL;DR:\nThe Game is Good is you know what to expect.","January 20","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't want to give too much away because it's better experienced than told, but this is a narrated anthology of short first-person games, narrated by Davey Wreden, who tells us that these are games created by a friend of his who is only referred to as Coda.\n\nCloser to being an installation piece than a traditional game, this is nonetheless an immersive and fascinating experience that dwells on psychology, loneliness, unreliability, and the assumptions we make about others.  I can't think of the last time I enjoyed a game this short this much.\n\nYou'll finish this fast, but it will stay with you long after you do.  Don't get it if you're looking for a traditional first person game, be it shoot em up or puzzle.  There is a question being asked and answered here, but not by any traditional game mechanic.

I love the developer and I loved The Stanley Parable but I just can't rightfully recommend this game.\n\nLet me just start off by pointing out the price, as it is slightly pivotal. It's $10 ($6 if you're getting this during the winter sale. as I did) for about an hour and a half to two hours of gameplay. And while I understand that The Stanley Parable did this as well, it did this in a way that even once you've completed some of the stories there is still more dialogue and more to explore and more to be done, and it is genuinely fun.\n\nIn this "game" (I am not using quotes to undermine it, merely because it is more an interactive story) you follow a linear path through the past games of a creator, told by a narrorator who just so happens to be Davey, the creator of both of these games.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\nTowards the end of the story it becomes more and more clear that he was searching for meaning where meaning was not, and that this game did not delve into the troubles of the fictional character "Coda", but instead into the mind of the developer himself and his struggles with self worth.\n\nAnd while this game is good for what it is, it has a very select audience. In my personal opinion, I would have most likely given a more positive review for this "game" had it been only a few dollars, but this much money demands a game, or at least some replay value, that just isn't there.\n\nIn all honesty, if you want to play this "game", save your money and go watch a full playthrough on YouTube, you get the same effect and get to see everything this game has to offer without spending the money on it.","December 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coda worked for himself in a big building where he was a game programmer and developer. Coda's job was simple: he sat at his desk in his room, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Ideas came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Coda did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Coda relished every moment that the ideas came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.\n\nAnd Coda was happy.\n\nAnd then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Coda. Something he would never quite forget.\n\nAside from the fitting Stanley Parable joke, this game really does speak for any artist who struggle with depression as well as the negative impacts of game developement (or rather just anything artistic in general) it can have on one's life.

It tells a very relatable and evocotive tale. IT actually hit me kind of hard because "Coda" is similar to an old friend, my story with him had a similar resolution to Coda's final message. Also While I particularly liked the "Lecture" level, and do think the game is worth playing, I cannot give it a positive review for a few reasons.\n\nPros:\n-Compelling story\n-Some cool levels\n-Very relatable themes and message\n-Intersting concepts\n-Well narrated\n-Good comentary on life, people relationships, and game design\n-Something that has never been tried befroe\n\nCons:\n-Very short (Took me 90 minutes)\n-No replayability\n-Extremely linear\n-No difficulty, No death, no puzzle solving (except one really obvious one)\n-Player choices are rare and have literally no effect on the story or anything\n-Kept freezing when loading voice over lines\n-Levels are short and mostly filled with empty content\n-Game self referencing is heavy handed (narrator tells you how to feel about what you are seeing)\n-Hard to suspend disbelief that a real person made these games, they feel extremely manufactured.\n-Repetetive and becomes shallow at times.\n-No Achievements or Easter Eggs (That I found, other than the 3 dots)\n-Nothing interesting to see in the levels except what you are supposed to for the main story (wandering off the path yeilds nothing of interest)\n-$10 (This is the big one, If this game were $5 I would give it a positive review, but it is too little for the price)\n\nOverall worth playing, but not worth buying IMO.

It's highly disappointing as it was made by the same guy as the brilliant The Stanley Parable. It's a walking simulator consisting of a string of seemingly randomly made levels made with the Source engine. There's a narrator that explains the fictional significance for the design of each level. There's a “twist” at the end that is completely unearned. Essentially, what this software does is tells a story and then at the end tells the audience that he lied about the details of the story and we're supposed to be shocked by the reveal. The story made absolutely no connection with me at all. It was a waste of 2 hours of my life. The genius of The Stanley Parable is that expertly deconstructs common mechanics of video games and challenges the player to reflect on why games are designed the way they are and why we, as the players, act the way we do in the game world. The Beginner's Guide is completely devoid of any of this. The Beginner's Guide seems like the developer had a bunch of unfinished attempts at creating game levels, cobbled them together and put some bullsh.t narration over it and called it a day. The developer has demonstrated that they are very talented and I hope this abortion was just a fluke.","January 23","false","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game is one of the most overrated titles I have played in recent memory.\n\nThe narrative is muddled and unfocused.  The level design is mostly unimaginative, notwithstanding a few highlights.  The emotional response that so many people write about was just a blip on the radar for me, which surprised me.  I really didn't connect with this game much at all.  There are few moments in game that truly resonated with me, but otherwise I was left wanting.\n\nThis game feels like an alpha version of something with a lot of potential.

An over-used, hyperbolic statement that frequently appears in headlines and reviews for games that innovate in some meaningful way. We all roll our eyes when we read it being used yet again... however, I simply cannot think of any other way to describe this game.\n\n• Publisher: Everything Unlimited Ltd.\n• Developer: Everything Unlimited Ltd.\n• Platforms: PC (Reviewed)\n\n_________________________________\n\nI never played The Stanley Parable. Not because I wasn't interested, or because I didn't have time, but because I... just didn't play it. I realize now that was a huge mistake, and I missed out on a game I would have likely adored (it's on my wish list now!). However, I thankfully did not miss the boat for The Beginner's Guide. This time, I wasn't late to the party, and I have to say, from the feedback the game has gotten, I gather that this is a far more interesting party. This is not to say Davey Wreden's "The Beginner's Guide" is a better game than The Stanley Parable, but a much more interesting one; primarily because of the conversations it has started.\n\nUnderstand that what I can write here is very limited. To tell you about the game, it's premise, and story would be to spoil the entire experience. Instead, I want to tell you the impact the game had on me.\n\nI started out genuinely intrigued. The game begins on a very fun note, almost like you're hanging out with a friend as he makes a game. Towards the middle of the hour and a half experience, the game almost got a tear out of me. It touched me on a very emotional level, and had me deeply invested. Then towards the end, I became worried, and ultimately angry. I thought about writing a review right then and there, but to do that I feel, would have colored the review in an unfair way; so I decided to wait until the end of the day.\n\nI'm ultimately glad I did. I realize that what angered me initially actually impressed and satisfied me in the end. This is a game I immediately wanted to share with my friends; to see how they'd react. I even thought about having my parent (who does not enjoy games) have a go at it. It's a game that makes you think, feel, and reflect; when's the last time any AAA, or even an indie game made you do that? Journey was the last game that resonated with me in such a way, but in The Beginner's Guide, the emotional impact is more explicit.\n\nThe Beginner's Guide is a very philosophical experience. One that tackles heavy topics like "What makes us motivated to do the things we do? How do our actions influence other's actions? Why do we not pursue our dreams like we know we should?". It's heavy stuff for sure, and it pushes the boundaries of what games can do, and the kinds of stories they can tell.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhen I was in the middle of the game, I was prepared to give this title my "Game of the Year" award. Yes; even beating out MGSV, Bloodborne, and Arkham Knight. Upon completing it, I've chilled the hell out about it, and even after my initial anger, I still consider it a contender. Some people have reviewed the game calling it pretentious, self-indulgent trash, while others have praised it for obliterating the lines between games and art (it made Jim Sterling write an emotional biography about his childhood for Christ's sake!).\n\nI think both of those sentiments have some merit. It's a game you'll likely come away either loving or hating. I did both myself, and that's ultimately a part of why I like it so much in hindsight. I'm a guy who typically avoids "Walking Simulators" and I can say with certainty, I've never been on the edge of my seat like I was playing this in ANY shooter or action game. What Mr. Wreden has done here is infinitely intriguing to me, and I hope he continues to challenge us like this. It's not your typical game, and that's what makes it so special.\n\nArbitrary Scoring:\n\n• Story: 8\n• Gameplay: N/A\n• Presentation: 10\n-------------------\n• Overall: 9/10","October 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Oh yeah. Is it worth the price? I definitely thought so.\n\nShould you watch Let's Plays or read reviews that talk about the story before buying? Probably (and highly reccomendedly) don't.\n\nI'm gonna talk as spoiler-free as possible, so here I go:\n\nThe Beginner's Guide is a one-shot game; it's a lot smaller than The Stanley Parable, and there isn't that much to explore in the game in terms of ending and whatnot. The narration and plot isn't going to change depending on what you do. However, this game takes you on a ride. An emotional ride, and if you are in any way familiar with the subject matter it presents then it's going to strike home and make you think about things you might not have even consciously thought before.\n\nHowever, this might not be the 'game' for everybody.\n\nLike the description states, there are no traditional mechanics, no goal, and no objectives. Much like Dear Esther, i's more akin to a walking simulator (though much more successfully executed) than anything, and you might get two or a few more plays from it if you're going to examine it throughly but otherwise once is gonna be it.\n\nDespite that, for the price I just can't argue with the experiance I got from it; it's just as much as I would pay for a movie ticket and took much more than I normally would from most regular ol' movies.\n\nWorth the price of admission.","October 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Even after the game had ended I spent a while to take it all in; to go over everything I had witnessed and experienced. The game is intelligent and I applaud it for that.\n\nHowever, the trailer makes you think that you will have more control over what happens. That you, yourself will be trailing through this random person's documents and games; trying to form your own opinions and conclusions on what they are like, based upon the things you see. However, this isn't how it really is at all and for that it feels like the game is slightly mis-sold.\n\nThe issue with the narration style is that it doesn't allow you to form your own ideas, or at least, not as much as I'd like. No sooner had my mind began to wonder about Coda and his feelings, the narrator would tell you what he thought Coda had been feeling. I felt this stifled my thoughts. I wanted more time to explore, to delve into the games and psychoanalyze it all.\n\nI feel that the game didn't expand as much as it could have.

The Stanley Parable was brilliantly written, played with impossible space in amusing ways, and had a lot to say about nonlinear interactive fiction.  This... is a collection of cries for help.  The interactivity is minimal, and the narration defeats any attempt to take this seriously as art.  It's like watching a movie with audio commentary the first time through.  There's some twists in the narrative, but I did not enjoy this.  Melodramatic and minimalistic, this really didn't feel like it gained anything by being a game.  I'm a strong proponent for storytelling in games, for the medium to be used artistically.  This didn't move me at all.  It's depressing, but not in the intended sense of sharing the creator's existential dread.  If there's any truth to this story, the people involved have my sympathy, to be certain.

Stick with it to the end and pay off is extremely satisfying.","October 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

The way the game takes full advantage of what a medium like video games have to present is interesting, and smart.\n\nSo let me get this out of the way first and for most "Hold W to game". That's it. It's even less "gamey" than the Stanley Parable. I want people to understand this before even considering the Beginner's Guide.

With that said, The Beginner's Guide really can't be told in any other form than through a video game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weoOVydw31k\nSince the story is about Davey's developer friend, it takes you on an interactive tour through his friend's past games and levels.

It's a surreal experience, and it certainly breaks all sorts of video game norms.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique experience or just like really well told stories, The Beginner's Guide is an easy recommendation. However, if you're looking for a game, even for an off beat game, The Beginner's Guide might disappoint. As mentioned above, there's really no mechanics to speak of, other than hold W to game. In Gone Home you have to look for keys and can interact with objects all around. In The Stanley Parable you have a pseudo fail state and an Easter egg hunt for all the endings. Even in most other "Walking Simulators" you have some kind of puzzle, or obstacle along the way. Not in The Beginner's Guide. There's only 1 puzzle in the game, and that's solely there as a story element. There are dialogue choices to be made, but they have no significant (or any) effect on your game. It's very much a guided tour through an interactive narrative. It's also relatively short at an hour and a half (I finished it at exactly 91 minutes).

I played this through in one sitting, and even though it was short The Beginner's Guide never felt lacking to me. It is not as open-ended as something like the Stanely Parable, but I feel one playthrough is perfect for this game. It does something I feel is very hard to accomplish in any other game, describing human emotions. Both the characters feel fully fleshed out, and both feel like real people.

Some games can be incredibly interesting and insightful, but I find describing them as "intelligent" offers up some pretension to the games.\n\nI think this game is very interesting and asks some interesting questions about not only creating videogames, but creating "Artistic" work in general. I don't know if the story that's told and laid out is totally true or not, or just a fictitious depiction to ask these questions personally or impersonally, but it does a good job of getting some questions out there about creator relationships to their creations.\n\nI don't create video games. I write, and draw, and make some music and even some videos. All of those are relatively quaint forms of expression as I don't usually share them with people too often. Which is a topic that this game tackles. Creating stuff for ourselves vs. creating stuff for others.\n\nThrough these questions (as I feel most philosophical questions eventually lead) the player is opened up to larger. more generalized questions of comfort and security in their life. The ever present opinions of others, the need to always move forward, the struggle of letting people into our personal lives while also being able to see other people's own personal lives. It's ever relevant stuff that has been talked about forever.\n\nThe game isn't long. And once you play it (if you pay attention to it) you'll probably not feel the need to play it again, unless to show a friend or something. It's true content is more than just tangible environments within the game, but more abstract concepts and questions posed throughout. I have my qualms with a 10 dollar price tag, no matter the philosophical content, but that may just be me.\n\nOverall I think it's a worthwhile game, especially when on sale.","October 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You wander around a lot of small, linear levels, ostensibly all standalone indie games.

What ties it together is the narration, which is set up like a developer commentary track. The dialog gets a little too on-the-nose toward the end, which kind of undermines what had up till then been a fairly poignant story, but it's still entertaining.

DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nSo, much like The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide is a though-provoking game with no clear end that challenges you mentally. It's narrated not by the same person who narrated The Stanley Parable, rather the creator of that game. The narrator, Davey, takes you through the games made by his friend Coda and discusses his thoughts on the reasons behind Coda's games from what he could discern. This goes on for about an hour and fifteen minutes. the last 20 or so minutes is Davey contradicting literally everything he's spent telling you in the first hour+, and having a slight psychological meltdown, admitting his innermost thoughts, fears, hopes, and desires before ultimately leaving the player a few minutes or so before the game ends.\n\nI loved everything about this game.

Is it a walking simulator? Quite possibly. Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. That's the wonderful thing about The Beginner's Guide. It's different, and it is definitely a game that you would see more as an experience than something you really participate in.\n\nIn the terms of the narration it showcases some really neat things in it's presentation, some of which can really open your mind to new ideas. The narration is easy to follow and it's something you will want to listen to. It's engaging and deep. For a product that openly advertises itself as not including standard game mechanics or goals, it is just that. That is the only expectation you should go in with.\n\nIt's absolutely a game I will need to ponder for a little while, and that's a good thing, as a creative person, I find value in what this game explores. Not everyone will, and that's okay.\n\nSimilar to everyone else's reviews, I don't want to spoil anything. However, in likeness to other people's reviews, I will say that if you are a game developer, or even a creative person, a musician, an artist, a filmmaker, or anyone who makes content for people to consume in any way, this will likely appeal more to you. This isn't something I would be putting onto a 'game of the year' list, it's simply an experience worth experiencing. Go into it with an open mind.

You share the narrator's every word and thought, following closely on his confidence, anger, disbelief, and eventually acceptance of what he did. A truly magnificent essay on a mistake we all made at some point in our life, and that will hit home for any creator out there.\n\nIt's short, and do not expect any form of gameplay besides walking and listening.

It's a declaration by developers who feel that their work should be a means of expression and not mere entertainment for others.  It's a rebuttal to the many who believe that gameplay trumps other aspects of a game.\n\nWalking Simulator?  Well no.  Dear Esther is more of a walking simulator.  In this game the narrator is talking to you instead of just talking.  And this is nothing like The Stanley Parable where the narrator openly mocks you and challenges you.  It is far less interactive than The Stanley Parable, but probably just as immersive.\n\nPeople who played The Stanley Parable may or may not like this game as it is less interactive.  However, people who love ramblings and insight on the radio as well as The Stanley Parable will probably enjoy this game, like I did.\n\nIf you want to consider what it means to develop a 'game', and whether a game minus gameplay can still be a purposeful and meaningful experience, install this and contemplate for a time.\n\n...  I do miss Kevan Brighting's voice though.\n\nEDIT:  The Ending demonstrates a reason why creators (be it writers, artists, game developers) who are friends can just so easily get into a fight over personal space, distrubition rights (for each other's work) and so forth.

Hope to see more games like these. Take the plunge and experience this masterpiece.","October 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the narrative and the story are pretty much linear, no defying narrators, but at the same time it wouldn't be right if you could defy him in this game since he tells such a powerful and interesting story.

DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nSo, much like The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide is a though-provoking game with no clear end that challenges you mentally. It's narrated not by the same person who narrated The Stanley Parable, rather the creator of that game. The narrator, Davey, takes you through the games made by his friend Coda and discusses his thoughts on the reasons behind Coda's games from what he could discern. This goes on for about an hour and fifteen minutes. the last 20 or so minutes is Davey contradicting literally everything he's spent telling you in the first hour+, and having a slight psychological meltdown, admitting his innermost thoughts, fears, hopes, and desires before ultimately leaving the player a few minutes or so before the game ends.\n\nI loved everything about this game.

Knowing it was one the creator behind The Stanley Parable I suspected some quite... weird, or depressing themed stuff even to begin with. So I sat down and played this in one go and, well.. what can I say? I really recommend this game to everyone actually. It leaves you thinking about how you treat other people, but also yourself, and how you should handle harsh times in life.  I think this game is about the combination between inspriation and motivation to create, and so I really related to it. At one point this game really crept deep inside of me and I felt sick because of what you were suppoused to do.

And yeah, this is totally my kind of thing. I'm not being sarcastic, there.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\nIf you like to create things, be it games or music or art, and are looking for a game that takes a broad, decisive look at how we develop and how people experience our creations, you can't go wrong with The Beginner's Guide. It's excellent for self-realization.\n\nThe soundtrack is great too, and there are game concepts I really like: How the game's narrative is us examining the story from a narrator showing us the aftermath, and the narration over the game world as you explore, based somewhat on how you explore. I just wish there had been more narration for more situations.\n\nNow, my problem with the game is how it describes everything as black-and-white when in reality the story it crafts is so grey it turns out pretentious. So, the game is based around Davey with a showcase of "games" created by his friend Coda. The "games" are actually small Source levels, and the game can be completed in about an hour or two. (I'm a slow player and I like to look around a lot, so my "hours played" might be a little overblown.) Davey plays through these games and develops concepts and questions about how the games fit into Coda's personal life, and what the games mean.\n\nThe overall message of the game is essentially "You can't really know what an auteur is trying to get across with what they create" but there's a lot of problems with the auteur in this game. (Coda) Past the twist in the game, Davey is presented as a needy, whiny manchild who doesn't seem to grasp concepts even after they've been presented point-blank to him without metaphor, and Coda is a shut-in who creates but refuses to show, <SPOILER>  and creates without meaning,  resulting in two characters I don't like or even associate with. It just rubs me in a way that makes me feel worse about the game when it tries to present one person as the morally right person and another as the morally wrong.\n\nThis is not a game to analyze on it's own. This is a game to make you look at yourself. Again, if you create, this is worth looking at.\n\nGo play The Stanley Parable or Dr. Langeslov. They're not as serious games but you'll have much more fun with them than this. If you really want to check this game, look up a Let's Play on YouTube.","December 11, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's perfectly paced, has great foreshadowing that will give you suspicions and theories throughout the game while keeping the ending a surprise. The characters are easy to relate to and are very strong and believable, to the point that everyone seems to argue whether Coda is real or not!\n\nIf you're a lover of stories and narratives, this game is 1000% for you - I can't remember the last time a game or movie moved me like this game did. While certainly the game is short - honestly I'd much rather play a well placed short game that invoked such strong emotions than a long game with filler to pad out the time and distract from the story.","January 2","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've not even created a review for Dota 2 yet and I have about 3.3k hours on it at this point in time.\n\nThis game is good. I'll give it that. It's got depth. However, there's something within this game that allows itself to be distanced from other games; to transcend from the term game for a moment and adopt the role, message. This game is a message and it's physical. A physical representation of a message is the basis of this game. This game doesn't just put you in the shoes of the fictional character the developer wants you to be but instead makes you him. Himself. You see through his eyes. Your process through his mind. You walk in his footsteps. Neither one of the many aspects of this game leaves more to be desired because it is undeniably complete. Complete in the most ironic sense and you will know why when you've played this game. I'll give you a tiny little spoiler here (too insignificant to spoil the game). The developers provides you with his own personal e-mail to drop him any messages about your perspectives or even mere thoughts about the game. Whether he did this for an intensified dramatic effect, I do not know but I got a strong feeling at the end of the game that it wasn't just for e-mails to sit around and "take effect".\n\nConclusively, this game is indubitably worth playing.

Overfull with visual wonder, interpretation and pure creativity. The actual experience is not in the game itself but the backstory of the relationship between the narrator and a close friend who made originally made this collection of small games over the course of 2009-2011.\nI won't say too much about it, since the experience is all in the history of these two people, but I will say that the collection of work is magnificent, some of the most visually stunning abstract video game art I've seen.\nBut just like The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide does not follow the rules of video games and instead sets out to make it's own experience without pandering to a mainstream crowd.\n\nWith that said, this game is not meant for average gamers. There are no objectives or anything of the sort to be had, it's just a tribute to a friend. Which is I think the main downpoint, if you're making this for a friend, why are you charging $10? For a total length of an hour and a half, I can't see any justification. It's not like a museum gallery with a hefty entrance fee, it's a tribute.\n\nWell, I don't have all the facts. So I'll just say this: If you're interested in video games as an art form, a means of expression or just a creative outlet, then The Beginner's Guide would probably be right up your alley. Otherwise, you'd be best off moving along.","October 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bioshock Infinite was amazing, but this takes the cake by a mile. This game follows a narrative (stay with me, I understand, thats strange for a game, but keep reading) in which we see a man trying to explain to us a person that he knows through the creations he has made. At first it seemed a little strange, but it quickly grasped my interest and I was sucked in and couldnt stop playing it. When I play a game, I look for how I get attached to a character in it. Bioshock Infinite got me attached to Elizabeth, as a protector. An amazing way to do that considering the end of the game...no spoilers here :). This game does a similar thing. It brings emotion into what you are doing, in a meaning way that you enjoy. This game is by far, my favorite game of all time now. It is so good, so deep, so driven. I am unsure on exactly how to explain it. Its like a movie, and a story, mashed into a game. The way the game is done is just incredible, like a letter to a friend. Just play it, its worth it, completely and utterly worth it. Just open the door...and find the light at the end....","January 7","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my personal opinion The Beginners Guide is an absolute masterpiece. It's a game that will stick in my mind and keep sucking me back to thinking about it time and time again.\n\nFirst off, the story is fantastic. What makes the game so powerful is the fact that the narrative touches on so many emotionally powerful topics that get woven into a grander theme of depression. This game doesn't shy away from offering emotional introspection and even goes into ideas like loneliness,  self destructive tendencies, and even projecting one's emotions onto other people. In a way, I think it even touches on what it is like to suffer from "hyper empathy". It's a crazy feel trip that hits all the right buttons to get you thinking about some pretty heavy stuff.\n\nBut what's more is the fact is the entire experience is just so lovingly intertwined with the narrative. There's many points where the game's simple mechanics just seem to connect with the emotions of the story and allow me to feel connected to the experience in a much more profound way. At times I could feel the frustration being conveyed through the story in the game through the mechanics, while other times the mechanics mirrored feelings of peace or relief. The game uses this act of mirroring the narrative with gameplay and sprinkles in some exceptional audio design to build an intense atmosphere that can honestly even be described as overwhelming at times. It almost seems as if the creators went out of their way to use the concept of "kinesthetic projection" to draw me further into the game.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend this game enough. Something as outright breathtaking as The Beginner's Guide needs to be supported with as much love as the gaming community is able to give. I love this thing so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much and I'm not going to forget it for a LONG time.","January 7","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A game that is more like an interactive narrative where a narrator takes you through indie developed games created by a friend and then tells his perspective of what his friend was trying to convey in each one. I felt uneasy, depressed at times, and even concerned for the creator of the games, much like the narrator felt for his friend. By the end I felt I learned something about myself and others in a perspective that I never thought to take. Oddly enough, a GAME of all things made me see a different point of view about others and how they deal with seclusion and depression. Sometimes you don't need to be a fixer, sometimes you just need to shut up and listen.\n\nAnyway, off the sappy bit. I highly recommend this game. An incredible narrative, sound effects that really drive the collection of games along, the atmosphere ranges from happy, to gloomy, and even sarcastic and pessimistic.

After playing it the first time, I can say that my pre conceived notion wasn't wrong, it just wasn't true the way that I thought it would be.\n\nThis game made me feel emotions that a game has never made me feel. It is incredibly sobering and it completely sneaks up on you.\n\nYes, this game is absolutely worth playing. I won't tell you not to go into it expecting something similar to Stanley Parable, because that's exactly what I did and I did not find myself wishing the game to be anything other than what it was. If anything, The Stanley Parable is what gave me a reference point for being able to better understand this game. Both are games that force the player's thought process to transcend what they know of conventional video games, The Beginner's Guide is almost like looking at it from the other side.\n\nI'm not sure if the creator meant this to be a side effect, but there were times that certain scenes in that game, and certain rooms I was in that felt like I had been there before in my actual life. This made it all the more emotionally jarring to play through, it gave me personal perspective on a game that is meant to be looking at it from someone else's perspective. In any case, it is truly a work of art, not becuase it is magnificient in any way, but because of the emotions it all but forces you to feel, even though it wasn't made for the players themselves.\n\nI recommend that you play this game and try not to criticize how it made you feel about the people who made it or why, but that you criticize how it made you feel about yourself, if the game doesn't make you want to do that already.","January 4","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I practically felt everything\n- Amazing atmosphere, you could honestly just take a screenshot during most of the gameplay and set it as a wallpaper.\nCons:\n- Not really a game, more of a story, or an interactible movie.\n- Leaves a mute/bitter taste in your mouth, and you will be feeling pretty depressed and empty through a majority of the game. Especially towards the end. (although that's probably intended)\n- Some may think $10 (or $6 because of the sale) is a bit much for about 1.5 hours of story. I felt it was worth it.\n\nLong Review This isn't a game. You don't shoot through hordes of aliens, or survive in an open world sandbox, or capture a flag, or build a city. It's a story. I'm afraid to elaborate on it, because every detail given away will detract from the experience, I highly recommend going in completely cold.\n\nThat being said, it's a rather emotionally daunting experience. This game made me feel so many different emotions I didn't know I could feel from simply pressing W, A, S, and D while listening to someone talk. I think this game story has elicited almost every emotion humanly possible out of me, in less than two hours of gameplay coupled with amazing atmosphere. The extent to which I felt those feelings? Not much, I mostly felt depressed and empty. I covered all 360 degrees of human emotion, but just barely.\n\nFrom a completely objective point of view, is this worth $10 (or the $6 that I got it for on sale)? Eh. It depends. If you really want something to be entertained by, something to replay for hundreds (or even dozens) of hours, don't look here. Play TF2, or CSGO. This is just a captivating experience with a small paywall.

I fully understood exactly what was meant.\n\nIf you are not in game design, this might not speak as strongly to you. I honestly don't know. To me, though, this game has so much more of an impact, if you work behind the curtain. This game, while being sold to the public, feels to me like it is not for the people who play games. It is for the people who make the games to be played.\n\nI do not know if the events portrayed are real or not, but regardless of if they are, I certainly hope all involved, particularly the story focus, get some closure. While it will mean next to nothing, I'd also want to note, for the game developers, that I completely understand this game, and the meanings behind it and every chapter within it. Or at least, I certainly hope I do.","October 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't find them nearly as interesting as the narrator was making them out to be so I put the game down for some other time. Eventually The Beginner's Guide got my attention as I started to come to grips with what it was trying to do. I'm just putting this here in case someone is concerned that they don't fall in love with it right away or that it has a slow start: It gets a lot better so definitely hang in there.\n\nThe Stanley Parable was great.

It could have been the fact that I was getting 60 fps for once and there are a lot of bright lights, but I think the misanthropic and lonely atmosphere was what caused it.\n\nAs a person who has struggled with a lot of internal conflict, this game did not do much for me. I could see how it might ellicit a powerful response in someone who has some serious thinking to do about themselves, but for me it more or less reminded me of things I already think about.\n\nLets talk about the game. This game will put on display for you the works of one person, narrarated over by a friend of his. The friend of course has a lot of bias about these games, and will push the notions he has about them on you. SPOILER: the narrarator will try to make it seem like the author of these works is a broken and lonely person, when really it's the narrorator himself who is seeing himself in the game (his own thoughts, views, etc). It's a sad dichotomy and the game does not end happily. In fact it's somewhat upsetting.\n\nIn short, to anyone considering buying this game, don't pay ten dollars for this, just go to the Library and check out a book on existential philosophy or chinese maxims or something. It will probably do a lot more for you than this emotional catharsis of a game.\n\nSorry if you love this game. You are absolutely allowed to feel that.

It's a declaration by developers who feel that their work should be a means of expression and not mere entertainment for others.  It's a rebuttal to the many who believe that gameplay trumps other aspects of a game.\n\nWalking Simulator?  Well no.  Dear Esther is more of a walking simulator.  In this game the narrator is talking to you instead of just talking.  And this is nothing like The Stanley Parable where the narrator openly mocks you and challenges you.  It is far less interactive than The Stanley Parable, but probably just as immersive.\n\nPeople who played The Stanley Parable may or may not like this game as it is less interactive.  However, people who love ramblings and insight on the radio as well as The Stanley Parable will probably enjoy this game, like I did.\n\nIf you want to consider what it means to develop a 'game', and whether a game minus gameplay can still be a purposeful and meaningful experience, install this and contemplate for a time.\n\n...  I do miss Kevan Brighting's voice though.\n\nEDIT:  The Ending demonstrates a reason why creators (be it writers, artists, game developers) who are friends can just so easily get into a fight over personal space, distrubition rights (for each other's work) and so forth.  It's...  A call for help...  Players must reach the ending if they wish to truly make sense of what this 'game' is.\n\n...  And whether you agree if it should have been released at all.","October 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That was a roller coaster. The idea of little snippits of someones work is very interesting, and to have an awesome narrator going over it was SUPER COOL. The play time might seem short compared to the price tag, but the experience is phenomenal, and after you play it, you will question EVERYTHING. It is a look into the human behind the game, and it's extremely well-crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly. The levels themselves are always interesting and bizzare, featuring strange concepts or interesting dialogue and interactivity. The end is the best ending to anything I have EVER witnessed in my entire life.\n\nOVERALL! This game is a 10/10 for me, and is up there as #2 of my favoritesest gamez.

If you can call it a game.\nThe indie developer who made this also made "The Stanley Parable". Both of these games aren't really similar, except for the makers ability to create something new and interesting.\n\nThe Beginner's Guide isn't for everyone. It's short, there's no real puzzles to solve, and you basically play simple games while listening to narration. The story that is told is introspective and personal to the game developer. It's not really a happy story, but it's told with skill, and you can tell it comes from an honest place.\n\nI played it through it comfortably in one sitting, and at the end, it was hard not to feel sad about what I just played and listened to. There's very little re-play value; there's no cards or steam achievements - but that's not really the point. I'm glad I bought and experienced The Beginner's Guide, and I'm going to look out for future games from this indie developer.","March 15","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However no one I know flat out didn't enjoy it. they all took something away from it, just maybe differently than I did. The less you know about this game before you play it the better.

Is it a walking simulator? Quite possibly. Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. That's the wonderful thing about The Beginner's Guide. It's different, and it is definitely a game that you would see more as an experience than something you really participate in.\n\nIn the terms of the narration it showcases some really neat things in it's presentation, some of which can really open your mind to new ideas. The narration is easy to follow and it's something you will want to listen to. It's engaging and deep. For a product that openly advertises itself as not including standard game mechanics or goals, it is just that. That is the only expectation you should go in with.\n\nIt's absolutely a game I will need to ponder for a little while, and that's a good thing, as a creative person, I find value in what this game explores. Not everyone will, and that's okay.\n\nSimilar to everyone else's reviews, I don't want to spoil anything. However, in likeness to other people's reviews, I will say that if you are a game developer, or even a creative person, a musician, an artist, a filmmaker, or anyone who makes content for people to consume in any way, this will likely appeal more to you. This isn't something I would be putting onto a 'game of the year' list, it's simply an experience worth experiencing. Go into it with an open mind.

At times this is uncomfortably intimate and by the end I felt the need to go online for fan theories about what happened and I have accepted a particular conclusion that makes sense, but you will likely never get an official answer.

The graphics are awful, the textures and objects are mostly taken from stock - and it feels as though the game could have been made in a month.\n\nThat being said, how can I not recommend this? I found myself tied to my chair as the credits rolled and I felt oddly satisfied. If you want to buy this because of the Stanley Parable, don't. It's not the same.

In my personal opinion The Beginners Guide is an absolute masterpiece. It's a game that will stick in my mind and keep sucking me back to thinking about it time and time again.\n\nFirst off, the story is fantastic. What makes the game so powerful is the fact that the narrative touches on so many emotionally powerful topics that get woven into a grander theme of depression. This game doesn't shy away from offering emotional introspection and even goes into ideas like loneliness,  self destructive tendencies, and even projecting one's emotions onto other people. In a way, I think it even touches on what it is like to suffer from "hyper empathy". It's a crazy feel trip that hits all the right buttons to get you thinking about some pretty heavy stuff.\n\nBut what's more is the fact is the entire experience is just so lovingly intertwined with the narrative. There's many points where the game's simple mechanics just seem to connect with the emotions of the story and allow me to feel connected to the experience in a much more profound way. At times I could feel the frustration being conveyed through the story in the game through the mechanics, while other times the mechanics mirrored feelings of peace or relief. The game uses this act of mirroring the narrative with gameplay and sprinkles in some exceptional audio design to build an intense atmosphere that can honestly even be described as overwhelming at times. It almost seems as if the creators went out of their way to use the concept of "kinesthetic projection" to draw me further into the game.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend this game enough. Something as outright breathtaking as The Beginner's Guide needs to be supported with as much love as the gaming community is able to give. I love this thing so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much and I'm not going to forget it for a LONG time.","January 7","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was new, exciting, confusing, elaborative, intriguing. You start right off the bat being told about someone that the narrator, Davy clearly admired. Then you started getting lost in these games and seeing things connecting. It began to make me feel lonely, like i needed something. I felt inspired and depressed all at once. Then I felt like I'd just witnessed someone dishing out a secret and it made me feel in the middle of it. I feel highly uncomfortable and have this feeling of sadness i cant shake.

A game that is more like an interactive narrative where a narrator takes you through indie developed games created by a friend and then tells his perspective of what his friend was trying to convey in each one. I felt uneasy, depressed at times, and even concerned for the creator of the games, much like the narrator felt for his friend. By the end I felt I learned something about myself and others in a perspective that I never thought to take. Oddly enough, a GAME of all things made me see a different point of view about others and how they deal with seclusion and depression. Sometimes you don't need to be a fixer, sometimes you just need to shut up and listen.\n\nAnyway, off the sappy bit. I highly recommend this game. An incredible narrative, sound effects that really drive the collection of games along, the atmosphere ranges from happy, to gloomy, and even sarcastic and pessimistic. Just an all around great game. 10/10\n\nAbout the most honest, truthful, untrolly review I've given in a long time.

After playing it the first time, I can say that my pre conceived notion wasn't wrong, it just wasn't true the way that I thought it would be.\n\nThis game made me feel emotions that a game has never made me feel. It is incredibly sobering and it completely sneaks up on you.\n\nYes, this game is absolutely worth playing. I won't tell you not to go into it expecting something similar to Stanley Parable, because that's exactly what I did and I did not find myself wishing the game to be anything other than what it was. If anything, The Stanley Parable is what gave me a reference point for being able to better understand this game. Both are games that force the player's thought process to transcend what they know of conventional video games, The Beginner's Guide is almost like looking at it from the other side.\n\nI'm not sure if the creator meant this to be a side effect, but there were times that certain scenes in that game, and certain rooms I was in that felt like I had been there before in my actual life. This made it all the more emotionally jarring to play through, it gave me personal perspective on a game that is meant to be looking at it from someone else's perspective. In any case, it is truly a work of art, not becuase it is magnificient in any way, but because of the emotions it all but forces you to feel, even though it wasn't made for the players themselves.\n\nI recommend that you play this game and try not to criticize how it made you feel about the people who made it or why, but that you criticize how it made you feel about yourself, if the game doesn't make you want to do that already.","January 4","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The narrator, Davey, takes you through the games made by his friend Coda and discusses his thoughts on the reasons behind Coda's games from what he could discern. This goes on for about an hour and fifteen minutes. the last 20 or so minutes is Davey contradicting literally everything he's spent telling you in the first hour+, and having a slight psychological meltdown, admitting his innermost thoughts, fears, hopes, and desires before ultimately leaving the player a few minutes or so before the game ends.\n\nI loved everything about this game.

I can see the hard work and effort that the developer must have put into the game, and here is basicaly its problem - It is very, very good but incredably short and as far as I can see, does not have much replay value (it took me 90 minutes to run throught the game once), and because of this I feel £5.99 is to much money to spend on this game, however I cannot see how he could sell it for less as so much of his time and effort has gone inot this. With games like GTA 5 a game that I think is far from perfect in many aspects but is still and increadably good game, They are priced at £39.99 because of the time you can spend playing it, (i have 321 hours I think) and the amount of money I spent to get that experience was very fitting to the amount of entertainment and replayabliliy in the game. The Beginner's Guide is as well crafted as games like GTA 5 but its the price for the experience that is one of the main problems with it.\n\nPersonly these types of games do not exite me in any way and I can't really get in to the story for the 90 minutes it lasts but at the same time it is a very good game considering the type of game it is.

It is not coincidental that the game designer behind it was also one of the people responsible for The Stanley Parable, which is another notable contribution. I do believe, though, that while Stanley was more accessible, The Beginner's Guide is original to the point of being ahead of its time - to avoid spoilers I will keep the explanation to this statement short, but let's just say that there have been some pretty unrealistic, detrimental assumptions about the game. You should not be thrown off by the fact that this game is, from a very strict, mechanical standpoint, a walking simulator (although if you play games for their complexity in interaction or systems alone and are not looking for a different kind of experience, this is most likely still not for you.)\n\nMost games in this genre do not explore their medium or the genre itself correctly - they rely so much on their story that the fact that you're experiencing them is actually a setback to your enjoyment -, but in The Beginner's Guide your experience aside from the narration is also essential to the narrative. One could not have been achieved without the other, much like in The Stanley Parable, which is a game that, as does this one, makes you think about yourself. The main difference between the two is in intent: while in Stanley[/] you were in for a witty, funny, weird, in-your-face commentary on your expectations as a player, Beginner's Guide[/] allows you to explore more meaningful, serious, broad, and unconfortable aspects of your psyche, along with expectations.

I'm not even sure I got it.\n\nThere's a lot of narration, but that's not necessarily bad.  The environments are gorgeous and the music might have dethroned To the Moon for its ability to so perfectly create atmosphere.  The controls are simple, intuitive, and not noteworthy.  Most of the game is you experiencing--rather than driving or interacting with--a story.\n\nThe story is intentionally vague (seemingly intentionally), even when it all wraps up at the end, but there's enough there that a lot of people--especially anyone who's ever wrestled with depression, either chronic or temporary--can find something in it that will resonate on some extremely deep, often (for me) painful level.\n\nIt's short.  It feels about like Naissance, with more narration and less "just experience this world" (if you liked The Beginner's Guide, by the way, give Naissance a look.  The aesthetic and area layout have a similar feel).  It's...confusing, vague, and feels almost uncomfortably personal.  It's also one of those games where I can't say anything substantial about the story without utterly ruining it--so much of it seems to hinge on what it means to you, the player, and saying what it meant to me defeats the point of that first, untainted experience.\n\nAbove all, this is a game that should make you uncomfortable.  And that is joyous, and beautiful, and lovely.\n\nIf you like games that lean heavily on their story and atmosphere, and are extremely personal and individual and sometimes painfully blunt, this is one of the best games I can recall ever playing to do those things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/recommended/303210/","b3ryl","B3RyL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/","240 products in account","You should watch the trailer for this game twice - once before and once after you've played it. Trust me - it's like watching two different trailers. And even if it doesn't work in your case than at least you've played the game and hopefully enjoyed it for what it was. So, is the game worth giving it a go in the first place? If you're a gamer who likes narrative-driven games the answer is: yes, yes it is. But if you're a designer, writer, artist, creator of some sort, and especially if you make video games, than this is one game you just can't miss out on, but not for the reasons you think of right now! Trust me.\n\n***Rant about negative reviews incoming (minor spoilers). If you haven't played the game or simply don't care about me ranting just skip to the last paragraph***\n\nI find it funny how people giving this game a negative review write 10-paragraph essays analyzing what the author intended to convey and pointing out where he failed to deliver on those intentions. Where they berate him for creating an "emotional confessional" and then trying to charge money for it. Where they accuse the game of being too disconnected, or too personal, too deep, or too shallow, or too confusing, or too simplistic, that you have to play The Stanley Parable to understand it, or that it has nothing to do with The Stanley Parable, that there's a clear message, or that there's no message at all. No joke, the most negative reviews are also the longest ones here, like the authors of those reviews are compelled to apologize for playing, to explain their motivations behind not jumping on the hype train, to express that they feel like they are the ones who have failed somehow... If you've already played the game you know where I'm going with this. Maybe they should write Davey Wreden an email. After all, he clearly stated his email address in the game.\n\nBut ok, let us not be the outcasts here - left out of the loop of people who have something substantial to say about this game. Let us try and do an analysis of the plot right here and now. In fact, let us one-up everyone and go extra-meta on this one: let us try and extrapolate the narrative portrayed in this game into the real world, Inception-style, and what we get is...\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS INCOMING!!! OMG!!! IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT DON'T READ ANY FURTHER THAN THAT VERY SENTENCE!!!\n\nI WARNED YOU!\n\nSeriously.\n\nWhat we get is the realization that this game is... just a game. It's a piece of interactive media with a well defined narrative attached to it for dramatic purposes, and it relies on immersion to build an enjoyable experience for the player. This is why Davey Wreden opted to reveal his name and email address in the game. This is why he build this emotional attachment to Coda. Remember, this is Davey Wreden we're talking about here - the man who's sole purpose in life is to dissect a piece of narrative and turn it on its head in order to entertain you, to catch you off guard. The Davey Wreden in the game is not the same Davey Wreden who wrote the game. Coda isn't real. None of it is supposed to mean anything, beyond that what you make of it, and whether it provided 1.5 hours of entertainment for you. And even if that's your argument against it - that Davey doesn't do a very good job at immersing you in the narrative, than fair point - maybe you just weren't feeling it. We will just have to agree to disagree. But trying to analyze the game based on your assumptions of what is or what isn't real, how Davey felt or didn't feel when making this game, and whether he has or hasn't the ability or even the right to convey a hidden personal message of some sort, and then making a judgment call in a review based on that analysis is not only futile, it's... exactly what the game is about in the first place. The death of the author. Don't get me wrong, everyone has an opinion and some people even have interpretations (including me), and there's nothing wrong with that, but as soon as you make a judgment call on something that may or may not be there, you're digging your own hole to fall into and you're dragging others with you. Now, go watch the trailer again, but instead of Davey's voice, try and hear your own voice in your head.\n\n***Rant finished. Closing thoughts follow***\n\nSo, does this game "do it for me"? Yes! I felt immersed and emotional while I played it and afterwards it got me thinking about some things for a while, specifically, how Davey can think out of the box in order to build this fantastic narrative, this illusion that leaves a lasting impression. To me, he's already looking to be one of the most influential writers/artists/creators of our generation. One who will be discussed in art and media schools for years to come. It's perhaps too early to call him the Quentin Tarantino of video games, but keep an eye on this guy because he's sure a hell headed in the right direction! Just google "Pleasurable You". Or maybe don't - I kinda feel bad for writing this now.","February 12","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isnt just a game, it is most definantly an experience, this may sound strange, but this game was the first to twist my emotions. At first, I would look in the darkest area's in maps (As I do in most games) to find secrets, and then just stopped, realizing that there was no point, no need to look. The reason for this, was that it was so basic, basic games dont hide secrets, all they hide is emotion, emotion that will soon reveal itself toward the end. And thats what it did.\n\nOverview\nFor people that want Action, Killing, Exploration, Adventure, Survival, RPG, Horror, or even Strategy, this game isnt for you... But for those that want a quiet and relaxing experiance unfold as you progress, learning secrets of a "Broken" and "Depressed" man, go ahead. Now, Im a big fan of RPG's (Just throwing that out there) and my favorite game is an RPG, So I am saying that this ISNT my favorite game, but its up there, be sure of it! Along with the great story and all, I think it would be to cliché to go as far to say that this game changed my life, but in a way it did. And with all this, the game is only $9.99, please, buy this game, you deserve it ;D","November 22, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, I can't tell you how, for that you'll have to play the game.\n\n\n\nAbout 2 hours ago I finished the game. My best friend purchased it for me after I said that it looked really good. I accepted the gift, downloaded the game, muted Steam and Skype, turned off all the lights, and played the game. Exactly ninety minutes later, it was over. I've spent the past two hours trying to make sense of it all. I still haven't. And I don't think I ever will. And that's okay.\n\nThis game will take you to the core of your being. It will make you rethink everything you know about yourself, the way that others view yourself, as well as your own perspective on your life and accomplishments.\n\nI don't think I will ever open The Beginner's Guide again. Not because I didn't like the game. In fact, quite the opposite: I enjoyed the experience, but it was exactly that, an experience. To try and recreate it, now knowing not only the ending but also the fantastic journey that takes you there, would be only a shattered fragment of the game as a whole.\n\nI will however, continue to ponder The Beginner's Guide, and it's personal meaning. The game itself offers no real resolution. Rather, it is expected that you will form your own conclusions based on the information given. I personally feel that an important message of the game is that we all have flaws, as well as expectations, and when one stops us from realizing the other, we can become blinded, misguided, lost.\n\nI really feel that everyone has something that can be learned from this game. And part of the game's genius is that, being such an abstract and open game, it's up to you to decide what that will be.\n\nOne thing I will say that I personally took away from this experience is the idea of perfection, or the lack thereof. I am a 17 year old senior in high school, who is going to college next year for Computer Engineering and dreams of one day developing video games for a living. I've already developed some games of my own, a few of which have been released to the public. However, I've always been held back in my game development prospects by my hesitation to produce anything subpar. If I had an idea that I couldn't flesh out into something that I felt would be something that other people would like to play, that wouldn be considered successful by others, then the idea would be discarded as something that wasn't "right," something I shouldn't "waste" my time working on, no matter how much fun I personally thought I would have had. The idea of public acceptance of my game as a success has always been important to me, has always been my determination of personal success. And because of that I've missed out on a fundamental part of game development: taking your creativity and passion and making something fun out of it. Not something "successful," something fun. Or engaging. Or emotional, intelligent, artistic. Something meaninful, in any way, not bound by the confines of "successful" or "popular." While I won't stop the public release of my projects, from now on I won't let the potential for failure be a reason to never see them materialize in the first place. This game has encouraged me to stop making games as way to prove myself to others, viewing every project as something to be scrutinized by the public in the form of reviews, ratings, or sales figures, and instead to make something because *I* want to make it, because *I* think it would be something fun or engaging or emotional or intelligent or artistic or meaningful. It taught me to develop my games, my tools to express my creativity, for myself, for the fun and enjoyment of making something, producing something real, something tangable. This game has taught me not to make things for others. It taught me to make them for me. And for that, Mr. Davey Wreden, I sincerly thank you.\n\nSo I challange you: play the game. See what you learn about youself. It might just change you for the better.","October 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I did not get it on the first time. When I closely studied this game reading comments, reviews, discussions, watching YouTube videos (btw, this one is priceless youtube - /watch?v=OPP9pdApRQE), reading articles I just found out what this game is about. I must say the game did not hit me hard at the moment and I refunded it immediately after finishing, but it reminds me to stay on the right path (I was already on) in my life to get know myself better, educate myself in some ways to be a better person, WORK ON YOURSELF.\n\nMy friend told me about the game and that it changed him, changed his life and look at things. I can't help myself but it is not my case. I was angry and confused after finishing. And even when I found out about the intend of the game I don't believe it gives me something, it just showed me what I already knew. To be more specific most valuable thing from the game is at the end when narrator ends his talks. *SPOILER* He says that he can't imagine life without external validations *END OF SPOILER*. This gave me thinking about it again and visit some youtubers that talk about it (RSDTyled for example, life guru).\n\nMy knowledge about the game was small before I play it. I thought it will be about social anxiety and that my friend think it will help me. I read reviews before I bought the game and after that it helped some people think another way, some people just felt emotional about the story of Coda (In my opinion fictional). I totally missed these ones. I only found out later in my game study what is this about. I should end it here, because it is only reviewed not my personal diary page :D.\n\nTo be this somehow helpful I must say buy this game to see for yourself and then decide if it give something to you or not. If game changes you, be glad that you paid only 9 dollars and not some hard/bad/sad life lesson. In other cases you can refund it and get your money back like I did.

It invokes thoughts on what makes a person happy, how to help another person, on the development of games or indeed, in anthing one does with their life. It is not a happy experience. Nor is it fulfilling. It is, however, very powerful, and raw. Whether the characters in it were purely fictional, or based on the creator and someone they know, means little. The feelings, and the meaning passed on is just so powerful. This was certainly worthwhile as an example of just how "art" can be presented in multiple media formats, including video games.

Please keep that in mind before you go on the discussion boards crying "This game 2 expensive not long enuff pls refund".\n\nSecond, there is no "gameplay" in this game. It plays very similiar to the Stanley Parable in terms of gameplay, just wandering around, exploring things.\n\nThird, and this is perhaps the most important thing, the messages that the Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide try to communicate are VERY, VERY different. While The Stanley Parable is a very funny, humorous game and just about having fun and goofing around, The Beginner's Guide is way more serious, trying to communicate multiple "deep", psychological messages. You won't find many humorous aspects here.\n\nDefinitely not your average video game, so please consider the type of game you are about to buy here before  you end up disappointed.\n\nTo everyone who enjoys these type of games though, there is definitely a lot this game makes you think about, and it is definitely, in my opinion, time and money well spent.","November 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/recommended/303210/","b3ryl","B3RyL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/","240 products in account","You should watch the trailer for this game twice - once before and once after you've played it. Trust me - it's like watching two different trailers. And even if it doesn't work in your case than at least you've played the game and hopefully enjoyed it for what it was. So, is the game worth giving it a go in the first place? If you're a gamer who likes narrative-driven games the answer is: yes, yes it is. But if you're a designer, writer, artist, creator of some sort, and especially if you make video games, than this is one game you just can't miss out on, but not for the reasons you think of right now! Trust me.\n\n***Rant about negative reviews incoming (minor spoilers). If you haven't played the game or simply don't care about me ranting just skip to the last paragraph***\n\nI find it funny how people giving this game a negative review write 10-paragraph essays analyzing what the author intended to convey and pointing out where he failed to deliver on those intentions. Where they berate him for creating an "emotional confessional" and then trying to charge money for it. Where they accuse the game of being too disconnected, or too personal, too deep, or too shallow, or too confusing, or too simplistic, that you have to play The Stanley Parable to understand it, or that it has nothing to do with The Stanley Parable, that there's a clear message, or that there's no message at all. No joke, the most negative reviews are also the longest ones here, like the authors of those reviews are compelled to apologize for playing, to explain their motivations behind not jumping on the hype train, to express that they feel like they are the ones who have failed somehow... If you've already played the game you know where I'm going with this. Maybe they should write Davey Wreden an email. After all, he clearly stated his email address in the game.\n\nBut ok, let us not be the outcasts here - left out of the loop of people who have something substantial to say about this game. Let us try and do an analysis of the plot right here and now. In fact, let us one-up everyone and go extra-meta on this one: let us try and extrapolate the narrative portrayed in this game into the real world, Inception-style, and what we get is...\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS INCOMING!!! OMG!!! IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT DON'T READ ANY FURTHER THAN THAT VERY SENTENCE!!!\n\nI WARNED YOU!\n\nSeriously.\n\nWhat we get is the realization that this game is... just a game. It's a piece of interactive media with a well defined narrative attached to it for dramatic purposes, and it relies on immersion to build an enjoyable experience for the player. This is why Davey Wreden opted to reveal his name and email address in the game. This is why he build this emotional attachment to Coda. Remember, this is Davey Wreden we're talking about here - the man who's sole purpose in life is to dissect a piece of narrative and turn it on its head in order to entertain you, to catch you off guard. The Davey Wreden in the game is not the same Davey Wreden who wrote the game. Coda isn't real. None of it is supposed to mean anything, beyond that what you make of it, and whether it provided 1.5 hours of entertainment for you. And even if that's your argument against it - that Davey doesn't do a very good job at immersing you in the narrative, than fair point - maybe you just weren't feeling it. We will just have to agree to disagree. But trying to analyze the game based on your assumptions of what is or what isn't real, how Davey felt or didn't feel when making this game, and whether he has or hasn't the ability or even the right to convey a hidden personal message of some sort, and then making a judgment call in a review based on that analysis is not only futile, it's... exactly what the game is about in the first place. The death of the author. Don't get me wrong, everyone has an opinion and some people even have interpretations (including me), and there's nothing wrong with that, but as soon as you make a judgment call on something that may or may not be there, you're digging your own hole to fall into and you're dragging others with you. Now, go watch the trailer again, but instead of Davey's voice, try and hear your own voice in your head.\n\n***Rant finished. Closing thoughts follow***\n\nSo, does this game "do it for me"? Yes! I felt immersed and emotional while I played it and afterwards it got me thinking about some things for a while, specifically, how Davey can think out of the box in order to build this fantastic narrative, this illusion that leaves a lasting impression. To me, he's already looking to be one of the most influential writers/artists/creators of our generation. One who will be discussed in art and media schools for years to come. It's perhaps too early to call him the Quentin Tarantino of video games, but keep an eye on this guy because he's sure a hell headed in the right direction! Just google "Pleasurable You". Or maybe don't - I kinda feel bad for writing this now.","February 12","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isnt just a game, it is most definantly an experience, this may sound strange, but this game was the first to twist my emotions. At first, I would look in the darkest area's in maps (As I do in most games) to find secrets, and then just stopped, realizing that there was no point, no need to look. The reason for this, was that it was so basic, basic games dont hide secrets, all they hide is emotion, emotion that will soon reveal itself toward the end. And thats what it did.\n\nOverview\nFor people that want Action, Killing, Exploration, Adventure, Survival, RPG, Horror, or even Strategy, this game isnt for you... But for those that want a quiet and relaxing experiance unfold as you progress, learning secrets of a "Broken" and "Depressed" man, go ahead. Now, Im a big fan of RPG's (Just throwing that out there) and my favorite game is an RPG, So I am saying that this ISNT my favorite game, but its up there, be sure of it! Along with the great story and all, I think it would be to cliché to go as far to say that this game changed my life, but in a way it did.

I was legitimately angry when I saw the end credits roll because I felt as though my intelligence was being insulted by a plot that consists of shallow melodrama and nothing more.\n\nPeople who don't like slow introspective games will hate this for being a "walking simulator" and people who do have an appreciation for such things should find an example that isn't so poorly put together.","January 9","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isnt just a game, it is most definantly an experience, this may sound strange, but this game was the first to twist my emotions. At first, I would look in the darkest area's in maps (As I do in most games) to find secrets, and then just stopped, realizing that there was no point, no need to look. The reason for this, was that it was so basic, basic games dont hide secrets, all they hide is emotion, emotion that will soon reveal itself toward the end. And thats what it did.\n\nOverview\nFor people that want Action, Killing, Exploration, Adventure, Survival, RPG, Horror, or even Strategy, this game isnt for you... But for those that want a quiet and relaxing experiance unfold as you progress, learning secrets of a "Broken" and "Depressed" man, go ahead. Now, Im a big fan of RPG's (Just throwing that out there) and my favorite game is an RPG, So I am saying that this ISNT my favorite game, but its up there, be sure of it! Along with the great story and all, I think it would be to cliché to go as far to say that this game changed my life, but in a way it did. And with all this, the game is only $9.99, please, buy this game, you deserve it ;D","November 22, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The lines between the narrator Davey Wreden and the real person behind the sucessful "The Stanley Parable" Davey Wreden seem blurry and I don't really know if they are the same person or not. And just keeping me guessing on this either tells me that this is a crazy thoughtprovoking real story or a crazy thoughtprovoking written story and neither would break it for me.\nYes, the game is only as long as a short movie (I've finished it in around 90 Minutes) but the quality of the time was amazing for me, thinking about the stuff the game provoked in me since I've finished it.\nAnd you can't ignore the soundtrack. The soundtrack by Ryan Roth underlined the emotional thoughts provoked through the game in such a wonderful way it really adds to the feeling the game conveys.\n\nIn the end, the game doesn't have much gameplay, making it debateable if it really is a game in his classic form, depending on the definition you follow. Nontheless it is an experience and a short, but, for me and many others, thoughtprovoking story with believable characters.

I will actually tell you the basic premise of the game. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who thinks absolutely nothing about the game at all should be 'spoiled,' even the vaguest sense of what it's about, then why are you reading reviews at all? Are you just looking for an excuse to complain? Stop being a jerk.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I will describe what you will read in the following sections so that you can read as much or as little as you like, according to your tastes. The sections themselves will be covered by spoiler tags and prefaced by non-spoilered text indicating what they are. At no time will I discuss specific details of events in the game that I would consider actual spoilers.\nIn the next section, I will describe the basic premise of the game and mention a vague surface theme. By the premise, I mean just a very basic description of the action of the game. It's something that you will learn in the very beginning when you first start playing and is in no way an Earth-shattering revelation. The theme I will discuss is very general and directly related to the premise. It's something you could likely work out on your own with no explanation from me at all.\nIn the section following that, I will discuss some of the deeper themes presented in the game. While I will still avoid anything about specific events in the game, this part might reveal a little more than some people would want to know, and I would probably recommend that most people skip it. I include it primarily in the interest of those who still aren't sure if this game is for them even after reading the previous section. How much you get out of the experience depends a lot on whether these themes are something you can relate to. While I still enjoyed the game, it was not what I was expecting going in and I feel like I didn't get as much out of it as others and that my inability to relate was the main reason for this.\n\nHere is the section detailing the basic premise\nThe game features a narrator who guides you through several short games made by a friend of his in Valve's Source engine. The relationship between the artist and his work is explored as you play through each one and the narrator explains the games and gives his interpretations.\n\nNow that I've actually typed it out and read it, I feel almost silly putting it in spoiler tags. You could just about get that from the trailer on the store page. However, I'll leave it as it is. Now we come to the part that actually sort of spoils some things. I would suggest you stop here if you haven't played the game yet. Proceed at your own peril.\n\nThis section discusses major themes and may detract from your experience if you have not played the game yet\nWithout mentioning anything that occurs in-game specifically, this story focuses on dependent relationships in which one person becomes reliant upon another for their self-worth and self-image. It raises questions about the role of artists in relation to those who take an interest in their work, as well as their rights as they pertain to the the ultimate disposition of their work. It explores the reasons behind the artist's creations. It wrestles with questions that intrigue me, however, I felt like I was on the outside looking in, so to speak, because I couldn't relate to them from the angle that was presented. You are meant to see things from the perspective of the dependent party in the relationship rather than the one to whom they become attached, but this is not the role I have historically found myself in. You will get more out of the story if this applies to you to some degree.\n\nUltimately, I think that this is something you will enjoy if you are at all interested in these kinds of storytelling 'games,' but your mileage may vary depending on your psychological makeup and personal history. I give it my approval, with some caveats.","December 2, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I want to like it but I just feel wronged, like i've been exploited in some way. See this is a work of fiction, presented as non-fiction. Which is in my view an exploitive and irresponsible narrative tool. There's plenty of reviews and discussion about Coda and who he is, it's all farcical. Coda does not exist. Coda cannot exist because Davey would have stolen his intellectual property and sold it for profit, leaving himself wide open to legal challenge. So once you realise this you realise everything you were told throughout the game was a paper-thin fabrication to house a very basic metaphor. Coda is Davey, it's the side of him that struggles creatively, the side of him that felt pressure trying to live up to the sucess of The Stanley Parable. At least that's what we think up until the final chapter, when Coda sends quite a clear message that he was fine the whole time and the interpretation was wrong. Which begs the question, is this a heart-felt relatable story about one's battle with creative vision? Or is this a giant f*** you to the viewer?\n\nThis game has a few flashes of greatness and prompts some introspective moments. Overall however I just cannot get past the fact that the whole thing is a fabrication, and like Davey doesn't believe in unplayable games because there should always be an end goal - I don't believe in the whole journey being a lie, because then the game is nothing but pretense.","October 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

However the actual physicality of the game doesn't contribute to what's going on; considering the confused lurching from asking us to interpret things to being resolutely informed that the entire point was really to show the narrator's incessant need for validation, it's more like reading a book with an obtuse mime sitting right in your field of vision doing everything it can to distract you from what's actually going on, and in an annoying way at that, rather than one which contributes to the experience. Is Coda real? Is the narrator's story just a story?

"Don't trust the narrator..he's wrong about many things! See what happens then."\n\nAnd she was right. She'd had a different connection to the game. I focused on game design structure, she was looking at it from the point of emotion. Which then made a lot of the previously confusing elements that I couldn't understand at all fit into the puzzle to complete a picture.\n\nSo I can now see the whole picture, or at least understand what Coda was trying to do.\n\nI can now recommend this game given I'd missed so much on the first time through. It's not the Stanley Parable but I think this game is equally as good for doing the exact opposite of what Stanley had - to escape the path to a new ending. In this you are shown the wrong path and you have to find the right one. And I assumed that the polygons and textures was it.\n\n[Original review]\nWeirdest experience I've ever had playing a game. If I had to liken it to something, it would be like walking around the Library of Babel finding that none of the books have any meaning through the random jumble of letters. Just when you think you're not going to find anything useful, you find that one book has a single intelligible word. But its existence is completely by chance - it gives no insight to who built the library or where the books came from. Rationality tells you it's all worthless. Random noise. But the library exists to give you that idea.\n\nI have no idea whether this situation is fictional or factual. I've no idea whether the narrator is both developer and commentator. I can't tell you whether it's a waste of time or not. But I bought a copy. I played it. And by some miracle I didn't request a refund. I still don't know why. Perhaps I feel I can work it out if I look at it again. I don't know whether ir's accidental - this sense of emptiness or it's a carefully engineered con-trick to rob the participant of any sense of understanding.\n\nI don't even know if I can recommend this game or not. Steam forced me to pick an option but it felt wrong to click either button. I chose Yes after tossing a coin.\n\nThe Stanley Parable tried to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of trying to escape a fixed narrative. This game is trying to ask if you can find meaning in the movement of fog and sand.  Can you look at the wind and see a form? All I feel is ambivalence.","October 1, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

As other reviewers have been saying going into to much kind of defeats the purpose but its still a unique idea and despite any potential  cries of it being a nothing walking simulator it does involve the player in its own way, its definitely not like Dear Esther. It's not perfect, and it can be rather self-indulgent, but it was interesting enough throughout and it sticks the landing to make for a good ending. I think more actually could have been done to really expand on the main theme and make it really great but as it its fine, not mindblowing and not nearly as impressive as some other indie adventure-esque games this year, but I think it works regardless and is worth it.","October 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

There is no completion percentage, there are no enemies, no fighting, and no replayability. Instead this game offers an amazing story that will catch you in to it from the beginning.\n\nSome players that come from The Stanley Parable like myself will start up this game in search for an awesome experience with tonnes of replayability, whacky features, and much more. Well this game is none of those. It is not an awesome experience, it is a sad, traumatic experience that requires patience.

Otherwise, I don't.\n\nI played just over 80 minutes of it, and took my time. I didn't bother to attempt to scour every detail, but I didn't rush, either. Even then, that'd be fine, if the narrative or gameplay were more enjoyable.\n\nIf you've ever worked on an indie game while battling depression/anxiety, you might feel some resonance with the tale. However the point is kinda hamfisted, insistent, and even a bit self-phallating.\n\nThe final ~10 minutes of the game were the only things keeping me from being downright peeved that I'd spent money on this at all. Even then, there was absolutely nothing fun or too terribly interesting about the journey to that point.\n\nLastly, the overall final point of the game is also severely muddied by the fact that the dev put it on sale for $9.99. (Though I got it 20% off ... $7.99 doesn't change my mind). If you wanted the game to be a message instead of enjoyable, and have that message spread, then why charge for it at all ...? Makes the entire point seem made-up, like you've just done nothing for a few years and wanted to push out some unfinished stuff as a cash grab.

It tells a fine story that goes well with the smooth running gameplay. However, the main thing that killed this game for me is the price of the game and the amount of playtime. I recieved this as a gift from a friend, who payed $20 for a copy for me and himself. This game is only about an hour and a half long, and once it's done, there is really no replayability. If you want to experience it, look it up on youtube, because it's essentially a story with some background game, and is not worth $10 by any means. For the content and playtime, I think it would be worth at most $5, and that may be asking too much. If you really want to play this game, wait for it to go on sale. Otherwise, I suggest you go get the Stanley Parable, made by the same dev, and with some actual gameplay and replay value. It's a little more money, but worth it.

I absolutely adored Stanley's Parable, it was probably both the funniest and most clever game I've ever played. But this... I dunno. It was certainly interesting. Is it worth $10? That's a hard question, because games aren't easy to make, and the author definitely deserves compensation, but I wouldn't really call this a game. It's more of an experience than anything. It's easily completed in under 2 hours, even with just screwing around and trying to interact with everything. Do not expect to find any secrets, this game is just a straight shot down a very linear path. Either that, or I missed something, but I felt I was fairly thourough.\n\nTL;DR: If you want funny and witty, play Stanley's Parable; do not play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/primordialmuse/recommended/303210/","primordialmuse","strbldsnch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/primordialmuse/","809 products in account","I just cannot rate this highly and it has nothing to do with it being pretentious or a walking simulator or a non-game or whatever else people might bash it on.  I actually thought it was a fun premise, though very very lax on interactivity, and enjoyed playing it even if I found myself getting more and more uncomfortable as (the relatively short) time went by.\n\nMy big problem, and I will try to say this without spoiling things, is that the game presents a clear message.  Clear signs and clear indicators of an important subject that is oft-times ignored by society as a whole.  Not even just ignored, but flat out villified and shunned and pushed under the rug.  I was all aboard with this.  I liked that it brought these issues to light even if it was painful.\n\nThen you get to the end of the game and, oh no!  It's a big joke on you!  That wasn't what was happening at all!  All those telltale signs of an actual problem weren't a problem at all.  In fact, the person with the problem was annoyed that someone tried to help.  We're talking cutting friendships annoyed.  Angry, in fact.\n\nThe fact that the game takes these issues then just turns them into a gotchya is irresponsible.  It is telling people to ignore the same signs in people they know because you may end up annoying them.  Don't show you care, don't try to help, don't try to pull them from the abyss... because you might be seen as a meddler who has no right to judge.\n\nBut most of these people displaying these signs do need help. They do need friends who are willing to intervene and save them. They need people willing to show an interest in pulling them out of a potentially life endangering spiral.  I was the one angry at the end of this.  How could anyone make a game that could cause even one person to question whether they should help a friend in need or not? All so there could be some clever twist.  No.  Just no.\n\nYes, I realize the friend meddled way too much and had problems of his own and actually did much of the meddling for his own benefit if only subconsciously. This part of the story is fine.  Even someone who actually had the issues we are led to believe the person had could be upset at this level of interfering.  But no, the game specifically says "I do not have that problem despite showing all the signs."  And that's not right.  It insinuates that anyone else displaying such behavior may just like being like that so leave them alone.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, well there isn't a lot. Exploration is not encouraged nor rewarded save for maybe a bit of dialogue saying, "Nope, nothing here!" and choices don't matter at all. It's done in under 90 minutes and starts off strong and compelling just from a narrative point of view. But the ending, discouraging helping people, invalidates anything positive on offer here.\n\nI tend to only review games I feel strongly positive about, but this one is the opposite and is my first negative recommendation. I wanted to like it and was excited when I heard about it. But I am just left wishing I hadn't played it and hoping others who might be influenced to stay out of someone else's affairs even when they sorely need the intervention also give it a miss.","October 7, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game will only appeal to a few, if the game does not grab you from the get go, it never will. I personally do not see the point in it, it made me sad but thats about it. I felt no wonder, no joy, no laughs, and most of all, anything to make it worth my money. If you want to see for yourself, play it, and if you do not enjoy the game, the refund option is helpful for times like these. Also, where i loved the first part of it, the joy quickly dimished as it gained a darker tone that remained till the end. The reason the parable was enjoyable is due to the fact that the game had laughs and emotionally relief while still sprinkling in darker tones. This game goes straight to the dark, and makes it unbearble to play due to its one tone and its emotionally oppressiveness ways. Final verdict: if you are looking for a fun game, this isnt it, go home. However if you are looking for an experience that makes you feel, then this may be for you.","October 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first you feel like you're digging deeper into a person's story of their life and how these games reflect on them, but you soon learn that it doesn't go deeper. It becomes repetitive and the narrator removes any thought from the game.\n\nIn the end, it's got a good story. While it misses a general story arch, it has some thoughtful presentation and good thought through struggles in life, but the gameis missing gameplay. It is just a story with narration and no thought in what you do, or really anything to do, which is what dissapoints me.","October 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game finds more in common with things like Dear Esther or Gone Home. It is heavily narrated quintessential walking simulator.\n\nAlso you will be disappointed if you expect to sink hours into this. This is a story to be experienced and assuming you take your time with it and take the time to appreciate the unfolding experience you will be done within 2 hours at most.\n\nSo you're paying $4 an hour to walk forward and hear a man talk. And it's worth every penny.\n\nDavey Wrenden offers a deep and touching story with an intimacy that a passive medium such as film can only dream of, intimacy that can only be gained by "going through a journey" through someone. It is a beautiful performance that draws you in. Immaculately designed enviroments and a truely beautiful score that rides the waves of the story both add nuance and depth on multiple levels. It both bleeds sincerity and real emotion and when it's over it will leave you with a lot to unravel about yourself and about the people you learned about.\n\nThere really is nothing else I can say without ruining the game so all I can say is that this game will challenge your sense of yourself, it will touch you and it will not stop once you close the program and will steep in your mind like an existenial teabag.\n\n\nThe teabag is feels flavored.","October 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But most of the reviews I read are more like a movie review that is meant for people who watched the movie. So this will contain spoilers. Stop reading after "About the game" if you want to try the story with fresh eyes.\n\nWhile "playing" I was very torn between recommend and not recommend. The ending made my decision easy though.\n\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe gameplay is nothing like the Stanley Parable if you wonder. In fact there is no gameplay. Yes you can play the little game sequences but the narrator will not let do much else. It is more like a movie where I have to keep "W" pressed so the movie continues. You choices (few there are) are meaningless. I think it is neither a game nor some showcase about game design...it is statement. See it as a movie where you can walk around the set.\n\nSpoilers start here-----------------------------------\n\nAbout the story:\n\nI'd like to preface this with the fact that everything in this game might not be true. I could be a fantasy. But the narrator really tries to convey the notion that this is actually true and Coda exists or did exist. This of course opens Wreden (the dev) up to much critisism over his behaviour, which did influence my gaming experience quite a lot.\n\nIn the first few minutes I thought I knew what was going to happen. We will see a person (Coda) deteoriate through "playing" his games until he commits suicide (or at least tries). And this game is supposed to be like a monument and the admission that Wreden did not or could not help him.\n\nThis is not how it is going to end. Coda just cuts off contact with Wreden because he felt violated. Coda just made games for himself, Wreden thought he is in some dark place and tries to "help" him by showing his games to others. To get Coda some praise and feedback. He did that without his consent. Coda feels like Wreden is just projecting his own issues onto him and his games. Coda made games like others write diaries. For himself. That is why he breaks off contact. Wreden instead makes the "Beginners Guide" to somehow apologize and try to reconnect with Coda. And he does exactly what Coda does not want him to do.\n\nThis is a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do. After playing it I felt like I had invaded someones deepest private thoughts. Stuff other people might tell their therapists. I felt disgusted because Coda clearly wanted to keep these games for himself. It is like Wreden was reading his diary on Youtube.\n\nI feel like I just had to sit trough 90mins of someone rationalizing an act (well two) he feels guilty about. I am not a therapist. I don't usually enjoy this. With friends I will listen and try get to the bottom of there arguments and feelings or I just tell them to stop. Or I tell them I disagree. But here you can not. You have to listen and thats it. Wreden can feel good about himself and his public apology...we can't even say no or not accept it or probe his arguments further. Well we can write reviews.\n\nWether or not the story is true. I feel like I was convinced to do something wrong. If this story is true. My moral disgust outweighs any artistic merit. If the story is fantasy, why? Do I as a gamer really need to replay a morally wrong act. We all done bad things. No I think this is story is real or Wreden at least wants us to feel like it is real. Then I am back with moral disgust.\n\nDo not get me wrong. Some of the games and narrators interpretation are emotionally quite powerful but after the end, I feel like I should not have done it. Have you ever snooped on someone elses phone and felt kinda dirty afterwards? Thats how I feel and I am angry that Wreden made me do it. The narrator will mislead you.","January 4","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
