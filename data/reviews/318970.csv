Well, StarCrawlers is a sci-fi dungeon crawler that puts you in the shoes of a Crawler in a galaxy where megacorps control the lives of the billions teeming in the galaxy. What does being a Crawler entail? Well, every now and then corps need a few dirty jobs done in order to expand and Crawlers are often the individuals they contact in order to do so. If you’ve ever played Shadowrun, this universe gives similar vibes.\n\nRundown:\n-	Graphics: When exploring the environments are detailed, crisp, and the lighting is appropriate for the locations (If it’s too dark, the flashlight is quite nice [F]). Occasionally graphical glitches or rendering issues will appear but these happen rarely. In combat game has a fair bit of beautiful eye candy when it comes to some class abilities (Void Psyker comes to mind as does a fully leveled Hacker activating Ex Machina.)\n\n-	Combat: The game is turn based with the order of the characters being dictated by combat initiative. Characters spend TU with their skills and are placed in the timeline of characters depending on the amount of TU spent. Combat is based of of skill which have a % chance to hit, as of now I feel that the percentages feel rather accurate, though this being a % based game you may have a string of unlucky misses or hopefully lucky hits. Leveling is a bit of a slog at first, you’ll probably want to stick to cakewalk missions for the first 10 levels or so and avoid any pirate levels. Classes have some very nice interactions between them leading to some very satisfying combos once you hit the level necessary to do so.\n\n-	Exploration/Interaction: Environments are procedurally generated so there it doesn’t feel like such a slog jogging down that same pathway for the next 10 missions. Current environments include facilities/mines/offices/labs/ship interiors.  If your cursor goes orange when you mouse over an object you can interact with said object. You can do things from picking up credsticks, hacking terminals, looting, disabling traps to unlocking secret rooms with bosses that have sweet loot.\n\nAssessment:\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nIt’s a pretty game but some graphical glitches hold it back.\n(It’s early access though, keep that in mind.)\n\nCombat: 7/10 -> 8.5/10\nThe first 7 levels will be the worst period of your Crawler experience as some classes need around 3 maxed skills to come online, but if you can tough it out you’ll be rewarded from that point onwards.\n\nExploration: 10/10\nTons of things to interact with, procedurally generated environment means no two maps will ever be the same. Different corps means different aesthetics; you might have waterfalls and plants from Agrigen/GalaxyMart or lab equipment from JinYin Biotech. Some maps also feature transitions; a mine map may start off in the mine but certain sections will possess interiors akin to an office map.\n\nConclusion:\nI’ve loved the game so far, from someone who’s grown up with the Wizardry series and Shadowrun it’s refreshing to have a game that caters to both tastes. The game isn’t the only thing that you can appreciate though, the developers are constantly releasing new content and listening to the feedback created by the community. I feel it’s worth every penny.\n\n(EDITED: Was missing a colon, punctuation ofc, and some spelling errors had to be fixed.)","February 13","true","115.5"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","38","39","0","0"

You get an *almost finished* game working without issues. And a great game while we're at it. The hand drawn art style interface is lovely, the gameplay works flawless, the humorous dialog mixed with the sci-fi theme reminds me about Han Solo in Star Wars. You start with seven possible classes (you're given an 8th one later) each with three different specializations and you're able to mix them in a party so the possibilities are endless. There's only one thing keeping Starcrawlers from being a very great game, early access, with that I mean there's some polishing to be done, sounds to be added and eventually other things to be included. But that's part of the EA process I would say.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video (first look):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy43opxrSJo","March 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","45","55","3","11"

The devs are active in the Steam Community forums and very receptive to feedback, suggestions and bugreports. StarCrawlers shows all the signs of becoming a great game after a succesfull Kickstarter and Early Access period. It just needs some more work and a bit more polish, like an actual story but that is still in the works.\n\nSpeaking of polish, if there's one thing StarCrawlers has going for it already it's the music. Ben Prunty (of FTL: Faster Than Light fame) has managed to produce another soundtrack that fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly and really sets the mood.\n\nAll in all this game has great potential.","March 17, 2015","true","16.4"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","0"

But that'll surely get extended later on, this is not a hard thing to do.\nAnd then there's a small problem with rewards balancing - right now it is basically non-existent. You can get same rewards for mission of level 2 as for level 7, which is not nice. But surely that'll get fixed.\n\nTo do those missions you have 8 classes to pick from. And don't worry, you can get all of them into your team, but you will have to pick only 4 that go into actual mission.\nAll classes are very different and have pretty unique play styles. And as well affect the way that you can progress through mission (e.g. hacker can crack the security system, or open locked doors, soldier can use his skill to blind security cameras, engineer can disarm traps that you'd triggered, etc).\nAgain, all heroes can be leveled up to gain awesome skills (and to wear better gear, which is quite obvious).\nThe combat is pretty much what you'd expect from first-person dungeon crawling RPG game. It's very solid, already pretty polished mechanically and just a blast to get through. Can get a bit boring if you go to a missions that too low level for you. But that's your own fault :P\n\nThe environments in the game are too very well made - they are pretty, stylish and quite enjoyable to explore. The maps are quite large and there are plenty of hidden lockers and stashes to loot and some other minor things to find.\nIf I would to criticise the exploration part (again, for the moment), I'd say that those smaller hidder reward most of the time are not worth it - spending too much time looking for 5 creds is not nice.\n\nThe game is made in Unity engine and is very well optimized, so you'll probably be able to run it on low-end machines too.\nIt also looks like devs made the UI with touch screens in mind, so it is possible we'll see StarCrawlers on tablets some time in the future (and I personally love this fact).\n\nOther small issues that was not mentioned before include:\n- Occasional issues with displaying the map layouts properly. Encountered that couple of times, does not breaks the game, but slightly annoying.\n- One crash that I'd encountered while exiting the game. No progress was lost, occured only once, maybe was fault of my recording software?\nAnd that's about it.\n\nThe game's excellent and if you love some good dungeon crawling - grab this one, totally worth it.\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://youtu.be/ELwhSs4Sf6A","March 22, 2015","true","7.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","7"

It is in a playable and fun state right now, but there are features missing, so be warned. There's a lot more here than just killing and looting. The interface is excellent, the combat is fun, and the dungeon crawling experience is actually more enjoyable than Grimrock's in my opinion. Little multiple choice popups allow you to flesh out your team's personality throughout the game. Different factions that ooze personality contact you to do their dirty work. The game looks amazing, feels amazing, and is a ton of fun.\n\nIf you can't wait there's no harm in buying it. That said, I would suggest you do wait until it comes out. It still needs a lot of work, but what's there is a very solid foundation and a lot of fun gameplay.","June 17, 2015","true","18.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkscyon/recommended/318970/","darkscyon","I am a robot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkscyon/","138 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Hacker, a CyberNinja and a Smuggler walk into a bar. They get a mission to steal some stuff for a nameless, faceless corporation that made a mistake with technology that shouldn't exist. They leave, and on the way find a killer robot named Sparky. Sparky likes to read Haikus and explain how he's superior to fleshy mortals. They band together to fight in the name of making more money. In the future, no one can hear you scream unless you have credits.\n\nEarly Access is a little bit of a crapshoot. On the one hand you're trying to support a developer so they can make a game you want. On the other hand you're being given an unfinished game so you can provide feedback and hopefully enjoy it a bit.\n\nWith this in mind StarCrawlers is well worth what they're charging. There simply aren't a lot of first person POV dungeon crawlers being made nowadays for the PC (most are on consoles and of them most haven't been translated to English), and the most successful series in recent memory (Grimrock) is real-time. You go into weird places, fight robots and aliens, take stuff that isn't nailed down and sell it. Rinse and repeat, you've got everything from The Bard's Tale to Might and Magic X with as little in-between you and a rare suit of armor with three more adjectives than is humanly needed.\n\nThey've clearly put in a lot of thought into classes and skills, and the interplay between different combinations of the two reflects a lot of work on balancing them. You likely will want at least two class/skill combinations that can do damage, but you can pick from buffing, debuffing, shielding or tanking among the rest. Even with a "pure" DPS setup like the Combination CyberNinja you get to play around with the battle system a lot.\n\nWith all of this, even with an unfinished game there is a ton of fun to be had here. I'll be happy when they implement mission saves, and there are still bugs to be found and reported. If you're ok with that you'll get more than you're money's worth.","October 12, 2015","true","16.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","19","22","4","0"

For StarCrawlers, the answer is "no."\n\nThis is, for the most part, a complete and enjoyable game.  There are occasional glitches, and the combat could probably stand further balancing, but these are minor nitpicks.  The only major missing component is the story, and while plot would enhance the game, it is not an essential element.\n\nThe characters come in six classes, and their abilities are quite distinctive.  The turn-based combat is a refreshing break from the "modern" action-RPGs which have become popular lately, but the game also manages a few new twists on an old idea.  StarCrawlers places considerable emphasis on time management, with many abilities altering the flow of the timeline.  At the moment, most of those abilities are wielded by the player, though I imagine the developers are at least considering enemy abilities.\n\nSome elements of the developers' plan feel a bit ambitious to me.  I would recommend buying this game for what it is rather than for what it might become.  I do expect the game to improve considerably, but it's quite good now.","April 4, 2015","true","15.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The setting is quite refreshing, there isn't much sci-fi going on usualy, and it's realy well done here. Art-work, especialy the soundtrack, combat effects, enemy and area designes are pretty slick and engaging.\nCrawling is done by a team of 4, while you can have more chars, only 4 go on a mission. classes vary quite a lot: starting from a combo-point mechanic (ala WoW Rogue), to a timebending hacker, there's alot of diversety and each class currently offeres lots of diffrent skills and there are more to come.\nYou kinda get thrown into the game and are running missions, collecting rewards, gettin rep with diffrent corps and gearing/leveling your party and it is alot of fun.

The individual ingredients may be familiar, but the resulting dish is damn tasty.\n\nThe game is, at the time of writing, in Early Access, but worth buying even if the devs never update it again - the current build is stable, relatively bug-free, and a lot of fun, with the promise that future builds will add more (more campaign missions, more systems).

Oh joy! This game is still pretty rough but so far it is extremely promising and interesting. Crawling dungeons has always been a thing I have enjoyed greatly, and kooky sci fi settings are always fun  (And yes, I know that Wizardry was kooky sci fi itself, so eh).\nProcedurally generated dungeons? Sure, why not. Not nearly as enjoyable as a well crafted dungeon (such as the ones in, well, Wizardry, and the Etrian Odyssey series). It is fun to see that the enemies are for the most part visible in the map so far, so one can decide to either try to  find another  route or fight them head on.\nAn issue I have so far with the map generation is that it seems to not be generating any sort of secret rooms, or none that I could find. Secret rooms on derelict ships would make sense,  secret cargo holds, etc, but at least the crawling is straightforward enough, and it is fairly entertaining  with well made tiles/rooms, even if the early missions do feel a bit repetitive.\nSo far I am liking it a whole lot due to novelty, but there are some issues that I feel mar the experience:\na)Menu dialogs with  a period after the number are not selectable through keyboard use. The menu dialogs with a parenthesis ) after the number are. That feels somewhat inconsistent and annoying.\nb)Combat  options being selected via mouse drag. It is annoying in Blackguards, and it is annoying in this one, although less so since it is far clearer on what everything does. A keyboard/menu based option that did not require the tablet-like selecting of combat options would be nice.\nc) No way to run from encounters? Need to finalize every single one? The option to run away would be appreciated. If there is any reason to not have something like fleeing, well, I would like to know!\nd) No way to delay a character's turn? Tactical options like that would be nice.\ne) No healer archetype class? Interesting.\nf) Only one recruit of each class? Oh well. I did like to have gimmick parties in the Etrian games, such as 4 gatherers for material runs, but if it is one of each, that still allows for quite a bit of flexibility.\n\nThat being said, I am enjoying this title greatly so far, and things such as the  visible turn counter are fantastic.\nI hope that this title does very well and keeps getting better with each version!

Oh the sweet loot <3\n\n*Con's* :\n*There really should be an overall story. At this point it feels like you're not really aiming at any goal other than "finish a little mission".\n*There should be something else to spend your currency on. Instead of just loot, maybe have your own ship that you can customize or upgrade?\n*There should definitely be more puzzles. The early "Yellow, red, yellow, red" was fun and I'd love to see more of that.\n\nAll in all this game is amazing for what it is and I'll be playing much more of it :P\n\n\n*Edit* 8/9/15\n\nSo recently they've done a *lot* of reworking when it comes to classes and they've also added a few new missions.\n\nThe reworking is great. Usually [in most games] reworking just means nerfing but in this case, they've made the classes even more interesting and fun to play. There's a lot of synergy now with the classes and all-in-all, it's just made the game even better.\n\nAs for the new missions? They're great and we need so many more of them! The main missions seem to have more depth, context, story and systems to them. Whether it's choosing how you do an objective, figuring out little puzzles or aiming to do optional objective, it's just great. The only issue is there isn't many/enough main story missions so after you're done with them, you just go back to the side missions which definitely aren't as fun.\n\nEven now, this game is getting better and better and I'm loving it. I just hope they add more story-oriented missions soon. Still hoping they add some form of character customization too >_<","March 21, 2015","true","12.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I don't even know where to begin to describe how/why it is so great.\n\nThe old fashioned grid based movement mechanics mixed with more modern free mouse looking is perfect.\n\nThe graphics are simply BEAUTIFUL.  The sound is perfect.  I think I'm gonna try to go back and by the other edition that comes with the soundtrack.  Never done that for a game before.  It's that good!\n\nThe hub-based system is great.  For those who don't know, here's how that works.  You're not just plopped onto a map and now you walk around to discover things.  Rather, there is a "hub" type of screen where you can mess with your loadouts (equipment), buy/sell/heal/etc.  And very importantly - where you get your missions.  You take a mission and then you get a short loading screen and you are then plopped into a starting spot on a map - just for that mission.  Now you're in the old-school crawling mode.  Discover things, fight, loot, achieve the objective - then you find an exit which just gives you another short loading screen then you're back at the hub.  Great!\n\nSo you're not just on one huge quest that you're supposed to be doing from start to end.  You take missions.  Which all have their own pluses and minuses.  Most missions seem to be "company X wants you to infiltrate company Y and steal something."  Of course, if you do it, then company X will like you more and company Y will begin to hate you.  Of course affecting future missions and such.\n\nEach mission has it's own map.  I think randomized?  Could be wrong on that - I haven't yet done the same mission twice.  I'm still such a noob at this game.\n\nThe other major thing is ...  instead of "creating your character" or your team of characters, you are picking characters from a pre-defind list of guys - MOBA style.  Except once you pick them you keep them and level them up.  You can build up a roster of guys and pick which ones to bring on any given mission.  The max you can bring on a mission is 4 guys.\n\nEach has three different "talent trees" to pick from.  You invest points to gain powers/perks as you level.  Standard stuff if you've played any MMO in the past 15 years.  The choices are both hilarious and awesome.  Very distinct gameplay because of the chosen powers.  My "hacker" tossing "shareware" around is just... so much fun!\n\nIf I have any complaint it's the fact that you can't just save whenever you want.  You can save at the hub, between missions.  I suppose this is their nod to the rogue-like crowd.  I just don't get this.  It's pretty bad.  BECAUSE...  even "level 1" missions can be on HUGE maps.  Just tonight I thought I'd take a level 1 cakewalk mission just to try out a new guy.  Take 15 minutes I thought.  NOPE.  The map was HUGE and it took me nearly an hour.  I would have loved to save and come back tomorrow.  Lesson learned.\n\nSo much of the game is still yet to be implemented too.  I can see so many places where they are planning to make it even better.  Yet even without all of that, the game is golden.  I love it.  Best new game in ages.\n\nBest of all, it seems to me like they could have quite a future.  Because each mission is self contained, it seems like they could pump these out for a long long time, giving/selling us new content well into the future.  Take my money now - I'd pay $15 per month to support that - this is the new game baby!\n\nTLDR: if you like old-school team based turn based dungeon crawlers but want something that will look and sound awesome on your modern computer - BUY IT ALREADY.\n\n","March 20","true","13.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/318970/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview of the 12/18/2015 patch\n\nSUMMARY: A science fiction adventure done dungeon-crawling style with it's own unique aesthetic and approach, and a real sense of atmosphere.  However it is very early access, so is only worth purchasing if you want to get in on it early - it looks very promising.\n\nStar Crawlers is actually a bit of a flashback to the old Sci-Fi CRPGs of yesteryear that used Dungeon Crawling mechanics to tell stories of laser weapons and high technology.  However though the idea is retro, the modern presentation is fully up to date - great graphics, fantastic music, unique character designs.  It's moving an idea forward in a modern style, with some tweaks and a sophisticated art direction - while retaining the fun.\n\nYou arrive on a distant space station as one of a selection of classes, starting life as a "Crawler" - a futuristic mercinary/explorer/troubleshooter.  Crawlers always have business among the stars, from being assasints to assisting in recovery of lost technologies.  After a few preliminaries, you're off on an adventure with your new crew and the fun begins.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk characters.  Each character class is extremely unique, each with three distinct skill trees to unlock.  Depending how you want to play, you can develop radically different gameplay styles between and even within a class.  Your Soldier can be a meat shield or an explosives expert or a sniper.  Your Force Psyker can be a walking mind-cannon or a barrier against damage.  Your Hacker can manipulate and overclock man and machine as needed.\n\nTo add to the fun - and a clever addition to the game - each class is recruitable once.  You get one version of each class at a time. so you can't overload the game with one playstyle.  This clever addition sets the tone of Star Crawlers for me - things we've seen before, but done well, and with little improvements that add more.\n\nIf there's one issue I have with characters its that some skills are a bit bizarre (some depend on your weapon, for instance) .  I'm not sure if THIS is clever or just a bit strange.  Skill interplay is vital to combat, however, and is very enjoyable.\n\nYou take various jobs, some following the plot, some not, and enter assorted randomized environments that you explore in 3D.  Puzzles, treasures, traps, and of course enmeies are all there for you to encounter.  The looks of these environments are good to fantastic overall, and there are some real surprises as you explore.  A "look around" function encourages you to truly explore your environment - a hidden cache or a terminal you can hack might just be found.\n\nEvents and random occurences in game add some additional choices, loot, and plot points.  One of the things that really makes it stand out is some events involve character interaction and dialogue - this adds flavor and character to the game and is a welcome addition.  Between the atmosphere, the classes, and these details you get a real sense of "being there"\n\nThere is, as is appropriate for the genre, combat.  Enemies and characters and allies each operate in a timeline - actions, kinds of weapons, and skills all affect when you can take action, how often, and how often your next action is.  This adds a welcome addition to combat - timing - and requires good strategy to master.\n\nEquipment and "treasure" is basic - loot, accessories, tweapons, armor, shields (which have both "charges" and "amount of damage adsorbed," adding another level of tactics - how long they last and what they do).  You can upgrade equipment, adding some additional customization.\n\nAs you play you gain reputation with a dizzying amount of factions, and little extras, plots, and so on pop up on your adventures.  Reputation will supposedly drive the plot, but at this time there isn't very much included, and it's not explained very well.  I assume this is coming.\n\nThe game is in no way finished.  There's missing elements, incomplete text, and more.  However the author has been good about posting updates and getting feedback integrated.  There's a real sense of commitment to the project.\n\nSo is it worth getting?  Well, it's not finished.  So if you sign on, sign on because you want to support this unfinished game becoming finished and fantastic.  I did and it was worth it.","April 12, 2015","true","17.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Shadowrun meets Firefly in the style of Wizardry 8.\nIf you like any of these or just good scifi games buy this.\n\nFirst off one of the best Early Access games I have played; you can tell I lot of work has gone into making this a smooth arena for early access players. I picked this up when it first hit steam, but it just sat in my library for a few weeks. Once I started playing I couldn't put it down. I am very much looking forward to seeing a more complete product. Now that said this is definetly not complete and it show's; if you want a fully developed game you will have to wait.\n\nThe main complaint I have, or had really, was the controlls are very clunky. the movement was stiff and the right click to freelook mechanic was downright horrible. But when I dug in a little more I found that these could be changed. I would highly recommend that anyone playing this switch to always freelook in the options, this should really be the default setting. I also found that with a little tinkering this game plays beautifully with the steam controller. If controller support is not already on the menu it should be looked into.\nI've seen some reviews talking about character balance issues, but I didn't find any major issues here. I do think that the difficulty rating should be ramped up a bit. I am not a hardcore game type, I play most games on normal and hard, never nightmare. but here I found myself ramping the difficulty all the way up to get a more satisfying experience.\n\nI won't give a real rating yet but\n\n10/10 to the devs for what they have done so far","December 15, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The attention to detail in the environments are superb - like the signs on the walls of corporations telling their employees that their co-workers aren't their friends (and neither are starcrawlers!). The combat is fun and challenging, the music is nice - could be a bit darker, but its light and fluffy sountrack kind of grows on you (like a vesitgial limb you can sell to the Doc for more credits). The story seems engaging and seems (from the content that was available at the time of my playing) that your decisions actually will matter to some degree to the story by affecting your ratings with the varying factions.\nOh yeah, did I say there were factions? I mean there are a lot of them.\nFeels a lot like a Shadowrun universe, and thats a good thing - while at the same time containing quite a bit of wry humor, and fun gameplay.

It may, or may not be an issue for you, just be aware that it's there, and can be an issue.\nIt is also super-loot based. With all loot being random, it can be kind of hard to equip an entire team. Especially since weapon accuracy is such a huge determining factor, and doesn't balance well against wait-times and damage.\nOh, and the main capaign isn't implemented yet, so beyond what feel like radiant quests, there's not much there.\n\nThen again, it is early access, and the developers are very involved and haven't implemented the main campaign which they have promised will remedy some problems. It's also super-pretty, has a great setting, good team-building and the party balance is pretty awesome.\n\nI'm recommending it, because it's only going to get better, and it's already a pretty nice, if slightly barebones at the moment, game.","April 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a great sci-fi take on the dungeon crawler genre, that lets me explore mazes of spaceship corridors and storage rooms while keeping me on my toes with challenging encounters.\n\nSure the game needs a little balancing with combat but its Early Access and that’s to be expected.  The devs are really responsive with bug fixes and updates so I’m positive it’s only going to get better from here.  I wish more Early Access games stated out like this.  Also a stellar soundtrack provided by Ben Prunty who also worked on FTL makes for a great atmosphere along with some fun times like in the hacking areas of the game.\n\nThis game has a ton going for it for just launching on Early Access and its totally worth the money, support, and love.

I mean it has great potential. As I understand authors are now presenting core mechanisms and more content will be added before full release as the game now is kinda flat. But if you liked wizardry this is exactly title for you.\n\nWhat do I miss (as the autors for say that we who bought game early should help to form game)\n\n1) Story where consequences matter (without it it will be just another Grimrock)\n2) More diverse combat in terms of effects - inspiration can be wizardry - there were at least two dozens different effects in combat that really did matter\n3) More places - so far there is a mission hub and random generated dungeon. This is good but not enough. Creating environment in such engine can be easy so you can create planetlike dungeon or some semipersistent area\n4) Monsters can be seen from distance but you cant really do anything about them  they move to you and than there is combat - maybe if you see them ahead you should be able to harass them with weapons or start up some buffs ...\n5) More character equipment slots. So far you have weapon armor shield and miscelaneous. Maybe its enough but I dont think so. Having only 4 options per character is too little\n\n\nBut I really do recomend this game as it has great potential to become new wizardry of 21st century","March 24, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only weird thing about this game is the RNG... seriously, sometimes 96% accuracy feels like 75% and 80% accuracy feels like 45% lol no joke you'll find yourself missing countless times with an 80% accuracy weapon, but crits are reliable and nice. The only bug i've encountered is the map bug, where parts of the map is incomplete, even if you walk into the area, it remains undrawn. But other than that, no gameplay bugs, glitches, or annoyance.

There are areas where I feel that my team (Void Psyker, Cyber Ninja, Soldier and Smuggler) are lacking (AoE damage, in particular), but I have tried the other classes and swapping out any one of them for another would simply open up bigger holes.\n\nI personally feel that the Force Psyker tank/shield combo should synergize better than it does; perhaps that will come when the upper tier skills are released. I have tried the Hacker briefly and was less than impressed; even with a fully buffed tree (after the patch; prior you could spam the haste transfer thing for great justice). Have yet to try the Prototype (since patch notes and forum imply a few non functioning abilities).\n\nStuff that I would like to see: functional buffs on loot would be nice, as currently I do not see a reason not to go all +dodge (as long as you have a Cyber Ninja that can exploit it), more storyline (but will never be enough), some sort of result from the rep system (might need to remove a few reputations or give way to get reputation for specific faction/corporation).\n\nIn conclusion, this has been a really fun Early Access game to just play, and I look forward to trying out more content!","May 6, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you don't want to read my lengthy review in its entirety feel free to skip to the “Recommendation” section to find out why.\n\nFurthermore this review may have been posted today (2015/04/06), but is mainly based on a small write-up I did for a German community (2015/03/18). There have been no major content patches in the meantime, so everything should still be up to date. Also note that English isn't my native language - so feel free to ignore or complain about all the mistakes I make. ;)\n\n- atmosphere / writing:\n\nOverall I like the writing so far. There isn't much in the game yet, since the campaign (apart from the prologue, which equals a short tutorial) isn't implemented yet, but what I've seen is nice. I especially like the fact, that character properties that are NOT part of the abilities and numbers on the character sheet also appear to matter. For example there were some spores or stuff like that and not only could the character wearing a full body suit go in without any negative effect, but he also made a comment about that. Very nice detail! Furthermore actual character abilities or classes also provide additional dialogue choices. This isn't really new (looking at games like Baldurs Gate), but something AFAIK rarely developed in first person dungeon crawlers like this one.\n\n- visuals and dungeon design:\n\nThe assets used in the procedurally generated dungeons are quite varied for the most part. More often than not I was very pleasantly surprised how desks most of the time look different – sometimes cluttered, sometimes tidy, but rarely all to repetitive. There have however been instances as well, were assets tend to repeat to often, somewhat staining this positive impression. (Especially the covers of magazines lying around tend to repeat. Admittedly they are a bit more difficult than cups etc., since placing and turning them differently doesn't help, but it's still noticeable.) There are sections that are entirely generated as well as “pre-made” larger rooms. Those larger rooms in itself are spiced up by randomly placed smaller decorative objects or obstacles, but overall the number of these rooms is still rather low and they tend to repeat very often.\nThe quality of the assets is very good for the most part. Considering this is an indie game in early development I'd say they look excellent. However rare cases of 'extremely low res textures' remain. I hope those will be fixed.\n\n- Sound and music:\n\nSoundeffects are okay-ish, but IMHO somewhat lacking in number. Some things (like for example doors) didn't make sounds for me at all. I hope that's still work in progress.\nThe music however is an entirely different story: It's really great and I presently do consider buying the soundtrack as well. I really does support the atmosphere of the game.\n\n- Gameplay:\n\nOnce I got into the game I found it to be a quite satisfying gameplay experience already. There are interesting synergies between different abilities of different classes. One other thing that I REALLY like about this game is, that it tends to keep the player informed. I would like to consider this a standard for modern RPGs, but unfortunately there have been many cases of 'retroish' Indie-RPGs that consider it to be to 'softcore' to actually provide data to the player. The mention an example: Hovering the mouse over an ability while in combat will preview the effect that executing that ability will have on the turn order. (So for example I will know: “If I execute the medium speed attack I'll have a second turn before the big guy finishes charging up his very painful attack, but if I'd use my slowest attack I'd have to wait for that characters next turn until after the monster has fired.”) In contrast to games like 'Darkest Dungeon' (which I also consider to be very promising) I consider this approach to be MUCH better, because it reduces luck and coincidence in combat. Furthermore: When checking my loot I also get to see the character sheet, where positive and negative effects of equipping the item under the mouse cursor are highlighted in different colours.\nIf I had to state anything negative about gameplay it would be the introduction of new players to the game: The tutorial doesn't give any recommendations for after the tutorial missions. Presently you basically have the choice of buying new stuff for your character or buying an additional character for your party. If by any chance the shop doesn't list any weapon for your character (and you don't yet realize that you could quit and reload the game to restock the shop) you will likely end up buying a new character. What the game does NOT tell you is the simple fact, that pre-equipped weapons of new characters are not suited for ANYTHING at all beyond the tutorial. The difference between a level 1 pre-equipped-new-character-weapon and a level 1 weapon dropped in the dungeon or bought in the shop is MASSIVE. I really don't know why they did this, but presently this results in new players likely ending up with a party of two or three characters that cannot complete missions any more – thus forcing them to restart after about 10 to 20 minutes of gameplay. And in all likelihood they will only do so if they are interested enough in the game to search the forums and find out that they absolutely have to get a new weapon before increasing their party size. Otherwise they might not even know what they did wrong.\n\n- Stability and bugs:\n\nI did encounter numerous visual bugs (for example walls or doors appearing at places where they were not), but no crashes.\n\n- Recommendation:\n\nOverall the game already looks very good and I think it might end up becoming a great RPG.\nHOWEVER: The campaign is not yet implemented at all and the developer has no previous history of storytelling that would allow me to guess how skilled they are in that field. (So far the only previous product of significance by the same developer that I could find was an environment for Playstation Home – the “3D chatroom” on Playstation consoles.)\n\nSo my recommendation to RPG fans would be to follow this game (and possibly add it to the wishlist), but not buy it unless they are willing to take a risk.","April 6, 2015","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like the game already now.\n\nYou get a dungeon crawler in a scifi setting, feeling a bit like shadowrun in space. At the moment you got all classes with 50% of their abilities implemented. Their is a simple city screen, with 3 options yet:\n\nDoc > Revive and Heals\nShop > Buy sell stuff\nQuest/Mission Dealer > Quess what you can do here... :-)\n\nYou lead a team of 4 members into random missions (campaign/story not yet implemented). The Maps are very different and have different difficulties (not yet perfectly balanced, but ok).The battle system is nice and like pen and paper role playing games as DSA or Shadowrun all is about speed / initative. The hacking is already their, but looks unfinished. There are also only a few enemies and almost no bosses. You do missions for corporation and gain reputation - but you cannot do anything with it yet.\n\nI found some bugs, some are already fixed no, some remains - but the developers seem to work on it.\n\nIf you start playing this game you can do this for 2 or 3 hours and can say: Thats it - i saw almost everything yet implemented - But this did not protect me from playing already 25 hours, cause the misson system and the fights are already so much fun - now my party is about level 60, to do the same for perhaps 40 more levels and no other specific reason.\n\nSo call me crazy and tell me that i waste my time - I had a lot of fun to do this!\n","April 6, 2015","true","28.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Reminds me of Eye of the Beholder and Wizardy games but better and modern graphics.\n\nUI, it's very nice and easy to navigate / interact with party / npcs.\n\nNavigation is well done and again easy to use\n\nCombat is smooth, timeline (turn based) system that is easy to plan with and see what is coming / calculate what you think is best.\n\nDialog / missions / quests have all been fun this far.\n\nTraps! well done, can surprise you but can also be dealt with / avoided if careful.\n\nCons:\nSome classes that require a lot of setup (building up xyz for effect) or relying on sustain don't fair well compair to pure dmg / tank / assasin classes. I think this is just an issue of tweaking stats and ballance but right know the classes that shouldn't tank and just deal dmg do better it seems vs support / rounded team setups.\n\nLots of useless / junk items, picking things up (using manual look mode to find a random 5 credits) seems like a waste most of the time, I think again this will be changed. Loot system + some sort of crafting and more interactive area's would be awesome.\n\nWould like to see a touch of stealth factor introduced into the game, ability to sneak up on non random encounters or like EMP jam cameras? More things you can do prior to combat to avoid or effect combat in your favor would be cool.\n\nReally enjoying this EA and really recommend.

AND AGAIN YES!\n\nVERY RECOMMENDED EVEN THOUGH ITS EARLY ACCESS.\n\nWhat happens if you make a cross between wizardry, system shock and legend of grimrock? THIS GAME and its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!\n\nI love this game! I havent played much of it so far but i absolutely adored what ive seen so far!\nRemember the movement system from MM10 and Legend of Grimrock? Well this game uses the same thing, however the setting is in space/future and it works out amazingly! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pixel hunting is still in the game and i dont appreciate it, at all however here it felt way more casual, i didnt feel punished for not finding them.\n\nThe visual effects were fantastic! They felt very organic and in tune with the game, every skill has a nice animation to it, not just generic fireball or some buff with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound. Yes, ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft learn from these people how to make a game! Character art feel authentic and fitting 100%.\n\nThe 'observe' function is finally not locked to movement! You can move and keep observing! The 'time measure' was COMPLETELY REMOVED leaving you free to explore! NO MORE TIME CONSTRAINTS. You can sit and enjoy the game, visit that place you liked a few times, check out how things are around, i love it.\n\nSound is done well, i did enjoy the combat music and exploration; 'homebase' however felt annoying mostly.\n\nClasses dont feel same-ish at all! Hell there is so much difference between every single one of them its insane! Moreover the internal branching felt very fun aswell - the smuggler using money to attack with his skills being a ♥♥♥♥ing rip offs early in that branch? XD LOVED IT.\n\nThe game is extremely far from finishing, so far it has 2 missions in the main campaign and a bunch of side ones by the looks of it. Many elements are not finished either, like tier 4-5 skills, additional classes * yeh there is a lot of room there ; D* missing lore texts. However despite all that game looks EXTREMELY PROMISING.\n\nI am not a fan of that visual style of games, i absolutely hated many things about Grimrock, like the fact that i had to pixel hunt and was always pressed by time to move on and on and on or be punished. This game fixes all those problems and brings in a refreshing theme. Killed defence droids in the office! 10/10 Speaking about the office: the game is made by creative people with  sense of humor! The worktable for the employyes of some Titan Metalworking or what was it called consisted primarily of Meeting about Synergy, Teamworking excercises and Trust excercises instead of actual work by the looks of it, a hilarious parody of that synergy craze companies around the globe had recently, yes it may be a bit out of date right now, but in the future.... you know the saying 'all new is well forgotten old' ! With ♥♥♥♥ing modern day coolers and drawers and staplers alongside holowatch and defense droids operating on a woking AI i ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Or that 'work hard! we can always replace you with robots! ' disclaimer!\n\nThe Time unit for weapons and classes feels great, just like in old games like Wizardry or old X-com, its very organic and fits perfectly.\n\nWhat are my hopes: More of this! Please, do not fire anyone involved in the game, its shaping up great! More classes, more missions, more everything. Take another look at 'crafting and improvement' - at the moment if feels more then disfunctional. Review the music in the base - it was one of the 'i hate this' parts of the game. Like when i started and loaded menu/got to the beginning i absolutely hated it just because of the sound. I wanted it muted and gone, was even thinking of closing the game. In Deus ex i remember just sitting in main menu listening to the theme it was that good, here - 1st moments were really ♥♥♥♥ing bad, after it - pure bliss.\n\nIdeally id love a button for 'blind' people to have the secret stuff and other clickables highlighted with glow coming from them or something, you know how you couldnt see stuff in diablo you pressed z and items were listed. That sort of thing on clickables as a turn on/turn off mode. Because i know it can ruin the immersion, but for people with broken eyes it benefits the gameplay a lot.\n\n9/10 for early access as it is right now assuming there is about a year more in dev time before release. And with the price so liberal? Its  a ♥♥♥♥ing steal!\n\nVERY RECOMMENDED EVEN THOUGH ITS EARLY ACCESS.","March 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I am a fan of grid  based dungeon crawlers. I also love sci fi. So I was very excited to first read about StarCrawlers. Would I recomend it? No.\n\nNote: This is for the Early Access version.\n\nPros.\n* It's sci-fi. And a dungeon crawl. Two tasty, tasty things.\n* the frist story mission was fun - felt immersive.\n\nCons.\n* Character Artwork. Not my personal taste. Single Male & female version of each class only.\n* Party make up. You can't take more than one of each class. Be nice to have the option for two ninjas or something.\n* No voice acting. At all. Not even catch phrases when you visit a shop.\n* Items dont feel particulary unique. Weapon types felt locked to classes if you wanted to make best use of skills.\n* The random levels you need to do to rank up your party for story missions are a real grind. Trawling through what are essentialy office buildings is not my idea of a good time.\n* The blocky nature of the grid is very evident in the environment. Not much efffort seems to have gone into disguising this, or making spaces feel like a real space ship or particularly sci-fi.\n* In my 8 hours of playtime half of the enimes where server droids that threw plates and cups at me. I cant say I felt real tough taking them down. Occasionally some more menacing opponents came along, but they where few and far between.\n* No dynamic ligting. Everything was very flat.\n* The other story missions that I played felt a  bit flat.\n\nI think I might have put up with alot of these faults 10 or 15 years ago, but I expect a lot more now from a game. I hope lots of people get value from this game, but it just failed to grab me at all.\n\nThere are better dungeon crawls. A pity they are not any sci-fi ones.","September 22, 2015","false","8.3"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","12","29","2","0"

But as it is now you can use those abilites regardless if you have gathered any "junk" at all. The Force Psyker abilite "Force Hammer" is so strong that it can one shoot an enemy and then another two turns later even on harder missions. The smugglers abilite "Shoot First" that is suppose to trigger when the smuggler is attacked triggers when anyone in the party is attacked even if the smuggler him/her self is dead...).\n* Little to no ambient sounds.\n* Uneven character levels (Your party size has a limit of four characters but you can hire a total of eight (that I know of). So some will need to stay behind and will not get experience. The missions you can go on are all based on your highet level character. So low level characters will need to be carryed by higher level characters until thy get to be a sufficient level.\n\nThat being sayed I think this game has the potential to been a lot of fun ones most of my complants have been fixed and I look forward to playing the game then.","March 23, 2015","false","11.8"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

I enjoyed playing this game as much as any I have played on Steam in a while. The downside to the game is that many of the character abilities are not at all useful even in their fully upgraded state. Missions are randomized but all very similar - Arrive at station, explore station, pick up some loot, fight mobs, repeat. Also, the loot is adequate to keep the characters alive but I found that my income from station raids never really allowed me to afford me to have great gear for my level. The mobs level as your character levels so you need to continually upgrade your gear. There are factions in the game that you can get on the bad side with by looting their stuff while you are on a mission. If your reputation drops with a faction enough they will send very tough hit squads out to your missions quite often. It can get distracting but I rather enjoyed these tougher battles.","May 16","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
