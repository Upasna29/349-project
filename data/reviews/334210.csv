"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/334210/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Fortified is a tower defense game similar to Orcs Must Die, but with a 50s comic book aesthetic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvfzBZrwTxM\nThe first thing you'll notice is the stylized look of the game. It nails the general atmosphere, including graphics, writing and cheesy dialogue that normally comes with 50s comics.\n\nYou'll feel right at home if you've played the Orcs Must Die series. You place defensive structures in between waves, and run around with cool weapons, fending off aliens alongside your turrets and structures.\n\nThe combat is very satisfying. You have a selection of cool weapons to choose from. Ranging from a futuristic freeze ray to a classic tommy gun. Each weapon also has a secondary fire, that allows for further versatility when you're attacking enemies. Enemies ragdoll when you kill them, which makes shooting feel very gratifying.\n\nKilling enemies also charges up a Hero meter that allows you to become super powerful, and wreak havoc. They differ depending on what character you're playing as. Some might have infinite ammo and be very fast, while another might fly or freeze nearby enemies.\n\nWhen you kill enemies, you gain money to spend on structures. These can be built on the ground, or walls to help you keep the hoard back. Traps can either assist in ways like slowing down an enemy, or flat out blow them up. You may also  sell and re-position a trap if you want to make changes in between waves.\n\nAs you play through the game, you'll unlock ability points to spend on new structures and weapons for your characters. Each character has a few unique weapons and structures to call their own. My personal gripe with the game is that I want to play and have fun with each different character. Although the fact that they all level up separately, means I need to play earlier, more boring levels and slowly unlock stuff for that new character. It's not a huge problem, as some people might not mind it, and it adds replay value, but it bugs me a bit.\n\nThere are 2 game modes to currently choose from. Each can be played solo or up to 4 players. The campaign has 12 levels. Each have a large amount of waves, differing types of enemies and last quite a while, so the replay value is decent. The Invasion mode pits you in what seems to be an infinite number of waves (I say seemingly because I don't see anywhere the game explains it). Each wave also adds a few random modifiers to make things interesting. Like faster enemies, quick Hero recharge times, etc. Pretty good mode to play for fun after you've upgraded your characters.\n\nOverall, I really love the look of the game, and it's a lot of fun. It's definitely something that is more fun with friends, but you can play it solo or with the public just fine as well.\n(The graphics options menu has a lot of nice customisable options too)\n\nRecommended!","February 3","true","3.4"," 106 of 125 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","106","125","6","5"

The coolest aspect of Fortified is definitely the art style/direction, as I am sure that is the exact reason you are looking at this game. Thankfully the art style is not where this game stops being awesome, Fortified takes the Orcs Must Die’s gameplay and does it complete justice with a few awesome twists. Another great thing this game does surprisingly well is the skills and upgrades system. There is many different ways you can upgrade and “level” each of the characters to suit you play style, and it’s easy to respec if want to change it as well. With the addition of online co-op Fortified gets even more interesting. Trying to build synergies between the different characters is fun and rewarding.  At the $15 usd price point it will be hard to find a better game.\n-HiPFiRED\n\nPros\nAmazing aesthetics and style\nSolid gameplay\nMultiple ways to play each character\nEasy to change the way you play\nVaried weapons and enemies to kill them with.\nInsane price point for what you get\nOnline co-op\nCons\nCan get repetitive\nLack of varied modes\nNo further info on future content\n","February 25","true","18.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/334210/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","3rd person co-op tower defense. Yes, it's basically a sci-fi version of Orcs Must Die but (A) it's a great retro-futuristic setting, (B) it has 4 playable characters all with their own unique abilities, and (C) it has some interesting twists on weapons and defenses. I played for a couple hours with my kid and we would have kept going but it was getting too late in the evening. Even on Normal difficulty (there's no "Easy") it was quite a challenge. Once we got to the third stage, we found ourselves getting whupped pretty good until we figured out a few tactics.\n\nOne important tactic is to resell and move/mix your defenses around as needed. They don't depreciate so the game encourages this. If you have minions (way way cool) they act as a squad you can issue orders to. Once I discovered that, it made a pretty big difference. Other than that, smart placement of defenses, situational awareness, timing "Super" mode correctly (you get a super boost you can use once or twice per map), and good aim is pretty much all you need.\n\nThe game's slick, the graphics are nice, the setting is unique (groovalicious!), and the gunplay, tactics, and mechanics are a ton of fun. The progression system of earning points to spend on upgrades is well paced. You can respec if you want to try spending your points differently, and I think that's essential.\n\nMy only gripes: I wish they had more female characters (at least one other), and I wish the game had more levels. Heck, it would be cool if there were a few "adventure" style maps where you'd have to make your way from point A to point B fending off enemies (like in the Sniper games). There are a couple different modes for each map though, so that's cool.  If you have a friend who might be interested in playing this with you, I highly recommend it.","February 3","true","9.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/334210/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Key from Developer obtained for the purposes of review\n\nTarget Audience:  Friends looking for chaos.....that have already played through the other options like Orcs Must Die 2. Even then, it's for a desperate gaming experience\n\nFirst Impressions Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8V1dDTEFkk\n\nSummary:\nA game that needed QA. Badly. The core concept has been done before in games like Orcs Must Die, and it was done better there. While the game does have some core elements that could give some fun at first, it quickly starts to lose the shine of its great aesthetic, as repetition becomes the name of the game here. Sure, it's fun to blow things up with a TNT launcher for example, but limited weapons/items to put on the field, and a lack of variety in maps, it won't keep your attention. Multiplayer could have made up for it: as when the game gets into pure chaos: it can be rather fun with friends. But if you don't have friends: good luck. The matchmaking system has no options to it: you're at the mercy of the draw....regardless of whether or not you wanted to play on a higher difficulty or not. You'll have to host....but remember that the players that come may not even be of an equivalent level to you. And even when you get a good party: the game's balance is bad: it does not scale well to more players, and you'll get overrun, very quickly, even if you know what you're doing. Oh, and there's no mute option as well. It's a game that still has potential, but at this current iteration....it's not worth the asking price. It feels like it's come three months too early.\n\nLists:\nMy Positives:\nThe core concept at first is fun, and works to a basic extent.\nThe soldier mechanics, while it didn't teach you a damn thing about them, were nice in its basic options.\nThe aesthetic works, and gives a wartime vibe that works rather nicely. Over the top in some cases, but I like the way that's presented.\nRagdoll physics is always fun, and the game gets a comedy element going with launching enemies with the TNT launcher.\nMy Negatives:\nLack of multiplayer options for matchmaking at basic levels. Needed criteria for game selection. I don't like being put at a difficulty that I don't wanna play at.\nBalance is pretty damn bad at more players. Does not take into account traps and cost at all, making it more a third person shooter. Really REALLY weird scaling.\nGlitchy. Got an enemy stuck on a roof one point where it took a while to get him off. It was not only annoying: it could have been broken.\nThe enemy AI when knocked off course don't know what to do. They just sorta stand there. Doing nothing.\nSingle player loses life rather quickly. It lacks punch. It lacks oompf. It lacks a reason for me to want to play it. The story starts out so strong and colorful....then disappears.\nlevel design isn't as varied as it needs to be. There's different paths and\nHonestly: this game feels like it was rushed to market in several areas.\nMissing a mute option of players. Seems to default to non push to talk either. Had to literally disconnect the microphone.\nThe unique characters lose that uniqueness very quickly, as most weapons are intermixed between the characters, reused and really not making sense at times.\nIt. Needs. More. Voice. Lines. I got sick rather quickly of hearing the same thing over and over again.","February 4","false","7.4"," 42 of 67 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","42","67","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jet14/recommended/334210/","jet14","Kiatus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jet14/","81 products in account","NOTE: This copy was given to me by the developer for review purposes, this however does not change the review in anyway.\n\nOverviewFortified is a fun, defensive and strategic game which is based in the 1950s. The story is that Martians come to Earth, with people thinking they came in peace, until the Martians attack a year later. This causes the American Army to gather a team of heroes to fight them off.  You're mission is to choose one of the heroes to fight off the Martian scum, utilising that heroe's personal weapons, buildings and abilities. Beware though, level progress is saved to the hero that completed those levels and that it can't be transferred to other heroes.\n\nQualityGraphics - The graphics in Fortified are exquisite and of top quality for an indie game. The game combines both a 2D and 3D version of the characters and background by using a comic strip for the story and the 3D mode for the game.\n\nAudio - The Soundtrack and sounds add some intensity to the game by having songs with a creepy tone and feel to it. It will help the game get on your nerves when playing on that high on level in intensity difficulty.\n\nGameplay - The game itself is very smooth. I'm personally impressed with the fact they had a "shift to run" button, making it easier to get from side to side on bigger maps with more Martian spawn points and rockets to protect. I'm also happy with the type of heroes that are available and they are all unique in a way. They could probably do some more development on the story as it is not too clear and they could add some more info on who the heroes are.\n\nPros & ConsPros:\n•	Comical Art Style | The way they used the comic strip type of art for the storyline was very nice and really did resemble an old comic from the 1950s. This gives more of a feel that the developers really put time into this game and thought about all the details.\n•	Music | The music in the game adds to the nerve of the game as said before, this is a good thing. They have a few different tracks that tradition into each other making sure it isn't too repetitive.\n•	Gameplay and Price | For a price of $14.99 this game packs quite a punch! The game lasts around 4-6 hours, maybe even a few more with the multiplayer and achievements.\n•	Achievements and Cards | There are quite a few achievements to unlock, which is a great compared to most indie games, which usually come with 5 achievements or less. The game also comes with cards so that you can get some cash back for the game, or so you can make the awesome badge!\n\nCons:\n•	Friendly AI | There is currently no availability for you to add in extra AI heroes in either Singleplayer or Multiplayer. This means that the only way to complete levels is in single player on your own, with a friend or with a complete stranger on matchmaking, which cannot always be possible due timezones, ping and availability.\n\nSuggestions•	Make a Comic/ Animation | This would be a great add-on to expand the story a bit more, showing the mysteries of the heroes and how they came about. The game already has the Art Style, just needs the story. :)\n•	Invader Mode | It would be cool to have a mode where you send in the enemies at your command instead of the enemies coming in the same pattern every time. It would probably be good for multiplayer, I don't know, it's just an idea, hope you take these ideas into consideration! :D\n\nConclusionFinishing up, Fortified is a really good game both a TD game and 3rd Person shooter. The game exceed my exceptions of a good indie game, but it could have some more features that people usually expect in such a game, such as Friendly AI or First Person Mode, other than that this game should exceed and should stay active for a long time!\n9/10^^My rating (will change if they make a difference in future updates.)\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 12","true","7.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Well, our prayers have been answered! The American Army has assembled a small and unique task force to pulverise these rather nasty aliens! Welcome to the 1950’s!\n\nFortified is a 3rd person shooter/strategy/tower defence game inspired by the 1950’s comic books genre. You will be able to play 4 different characters (The Captain, The Rocket Scientist, The Agent and The Spaceman) either on a solo or co-op game and try to beat 12 progressively challenging levels.\n\nAt the start of each level, you will choose your loadout which is 2 weapons and some structures. Each characters have their specific structures or weapons. Structures will cost money to layout, so choose carefully (important when you get further into the game) and place them in the right spot so you can inflict maximum damage to those “NASTY INVADERS (1950’s commentary voice)”. In a nutshell, you will defend one or several rockets and destroy the upcoming waves of aliens. The waves can attack from the ground or from the air so make sure you have the right combination or your rocket will probably be destroyed. Upon successfully beating the level, your character will increase his level and you will be given points which you can use to unlock new weapons and structures; you can also choose to upgrade your current weapons or structures.\n\nI like the gameplay - it is fast and frantic especially in the latest level. Either you play solo or co-op. Killing Aliens will give you money and even during the gameplay you can purchase and place a new structures and you do not have to wait between the waves to do so.\n\nThe graphics are great and the game runs brilliantly and the audio is perfect.

The game itself is alright, but is very combat reliant. The combat is rather dull, altho I've only played the Patriot dude, so I maybe it varies between classes.\n\nYou get to pick 2 weapons for a mission, out of a maximum of 5 weapons (which can have 2 different upgrades, each one at the time). Same upgrades apply for traps, and there's 12 traps per class. All 4 classes have unique traps, but share some traps aswell.\nYou get a break between each wave, and you generally want to sell the majority of your traps, which are expensive generally, and reposition them.\n\nThe game has 12 levels, and 3 (or 4?) difficulties. The game can be hard as nails even on Normal (altho I'm not really a pro).\n\nShould you buy it?\nSure, it's 15 Euro!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/334210/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Ever since I was a child I have loved retro 1950’s sci-fi comic book style news announcements. You know the ones. During the introduction we’re advised of the imminent threat on the world. I find that they serve as a perfect hook to immerse you into their media form immediately. You’ve seen them on television, in movies and a number of video games have used them perfectly well. Fortified uses it perfectly to establish the tone and to introduce the characters and the setting. I found myself hooked and immersed into the game before gameplay had ever gotten underway. The campiness of the retro-futurism is something that I certainly appreciated.\n\nIt really is just the first sign that the game has been developed with intelligent game design choices throughout the entire creation process. Clapfoot have known exactly what they wanted to create, the elements that were required to be in their game and have clearly worked tirelessly to meld everything together into a fantastic tower defense game. For those who have played the Orcs Must Die games you will be immediately reminded of those games. There are also a lot of similarities between this and Dungeon Defenders as well. The games are essentially sharing the gimmicks that made both games such successes. That’s not a bad thing. There are differences, however, and those differences are enough to differentiate the two. Others have written of the similarities between this and Dungeon Defenders as well.\n\nWhat differentiates Fortified from those games are the differentiated characters as well as the upgrade and status effect systems. Each of the four playable characters come with power ups that essentially make them invulnerable or overpowered for short periods of time. These can be powered up over time and utilized in one lengthy burst or simultaneously.  These systems are arguably the highlights of the game. Players combine their own abilities and weapons with constructed defenses to combat waves of enemies. When you complete each level you are granted experience points – the better you do the more experience points you get – and ultimately when you reach certain levels you will be granted levels. When you level up you are awarded unlock points that enable you to purchase both upgrades and new and better weapons.\n\nIf there is one major area of weakness that limits Fortified from becoming one of the best that the tower defense genre has to offer is a lack of depth. Unfortunately this is because status effects reign supreme and have a strong tendency to overpower every other weapon in your disposal. You’ll soon pick up on what weapons were optimally well for your play style and knowingly avoid the weaker weapons. The weapons that generally are overpowered are those that freeze and cause damage over time. You are also limited in what weapons and constructs you can take into a fight with you and thus your temptation to experiment is diminished.\n\nWhat I did like about the constructs is that if you ever change your mind about the placement of one of them you can cash it in for a complete refund. That you’re not penalised for a poor choice for the remainder of a round is a nice bonus that will certainly please those who are inexperienced with games of this nature. Other games tend to favor a partial refund (generally half) so the change is nice. This system also enables you to place better systems in between rounds so on your second and consequential playthroughs you’ll learn to know what constructs are needed and where to place them. Each wave sends different numbers of enemies and in different placements than the previous wave. While it doesn’t solve the depth issue it does change the strategy.\n\nThere are 12 levels in the game and an estimated 6 hours is required to complete the game. With four different characters you can extend your gameplay but with the lack of depth you may not find enough variety to make it worth your while after the first playthrough. However, you can play with, up to, all four classes online. The game scales in difficulty dependent upon how many players are playing and thankfully the netcode has been well implemented.\n\nIf not for its lack of depth I would consider Fortified to be a great game. However, it falls short of that and is still a very good game recommended to those of you who are fans of tower defense games and especially to those who enjoyed Orcs Must Die!\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways check out http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and Curation please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 13","true","13.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So here's why it's down:\n\nSolo play is ok, although like most tower defence games it's really best as coop. Unfortunately this game is as dead as disco.\n\nThe classes are ok but not really that interesting, and the same can be said for the towers.\n\nThe enemies are a solid challenge. The maps aren't great but they're not terrible either.\n\nIt's a tad glitchy but nothing game-breaking. There's a few things that really need to be patched though.\n\nFinal word: unless you really enjoy solo tower defense you should probably give it a miss.

While it's a little too late to do anything about, the least I can do is do better.  So for now on, I'll give a more detailed review on these games.  So hopefully you'll enjoy them more than the others.  Now on to the review...\n\n\nFortified is a Tower Defense game mixed with 3rd-Person shooting, and it is developed and published by Clapfoot.  The game takes place in the 1950s during a Martian Invasion.  Humanity is in danger and it's up to four brave people, each with their own set of arsenals, to protect Earth and repel the Invasion.  The game also features a 4-player Co-Op mode, where players can work together to play the game's 12 maps plus the Invasion mode.\n\nI was actually interested in this game, mostly because I grew up playing a ton of tower defence games in Newgrounds, both good and bad.  I also liked how the game's presentation utilizes the setting to make it look and sound like it's a 1950s alien invasion comic.  Although for some reason, I'm getting that Team Fortress 2 vibe while playing this game.  I can't be the only person thinking that, right?\n\nI enjoyed Fortified for what it is, this is a game that makes for a pretty good time killer.  Something to pass the time when you are up for some Martian killing, tower defense-style.  The mechanics of the game has you setting up defenses and repeling the invasion.   Before that, you have to choose which of the four classes will you be playing as: The Captain, The Rocket Scientist, The Agent, and the Spaceman (whom I blame for the invasion).  Each has their own playstyle, structures, and weapons although some of them are shared with other classes.\n\nThe main objective is to protect the rocket from a set number of waves in each level.  Depending on which class you play, you need to determine which weapons and structures are best suited for the map you are in.  The exclamation mark circles indicate where the enemies will spawn from, with green arrows indicating the path they take.  This will help you set up defenses where it's needed most.  Most maps have more than one pathway, so be ready to move from point to point to stop the Martians from overwhelming you.\n\nCompleting each map will give you EXP, and earning enough will unlock more weapons and structures for the class you used.  In addition, you will earn skill points which can spend to unlock the weapons/structures and their modifiers.  Modifiers adds an ability to the weapon/structure.  Each weapon/structure has two abilities, but you can only choose only one to use in the map, so be sure to choose wisely.\n\nIn regards to issues,  Fortified isn't a game that's going to grab you're attention for too long.  There isn't much to do outside Invasion mode and Co-Op mode.  You probably beat the Solo mode within 6-7 hour, probably less if you know what you are doing.  Also, I did experience one game crash, but other than that, the game runs pretty well.\n\nI did enjoy Fortified for what it is, however it's not a game I can fully recomend to those that like the single player experience.  But if you friends that likes these types of games, maybe you'll fun with it.\n\nRating: B","February 4","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A throwback to a retro style without all that social paranoia souring it up with meaning. Fortified provides just that, with classic designs and clichéd dialogue that really nails the cheesy sci-fi vibe they were going for, and all it’s missing is a bit of stock footage between levels. However, once you run out of ’50s era fun, you’ll find little about the gameplay or online features to keep you coming back for more.\n\nWould you like to know more?

Been having tons of fun so far, and the higher difficulties and wave mode are challenging and give the game longevity after running through the campaign.","February 18","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We bought the game and played through the entire first difficulty in one sitting. It was some of the most fun i've had in a long time playing a game. And i normally don't like tower defense games or anything similar. Appealing graphics and setting make this game unique and stand out to anything out there for tower defense. 10/10. I'd buy it for you if i could.","February 5","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played as the Freezing Spaceman with a friend who played the Explosive Rocket Scientist and got flashbacks from the glory days of Orcs Must Die. Looking forward to play more.\n\nI kinda wish the campaign had a more progressive story cut-scene between each level. Just a quick one. Probably too much to ask from a small indie dev team like this. Nonetheless great job!\n\nHere's some gameplay from our 2 hour long session yesterday:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mvkuIBXNGo","February 4","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
