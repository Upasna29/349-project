It does scale to 1920x1080 (and possibly above) without having to do anything to the game which itself is a huge plus for an older game. Some of the menus/UI choices are clunky (but again, it's a very old game) but nothing terrible to use and the game does offer a fairly detailed tutorial through the campaign. If you like a good, old-fashioned, economy focused game - this is for you. While there are some forms of combat in-game (you can change settings to limit/expand this) it's mostly just focused on building a working, profitable space station.\n\nFor $6.99 - you can't go wrong here.","November 25, 2013","true","4.2"," 100 of 101 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","100","101","0","0"

Cure diseases, perform hostile takeovers of station segments, and rehabilitate hardened criminals - all for a profit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/recommended/243040/","GenC","General Chaøs™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/","630 products in account","Short Review\nDespite how the graphics will look they are just fine.You will end up spending most of your time at a view that the ol school graphics will not be a bother.A great deal of simulation mechanics involved that all work well with one another making for a fun and challenging game. The A.I. has a various range of difficulty and can become your best friend or worst enemy.Loads of content in the game you will not feel short handed.The game has both singe player and mp hosted via peer to peer.Skirmish mode gives you a  variation of options,from playing solo no A.I. opponents,to having A.I. opponents,to having win conditions.\n\nThere is a tutorial but you can skip it and just start the campaign because it progresses as a tutorial.Each mission you work for a different race and learn about how that race acts.The campaign is a lot of fun and I suggest playing it.There websites that provide custom campaign missions.If you like sim games,city building,strategy,trading,warring, check this game out.\n\n[Regular Review]\nThis game has quite a lot going for it.You have 10 different races in the game that serve as customers,clients, and employees. They come with their own likes and dislikes and even have abilities separate from one another.Each race works a specific job in the game so remember this will be crucial if you want to have a fully functioning station. There are also worker droids which serve as maintenance and security patrol and are always needed. Outside of the 10 races and two types of droids there will be events that pop up in which can effect the outcome of how well or not you are doing.Solar flares,meteor strikes,plagues,etc a good host of  events can occur. The events come in flavors that are helpful and harmful and add spice to the challenge of the game.\n\nThere are three floors for every section of the space station. Floor 1 is the lowest and acts as the industrial section.Here you build your port.These allow passengers to board your controlled area of the station.Other items such as factories,sickbay,cargo holds,labs,recycle center,prison,security control center,etc are built here. Floor 2is the commercial services section.Motels,Hotels,Inns,stores,bars,etc get built here and will be where the build of your money unless you decide to focus on trade.Floor 3 is the bio dome which acts as you would expect.You can grow vegetation here which once mature enough can be harvested and the products traded for energy or used to create items  or supply your commercial shops and services.\n\nThe Currency in the game is energy.You produce energy by building energy collectors(like a power plant),power boosters,medic bays,sleeping champers,stores,hotels,etc. When patrons go to shops,hotels and such they pay you in energy while at the same time the facilities use energy in order to run so be aware of any facility that is costing you more power to run than it is making. Luckily thanks to the detail in the game, you can power down the facilites if you desire or even deconstruct the whole thing and sell or store the building units used to build it.\n\nExpanding your control of different sections of the station can work in two ways,you buy the sections with energy or you hack the enemy control neighboring section.Combat occurs of someone (you or the A.I.) is under/starting attack.Once you have your security staff and just about anyone else that can help to defend/attack they will head immediately to the way point you set.If an enemy is in your ranks and attacks someone in range of a employee capable of attacking,that employee will attack.Outside of the security staff & drones you can build turrents which are quite useful but require energy to fire and function so be careful using them.\n\nMechanic wise is where I love the game the most.Everything has needs in order for you to gain access to them or use them properly.To get trade you need a com and a port otherwise no ship can dock in.In order to have some commercial services running you need the races that work in them.To get those races to come after time has passed you need to make sure their most wanted items are on your station or that the conditions they prefer exist. These are just examples but its how the whole game works.Everything gets used,has a need,serves a purpose.If you choose to specialize in  different economic areas they come with their own negative/positive aspect keeping everything balanced and challenging.\n\nThere is a campaign in the game that plays with you being hired by each race that is in the game to build the type of station they like to visit.In total there are 10 campaign missions 1 for each race.Their difficulty increases sometime throwing you tol the wolves.From my experience each mission was harder than the last.This serves to teach you how different portions of the game work as well as teach you about the race you are working for and what they like/dislike.Since you will need to know this about the races each mission gives you more of an edge as you carry over what you learned but still throws new things at you.\n\nI really could go on in even more detail about this game but I believe I covered enough to give you a good idea of how this game is. I am a big city builder fan and sim fan in general and this game by far has impressed me in more ways than I thought possible considering how packed with content,balance, and developer love/care it has. I never knew about this game back when it first came out, and I am glad I did not because in this current stagnation of good city builders, this space station builder came out of no where to help quench that thirst. Get the game if you never played it before, or did but looking for something to play. As old as it is this game keeps me wanting more. I wish for a sequel be it official or spiritual its just that much fun.\n\nThere is even more I could say,but this should suffice.","February 12, 2014","true","68.8"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/243040/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","I picked this up primarily out of nostalgia. It's a game I've long enjoyed, despite the fact that I never quite grasped all of its mechanics when it was entirely new. It's very much like a sci-fi Dungeon Keeper - you're tasked with managing a space station, building facilities to squeeze money out of visitors and meet your employees' needs, extracting resources from plants, and going to war with rival groups for complete control of the station.\n\nMost of these gameplay elements are fairly simple and intuitive, and it's quite relaxing to watch the various aliens go about their daily lives aboard your station. That said, its simplicity is also one of the game's downfalls - combat is about as simple as pointing out a target and watching all your combat-capable employees rush to attack it without much thought to tactics, and strategic considerations in this game consist of nothing more than ensuring you have more warm bodies on your side than your opponent.\n\nLikewise, the management aspects are rather simple - it's not altogether difficult to figure out what you need to build and keep everything in the green, though there are some missions that do provide a satisfactory challenge, albeit one that doesn't really hold up on subsequent playthroughs. One thing I noticed was that population and demand for facilities don't always increase proportionally with supply - just a tiny handful of higher level entertainment buildings and hotels can very easily meet your station's entire demand, so expanding past a certain point becomes worthless, as most residents and visitors will only congregate at a few points, giving your station the feeling of an empty ghost town as opposed to a bustling community.\n\nThough a second look did reveal some flaws I hadn't noticed the first time around, I would still heartily recommend this game to anyone who might be interested in the general concept, as the game still holds up amazingly well, especially for such a low price.","August 30, 2015","true","20.4"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","25","25","0","0"

What a gem. Created by a bunch of ex-Bullfrog employees this is an amazing little management game. You are tasked with looking after certain sections of a space station. You start the game with 3 Bulkheads. One Industrial, one entertainment and one recreational. You have to look after the visitors of your small part of the space station, making sure they are happy, hiring some of them, to work on your part of the station, while meeting increasing demands.\n\nThe game is made up in the good old 'tutorial style' where you have a fun mission and each mission it introduces new things. Like for example, in one mission it unlocks the priests and you get the mission to create a pilgrim station, giving you ample opportunity to learn how to use the priests properly, while being a fun and challenging mission on its own.\n\nEventually you'll end up fighting NPCs over control of the station. Fighting them with weapons and economics (depending on the level), or simply sneak attacking them with a security droid, sizing control of the section.\n\nBut its not all roses. The game was released in 2001 and it age shows, not only in the Artwork. The UI and its like are barebones, in the same style as it was common back in 2001... its lacking some tooltips and the interface is a little needlessly complicated. The background sounds aren't the best, but its a 14 year old game.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the original Themepark game, except Startopia has Aliens, Lasers and Spacemonsters.","June 17, 2015","true","21.6"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","26","27","2","1"

Since I had been pining over a space-station sim (since the other game like this one that was on Early Access recently flopped, releasing early without the full range of planned features) I decided to revisit this game. It was well worth the price of admission.\n\nYou can read up on the history of Startopia on Wikipedia (there's a full article there) which talks about its lighthearted humour and cartoonish aliens and how the game was developed by ex-Bullfrog employees (after Bullfrog was absorbed by Electronic Arts.)\n\nWhile the game was not fantastic for its era (and while no game improves with age), it did sell 110k copies at the time and it has stood the test of time remarkably better than one might have anticipated. The torus floorplan (rounded floors, tiered levels, unlockable sections around the radius of the space station) holds a certain charm. The Targ race of aliens is reminiscent of Grunts from Halo: Combat Evolved (which makes it an interesting bit of trivia that Startopia and Halo were released the same year.) The varied races with their unique professions, the wide variety of mission objectives keeps the game very engaging: mining rest station, medical station, trading station, and even prison station are examples of the first four map objectives.\n\nStartopia even supported multiplayer (although I do not expect to be able to actually test that).\n\nThe game lacks primarily in that it was designed for desktop machines of 13 years ago (as of the time this review was written). The graphics tear periodically as the graphics engine tries to render and hits a snag in translating from the old style graphics code to the newer hardware requirements. The alien avatars are fairly simplistic (although there is lots of emote activity going on and even some dynamic interaction AI that adds a sense of believable life to your aliens.) But the game doesn't take itself too seriously and plays up its cartoonish nature with narration that sounds like it came from Douglas Adams (of Hitcherhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame.)\n\nIn conclusion, while the game may not have been worth the full price tag (whatever it was in 2001) it is most definitely worth the lower price tag of today.","September 29, 2014","true","28.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","0"

(Can it be 'classic' if it was released in 2001? Well, in my mind it is.) You oversee a space station which aliens visit in the hopes of enjoying classy resorts, getting medical care or just grabbing a bite to eat and a nap before their next flight.\n\nBuilding is usually done by creating a room, then placing objects in the room (much like Theme Hospital). You build on the inside of a torus, and you can move the camera around with great freedom; it's fascinating to look through your torus and see rooms curving upward into the distance. In addition, there's a 'biodeck', where you can shape hills, valleys and lakes with great detail, as well as define different 'climate zones'; alien plants will grow there, which you can harvest for goods...Or you can transplant the plants around your station as decoration.\n\nAs for gameplay, there are about a dozen missions that introduce aspects of the game in sequence; they're fun, although they can be challenging! You can also rule over a station in your own time in the 'sandbox' mode. Most missions have to do with building a certain structure and making sure all the other basic facilities are in place; a hospital mission, a prison mission, etc.. There's also a mission where you have to trade goods with passing ships; buy low, sell high!\n\nOne last thing I absolutely must mention is the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. It has a very British sense of humor. Your 'assistant', VAL, sounds like a cross between the Dungeon Keeper narrator and HAL 9000. It's clear the designers were at least influenced by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I bought this game back in '01, and played the heck out of it. After losing the CD, I bought it on Steam. I would love to see an updated Startopia for modern PC's, but the game runs well regardless.

You would think Deep Space 9 fans or Babylon 5 loyalists would have pulled something together, but really all we have is StarTopia. Despite the novel premise I never really got into this one as a kid, it being more Dungeon Keeper than I had hoped. Revisiting it now I see where it deserves a lot more attention than it got, and also why it was so overlooked.\n\nStarTopia sets you up as the administrator of a classic donut-shaped space station. The first thing that may throw you off about your position is that you're not actually building the station, just filling the interior. Each station is sliced into a dozen sections with three decks each, a service deck, a leisure deck, and a bio deck. You construct buildings within these cavernous spaces that provide all sorts of services to your visitors and residents. These are anything from space motels and bathrooms to research labs and penitentiaries. Most structures can only be built on a specific deck, and in fact you can't build anything on the bio deck, just adjust the landscape for growing different plants.\n\nThe result is a game that plays much more like Dungeon Keeper in space than a proper space station builder. Each visitor to your station is simulated, and you can watch them walk around, spend money, and see what they like and dislike about your digs. They also have stats that apply to their job if you hire them, as many of the buildings you build must be staffed. Hiring can be pricey if you go for talented employees, and in fact the economical side of the game can be quite difficult to keep balanced. You need a healthy mix of basic services, entertainment, industrial production, and trading to keep flush with cash, which is actually energy that keeps your station humming as well. There's enough going on to find yourself overwhelmed just keeping up with the basic operation of your station, to say nothing of garbage piling up or spies planting bombs around the place.\n\nThere's a five-part tutorial that'll teach you the basics of the interface, and then a ten-mission campaign that drills down on the different aspects of stations. You might have to run a medical station, or a trade hub, or take over a derelict station from squatters. The first five are almost like an extended tutorial, but the latter half can be intensely challenging. A mission will generally take you about an hour but the more difficult ones might need several restarts, their striking difficulty almost requiring foreknowledge of the mission's quirks. If none of that sounds appealing there is an incredibly customizable sandbox mode where you can set victory conditions and individual difficulties to your whims.\n\nThe basic 3D graphics have held up surprisingly well over the years, from picturesque views up the curves of your station to the little details on each of the aliens. Sound design also remains up to the task, with plenty of understated sci-fi effects and an inviting soundtrack. The big thing that might throw people off is how incredibly British the presentation is, with a dry AI assistant and plenty of off-color humor in facilities like love nests and space discos. Honestly it feels like a sim set in the Hitchhiker's Guide universe, and if that sounds like a good time then you'll get plenty of mileage out of StarTopia. And even if it doesn't, there's a clever, if not perfect, management game to be had.","June 2","true","11.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Some of them have been complete wastenados of my money - one in particular I shelled out a lot for and only got a couple of hours of semi-enjoyment out of it. Startopia is the exact opposite of that game - I paid very little for it and, so far, I've gotten more hours of fun out of it than any other game I've purchased on here.\n\nYou're managing a space station which is being visited by nine different alien types, each with their own preferences and skills. You have to build facilities to ensure these aliens are healthy, well-rested, well-fed, entertained and other things like that, make sure any aliens who cause trouble get rehabilitated, keep the station clean, and make sure you have enough energy to keep it all running. You're aided by this artificially intelligent being called VAL who often peppers his advice with a degree of snark and you get occasional visits from a trader named Arona who I swear is a cross between a Vogon and Moneybags from Spyro 2.\n\nSpeaking of Vogons, if you pay attention to VAL's messages and the descriptions of each individual alien, you might notice qutie a few sci-fi references in this game, particularly Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ones.\n\nThe graphics aren't brilliant and a lot of the animations do look kinda like the aliens are miming their actions rather than actually performing them, but they're good enough for what this game needs. The music isn't particularly great either but it does help to provide a great atmosphere. You're given a few tutorial missions to help you get to grips with the mechanics and then there's ten proper missions for you to do, each one focusing on a particular aspect of gameplay, like healing sick aliens, putting criminals in the slammer and cultivating resources on the bio deck. And then there's sandbox mode, where you can set things up how you like. Personally, I like just using it to see what I can actually do.\n\nNot that this game is perfect though. The combat system feels kinda loose. Like, I know that by clicking on the enemy I'm telling some of my guys to attack, but how many? And placing and managing muster points is just awkward. There is also this bug where if a gem slug sits at a table in a cocktail bar or gets in one of them slug baths, it will never ever leave the table or bath and it will die. I don't think this is too bad because, by the time you're building those things, you should already have plenty of energy in reserve in case of bad things happening. Plus, you could always handwaive it as the slugs dying in their own excesses or something. Finally, after completing all ten missions, unless you're willing to use sandbox mode to make your own, the replay value of the game diminishes.\n\nReally, though, those are the only bad things I can think about with this game, and I'd say it's easily worth at least double the price it's being sold for. I'd be willing to pay triple.","August 2, 2014","true","54.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Just happens I lost my original disk registration key and had to rebuy. So I -do- know what I'm talking about on this.\n\nThis is kind of a mix of a "The Sims" title and a potluck of many other game genres. There's combat, there's construction, there's 'farming' of a sort, trading, healthcare, and well.. You run a space station 'ring', or waystation as the game calls them. All in all it's often head and shoulders above anything that recent science fiction, future space life sims have given us in the recent year or two. And I'm not just talking about blowing Moonbase Alpha outta the water, that could be done by a wet dish towel and a piece of cheese. (Don't try to imagine how that'd work, any method you think of would be inestimably better than Moonbase Alpha)\n\nAt seven dollars, currently this game is a bloody steal, and can provide hundreds of hours of engaging, even if a tiny bit repetitive once you figure out what you think are the 'best' arrangements of rooms and facilities on the various station decks. It has a curious sense of humor, kind of charming really, and never misses an opportunity to poke fun at various sci-fi references. If you want to know what I mean, look up "Startopia Intro" to find the original game introductory video, and that'll show you exactly what sort of strange humor you might be dipping into. Personally I love this game to bits, and I really think everybody in my friends list who has even a glancing interest in science fiction or simulation games should pick it up. Heck, everybody who ISN'T in my friends list should pick it up too, Mucky Foot was an excellent development studio, and should never have flatlined like it did. Just the times they were in, I guess?\n\nTL;DR - Buy this game now or I'll have a skrasher feast on your lower abdominal organs. Seriously, don't mess with the 20 foot tall murder-beetle.

There's the narrator and advisor AI VAL, who sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Fry which is awesome. There is the queue of items you can teleport around with sound effects that wouldn't look out of place in a star trek episode. and there's aron daal, a shady trader that might have been a reference to star wars i guess.\nBesides all that, the presentation is near flawless. If black and white blew my mind by how much you can have your world open and explorable in a god game while still having tight gameplay, StarTopia excells by giving you amazing possibilites with limited space and set pieces.\nIf I have to give criticsm, I'd say that there's maybe a bit too little things to actually do, which might date the game a bit compared to the average run time of a modern game. This is a nitpick though, the game is fun as balls and you should really get it and see for yourself.","November 29, 2013","true","21.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You get the freedom to set your space station up how you want; you pick your buildings and place/design them, hire your people, trade your goods, research technologies and design your own bio-deck. The game achieves a good balance, often times keeping you very busy and struggling to keep your station running. The game is not too hard, but there's definitely legitmate threat of losing everything you've worked to build. Sometimes you might feel like you're absolutely crushing a mission or opponent, other times you're getting breached and don't have enough employees to repel the breach, and you just know you're kissing a part of your station goodbye.\nI'd say just in missions alone you can get 30-40 hours of play time, depending on how fast you complete them. And the sandbox mode will add some time on top of that for you. This game has some replayability, too. You could come back to it in a few months or a year and be sucked in all over again.\nIf I had complaints, one would be the combat in the game. You can take sections of the station from other administrators, but the combat is pretty hands off for the most part. You initiate the breach and your people take care of the rest. I also found myself wanting a little more interaction with the employees I hired. When you first look at a potential candidate for hire there's a whole interface, but I was slightly let down when I realized all you can really do is hire, fire and promote. But that's just a very small "I wish I could do more!" thing. This is an older game, and the graphics are pretty much on par with games of it's age. Overall, I'd say great game.

Essential you terraform the landscape of the deck in terms of altitude, moisture and temperature in order to grow different alien flora to harvest as different resources either for trade or manufacturing.\n\nResource Farming (Biodeck), Combat, Staff Management, Building Management, Sanitation (Beam up that trash or you'll get space rats that mutate in huge monsters!), Trade, Spies, Religion just to name a couple of the myriad of things to keep track of as station administrator... it really does make this station feel alive.\n\nPros:\nSo much to do on 3 different decks of your space station\nGreat voice acting (Guy who was the voice of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary phase is the main actor in this)\nBiodeck was/still is a great feature.\nCute graphics and humor\n\nCons:\nNo first person mode like in Dungeon Keeper\nBeing over a decade old, expect no updates or fixes.","January 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Here's a couple of examples. Each alien has about five things that need to be satisfied like hunger, cleanliness, fun, etc. In most games you'd just click on the alien and you'd be able to see which category is the problem but in Startopia you have to click on each category and then wait for the delayed physical reaction of the alien. It can take a long time for one creature and there are a lot of creatures. It makes me nuts. Sometimes, yes, they do get a floating balloon which I think means they need fun. I'm never really sure. You also have to hover your mouse each category and wait for the tool tip to pop up. This is bad in a game where the doors to the next sector can open up and a swarm of enemies can disable your equipment and kill your guys in a hurry.\n\nThen there's another aggravating thing that is just needlessly odd. You have a management screen. I didn't know this until I played for about 30 hours but you can promote people from this management screen. They sort of paste a promotion star to your cursor if the alien feels like it needs a promotion if its not going to quit it's job. Elsewhere you click on something to promote the alien so this different way of doing things on the management screen threw me off as I was trying to click on things and promote aliens whether they felt like they deserved it or not. The second failure in both these things is that they aren't mentioned in the tutorial and they make the game play quite a bit better. They're sort of essential.\n\nIts too bad because Startopia is really neat game. Its fun, creative, unique and its deep. There are many hours of gameplay but there are things you have to put up with that other games like Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon and Railroad  Tycoon did better. Definitely a good buy.","February 5","true","111.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You can also place pools of water in order to make puddles, swamps, lakes and oceans. It's not just for looks though. Conditions on the biodeck effects what plants you grow, which ties into the game's economics, crafting and research systems.\n\nThe game does have a few annoying design flaws. You have to do some tedious micromanagement once and a while in order to avert disasters and the game doesn't really give you any tools to automate things. For example, employees need promotions once and a while or they'll quit, and the only way to know that the need them is to check the employee list and look for flashing stars, then click each one individually. You can get free energy due to a random event, but you need to notice the event notification and click it as soon as possible.\n\nThere's also combat, but like in other similar games such as dungeon keeper, it tends to heavily reward getting a huge bunch of guys together while heavily penalizing not having overwelming force. There's really no need to charge the players an energy penalty when one of their units dies in battle. They already paid energy to recruit the unit and it just means losing a battle loses you the game. Unlike dungeon keeper, battles tend to be fairly dry - rather than different units having different kinds of attacks, everyone just uses a sci fi blaster. It's really the weakest part of the game.\n\nStill, the fundamentals of the game are sound and the biodeck more than makes up for the annoyances the game makes you put up with.\n\n----\n\nTips:\n\nMake sure you place enough litter bins around your buildings. Dinomats need 4 in each cardinal direction, while shops need 3 directly in front.","January 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a sandbox space station administration game. The missions are well thought-out and each is challenging in its own way.  The solution to one mission can't be used to solve the next, so you're required to think up new tools, solutions and strategies each mission. The basic gameplay design is really clever, leading to a surprisingly fast-paced experience as you attempt to meet your goals. The usability can sometimes feel a bit slow, like when you wait for an alien to finish what they're doing so you can finally hire them, but overall tasks are pretty intuitive to accomplish.\n\nThere are unfortunately a lot of bugs, which become particularly obvious once you have a large sprawling space station (the AI for the scuzzer helper robots is particularly bad once you have a lot of them as they all end up trying to do the same thing at the same time instead of spreading out), but there are no critical bugs that ruin the basic game play or anything like that.","July 14, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though I say that, the game is not that seedy, so do not expect anything shocking coming from that aspect.\n\nYou balance the needs of your residents and cash income by creating different facilities across three separate sections of the space station you reside in. The first section is going to house living areas for your crew, medical facilities, jails, recycling plants, etc. The second section is the entertainment area where you put those said houses of ill repute, casinos, and anything available to bring in visitors and increase your income. How much you charge in itself is up to you and you can set the price for goods and services. The upper most section of the space station I guess is for creating a nature area; I never quite understood the point in the place other than having habitat zones for each type of alien.\n\nThough this game does offer a lot in terms of content, it really just feels like you build endlessly until completing your idea station. As a result, the game feels a bit above average it is not a bad game, in fact it is actually a good game. However, because of the repetitious nature of the game I lost interest quickly, so though I recommend this game, I do so in a sense that the game is a good single play through.\n","June 26, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While the gameplay is a slightly challenging resource management with a dash of The Sims, the atmosphere and universe the game takes place in is what has always sold me on it. A Douglas Adams/Red Dwarf sci-fi universe in which two-headed scientists need love from sultry sirens, four-armed farmers grow crops alongside alien monks. Your assistant is a sarcastic AI who is a bit more Marvin the Paranoid Android than GLaDOS.\n\nThe missions are challenging, combat isn't super intuitive, and it has glitched out on me a few times. Why do I keep going back? I want to see what happenes when you research the alien artifacts, or what kinds of plants give me what kinds of cargo.

This is an under-appreciated gem - very cute graphics and endearing characters, and the game flow is captivating.  There's always something to deal with.\n\nIt's a city-building game - but you're building a city on a space-station which is a spinning ring to generate artificial gravity.  There are 3 layers (levels) to build on and associated costs for unlocking more space to build in.  There's also space management (not very fun) for cargo holds.  There's also occasional sabotage, which can bring your whole economy down if you aren't careful and run out of funds after a bomb goes off.  The driving force behind the game is 1) the character personalities and 2) the economics.","January 11, 2015","true","14.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Coming back to it as an adult with a more mature mindset, it feels like an entirely different game in a way. As a kid, I had no idea why I kept having my people explode into giant aliens that went on rampages. I had no clue about proper research/build priorities or how to tailor each sector for my different races.\n\nNow that I'm an adult, I do! It took the game from being a funny city-builder type thing, to a more complex one with Tycoon/Management vibes and hostile take overs!

Turned out to be due to my monitor resolution, and the fix was super simple! Just add /r  and then whatever your resolution size is by right clicking your game, selecting properties, and then set launch options. In my case, it looked like /r1920x1080x32 and it solved my issues with the game failing to launch. The 32 at the end is the OS I think.

You're given three floors of a space station to work with. The first floor holds your main focus, where you will be building docking ports, accomodations, labratories, and a bunch of other stuff. The second floor is for entertainment, where you build extravagant restaurants and hotels, discos, and yes, brothels. The third floor is the Biodeck, where you alter terrain and can create different habitats for a species of alien to grow different plants in, which provides you with resources. On each floor, you can purchase multiple adjascent sections as the space station forms a circle. To run many buildings, you will need workers from a good bit of different alien races of which you hire. There's lots of building, trading, and fighting to be done.\n\nNow for my complaints. The in-game tutorials do very little in the way of actually teaching you how to play the game. You'll be taught what buildings basically do, but not exactly. You'll learn that residents have different stats, but aren't told how they impact their work. They will briefly touch on fighting mechanics early on, but I didn't encounter serious fighting until 9 hours in and I wasn't close to being prepared. If you press F1 while hovering your cursor over an item, you'll get more information on it. This doesn't work for cargo crates, but only the item after you already own and build it, and most of the information is superficial and not actually helpful. There are also lots of items you can waste precious Energy (this game's currency) on, that ultimately do nothing, such as Benches or Chronometers, despite the game telling you to purchase them. The controls and camera are hard to use to at first and feel very unintuitive. Some things require too much precision and things can end up getting clunky, such as when trying to pick up one item but the it grabs another near it instead. Also a minor issue, is how the Cargo Hold will instantly take any items you purchase but take a long time putting them up, so you won't be able to get them until you end up forgetting you bought them. The list goes on.\n\nI got very lucky with most of the missions, completing them an inch away from Game Over, which can be very stressful as each mission tends to take a very long time to beat. You can spend hours on a single mission, and that's not fun when most of it is comprised of a lot of waiting around and wondering if you're playing the game the right way. It's especially not as fun because if you haven't been playing properly, all of that time is a gigantic waste. You can save as many times as you want, and the game cycles through three autosave files as the mission carries on, which is pretty advanced for its time, but if you've been falling behind for the majority of the mission, you'll have to do it all over again anyway. I made it to Mission 7 before I stopped playing. The game wanted me to take over a space station. I spent an hour and a half doing my best to earn as much money as I could, something that was so basic yet still very difficult despite playing this far, only to have my door breached and my base destroyed by an enemy. I forgot the whole two lessons it taught me in the first tutorial on how to fight. I had the right amount of residents the game recommended to me, even moreso, and senty turrets all around, and since the game basically runs on auto pilot I should've been safe enough to reseal my blast doors (something I only knew about because I read it online, as the game doesn't explain this feature). I sealed the doors, with all my battling residents on the other side as I forgot the one, pathetic way you have of controlling them, and for some reason all of my Energy was depleted. Every one of my buildings was shut down and out of power, including my Energy Collector which is what brings me power. I had 0 Energy, no way to get any more, and no idea what was going on. After over an hour and a half, my game was left in an unwinnable state.\n\nIf you're a fan of RTS-like management games, you might want to get this game only when it's on sale. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't already know how to play it. It does have some charming ideas, like its Sci-fi references and your "helpful" advisor, VAL, and a sandbox mode of which I will not be playing, but it isn't enough to save the game from its disastrous design. It's very difficult to get into, and I gave it an honest try and spent 10 hours with it, and I got to the point of where I'm just sick of it now.","June 28, 2015","false","10.0"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","10","32","3","0"

Anyone who's ever played Bullfrog games will be familiar with the design influences the Dev's carried over from their previous titles blending elements of Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper while evolving it into its own retro-future setting.\n\nThe game has a sandbox mode, multiplayer via ipx or tcp/ip (with AI settings allowing pvp or compstomp co-op or ffa.) SP campaign mode which is more a series of individual missions.\n\nSingle player is well thought out with each mission requiring a different style of play and focus in order to complete and while not difficult they are engaging and challanging. Unlike many games of this ilk the different scenarios keep the player from grinding out the optimal stratagy without feeling either too handicapped or still on training wheels.\n\nThere is a mission editor and although the MuckyFoot may have fallen by the wayside there are still plenty of missions still to be downloaded without to much effort with a little searching on the internet.\n\nThe game setting is kept small in scope, space management being a resource unto itself and there are many novel and characterful ideas intermingled with the tried and tested;  blue print room, object placement, research, resources and peeps each with their own preferences and specific role, style of strategic managament.\n\nThe player needs to keep an eye on three different tiers or decks developing them all simultaneously which while initially daunting is actually fairly intuitive after a game or two.\n\nGraphics while dated hold up well enough, nice animations and fully 3d objects and sprites and full camera control with extra sounds and animations when zoomed in close or using the follow camera.\n\nI use AMD HD7850, win 7 64bit, 8gb ram, i7-3770k with corsair mouse and razor keyboard. On my rig the game runs smooth and i've yet to experience any game stopping bugs. Full admin rights but no compatability specific settings for the game itself. My friend uses nvidia 560ti, vista 32bit, 4gb ram, quad core intel, logitech mouse, again full admin rights and our multiplayer has been solid.\n\nThe black flicker refresh experienced can be solved by selecting the graphic card by model in options rather than using auto, this has to be done every game start-up but only takes a moment before several hours of gaming.\n\nThe issue with space-slugs dieing in their chambers isn't apparent (they enter and leave without any issues in all the games i've played)\n\nSummary - engaging, characterfull, fun!","December 6, 2013","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far this old classic has ticked all my boxes. If you are a sci-fi fan, like star trek, red dwarf and hitch hikers guide to the galaxy you will love this game.  As soon as you get into it you notice some subtle references such as wooshing doors, teleport noises and a comedian computer narrator.\n\nThe game itself is a sort of space station sim which can be played through story led missions or in a sandbox mode. The graphics although dated still look good and detailed if you crank up the res. There some neat little animations and you have full 360 views of the station and its rooms. The game itself works in a similar way to other management sims where you will need to keep visitors happy by ensuring there are enough facilities. The more visitors you get the more money the station makes. The game has a simple tutorial that eases you into things and the missions are structured in a way as to not make things to taxing at the beginning.

As soon as you get into it you notice some subtle references such as wooshing doors, teleport noises and a comedian computer narrator.\n\nThe game itself is a sort of space station sim which can be played through story led missions or in a sandbox mode. The graphics although dated still look good and detailed if you crank up the res. There some neat little animations and you have full 360 views of the station and its rooms. The game itself works in a similar way to other management sims where you will need to keep visitors happy by ensuring there are enough facilities. The more visitors you get the more money the station makes. The game has a simple tutorial that eases you into things and the missions are structured in a way as to not make things to taxing at the beginning.

Each of the little aliens running around your space stations also have humorous CVs in an Adamsian style, and the wider universe and plot fit into that slightly zany vein (albeit less satirical). The art style is complementary, as is the campaign story.\n\nAll in all, for those who like tycoon games and/or Hitchhikers' Guide, this is definitely worth retrieving from the archives of yesteryear. It's also worth exploring as game which straddles management sim and sandbox more successfully than some, but, for me, this game is well worth it on comedy alone, especially if you catch it in one of the regular sales.","January 1","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent a grand total of 20 minutes on it before realising how much I love it.\n\nFor starters the game introduces its main campaign with the voice of William Franklyn (the voice of the book from Hitchhikers tertiary phase) as your assistant.\n\nThe aliens are really damn cute and despite age the graphic style suits the game well.\n\nConsidering, again,  the age of the game, the controls are not awful like a numer of older pc titles.\n\nIt doesnt need to be purchased through nostalgia, I didnt have a clue of this games existance until 2016 and I have loved every second of it so far.\n\nTake a look folks, I cant say I regret anything with this one.","January 20","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
