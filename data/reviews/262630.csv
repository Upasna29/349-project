It was challenging, which I feel most games lack now a days. Or games have you pay to make it easier. There is a lot of humor, and old school game mechanics like checkpoint system, limited lives or you start from the beginning, off-the-path hidden treasure boxes.\n\nIt is only early access, so there will be changes moving forward and loads of new content. Especially GUNS! GUNS AND GUNS AND GUNS WITH UPGRADED GUNS! For being an early access, I ran into very few bugs and seems to be a pretty complete for the first few levels.\n\nI highly recommend this game for its funny story (especially if you work in corporate), and beat 'em ups (With new school technology). I hope the difficulty does not change, personally.\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I also like the early implementation of the weapon upgrade system that gives me a feeling that I can tackle the game in my prefered way.\n\nOnly thing that I miss is more open areas where I really can move around while facing enemeis that are harder to kill, but I'm sure something like that will come in future updates.","February 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It fills for me a gaming void I wasn't even fully aware existed.  I really can't recommend it highly enough, even in its still somewhat rough state, for a few reasons listed below:\n\n-It's extremely fun.  This may seem like an obvious reason to recommend a game, but I had to mention it all the same.\n\n-The developer is awesome.  You really wouldn't guess that it's from a one-man studio with the level of quality the various components show!  It's Early Access, but plays like a well-designed full release.  In my experience, there have been almost no bugs or glitches and the game runs beautifully with full quality settings enabled.  And on top of all that, the developer has been incredibly dedicated and active in continuing to improve everything... each time I've left a comment/question/suggestion/etc, the response time is incredible.  He really takes on board everything you have to say, good or bad, and responds so quickly your head'll spin!  If only more Early Access experiences were such...\n\n-It's really well-crafted.  The visuals are fantastic, the style fits the satirically humorous theme perfectly!  And if they're too smooth and 'modern' for you, you can turn on various levels of a filter that gives everything a pixel-art look.  Nice!  The music is just great and adds a great feel, and the sound effects are well-designed and programmed.  Really quality all the way.\n\n-It's really FUN!  Did I mention?\n\nIf you at all enjoy top-down shooters, ARPGs, fast-action titles, or just having fun in general, you owe it to yourself to try this out.  It'll be a joy to watch as it progresses towards a finished release.  There are only a relatively small number of levels thus far, but there's still plenty of play to be had in the build as it stands right now.  It can only get better!\n\nPS - I've been playing Tom vs TAOH quite a bit with Steam in Offline mode which doesn't seem to have accurately recorded how much time I've actually spent playing this game - it's really quite a bit more.  :)","February 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(I have been told they are still balancing the levels)\n- Very scarce health & ammo drops\n- No voices from NPCs just text (which may be good or bad depending on your opinion)\n- No tutorial (there really isn't any need for it, as it is very self explanitory)\n- RPG has terrible damage.\n- Some weapons dont armor pierce (confirmed fixing in progress)\n- Boss hit boxes are really off.\n- 1st boss attack pattern is way too fast to avoid.\n\nPC Performance\n\n- No game crashes\n- solid fps, no major drops. (if you would like to see my PC specs, check my profile)\n- Keys are rebindable & the ability to play with a controller is available.\n\n\nOverall summary, the game is solid, just needs damage and enemy balance tweaks, which I can confirm are in the works.  (Also the videos above were recorded as of Feb 6, so things might be easier now than when it was before)\n\n\nFeb 10 update -\n\n- apparently there is a drop rate from enemies, I thought I just wasn't getting any from runs.  Understandably the game is supposed to be challenging, but not getting any drops should be tweaked.","February 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"
