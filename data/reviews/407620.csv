While I clearly see the game is labelled as Early Access, other more successful Early Access titles typically show much higher production values even in their early state, with the only real issues being lack of content and a lot of bugs, but the amateurish quality of everything displayed with this game here doesn't show much promise unless the game receives an incredibly massive overhaul. This game has the build quality of a free browser-based game, not a commercial product. The game is full of stiff animation, menus/GUIs that appear to have been made by someone just learning Photoshop, and character/stage models that look to have been created by someone who just began using Blender. And while I understand this game is in no way trying to hide that it's supposed to be a Smash Bros. clone on PC, the least the devs could do would be to make it SOMEWHAT original in its presentation, something PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale did to differentiate itself from Smash Brothers.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, the way the devs are handling PR is awful. From what I've read, a character was cut from the game simply because the creator of that character talked smack about the game. That would be like if the creators of the Super Mario Bros. Movie digitally replaced Bob Hoskins with another actor in later releases of the film just because of the bad things he said about the movie years later; If someone thinks your game is not very good, especially someone who has contributed content to your product, perhaps you should see it from their point of view and maybe use their criticisms to better your game, but nope, instead their character was cut entirely just because the developers did not want people involved with their game saying bad stuff about it. And if that wasn't bad enough, people who have in some way contributed to the game appear to be acting like complete shills around the Steam community for this game, leaving positive reviews that aren't very well written or detailed, and flooding the comments on most of the negative reviews insulting them for not liking the game. And while I won't name any names, there's one particular user who has some involvement in this game that very frequently goes around the negative reviews and talks smack to them for their opinion. If indie devs like Phil Fish have taught us anything, it's that PR like this is not acceptable in the game industry, and will likely cause bad press for your game.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game, not just for the poor quality of the product itself, but also the obscenely disgusting PR from the people involved with it.","March 5","false","1.0"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","50","66","0","45"

This is going to not only cover the innards of the game and what I like and dislike about it, but I will also be providing my stance on the little controversy that seems to be brought up in some of the more negative postings. Grab a big bucket of popcorn, because we're going for a ride, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nSince the "drama" is likely what you want to hear about right now, I'll make that this first half of the review.\nI have a character in this game. Missileman. Felix, the game's creator, has asked for him to be in his game, and I was stoked about the whole idea of my character being in a Super Smash Bros.-style game. Point is - I talked to some of my Internet buddies about the game. CrazyRiverOtter, IndieAnjelo, and so on, and a one "Rockto Studios" was onboard with the IGB stuff as well.\n\nOne day, there was a disagreement between Rockto and Felix (and his friend Octopus58), and it drastically escalated from there for reasons I can't even pinpoint myself, with CrazyRiverOtter fighting hard in Rockto's defense.\nThat's where I end up cringing at the entire situation. There was simply no right or wrong being displayed on both sides as I stood firmly in the middle ground trying to recollect thoughts. Both the devs and my friends that got the boot had done wrong to each other, and two wrongs don't make a right.......Or any more than two.\n\nThat said, everyone from both sides has been tired of the "drama" already, so there hasn't been a point bashing it in again.  All I know is if I'm still here chatting with developers that participated in Indie Game Battle, then I must have behaved in a different fashion than Rockto and CrazyRiverOtter have. If anything, I feel somewhat responsible for the fault because I'm the one who told the latter Missileman was going to be in this game in the first place.\n\nEither way, it's okay to love Fez and hate Phil Fish, and whatever your stance is on Michael Jackson doesn't change how awesome his songs are.\nHowever, the entire situation seems like nothing more than a glorified schoolyard trouble. Everybody has that one or few people they've grown to despise in class or something. As it turns out from this, I have friends that can't get along with each other. I'll leave it at that, and everyone else reading this should as well.\n\nTrust me. I've been riding this Indie Game Battle train from as far back as before this game even came out.\n\nI'm no suckup, myself. In fact, I have been hard on Felix and Octo on numerous occassions, going as far as to argue with them on multiple things. Nevertheless, I still hold my respects for them as they constantly try working on this game, and they know that. I'm also a guy of my own personal opinion, and that's where we start talking about the actual GAME part of this review. With that giant mouthful out of the way, let's proceed to the game.\n\n--------------\n\nIndie Game Battle is a 2.5D Four (or Eight)-Player fighting game where opponents must knock each other off the dynamic stage. Basically, Super Smash Bros. with indie characters, and made by much less people.\n\nIf I have to be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that I was given this game by the developers, I most likely wouldn't have bought it on account of it being Early Access. I personally don't believe in Early Access, which is why I love giving games like Street Fighter V such a brutal time about it. I would've waited until the game was more complete or had features I was interested in. That said, should you take the plunge, there is fun to be had. Unpolished fun, but fun regardless.\n\nAs of this time, the only features there are focus on the core Versus mode than anything else. The game is currently devoid of single-player modes save for Training. Felix and the gang have made it clear that they totally want to try and incorperate an Adventure mode and Online play, and if the newly added Local and Online menu is of any indication, the latter's already being worked on, but for now we're left with AI opponents.\n\nThe closest there is to a sense of progression at this time is the ability to garner achievements.\nWhile there are a decent amount of achievements obtainable by trying out various characters and gathering up tons of KOs, I think it would actually be pretty neat if there were achievements for even more things, notably winning battles on particular stages or maybe some could be dedicated to Team matches.\n\nDespite the currently lacking amount of game modes, there's at least a promising selection of characters and stages. There are loads of blank spaces, but at this time, there are a total of Twenty-Three characters and Twenty-Four stages (soon to be twenty-five in the next update - v1.53). That's not too shabby by any means, and in fact, I am completely down with what there is here. I've seen some complaints about not enough popular characters being included and crap like that, but the way I see it, that completely kills the idea of an indie game. We as indie developers strive to gain an audience, so of course unfamiliar names are everywhere. I get that there aren't many familiar names here, but if you don't go out and experiment with other games that aren't as known, then who are you to suggest what an indie crossover should be like? You would only be disrespecting those that are struggling to reach that status.\n\nPrior to v1.50, I had hardly touched IGB because I couldn't be comfortable with the default keyboard controls. Fortunately, you can change them to your own liking, which I at first didn't expect to really help me, but wouldn't you know it - It did.\nDo you see all those hours I've played this game for? Yeah, that's because I legitimately went in willingly and played matches. Because I had FUN! Sure, my inner narcissist adored the fact that Missileman in there kicking butt, but he along with other characters really are fun to use, despite ones with the "WIP" label missing a couple moves.\n\nI was actually kinda expecting the fighting system to be rather sloppy along the likes of Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion, an inferior Smash clone with CN characters. Instead, the game actually does play out its mechanics finely enough. You can feel the hits connect, and the moves are varied and servicable. Again, the characters are fun to play with, and getting their moves to smack opponents the way you want them to is ultimately satisfying. I initially didn't like how the run button would deactivate upon turning around or jumping, but as I addressed that to Felix, he actually fixed that up, and running and jumping has been feeling great since v1.52!\n\nNow it's time to give this a mood whiplash by talking about glitches. The biggest one I encounter is when CPU opponents would strap themselves to the side of a wall instead of falling. That......that's a bit of a problem. There are also a couple visual glitches in the character select menu, notably Gip losing his hat upon scrolling through his character colors.\nSpeaking of the menu, that cursor NEEDS to lose its momentum. It makes using the arrow keys feel like I'm dragging an anvil.\n\nAs can be expected, not everything is up to snuff, as the Early Access label indicates by nature. There is still a need of a general polish, as framerate performances are considerably sporadic depending on the stage you choose (Fortunately, tinkering with the Game Speed when pausing helps alleviate the performance when in battle despite framerate), and graphics such as ones for the HUD could use some spicing up.\n\nEverything said and done, I like this game. Is it $10 worth of fun? I don't know, but it's better than CN: Punch Time Explosion ever was, and I paid $15 for that, so that should say something. If you feel like taking the plunge, go right ahead. You'll enjoy it like I have. If you would rather wait for future game modes, I totally understand.","March 10","true","14.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

But why would it necessarily be a bad thing?\nIt's not like they stole the very essence of Smash Bros.\nThere are ton of games like this one,\nsome people even consider "Smash Bros clones" as a genre of its own.\nThe game is very rough to be honest.

I can see that it's far from finished but I also see a lot of potential to this. I hope for more characters that I know of, because right now there's only two characters that I knew of before I played this game. And of course I hope for better graphics, character designs, music and such, but all that is getting taken care of one day at a time. It's gotten much better since I started playing it - which was before it was even released on Steam.\n\nSo yeah, do I recommend it at this stage? It depends. Are you interested in seeing the development of this game, as in booting up the game every once in a while and check out the updates and try out the new stuff? Then sure, it's actually quite fun keeping up with the development. I mean, it is early access so all that I just wrote is pretty much the point. But if you're not interested in that and want to have a finished product right away then you should just hold on for a bit and check back whenever it's more worked on and then give it a go.\n\nSo, for short, it's far from finished but has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to seeing this game become a finished product with lots of fun characters, stages and all other kinds of fun.\n\nCheers!","November 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","0"

But the Early Access tag means that I’m only judging based on what is there. And what is there can be made stronger.\n\nMany characters in the game tend to feel floaty and a lot of animation needs to be heavily refined to help give players that sense of weight that other platform fighters posses.\n\nThe character roster definitely needs to grow. But having over 20 fighters is already an impressive feat; with much more clearly on the way. There are some good choices like Goat from Goat Simulator and some very “interesting” choices like Salad Fingers. (Who was technically playable in Newgrounds Rumble) The game could use some bigger names like Hat Kid from a Hat in Time or Juan from Guacamelee!\n\nThe creators of this game are very open about this project. They actively update the game and you can contact them easily on their Twitter.\n\nIt’s not up to quality just yet with other platform fighters. But with the dedication this team clearly has for the project I feel it can just get there. And $10 isn't that much for what is alreay in the game.\n\n(Also go contact Super System Works about getting a Drift Stage… uhh stage in the game. That would be sweet!)\n","May 10","true","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

(there aren't any bad things about this game so it's all good.)\n\nShould you buy this game? If you're into early access games go for it but if you're not then don't. I suggest you buy this game because this game deserves more recongnition especially if you're willing to check out some of the characters game oirgins or whatnot.

The menus are unintuitive and completely butt ugly and the music is really off key and annoying. Full controller support in this game means using your gamepad like the slowest most inaccurate computer mouse you've ever seen. Tiny unreadable blurry fonts and icons that look more puked up than designed. Just trying to start a game is like opening a copy of war and peace. Then you realise that you've set up both players as CPUs ... I mean what kind of a game lets you actually do that? This game is so completely full of bugs that restarting crashes just about every time. OK, its probably great that someone has probably learned to use Unity while building this but I find it plain ridiculous that money is actually being charged for it (I actually traded to get it).
