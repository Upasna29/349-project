This game was released in August 2012, so by the time I encountered the bug I saw, it had already been released over half a year.  I was playing what was promoted as a released non-alpha, non-beta, polished, clean product.\n\nBy telling players "this is just alpha code" - all sorts of bugs are forgiven.  It just changes the whole tone, and it also scares players like me away.  I don't want to be anybody's alpha or beta tester and pay for it unless the game is extremely compelling.  That's just my personal approach as a consumer.\n\nSo I don't know if my review is a troll.  If anyone asked me "do you recommend this game" - my review is exactly what comes to mind when I see this game, especially when I visit the forums and get that dirty message in red at the top.  It was a power play by the dev "you didn't follow protocol.  Nananana."  Or at least that's what it felt like for me getting banned.\n\nToday I played 2 multiplayer games, and I didn't see the issue that had happened before.  It's quite possible that the issue has been addressed.\n\nAnd there's really no point in dwelling on "here's what so and so did wrong".  I'd rather find a solution, and for me that solution is, it's much safer to call a game alpha than go through this sort of mess.\n\n--------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ------------------------------------\n\nYou have been permanently banned from all Tower Wars discussions.\nYou were banned by a Tower Wars developer.\nReason: "Not following protocol to submit a bug report."\n\nThis is how this developer treats customers.  If the customer runs into a problem with the product, ban them from the forums.  Permanently.  Which leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  I can't recommend a game by a dev who treats people like this.\n\nAnd for the gory details: my mouse would lock up attached to an object in the middle of games.  I couldn't\ngo to the menus, NOTHING.  Multiplayer games would log me as having quit the game, when it was a bug.\nOf course NOBODY else saw this bug.  Well it turned out, eventually, that I figured out (no thanks to the\ndevs) that this only happened when my video settings were maxed out (monitor is 2560x1600).  So there\nwas a workaround - and they might have addressed this too.\n\nBut I'm still banned from their forums.\n\n\n[EDIT: It looks like they have indeed added a single player campaign, so I've removed the statement that signle player is missing.]\n\n\nAvoid this one.","July 4, 2014","false","25.5"," 640 of 790 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","640","790","0","52"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/214360/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Tower Wars is a tower defense game combined with army building. This indie title was released in August 2012, so has been around for a while coming in with about 400k owners on Steam.\n\nAs with other tower defense games, you start out with a blank battlefield, although this version of tower defense is slightly different to others, you are also fighting against an opponent, who is also building towers on their blank battlefield. The aim of the game is to get your army into the enemies base to destroy their castle before they destroy yours.  Tower Wars has two currency systems, Gold and Battle points - you are able to generate gold via the mines which are already located on your map; you can do the usual technique with tower defense games and upgrade them so that they generate more gold and are quicker at it. Battle points come through sending units to your opponent and working their way to the castle, this of course requires gold though.\n\nYou build units from your barracks with gold, there is a build queue which you can fill up however you please with different assorted units which you can train, and then push them all out in one go. Your barracks has a cool down so you can only push one wave out every 40 seconds or so. Some units are basic, some have their own special abilities, and some even increase the stats of the whole wave, regardless of whether they are near the units or not.\n\nThe tower building side of things is again, very similar to other tower defense games, you are able to position your towers pretty much anywhere you want on the map, allowing you to create all sorts of death traps, and corridors that your foe has to battle through, obviously the more ground the opponent has to cover, the more damage you can do to them with your turrets. There are plenty of the normal sort of turrets, such as cannons and arrow launchers, but there are also some really unique ones, such as a huge fan that pushes your opponents back in a certain direction, this makes for some great end of hallway traps!  All of the turrets are able to be upgraded in the usual fashion too, however I didn't really find the need to do that in the single player mode.\n\nTower Wars has a really nice looking graphic and art style; they are really polished and it looks like a lot of care and attention has gone into making this a beautiful steam-punk looking game.\n\nThe difficulty in Tower Wars takes a huge ramp up once you get past the tutorial. I will say though, the game's tutorial is really helpful and gets you to grips with the UI and all of the basic elements of the game. It does leave out a few bits that mean you have to go digging around and use a bit of trial and error to see what is what, but that's part of the fun of this type of game.  There are also an abundance of guides, and wiki posts out there if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of it.\n\nSince the game is almost four years old now, the multiplayer scene seems to have died down a bit, at the time of writing this there are only  ~30 people playing the game, but thankfully the game does have the option for co-op, so that may peek the attention of some people\n\nTechnically, this game has a lot of graphical options, allowing you to cater it for your rigs power and capability, coming with plenty of resolution options too.\n\nI have put about six hours into Tower Wars so far, and given that matches against the UI/Bots can sometimes last anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour, you can expect to get a lot of gameplay out of this even on the single player mode. If you manage to find yourself a group of friends to play this with, you are looking at a major time sink with ample amounts of fun and content.  I will definitely be carrying on playing Tower Wars after writing this review, since it also has that addicted sort of gameplay that I just cannot put down.\n\nThankfully, due to the price of Tower Wars being Â£5,59, I am going to strongly recommend this title, if it was any more I would have just said to pick it up when on sale due to the lack of multiplayer activity, but because it is already a low price as it stands, I can easily say you will get at least five or six hours of enjoyment out of it. Hardcore tower defense fans should not miss out on this game!\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Nothing special here, typical set of towers available.\n\nYou send your own armies to attack enemy in order to get battle points which allow you to unlock new units and upgrade old ones. There's more freedom here, and if you know what you're doing, this is a great place to showcase your tactical skills, especially at late stages of the game when some interesting units are available.\n\nThere's also a little resources gathering aspect to the game.\n\nBiggest trick is to efficiently balance your defence, offence, upgrades and resources. If you screw up anywhere, you're done.\n\nThere's one huge problem with this game, which is why this is a negative review. It has pretty much no tutorial available, no single-player campaign to gradually develop your skills, UI is un-intuitive, controls are messed up, etc. All you have are bots, weakest of which will probably defeat you up to five times untill you grasp basics of the game, and after that you only have try-and-fail approach to figure out why some more sophisticated things work and some don't.\n\nAnd then, playing multiplayer, game becomes over-competetive pretty fast, so unless it's inline whith your character, you will not be able to really casually enjoy the game ...\n\nIt's a pity, if devs would've spent a little more time to implement decent in-game tutorial and usable UI and controlls, game would be much more playable.","June 25, 2014","false","4.6"," 81 of 111 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","81","111","0","1"

If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. I'd say to skip this one and get Defense Grid: The Awakening instead if at full price, but it's on sale for 2 bucks frequently, and for that price, I'd say it's worth it.","November 2, 2013","false","8.2"," 55 of 75 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","55","75","0","0"

I really found that funny and great.\nLater, when I wanted to play it again, I wasn't able to remember the name or the website.\nAnd 2-3 years after, I saw Tower Wars. I bought it for me and some of my friends, and it became my favorite game. (I actually do like 2 or 3 hours every morning).\n\nTower Wars is a really beautifully designed Tower Defence with Steampunk like models, where you can place towers to defend your castle at the same time that sending units to try to destroy ennemy's castle. Towers are balanced, Units are quite too, maps details are awesome, musics are just PERFECT. Usually a Game can be between 25 and 60 minutes, 25-60 minutes of fun. And the fact that mines are placed randomly doesn't make you able to have a "perfect strategy", that's why you always have a chance to beat other players.\n\nI watched some other reviews, most of them are negatives. I will not injure them, but only one thing : Don't trust them. The game is really cheap, so you can simply test yourself. I don't see any problems with the SinglePlayer Bots, I just beat all of them exept the 2 last ones that are 'cheating', with only 2 loses (#4 one and #7 one). Also this game is really fun on Multiplayer, even more at 2v2 and 3v3 Matches, most of the other players I fighted were kind and sympatic.\nAnd seriously, THE ONLY THING for me Tower Wars didn't do well is Achievements (Some of them beeing near-impossible to do (and 1 Impossible) and lots of them where you have to do on Ranked Matches), otherwise EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT. Some updates are added between seasons, to balance even more the game. Developpers are kind, Game is perfect.\nNow my only question is how can a such awesome game have that much negative reviews.","July 29, 2014","true","132.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/214360/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Tower Wars is an interesting idea bogged down by its excessive attempts to condense and entire tower defense experience into a single match.\n\nThe basic concept of Tower Wars is a competitive TD game where you control both the towers and the enemies, and have to balance throwing tons of grunts at the enemy castle while building up your own defenses to keep theirs away. Adding onto this is a huge upgrade tree, from unlocking new grunt types, to passive upgrades for all units, to upgrading your towers and already unlocked grunts. Essentially everything can be upgraded several times over, and with a limited amount of resources you need to pay careful attention to what you invest in or else be overrun by the other player.\n\nIf this sounds like a lot to take in, that's because it is. Tower Wars is absurdly involved, as it takes the features that would normally be slowly added over the course of a typical TD game and instead gives you them all for the one self contained match you are already in. As a result it's incredibly overwhelming, and causes matches to stretch on for far longer than they have any right to. The tutorial match alone took nearly an hour, and my first match against the easiest AI opponent in the game about 30 minutes more (which ultimately ended in my defeat). If you're going up against a real human opponent of equal skill, expect this time per match to only rise further, which creates a huge commitment on the player that could ultimately prove for naught.\n\nUltimately Tower Wars asks too much of the player without giving them a reason to stick with it through the long periods of tedium that inevitably occur after the first 10-15 minutes when you've placed most of your towers and begin the long game of tug of war, as you incrementally chip away at each other's castles until someone gets a lucky break and finally pushes through. The concept is a really neat one, but the way it's executed here is dull and overly complex to the point I was begging for defeat simply so the match would be over. I love TD games, probably more than I should, but nothing about Tower Wars ever manifested itself into anything fun or engrossing and just left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and had nothing to show for it.","September 3, 2014","false","2.1"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","33","49","0","6"

To that end it's mainly a multiplayer game, though the last major update added ten levels of bots to lose to without anyone knowing your shame. It's a good thing too, because the odds of you getting a match against a person aren't very good these days.\n\nEach match gives you command over a castle, a barracks, and large tracts of hex-gridded land, all mirrored by your opponent. Your task is to send waves of attackers to destroy your foe's castle while maintaining a field of towers to defend your own castle. The resource that fuels both of these labors is gold, mined from upgradable plots in your territory, so right away you have a balance that must be struck between offense and defense. In addition, your attackers earn Battle Points for the time they spend (alive) in enemy territory. These points are used to unlock new units, upgrade your units, and upgrade your mines.\n\nIf all this is starting to sound complicated, well, it is. You need to be sending troops to attack, upgrading those troops, upgrading your mines, and managing your own towers, all based out of two resource pools. And yes, just the tower defense part is full-fledged tower defense, with the ability to place upwards of a hundred towers on a single map, of eight different types and three upgrade levels. Layering further complexity over that, while an interesting idea, makes the game a huge struggle to keep up with. It's basically Build Orders: The Game, so if that was your favorite part of Starcraft, there might be something here for you to latch onto.\n\nEven so, it's hard to give a positive review to a multiplayer-focused game with no player base. None of my half-dozen attempts to find a match, ranked or unranked over several days, met with success. Poking around the forums it seems there are only a few dozen active players left, and there may be something wrong with matchmaking that the developers have not addressed. It's just as well, because the complexity pushes it up into DOTA territory, long matches and all. A single round can last thirty minutes to an hour, and a loss after all that time really hurts because it earns you nothing. There are no unlocks or points or anything to chase, just match after match.

On one side of the defense you have a VARIETY of awesome towers that you can build and upgrade each with their own specific purpose (arrows, cannons, launchers, giant hammers, giant fans to slow enemies etc...). The castle is also upgradable by means of shield or ammunition effectiveness (that's as far as castle upgrades go). There are also unlock-able units as you play depending on what you want to unlock and they can also be upgraded. To go beyond upgrading simple units, the game has a upgrade system where you can add shields, armor, or even health to the units. The upgrade system (building) allows for other upgrades such as reduced wait time to send a wave of attacking units to your enemy, bigger barracks, spawn random units when deploying an assault, or upgrade battle points so you receive more. This game is also multiplayer which makes it all that much better!\n\nI would highly recommend this game. The visuals were done right, the sounds were done right, the units were done right, the delivery on the game play was done right. Variations and modifications are always welcomed and a simple layout style (with some random obstacles) always make for an interesting game.\n\nWarning though, one game can take 45 min to an 1 h. So don't expect to jump in and jump out. If you want a game that's not 45 minutes long I HIGHLY suggest CastleStorm which is sort of similar to this but a 2D (3D graphics) platformer.\n\n\nRATING : 8/10.\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B\n\nSmall update as of May 13th, 2015... a few of my friends have reported lag when there are a lot of units on the screen when playing multiplayer.

You need a few hours to master all the mechanics, but then it's great entertainment.\n\nYou and your opponent both have castles and barracks, and you need to send waves to destroy each other, while simultaneously upgrading your units and castles as well as tending to your gold mines. Gold is mainly needed for recruiting units, and as long as they are within enemy territory, they earn "battle points" for you, which you need for upgrades. This makes for some challenging gameplay, as you need gold to earn battle points, but also battle points to get upgrades to earn more gold, ...\n\nThere are many different units, each with unique attributes - speed, health, damage dealt (against opponent's castle), armor, shield. Some have special abilities, e.g. they increase other units' speed or improve their shields.\n\nSimilarly, there are lots of different towers with unique strengths and weaknesses, e.g. arrow towers, cannons, lava distributors, fans (to slow down the enemy's units) etc.\n\nThere are a few maps shipped with the game and you can download additional maps from the community. The gold mines are always placed randomly, which means that for every match, you need to come up with a new path around which to build your defense towers (although you will always be using the same basic structures).\n\nI recommend that you buy this on sale and get additional keys for your friends, because as mentioned above, it's hard to even find opponents for multiplayer, and the matching can take ages. But I have spent way too many hours playing against buddies now and we're all hooked!\n\n\nPROS:\n[+] Challenging game mechanics\n[+] Awesome multiplayer mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3)\n[+] Many maps to choose from and random adjustments in each round\n[+] Very cool steampunk setting\n\n\nCONS:\n[-] Steep learning curve (although this becomes rewarding if you don't give up early)\n[-] Very few people "out there" for multiplayer matches (but it's more fun with friends anyway)\n[-] Boring co-op mode","August 5, 2015","true","166.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I found Tower Wars on sale and immediately grabbed as I'm a fan of worlds created with hexagonal terrains put together.\n\nThe game resembles Tropical Tower Wars, a custom WarCraft III map that I used to play. Instead of having a fixed pathways and a place for your towers, you create the maze yourself. The world is made out of hexagon tiles separated into different islands. Three gold mines for each team are randomly placed in the map to create diversity for your mazing strategies.\n\nControls[+] Not much to say on this as the game uses the most conventional controls for any Tower Defense game. In the time that I played I haven't felt any type of discomfort even once.\n\nGraphics[+] As I said before, I am a fan of game terrain made out of hexagon tiles.\n[+] The maps for different modes was well made allowing different kinds of strategies to be put to use.\n\nBalance[+] The bots are good for people who are learning the game. They start from easy and eventually gets more challenging as you defeat more of them one by one.\n[+] The game gives you freedom on how you want to handle your mazes.\n[+] It also has a route detector to make the game eye-friendly despite building a big amount of towers and stops you from messing up in case you get confused in your own maze.\n[-] Although it gets challenging as you pick higher level of bots. The only difference you see is the rate of how fast they upgrade their towers, and mines. They keep recycling the same strategy over and over.\n\nOthers[+] Variety of maps to choose from.\n[+] You can either play defensive, offensive, or balance depending on how you wish to control the game.\n[-] Few people are playing and on that "few people" even fewer people plays Human vs. Human.

The graphics are basic, but HIGHLY polished and good looking. This game will most certainly age well for the style they've chosen. It's a tower defence with RTS elements so you are both attacker and defender, the game has a steam punk theme, good music well directed art, and has very few bugs which is impressive generally, but particularly for a smaller development scheme.\n\nThe single player is challenging even at the lower levels, so if you want to fight bots they have everything from "I'm barely paying attention" to "How is it even possible to generate units that quickly?!?" and unlike bots in most games, these will actually ready you for playing against other players.. Which is good because you can rock 3 vs 3's in this title and oh my god will you.\n\nBalanced enough that you can't even gripe when you lost because you messed up or the other player managed their resources better than you did.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Gold is used for building/upgrading towers and also for sending units.\nBattle points are earned by the units you send out. Battle points are spent for unit upgrades, unlocking new units, buying miners\n\nThere aren't as many types of towers or creep units types as I'd wish but it ok:\n- around 8 types of towers ( each can be upgraded 3 times - but it's a liniar upgrade, no branches or other abilities/customization of towers)\n- around 10 units(again each with some upgrades)\n- castle upgrades for armor or damage\n- a pretty complex tree structure for speed/armor/shield/health and other stuff as general upgrades for all units\n\nAt first it was a little strange the way you choose/upgrade towers(hold and drag mouse) but I got used with it and then I found out you can also use key shortcuts(shift+click,ctrl+click)\n","July 16, 2014","true","24.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And this was around ten years ago, around 2004-2005. Long time ago...\n\nTower Wars is a strategy game. It combines classical TD (tower defense) elements with a war elements, where YOU are the one who sends the troops, not the AI. It's like taking old WMW concept and creating a game based on that. And, I must agree that it ended pretty well.\n\nIt's not an easy game, tower wars requires from you a tactical thinking and the willing to practice... much. By playing this title, you'll need to balance between the offense and the defense, You'll need to decide whether to upgrade existing towers, or create new ones, between upgrading existing troops and training new ones.\n\nWhat I can say about this title... It's good. Graphics are nice, it's well balanced game, I didn't find any bigger issues, and I can really recommend this game. If you've ever played a tower defense game, and you liked the concept, you'll like this one even more. If you did not, I'd still give it a try, because game is awesome and building a strong defense is as important as attacking the enemy with strong troops.\n\n9.5/10","November 23, 2014","true","15.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

And while it follows the "Mazing" style of TDs (you have no predetermined path enemies take. you have a patch of land and the enemies will take the shortest route towards your Fortress) it also forces you to focus on how you will attack.\nYou gain resources by killing enemies and having your people waddle as far as they can.\n\nNow the Towers and Enemies are where the fun starts. You are not presented with the standart "Normal tower/ Faster but weaker tower/Splash Tower/Slow Tower" variety, but rather towers that focus on different kinds of Health as well as some supporting towers, like a wind turbine that slows enemies in its path or a huge pot that throws boiling oil to all its sides.\nAs far as the offensive units go, you go from the why do I worry-kind of standart waddler, faster waddlers, healing waddlers, shielding waddlers, carrying waddlers, as well as Upgrades for them. in the end I believe you stand with as many supporting units as you have actual damaging units.\n\nRounds may be short (if any of the players really messes up his BO) or can draw out to a 2 hour "We all send a full wave of our biggest units, all fully upgraded through each others maze and look what happens"-Stalemate. but even those are fun, because its like a snail race. In the end you only win or lose by a hairs width.\n\nAlso, Bots in 10 difficulty flavors have been implemented.

Focus too much on your towers, and your enemy will overwhelm you with a superior economy; but focus too much on creating an army and your defenses will fall to even the puniest wave.\n\nThe ecnomy of the game requires two currencies:  Gold (used to purchase troops, unlock new troops, and build and upgrade towers) which is mined through randomly placed mines that must be upgraded, and Battle Points (used to upgrade toops and mines) which is gained through sending troops into battle.  The interdependency of these two currencies further requires maintaining a delicate balance between offense and defense.\n\nBattles can be decisive and quick if the skills are mismatched; but if you find a good opponent, then you'll find yourself in for a campaign of attrition which could take upwards of two hours.  It's a high stakes tower defense game that offers a high amount of replayability; but the lack of map content (three total) leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to diversity of content.","June 28, 2013","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/214360/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","Tower wars is a steampunk, competitive, Tower Defense game that challenges the preconceptions of the genre by putting you in control of not only your towers, but the lemmings that throw themselves at the defenses of your opponent.\n\nIt requires maintaining a delicate balance between building your towers and upgrading (and purchasing) your troops.  Focus too much on your towers, and your enemy will overwhelm you with a superior economy; but focus too much on creating an army and your defenses will fall to even the puniest wave.\n\nThe ecnomy of the game requires two currencies:  Gold (used to purchase troops, unlock new troops, and build and upgrade towers) which is mined through randomly placed mines that must be upgraded, and Battle Points (used to upgrade toops and mines) which is gained through sending troops into battle.  The interdependency of these two currencies further requires maintaining a delicate balance between offense and defense.\n\nBattles can be decisive and quick if the skills are mismatched; but if you find a good opponent, then you'll find yourself in for a campaign of attrition which could take upwards of two hours.  It's a high stakes tower defense game that offers a high amount of replayability; but the lack of map content (three total) leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to diversity of content.","June 28, 2013","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Someone made an actual Tower Wars game! The mods were so much fun, so it's awesome that SuperVillain made an actual game to pretty much officially kick off the genre (I think?)! Basically, not only do you set up your towers and maze to defend, but you send out your own armies to attack the other castle! Lots of units to unlock and upgrade by using an RTS system (tech tree). And the humor is a nice touch too. Who doesn't love a robot named Stanley Clunkerbottom? The meat of the experience is the multi-player for sure! It supports local hosted and ranked matches, so you can play with friends until you're ready to head out into a ranked match. 2v2 is probably my favorite, and the game goes all the way up to 3v3 (and 1v1 of course). And there IS a single player "Classic" mode, which is like other normal Tower Defense games where you just defend as long as you can. But this thing REALLY shines in multi-player modes that it's built for!\n\nAnd, for what it's worth, the game is gorgeous if you have a gaming PC with some muscle. But it also lets you customize all settings for weaker machines too, and even looks pretty good at lower settings. Looks like a miniatures set up! I want to play this in real life!\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Tower Defense, RTSs, Table-Top Games, or multi-player with friends! Oh, and for $10? No brainer!","January 4, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You build towers to channel and kill enemies, while balancing resource production, units to pressure your enemy, your defenses, and upgrading your units to do more damage. It's a pretty interesting priority based system where every game plays out very differently based on how you and your opponent react. The way it makes me think is more like a RTS than a tower defense game. Pretty good.","November 6, 2013","true","87.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The biggest problem with the game is the lack of levels. I bought this for the solo play, only to find that there isnât really a solo play. There are only three small solo maps . Having said that, there aren't that many more on coop, which all in all leaves a lot to be desired.

At round two the bots will start to send upgraded and new units at you continually. In that same amount of time I am able to put up 3-4 towers and send out a wave of 5-6 units. Difficulty seems very broken and punishing to me.\n\nThat being said. I really like this game. Love the concept, the graphics, voice acting, music(amazing music actually). The brutal bot difficulty(why not have an adjustable difficulty for single player?) is keeping me from being completely in love with it.\n\nI do absolutely recommend this game though. It is very well done and multiplayer matches are an absolute blast(especially with a group of friends on skype or local lan.) My only complaint is the one that I mentioned involving the single player experience.\n\n*FWIW. In the menu when you click tutorial, it will bring up the single player menu again. You have to click Tutorial again to actually play it. A very minor issue but an odd one considering the "Tutorial" button is on the main screen but it does not actually take you to the tutuorial.\n\n*Update* I must say that I am impressed with how much the maker of this game has been in the  forum responding to comments and giving feedback to the players. It is refreshing to see someone who cares about their audience and the experience the audience is having with their product. He has addressed all my concerns in my original review and new content updates to implement further training levels are forthcoming.*End of update*","December 22, 2013","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And yes, you can improve the towers too. It's a regular tower defense game.\n\nThere is resource management in that you have to control the mines to ensure you have proper flow of resources to fuel your tower building as well as unit making and unit improvement research. You mainly do this by making sure the mines are controlled by towers, and improved to ensure they have good throughput.\n\nThen you need to research units, each of which have a different use against certain types of enemy towers. Some are fast but low armor, some are juggernauts that move slowly, some heal, some shield, etc. And add them, in the right order, to yoru build queue, and hopefully, push the enemy back enough to take out his HQ.\n\nThere are many different maps and different AI to keep you busy.

The few tower types make the game slightly disappointing, but the upgrades make it worth it. The main problem I have with it is the co-op gameplay.\n\nThe co-op gameplay consists of only one map. This would be barely ok if it weren't for the fact that the difficulty on this map is just damn near impossible. Eventually the boss just kills your entire maze bringing it down to 1/4 of your once used build space. And the zone that gets overtaken is now a spawning point. To top things off, this boss is nuking and instagibing sections of your maze. This would all be fine, if it didn't become so frustratingly impossible at the end of the 3rd wave. Honestly I think it needs to be redone to a possible difficulty, and keep the current one and call it "Impossible Mode."\n\nTL;DR this is a good game to play solo. Not suitable for co-op unless you and your buddy wanna pay $10 for one map that's nigh impossible to beat. 6/10 would play again... but barely.","September 16, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You also have to manage your income in the form of mines (you can upgrade them task more miners)\n\nThe upgrading is very basic, max level 3 for towers; however, there is a good amount of diversity for the macro-upgrading trees. For this, you have to spend both money AND battle points. You get battle points by sending troops out (most likely to die), so playing defensively might not be the best option if your oppnent is beating you in gold and battlepoint revenue.\n\nYou can use your towers to make mazes for the creep to pass through, and the feedback showing exactly where the creeps will travel is really helpful. Admittedly, I've taken lessons from the AI's layout.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty good despite the extra mechanics, I think the only thing people need to be aware of is how critical getting battlepoints is - balancing your income is key. There is no point of having 10000+ gold if you're waiting on your battlepoints to upgrade your stuff.\n\nAesthetically, the game is very nice and charming. I'm used to towers getting the most insignificant aesthetic changes in old school TD games, but all of the towers here come with their own newer, badder look. The feedback for enemy health, movement, etc is very seamless - so you can still keep track of how much damage you're doing despite 100 catapults shrouding an enemy (pretty good tactic in all TDs actually - artillery for the win!)\n\nFor the price, I would definitely recommend getting it, especially if you're a fan of tower defense games!","July 6, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Tower Wars is a challenging tower-defence game, but with a twist where in one game mode you can send out armies to attack the enemy to gain battle tokens. Even if they don't reach they castle, you get tokens based on how far they go.\n\nI find it enjoyable, even when losing which is easy if you don't get a good balance of putting up towers, shaping the path, putting up the right de-buffing towers and so on. It's cartoonish effects make the game a lot of fun t play and there are 10 levels of difficulty to play, though from what I can tell no actual story in the game itself.\n\nHowever a big complaint I have is that it seems to be prone to crashing. I'm uncertain if this is a common factor on other people's systems, but it does seem to be prone to crashing, though when it does crash it just closes rarther than going black screen or forcing steam to crash which tells me it's possibly being worked on in patches. Still, it is quite a enjoyable game and I recommend you give it a go if you are a fan of tower-defence games.","January 8, 2014","true","4.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Idled for cards, made some money. My son actually played it, then challenged me to a match. I've got to say its a pretty fun game.\n\nThe jist of it is that you play tower defense against your opponent while also sending waves of units against them. There is gold from mining and battlepoints from sending units (more BP the longer they last on the map). You need both. Towers and units are bought with gold, upgrades are bought with BP, and units are unlocked with both.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that you need to balance sending out lots of units to get upgrades, and you need to keep your maze strong to stop enemy units from getting BP for upgrades.\n\nThe main downside to this game is that there are some fairly predictable setups that will win matches against players that expect a regular TD game. If you find an opponent that uses a similar setup, the game can progress, but otherwise its usually quite one sided.\n\nOverall, I think its a fun game, with some features that make it different from the rest of the TD out there.","August 2, 2014","true","43.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It was a shame then that when we played a multiplayer co-op game almost everytime we are deep into the waves the servers either cut out and kick us or the games just freeze. we have tried for hours on end and cannot get past the first co-op stage either due to bad luck RNG with the cyclops hat man shooting off a vital part which is different each game or the servers crapping out. Given the RNG in a tower defense game it feels like no matter how well you play he can still smash through your most vital spots at random without notice in the middle of a wave and thats all it takes. Hard to recover on wave 30 when half the island disappears.\n\nNeeds Co-Op work for the Co-Op fanbase but still a fun game in singler player for hardcore tower defense fans.\n\n6/10","February 9, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Doesn't bring so much innovative stuff. However, multiplayer can be highly engaging if players are close in skills. However, multiplayer suffers from lack of regular players and therefore you will end up playing against  highly experienced players. Therefore, I would suggest this game for predominantly single player. Eventhough it has great multiplayer.","February 15, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not only will you have to worry about managing towers and shaping your lanes, but you'll need to upgrade troops, que them up, and send them toward the enemy castle.  The constant upgrading you'll be required to do to stay competitive, in addition to managing everything else, will keep you busy from start to finish.  In fact it may even be too much for some people, though I personally enjoy it.

I'ts a pretty straight forward TD where you use tiles to try and "maze" the creeps with towers. The selction of towers isn't terrible and it is pretty fun at first.

I love TD games, and I love the Tower Wars aspect because I used to play Player modded tower wars games on Warcraft 3 online all the time back in the day. Few do it justice, this one did. Its a good fun inviting experience that for $2.39 is amazing. I mean two dollars and thirty nine cents is nothing people, seeing a guy with over 25 hours on it and giving it a thumbs down is hiliarious considering its low price.

The number of towers is small, with most of them being useless, the upgrades are negligable, and the gameplay simply lacks satisfaction as 90% of the enemies fall not to all your carefully placed traps, but make it through to the final "fine we'l kill them for you" part of the map. Single player is a joke. I had the whole path triple layered in every kind of usefull tower and a majority of the enemies made it through unscathed. It might be better in multiplayer, but the game sure as hell doesn't stand up on it's singleplayer.\n\nThe steampunk caught my eye and I was disapointed in that regard, too. It feels really lacking in overall design. Levels (at least the first few I tried) feel baren, the enemies are creative only in close ups, and the actual defences don't really have any substance to them.\n\nOverall, I'd rather just play a free flash game.","April 24, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Entweder sind sie von den Farben her zu knallig, inhaltlich zu abgedreht, zu langatmig, zu schwer, zu schnell usw. usw. FÃ¼r einen echten NÃ¶rgler kann die Liste nicht lang genug sein. Erfreulicherweise konnte ich mich bisher vor allen selbstgemachten Negativerfahrungen bewahren, da ich bis zum Test von âTower Warsâ eine wahre Tower-Defense Jungfrau war. Daher kann ich vorab sagen, dass mich das Game mehr als positiv Ã¼berrascht hat. Aber kommen wir doch erst einmal dazu, was die Damen und Herren von SuperVillain Studios so geschaffen haben.\n\n\nTOWER WARS REVIEW â WAS IST DAS EIGENTLICH?\n\nNach kurzer Spielzeit wurde fÃ¼r mich eines sofort deutlich. Tower Wars ist ein ordentliches Tower-Defense Game, mit ordentlich Zack! Aber kommen wir doch erst mal zum Inhalt. Obwohl ich an dieser Stelle langatmig die Mechanik eines Tower-Defense Spiel erklÃ¤ren kÃ¶nnteâ¦. ach was solls. Wie man vielleicht aus dem englischen Ableiten kann, beinhalten Tower-Defense Games TÃ¼rme und Abwehr. Kombiniert man das ganze kommt man schnell auf den Trichter, dass die TÃ¼rme als Mittel zum Zweck verwendet werden. Und zwar um seine eigene Basis vor den anrÃ¼ckenden Gegenerhorden zu verteidigen um parallel dazu, mit seinen eigenen Truppen, dass gegnerische Lager bis auf die Grundmauern niederzubrennen. Klingt das nicht schÃ¶n? Nicht nur Ã¤hnlich, sondern exakt so, geht es auch in Tower Wars zu. Kommen wir daher also mal zum eigentlichen Spiel.\n\nTOWER WARS â GAMEPLAY\n\nIm GroÃen und Ganzen ist Tower Wars sehr simpel aufgebaut. Man hat neben dem Tutorial (welches verhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãig lang, humorvoll ist und auf angenehme Weise die Spielmechanik erklÃ¤rt) weitere Spielmodi wie z.B. den Multiplayer und der Kampf gegen die kÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz. Bevor man ein Spiel gegen Mensch oder KI startet, empfiehlt es sich das Tutorial zu spielen. Hier werden alle wichtigen Spielmechaniken erklÃ¤rt und dies auf eine sehr humorvolle Art und Weise. Wir lassen jetzt mal unsere Fantasie spielen und stellen uns vor, wir sind im Game. Was jetzt? Im Endeffekt ist das Spielprinzip sehr einfach. Man selber (als auch der der Feind) hat eine eigene Basis, die durch das Setzen von TÃ¼rmen, vor den heranrÃ¼ckenden Feinden beschÃ¼tzt werden soll. Dazu hat man eine Auswahl an unterschiedlichen TÃ¼rmen. Egal ob es sich dabei um Ã¼berdimensionale ArmbrÃ¼ste handelt, Teslaspulenartige TÃ¼rme die an die Zeiten von Command & Conquer erinnern, oder riesenhafte Katapulte fÃ¼r Distanzangriffe. Tower Wars bietet alles! TÃ¼rme haben in Tower Wars allerdings noch eine weitere Funktion. Neben der Verteidigung dienen sie auch als MÃ¶glichkeit, um die KI vor ihrer vorgegebenen Marschroute abzulenken. So laufen die Gegner immer auf einer exakt vorgegebenen Route lang, die im Spiel entweder blau oder rot markiert ist. Durch das setzen der TÃ¼rme, kann diese Route entsprechend verlÃ¤ngert werden, was auch nÃ¶tig ist. Der Feind baut im Laufe des Spiel grÃ¶Ãere und stÃ¤rkere Einheiten, was ein Risiko fÃ¼r den Durchbruch der eigenen Verteidigungslinie immens erhÃ¶ht. Neben dem Bau von TÃ¼rmen ist es allerdings auch mÃ¶glich eigene Einheiten zu bauen. Dies wird ermÃ¶glicht durch Gold und Battlepoints. Gold lÃ¤sst sich einfach in den umliegenden Minen absammeln, wÃ¤hrend Battlepoints durch blutige Schlachten gewonnen werden kÃ¶nnen. Neben dem Einheitenbau lassen sich mit Battlepoints und Gold auch Upgrades erkaufen um die feindliche Basis noch schneller zu stÃ¼rmen.\n\nTOWER WARS â GRAFIK UND SOUND\n\nWas lÃ¤sst sich schon sagen. Ich persÃ¶nlich finde die Grafik sehr gelungen. SuperVillain Studios ist ein Indie Studio welches nicht Ã¼ber ein Budget von mehreren Millionen Dollar verfÃ¼gt, daher ist das was dem Konsumenten prÃ¤sentiert wird mehr als ausreichend. Es gibt keine groben Ecken und Kanten und mir sind bisher keine groben Grafikpatzer aufgefallen. Der Sound ist allerdings erste Sahne! Neben den klangvollen GerÃ¤uschen ist insbesondere die Vertonung der Stimmen PERFEKT gelungen. Selten habe ich einen so hervorragenden, englischen Akzent in einem Videospiel erleben dÃ¼rfen. Einfach nur herrlich.\n\nFAZIT\n\nMachen wir es kurz und schmerzlos. Tower Wars ist ein Ã¼beraus gelungener Indie Titel von SuperVillain Studios, der sich nicht hinter anderen Tower-Defense Spielen zu verstecken brauch. Das Gameplay ist schnell, manchmal vielleicht etwas zu schnell. Mit etwas Ãbung und stimmiger Aufteilung seiner TÃ¼rme ist die erste Defense Line geschaffen, wodurch erst mal brav Battlepoints gesammelt werden kÃ¶nnen. Tower Wars ist auf Steam erhÃ¤ltlich und dies sogar in mehreren Versionen. WÃ¤hrend eine Kopie des Spiels schlappe 7,99 Euro kostet, ist das Tower Wars Team Pack, bestehend aus drei Kopien, fÃ¼r 19,90 Euro zu haben. FÃ¼r Tower-Defense Fans sollte das Spiel durch die unterschiedlichen Spielmodi  lange SpaÃ machen. Ansonsten eignet es sich durch den Preis von 7,99 Euro auch wunderbar zu giften.\n\nZusammenfassend lÃ¤sst sich sagen, dass Tower Wars ein spaÃiges Spiel fÃ¼r Einsteiger ist, welches besonders durch seinen Humor und Preis beeindruckt. Daher verteile ich fÃ¼r Tower Wars ganze vier von fÃ¼nf Sternen.","August 13, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Maybe I have just lost interest in this, but thought that maybe this would reinvigorate it. It does not. There to me seems to be very little interesting diversity. The types of towers you can make can each be upgraded, and all of it is very neat and tidy, but there is just something unfortunate about how unbearably "Realistic" it is. I don't want cannons and arrows and fans, not beyond the initial "early stages" gameplay. I want monkeys wth laser-beams coming out of their eyes, I want dragon-roosts, I want Lich-towers that spam some wierd slimey crud and you don't really know nor care what it actually is, but only that it does good damage against certain armor types.\n\nThe game doesn't move fast enough, and at the same time, it is like trying to crush ants with a hammer. Everything about this game is very polished, but unfortunately too artificial. I suppose that I am looking for something that reminds me of something from a previous era, and I am obviously just sore that this wasn't it.  5/10.","August 5, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Towers have upgrades along with units, stats for units and stats for income.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/recommended/214360/","zeroxxx","zeroxxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/","2761 products in account","The game instantly reminded me of Castle Fight - a Warcraft 3's mod map. Unfortunately it's still lacking many things, including but not limited to Good AI, more campaign maps (solo play) and missions. Would've been a good one if it was released from the start so as the game would have been more popular than it is now.\n\nThere's only three or so missions/maps for solo play including one tutorial. If you expect to play alone... don't think about it too much.\n\nUPDATE: There's now single player content. Horrayyyyyyyyyy!\n\nMultiplayer aspect is pretty much dead. Arrange a match with friend before you jump into multiplayer. If you can find someone with same skill level, well, I guess it's fun.\n\nLearning curve is surprisingly not that hard. There's still a learning curve, but from what I can see, not as steep as Castle Fight. Also there's little teamwork required unlike in Castle Fight so yeah... You just need to send your units (controlled by AI after you launch them) into enemy's castle and simultaneously defend you castle by making maze (hello Sanctum 1). When engaging enemies, you earn points that you can use to hire workers to obtain more gold, upgrade your tech trees to obtain more units and make them stronger. Rinse and repeat - don't forget to keep creating maze.\n\nTypical tower defense stuffs, heh.\n\nAll in all, a promising game but lacking execution and less polished. Despite the workshop implemented already, there's little to none content in it. Sad, but that's true. Maybe with longer developer supports and a few sales here and there the game can be improved and has bigger player base.","September 6, 2013","true","2.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

As you create towers throughout the hexagonal spaces thatâs in your lands, you also spawn your army from a barracks which travels to their lands. I liked this idea, but then felt that the developers had tried to include too much in the game. With a dozen different towers and units to use, you have upgrades for each individual tower, upgrade trees for your units and towers, upgrade trees for your barracks and castle, two resources to use for towers, units and upgrades; several different mines to gain resources which can each be upgraded individuallyâ¦ ok so thereâs too much to upgrade.\n\nThe main problem for me was that the game wasnât engaging enough to keep me playing. Maybe a single-player campaign would have been enough to keep me playing. While game might be complex, the learning curve is still decent, just finicky. Aesthetically the game was OK, Steampunk being something that can never get old, but generally not enough to make a game great. This all being said, I never tried the multiplayer which is the gameâs focusâ¦ so maybe I missed the fun part.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/02/21/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-tower-wars/","April 6, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In short: The sum of several smaller problems. Read on for details.\n\n1.) I bought a 3-pack to play coop. The game description says it has singleplayer & coop and it does. But it is clearly focussed on PvP (1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and the other modes seem like 2nd-class citizens. There is just a single coop level & mode - disappointing.\n2.) The UI does not work well for me, both in input and output. The tower placing mechanism is error prone. Several hours of playing (and watching the UIs feedback) did not lead me to defeat one of the simpler bots. Reading steam community guides for a couple of minutes allowed me to even compete with players.\n3.) 2 years after release i still encountered 3 bugs, 1 of which tipped a head-to-head pvp match to my opponents favor by not allowing me to place towers where i needed them (they could legally be placed there).\n\nEdit: Reduced UI critic, as the info i was lacking to suceed is present and i just never recognized it.","July 7, 2014","false","19.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It is.  I don't know enough about computer processing to explain the details you need to get this game to run smooth, all I can tell you is that it runs beautifully on my Windows Surface Pro 3.  What I can tell you is that it is a whitty game that breaks the fourth-wall (For those of you who don't know:\nThe Fourth Wall is a term in entertainment when the character has a thought about the watcher, or user sometimes in the form of "I wonder if this is some kind of games and we are all just pawns"  or the characters just outright acknowledge you as a player in a sense that you aren't apart of their universe)  It can be quite fun, and is a good time waster if your at work and want two hours to kill.  The singleplayer is mainly versing higher level intelligence bots, not much to it, but if your that type of person thats easy to please, and doesnt need complexity it can be really enjoyable.  Also I do know it takes a long time to find a match in PvP.  If you play with a friend it is better.  Overall  the fact that this game is a time-waster (in a goodway) and has achievements is great!  I personally like to achievement hunt, but the fact that a smaller game with not so difficult achievements gives me a break, and its just interesting to see what objectives the game will amek you complete.   However, if you are not good with focus, or multitasking I DO NOT reccomend this game for you as you will get frustrated with trying to build and upgrade defenses, also trying to make them into a maze.  Dispatch troops, and upgrade that aswell. And finally trying to upgrade your gold mines and castles at the same time.","January 9, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Going through the not-very-detailed tutorial, the joking dialogue confirms your impression.  When the guidance is complete (having forced you forward so you couldn't really watch the effects of what you were told to do since the action was off the screen while the text pop-ups prevented you from scrolling), however, and you are told to defeat the AI that was allegedly designed to be laughably simple, you eerily discover that it is strangely not so easy.\n\nBrushing it off and moving on to the first opponent AI, the real game quickly shows itself.  Still not really sure when you are supposed to use which towers and units (i.e. what the strengths are meant to be), you are left to figure it out in real-time.  A bit of delay and boring start ensues, but the pace quickly picks up.  Expect to loose if you actually try to take the time to read the in-game descriptions for each unit and tower to learn as the AI rapidly ramps up its waves.  I am quite a tower game rookie, but since the game gives the impression that it would fit well for that situation, it is telling that I lost 3 or 4 times until beating the very first AI opponent (then beating the second on the first try since the design is so repetative before giving up on the third from the stupidity).  Most annoying is the fact that there is no time to really think about how to lay out your towers, the waves come too fast, you have to memorize the map and already know what to do.  The fact that single player was an after-thought is quite evident given that, pathetically, there is nothing even as simple as a game speed adjustment.  So while the AI happily processes away at the speed of electricity, its all on you to try to out-click it - the single biggest factor in destroying the potential enjoyability of the game - it is nothing but rushing to keep up.  If you step back and think about it, though, that really is the only way to make it "challenging", since the fixed, hex based maps are so pathetically constraining, there really is only one effective way to force the path through the "maze" at a high level, all you can do is select which towers to construct where.\n\nWhich brings us to the next point.  How do you know which towers you really need?  Well it depens on what troops are being sent after you.  Do they have lots of shields? Armor? Health?  Can you watch and see how effective or ineffective your towers are?  NO!!, you can't!  When you click on a menu to bring up your options, the game forces your screen to look at a certain area.  For instance, if you bring up your castle, your screen MUST look at it, ditto your mines, etc., therefore you cannot browse through and think about upgrades while also watching the assault in the background.  If you try to go around upgrading, you will suddenly have an attacker at your castle door with ample shields and not a clue where you need to add tower strength to prevent it.  If you sit on your hands while watching the action so that you can see where your weaknesses are, you won't have time to actually implement the necessary changes.\n\nThen there is the fact that Every. Single. Time. you launch your troops, the "king" announcer randomly picks one of 2 or 3 lame and incredibly repetitive and annoying phrases to say when you are already frustrated at yet another "strategy" game that has almost no strategy (or even tactics), replacing it with yet another round of who can click the fastest.\n\nI could rant on, but I have wasted enough of my own life on both the game and this review already.  I have not had a Steam account very long, but this is the first game I have uninstalled without beating.  Quite surprising given the lousy 5 (simplistic) maps and 10 AI opponents you have to select between, yet another misleading indicator for this poorly designed game and its confused developers.","March 29, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It struggles to communicate even the most basic things for the Tower Defence genre. For example: when you are going to place a tower, the menu that shows tower placement options actually gets in the way of the range indicator for the towers. Also, the tower placement menu is only visible for as long as you hold the mouse button down; and if you accidentaly misclick a tile, that counts as pressing the button (to show the menu) and releasing it (to select an action i.e. placing a tower), which means you'll built lots of towers by mistake. The buttons in the interface are way too small, there are no information tooltips for most of them (what the hell does the exclamation mark do exactly? It turns red when I click it, but that's it). The fonts are ugly and inconsitent. The creeps' HP bars are hard to read. The pathing of the creeps is smart, but it doesn't show you how it will change until you actually place your towers, so you have to think extra hard before you do anything. Even deleting units from your units queue is painfully hard, you have to double click each individual unit (also, this information is nowhere to be found, I figured it out by mistake). Seriously, the developers need to take a cold, hard look at their User Interface and User Experience. The game is frustrating before it even starts.\n\nThese interface issues were enough to make my experience (with a friend, actually) a nightmare, to the point where I ragequitted a co-op game that I was winning. Aside from that, I'd say that the game actually tries to be funny (in the tutorial and in all the tips and vocal taunts), but really it is not. And bad comedy is worse than no comedy at all.\n\nThe more I think about this game, the more I find things to hate about it. Having two different resources seems like a good idea in theory, but it sucks in game. There are loads of options everywhere and on everything, but most of them are not actually viable - they're useless clutter. You have 3 mines (where you get your resources from) and you can upgrade each one individually. Why? Why not have just one place to control your resource gathering? By the way, the "Tower Defence" aspect of this game is secondary. This is a resource-management game, pure and simple: it's about MIN/MAXING meaningless numbers on what could otherwise be an Excel sheet. Except there's a guy yelling at you trying to be a funny british king figure, and failing hard at it.\n\nThis game is not worth it.","July 4, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","2"

And even so, from what little bit it let me play, it sucks nuts anyway. I can truly see why it got bad scores because it just sucks.

It seems to be only 'optimised' for touch screen.\n\nLet me show you:\nScreenshot\n\nTo build a tower you have to click and hold the mouse button, then you have to circle through a menu and release the button. Hoping you did not select the wrong one. The same setup is done for upgrading and selling, which can often lead to annoying situations.\n\nI don't like my games to be tedious. I do not understand why there is no option to change the settings: Upgrade -> shortcut u, sell -> shortcut s. Simple stuff like this.\nThe game is quite fast paced and the interaction to build/upgrade/sell a tower is really slow because of this setup.\n\nFurthermore, I do not find the towers very balanced. The costs seem extremely mixed. Rather than different towers with different effects for roughly the same cost (Think of Kingdom Rush). So diversification of towers is more a cost matter than what troops the enemy sends you.\n\nAs a result, this game could not interest me. As reflected in my playing time.","January 9, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there are a plethora of options for the game, I find that I can't pull my camera back as far as I'd like. In addition the learning curve is fairly steep and unforgiving. This wouldn't be so bad except play is ONLINE ONLY. There's no skirmish mode against a computer, it seems like an obvious thing to add, but they didnt. You can only play this game against other players. So in my experience you either get absolutely trounced by people who have their strats down, or you trounce a new player.\n\nIn addition since it's a newer game, you have to wait for a match to be made, yesterday that took eight minutes. 8 minutes of sitting in a queue staring at a loading screen isn't the most fun when I just want a 20-30 minute game.\n\nThere is a single player 'TD' version of the game, but it's not the real game and feels tacked on.\n\nUltimately I would say give this a pass just because of the online pvp only unless you're REALLY into this style of game.","August 27, 2012","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "Competitive" mode is a tug of war + TD style game where you defend with towers and spend money and "Battle Points" on sending a combination of units.\n\nThis game is a great, well thought out, tower defense (TD) game. Albeit the learning curve it is a very fun and involving game - HOWEVER - like any TD game it does get rather stale because you end up running out of real estate to build on. At the 20-25 minute mark you're left with an abundance of the most effective towers for your situation and can only sit their and watch your gold accumulate.\n\nThe competitive online scene is just that, you find people who will either end you early by spending all their gold on units you can't kill early on. The other scenario is you battle it out for what I have found to be anywhere between 15-70 minutes.\n\nAt its retail price it's a great game that offers a great new front for the tower defense genre. At a sale price, it's an even better steal.\n\n","July 4, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

From my brief experience it seems the idea is to perfect your strategy ( maybe per map ) and then rinse and repeat. Make the enemy travel the longest way to your castle and figure out the best combination of towers and soldiers.

Here are the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Steampunk-style art offers a new take on the tower defense genre.\n2. Gameplay is straightforward and easy to pick up.\n3. Different levels and a hex based grid allows for a unique game each time you play.\n\nCons:\n1. Content-wise, the game lacks diversity. There is only one set of units and the only changes in style between opposing players is color.\n2. MONUMENTALLY long loading times for a small game will make you wonder if the game has frozen while spinning up a map.\n3. Limited replayability as the playerbase is lacking for matchmaking/competetive play.\n\nSummary: At its current 2.00 sale price, Tower wars is a definite buy. Even if you only get about 10 games out of it before moving on to another title, this game does offer some intense competetive play - provided you have the patience to wait through the loading times.","July 5, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might just be me too but I found the game incredibly difficult (though judging from other reviews I'm not alone), I personally wasn't even able to beat the first level with where you battle against a plank, that's right, A PLANK!\n\nAside from the difficultly, the game did have some rather humorous moments and the I really liked the graphic style and the tutorial level did a really nice job of explaining things.\n\nOther than that I would like to include another person's review, Drunk Bear Man, because it sums up how I feel about the game as well:\n\n"6/10\n\nIt's a unique kind of mix-up to the Tower Defense genre, where you have to defend using towers like always... AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre.

The game plays around the game mode made popular by War Craft III in which the player constructs towers in a maze to protect their base (or in this game's instance, their castle). Its a simple style of gameplay for a very casual game that can be both relaxing, or in more difficult settings absolutely intense. Unfortunately, Tower Wars fails to deliver on any of that excitement that made tower defence games so very popular in the years past.\n\nA few review note this game as being easy, others stating that it is hard. Overall, the game is easy--until you hit the absolute best in any given map in which case its a waiting game for the creeps to get strong enough to make it to your castle. Games lasting an hour or more of just waiting for your maxed out maze to finally be defeated while you sit hopeless...and bored. That is the survival mode in a nutshell--lifeless and easy. Aided with a rather terrible user interface and rather bad maps it feels uninspired and a chore to get into.\n\nThere now is multiplayer too, which like one of the single player modes adds the the ability to spend gold to buy "creeps" to send to the oppossing player's maze. This verses style worked fantastic in days past--the perfect balance in deciding to spend money for either offencive play or defencive play. While Tower Wars continues on this great gameplay, some of the same reasons that make the single player so dry still exist in multiplayer making it one of those games which simply does not draw the player in.\n\nSure, my ideas of tower defence games is carved from the various mods from the early days of their introduction as mods for various Blizzard games, but I gave Tower Wars a chance to work with the genre to create new and interesting gameplay and build on it. It adds hexagonal tiles, which could have resulted in amazing new ways to making new mazes, alas the maps do not even permit very complex mazes thanks to their size. I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially at the asking price of $8. It quite simply falls short.","December 31, 2013","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each side pitted against each other, sending minions, and building towers to defend against the minions that their opponents have sent. Tower Wars adds it's own twist in the form of Battle points as income for sending minions instead of more gold. Battle points are used to power up your sent minions, as well as increase the mining power of your miners. The one flaw with Tower Wars, is that the ramp up time is very slow. Games have the potential to last hours if opponents are on even levels, and often the games do last very long.","December 6, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just couldnt get into it, and once I saw how people just found way to abuse the ranking system I stopped caring. I dont know if they have fixed these problems but honestly at this point I just dont care. I got this game at launch really curious about it, but all it did was reaffirm why we should not preorder, or purchase games at launch unless we have seen enough gameplay footage to say "yes, I am making an educated purchase".\nDont get me wrong I dont care what other opinions of a game is...if you like it, you like it end of story. We all have to justify the purchases we make for ourselfs. And while this is one I would normaly want to take back, reality is I usually spend more on lunch. That and I will take it as a lesson learned, I only hope the dev's will have a more desirable offering next time around.\n","December 8, 2013","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a fairly unique concept in the genre of being able to make the entire maze that creeps have to travel. The PvP mode is also very well done and has a lot of micromanaging to attend to which any strategist should be able to appreciate.\n\nWhere my gripes fall on this game (and this being a few weeks since I've last touched the game) is the co-op. While the one map they offer is very good, they haven't really followed up on it by offering more maps. That aside, this game is excellent from what I've seen so far.

It might just be me too but I found the game incredibly difficult (though judging from other reviews I'm not alone), I personally wasn't even able to beat the first level with where you battle against a plank, that's right, A PLANK!\n\nAside from the difficultly, the game did have some rather humorous moments and the I really liked the graphic style and the tutorial level did a really nice job of explaining things.\n\nOther than that I would like to include another person's review, Drunk Bear Man, because it sums up how I feel about the game as well:\n\n"6/10\n\nIt's a unique kind of mix-up to the Tower Defense genre, where you have to defend using towers like always... AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre.

Tower Wars adds it's own twist in the form of Battle points as income for sending minions instead of more gold. Battle points are used to power up your sent minions, as well as increase the mining power of your miners. The one flaw with Tower Wars, is that the ramp up time is very slow.

The game plays around the game mode made popular by War Craft III in which the player constructs towers in a maze to protect their base (or in this game's instance, their castle). Its a simple style of gameplay for a very casual game that can be both relaxing, or in more difficult settings absolutely intense. Unfortunately, Tower Wars fails to deliver on any of that excitement that made tower defence games so very popular in the years past.\n\nA few review note this game as being easy, others stating that it is hard. Overall, the game is easy--until you hit the absolute best in any given map in which case its a waiting game for the creeps to get strong enough to make it to your castle. Games lasting an hour or more of just waiting for your maxed out maze to finally be defeated while you sit hopeless...and bored. That is the survival mode in a nutshell--lifeless and easy. Aided with a rather terrible user interface and rather bad maps it feels uninspired and a chore to get into.\n\nThere now is multiplayer too, which like one of the single player modes adds the the ability to spend gold to buy "creeps" to send to the oppossing player's maze. This verses style worked fantastic in days past--the perfect balance in deciding to spend money for either offencive play or defencive play. While Tower Wars continues on this great gameplay, some of the same reasons that make the single player so dry still exist in multiplayer making it one of those games which simply does not draw the player in.\n\nSure, my ideas of tower defence games is carved from the various mods from the early days of their introduction as mods for various Blizzard games, but I gave Tower Wars a chance to work with the genre to create new and interesting gameplay and build on it. It adds hexagonal tiles, which could have resulted in amazing new ways to making new mazes, alas the maps do not even permit very complex mazes thanks to their size. I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially at the asking price of $8. It quite simply falls short.","December 31, 2013","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The single player is one of the reasons why I like the game and it should also be a reason for people to get it. The single player is a good way to learn how to play the game (even though there is a tutorial). You could think of different ways to try and win a game. Also there are a few maps to play on but after a while it could get repetitive and that is the reason why I rate it 8/10 and not 10/10. Besides the standard gamemode there is one more. Although the standard gamemode is better overall.\n\nIf you have a computer that just makes the requirements (like me), expect to be turning down the quality of how it runs and how it looks (the gameplay still looks pretty good though). Overall this game is not as demanding as other games for your computer.\n\nThis game is worth your time and money.","June 6, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "Competitive" mode is a tug of war + TD style game where you defend with towers and spend money and "Battle Points" on sending a combination of units.\n\nThis game is a great, well thought out, tower defense (TD) game. Albeit the learning curve it is a very fun and involving game - HOWEVER - like any TD game it does get rather stale because you end up running out of real estate to build on. At the 20-25 minute mark you're left with an abundance of the most effective towers for your situation and can only sit their and watch your gold accumulate.\n\nThe competitive online scene is just that, you find people who will either end you early by spending all their gold on units you can't kill early on. The other scenario is you battle it out for what I have found to be anywhere between 15-70 minutes.\n\nAt its retail price it's a great game that offers a great new front for the tower defense genre. At a sale price, it's an even better steal.\n\n","July 4, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Fun idea, and the game technically works. Although the tutorial is useless: it just says you learn by playing :).\n\nThe problem lies in the gameplay. From my brief experience it seems the idea is to perfect your strategy ( maybe per map ) and then rinse and repeat. Make the enemy travel the longest way to your castle and figure out the best combination of towers and soldiers. Once you get this planned out, it seems hard for me to continue from that point on or believe there's something so strategic that you can evolve.","July 5, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Steampunk-style art offers a new take on the tower defense genre.\n2. Gameplay is straightforward and easy to pick up.\n3. Different levels and a hex based grid allows for a unique game each time you play.\n\nCons:\n1. Content-wise, the game lacks diversity. There is only one set of units and the only changes in style between opposing players is color.\n2. MONUMENTALLY long loading times for a small game will make you wonder if the game has frozen while spinning up a map.\n3. Limited replayability as the playerbase is lacking for matchmaking/competetive play.\n\nSummary: At its current 2.00 sale price, Tower wars is a definite buy. Even if you only get about 10 games out of it before moving on to another title, this game does offer some intense competetive play - provided you have the patience to wait through the loading times.","July 5, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Long battles defending your castle and attacking the opposition in great swarms of waves. Demolition & destruction, the sheer agony of your enemy's troops as they fall in battle. Be wary to kill them fast though, or your time may well be spent best playing the TD mode which is also a great challange.\n\nDefinite buy.\n\n","January 3","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only gripe is that the game mode used in multiplayer is different than the single player option, and that's not a big deal except that the multiplayer type of "battle" play doesn't have a single player option. It would be nice to have that to practice before you get involved in Ranked matches.\n\nAlso, there's only 3 different maps at current. Hopefully they release more, or perhaps an editior to allow the Workshop.\n\nOverall it's a great game. Give it 7/10","August 22, 2012","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
