However I would recomend you don't make the mistake I made and purchace this instead of Race WTCC 07. That game basicly includes everything in this game plus another game, and  also has a wealth of mods on the internet, including the excelent 2012-2013 mod. For only $1 more it's an amazing value, and I ended up just purchacing that one and uninstalling this, because there was nothing more this could offer. As a game though I would recommend it. It's a bit of a hardcore sim, so if you're used to Burnout or Need for Speed you may have some trouble adjusting. However for the money it's a good deal. Not on the level of a new Codemasters or Forza game, but still worth the money.","January 15, 2014","true","4.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

Both realistic (quite simulator-like, if not an actual simulator), highly enjoyable (with assisting can be played as an sim-arcade) and challenging (AI reacting to your type of driving, learns your tactics on the track and adapts to confront it). Huge bonus - great graphics for a game made in last decade, AND is still fully capable to be played on lower end pcs/laptops (latter being my case).

In the other hand, not much evolution compared to earlier Simbin games. Still no real-like rain and still too low damage sensitivity and too simple damage model. Two formula cars are welcomed add-on, however their drivability and grip feel should be better. I hope these formula cars are profecy of F1 racing game from Simbin in future. Again great game for sim veterans and normal players.","February 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But now well......... Not so much. The interface or graphics which ever one you want to call it look old compared to my other games. Also the game is kind of limited. First of all there are only about three car brands. All the cars look the same and the only thing that's changed is the paint job and the number. Thee are also only like 10-20 tracks. Also if you have a wheel this game is not for you. I have a wheel my self and in my opinion it just does not feel right compared to my other racing games. There is also the fact that this game has not changed/been updated for about three years. They are many other things that are wrong with this game and I doubt that will change so really don't buy this game.:(","March 13","false","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Cars are all tunable but you have to know how to tune, or if you don't know you have to practice about it. Game includes 7-step-beginner tips which is simple about driving. The only problem I think is even dry, tarmac always looks dirty with dirt.\nFinally, it reduces it's money and it gives a lot more than it's money.\n"Thumbs up for this game."","September 7, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a wonderful racing game but it will never replace GTR. I can't play GTR anymore though so this I guess just has to replace it.","February 23","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
