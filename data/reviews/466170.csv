I hesitate to even call it a game since it has almost no graphics, and looks like a business application. Why is it bad?\nThe UI is poorly done, and it doesn't adhere to GUI conventions. For example, there are a lot of things that look like buttons, but they effectively serve as tabs, because clicking them changes the page that's displayed. Just, unlike actual tab controls, there is no visual indication of this whatsoever.\nThe game is rather complex, and the numerous pieces of information it displays and the actions you can do are all stuffed into the multitude of hidden pages. There is no simple, sensible layout of all this.\nSpeaking of the game's complexity, when you first run it, you'll be greeted by the FAQ page. Its wall of text will try to explain some of the game's multitude of concepts and mechanics to you. Why? Because there is no tutorial! Instead, aside from the FAQ, there are tooltips on all the UI elements, briefly explaining what they do. You're going to be playing detective for a while to piece it all together.\nBTW, this game has been out on Kongregate for a while, and a large number of the positive Steam reviews you see here are from experienced Kongregate players. The game is by no means as good as the current rating implies.","May 29","false","117.7"," 150 of 248 people (60%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","60","150","248","14","11"

Why am i doing this to myself?\nI did find that i quite like the tooltips. they did give me a few chuckles. However, i found a few more glaring design flaws.\nWhy is there a feature to limit the max amount of levels on skills, but NOT one to limit the max amount of creations? this means i jhave to watch very carefully if i want to make soil and have some rocks left over, or make air and keep light. Compare this to the absolutely useless ability to stop gaining infinitely extendable resources with zero penalites for making them, tranings and skills.\nAlso, the fact that pet food's tooltip seems to imply that it actively HURTS your pet isawful, and makes me not want to use it. i assume it doesn't but i'd rather not take risks.\nSpeaking of pets, why is food so expensive? just let me buy it in divinity!\n\n24 hours in. Haven't progressed much at all, due do a few factors.\n1. Offline progression either doesn't work, or is nonexistent.can't tell you which yet, but i'm leaning towards the latter. EDIT: IT WORKS NOW, dunno why it wasn't before.\n2. you know how in every other clicker/idle, if it has a prestiege feature, this feature is something you should hold off on using until quite a while in? this game wants, no, DEMANDS you use it constantly.\n3. grinding the clonecap down is tedious and boring, and it doesn't appear there is a way to speed up your ability cooldowns in the special minigame. ALMOST FORGOT: it is super counter-intuitive. i get what the dev was going for, i really do. he wanted you to have to keep your skill power and cap grinding time balanced. However, what really just ends up happening is that your low level skills you need to decrease the cap for grow with level, meaning that they do no damage, meaning using them solely to fight (one of the only reasons to use special) will not work. you are literally better off waiting 24 hours in auto before progressing (see point 1) in order to have decent enough skills to grind.\nNot sure i'll progress much further before quitting, only redeeming factor so far is the decent fanfiction unlocked by beating a boss.\n\n\n\n2 Hours in. this is the slowest clicker/idle game i have ever played. it takes "less than an hour for newer players" to even be able to defeat the first boss, in which it is ALREADY reccomended you ascend/prestige/rebirth. In my playthrough, it took 10 minutes to even START fighting! A lot of this is given in the FAQ, which the game starts you in, basically telling you "read this, this is how you have to play the game, if not you will be entirely lost". The game doesn't ease you in, either. ot's a complex mess from the start, that i am still slowly figuring out. Also, not a major thing, but te UI grapics are awful. yeah, player graphics arent needed, but when the UI makes me want to be as AFK as possible, there's an issue.\n\nPROS:\nPlenty of content\nUnique Concept\ncool story?\n\nCons:\nReally slow\nIncredibly complex\nRequired FAQ instead of simple tutorials\nIRC has caused my game to crash when starting it\nNon-permanent achievements\n\nGotta give this game a 4/10, reccomended only to the most hardcore of idle fans.","May 30","false","32.5"," 41 of 73 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","41","73","2","10"

It's not a game for everyone.  But if you've got time on the side to play around a bit, and you liked playing with numbers as a kid, you just might fall in love.\n\nThe start is rocky, and the pace is cruel.   But there's plenty of willing helpers in chat, as well as guides and established forums with loads of information.  And just when you've reached the end of the hit list, the real game opens up.  ItRtG has enough different types of challenges and goals that it can fit any schedule or play style.\n\nThe best part, IMO, is the complexity of the different features, without any being game-breaking.  A good idle game to keep a thinker's brain busy.\n\nJust don't come in looking for instant satisfaction.

I checked it out, noticed it was free and even though there are some what you could call 'pay to win' elements (but not really) I wanted to give it a try. And well, as you can see, I already pumped over thirty hours in the game.\n\nSo the most obvious question you ask yourself after the previous parargraph is 'if the game is pay to win, then what do you mean by that?' or something along those lines anyway. Well, there is something called 'god power' that you get by defeating gods the first time and then every time after a certain point.\n\nTo clarify that a bit, there are about.. I think eight to ten gods that only give a god power the first time and then you get only a god power starting from (as an example) god number eleven. That will get you a point every time.\n\nNow, these points can be used to increase your stats permenantly. See, you progress into the game mainly through the use of shadow clones. (not related to Naruto in any way shape or form) but the idea behind it still fits.\n\nAnyway, you use shadow clones to fight monsters, to train and to build monuments. the first two you can do from the start but the latter is only available after defeating a certain god.\n\nAn additional feature is something called 'rebirth' it will reset your progress to zero BUT you keep your stats. That means that when you struggled to defeat the first god, the first time around, you'll defeat him in seconds flat by the time you rebirth a few times.\n\nNow, this game is an 'idle' game which means that you don't have to pay it much attention. In fact, you could leave it alone for a few days and you would have made a very big amount of progress stats wise. The bigger your stats before you rebirth, the bigger your advantages will be the next time you rebirth.\n\nAll by all, if you have time to waste, to check the game every now and then and see progress every time you do, then this game is definetly for you.\n\nBut if you don't like bigger numbers then you ever realistically use in real life (like EVER) then don't bother with this. After a while the numbers get so big that it gets absolutely ridicilous. I mean, I knew that after billion came trillion but after that I didn't care too much. I mean, what need does a regular person have for bigger numbers then that?\n\nNow, story wise you can read a story but it is only written up to a certain point at this point. It requires your imagination to tell the story and even if it was finished, the story is 'meh' at best and 'oh my god, that was the biggest waste of time to read in my life' at the worst.\n\nI want to stress that this isn't a game that you leave open for hours at a time. In fact, closing it and leaving it alone rewards you by increasing your creation stats by three hundred percent. (300 % !!!)\n\nTrust me, that's good.\n\nMy conclusion is that this is an excellent game to waste some time if you are bored and got nothing better to do. But I would still recommend it. Hell, I would even be willing to pay a small amount for it. Not much, definetly not above five euros and probably not even that. Not because I'm cheap or anything, but because the nature of the game, while amusing isn't worth more then that.\n\nKingdark","June 5","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It cost you nothing to try it out. But... (and this is where my positive review ends.\n\nI can't defend spending money on this now unless you do it just to support the developers. There is only one thing I could concider getting, but not as long as the prizing is as it is. I honestly cant understand why they have made their purchases this expensive. This is a small marked, there is (or at least shouldn't be) any competetive reason to keep players at a blanced playing field, the game isn't interesting, and the game isn't that good. Why are you holding people back from experiencing your game? You have people who don't have my patience, that won't bother with this game, and you have people who have my patience that won't bother spending money on this. The only crowd I can concive that you are making money on is kids.

I was hooked on this almost as soon as I started. Coming off of a recent Cookie Clicker binge, I guess I\'m just not ready to move on from these idle games.\nI think the reason these types of games are fun is becuase of the constant  goals you can set and accomplish.\n\nThe game also is not a huge time-sink. You set your clones doing work, and then you focus on something else for a few hours. You come back and now you\'re strong enough to kill the next god.\nThe pacing of the game is also really well done; you\'re always unlocking new things even towards the end, and each rebirth feels like a new game but less grindy.\n\nThe game is also very transparent in how things are calculated. It doesn\'t just throw you in and make you deal with how things work, it very plainly tells you all of the calculations and formulas that are used, so you don\'t have to waste time searching the web for that stuff if you\'re a min/max addict like me.\n\nAnd whats that? This game is only $0.00? (€0.00 for my friends across the pond)\nThat is free. This game is free. I like free. Free is best.\nThis dev is also not aggressive about the fact that the game is free. Sure, there\'s things you can buy in the game, but the dev doesn\'t even attempt to force those things on you or throw it in your face, and I really respect that.\n\nTry this game out, let it run while you do other work.","June 1","true","101.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"Some DA ♥♥♥♥?" ♥♥♥♥ off, this is some nice art and fits with this kind of game.\n\nNow of course the cons because almost all games have some.\n\nCons\n------\n\nSome of the UI isn't there or doesn't help much, like, I don't know what the 'Special' tab does. I'll click on a skill and it says "Start the fight first" and I've done that while battling a god.\nCreating doesn't have a 'stop at' (stop creating Plants if Soil if Stone is 200 like JDude said.) Tbh I'd like to see that for everything but as a whole is needed.\nUnlocking clothes, wings, and stuff is nice but I absolutely hate that it resets to default when I rebirth and I think paying a crazy amount of god power (though once you get there farming won't be hard) is silly for a perm. In fact, if the game could remember what I wore and once I unlock the items it would auto equip would be super freaking cool.\n(NOT REALLY A CON) The (as some people think) "P2W trash" is crazy expensive. 5 god power for  2.90? That's pretty crazy and I actually think this deters players from buying it. So I don't know where this P2W is coming from.\n\nI'm sure there's more but I can't think of any atm.\n\nI really can't wait for the next part of the story (after beating Diana.)","June 5","true","137.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot more to it then one would think.\n\nFirst off this isn't a CLICKER game. Not like Clicker Heroes, Time Clickers, etc. There are some parts where you click a lot of but it's mainly focused around idling and waiting for stuff. I know, strange that a game with the word IDLING in the title has a lot to do with IDLING, isn't it? Of course you could be an idiot and leave a negative review for just that reason.\n\nAnyway, so here's how it works. You start off as pretty much just a normal guy, stuck on a planet after we humans destroyed our home world....for the 17th time. You end up in a world and universe ruled by powerful gods. Being the last survivor of a war against the god Hyperion, you end up developing your own godlike powers and start to challenge the gods, beginning with Hyperion and progressing up a ladder.\n\nYes folks this game does indeed have a story, with bits of it being unlocked everytime you defeat one of the gods. Currently the story stops after one of the mid-range gods with nothing remaining for the rest of them, so this might be something that comes in the future hopefully. For now the story that exists is pretty good, as it gives context and reason to your idling.\n\nAt its core the game is involved around you training shadow clones, and using these clones to train skills and fight monsters, which in turn raises your own stats. You assign a certain number of clones to each task and wait as your skills get higher. When you're strong enough you challenge a god, and then rinse and repeat until you find you can't beat the next god. At that point you can "rebirth" which starts you over but gives you multipliers on your stats; not much different then a lot of other idle games of this style. But there's a fair bit of depth to it, which i'll leave you to figure out yourself once you start playing.\n\nA solid 'sit around on your ♥♥♥ and become more powerful then you can imagine' recommendation.","June 3","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a time sink game. You do not really do much of the whole "Playing" thing, it's an idle game of course. When you see bad reviews you see they maybe play the game half an hour, they haven't killed the first god yet. I played this game on Kongregate for a long time and killed all the gods up to baal 3. This is an EXCELLENT idle game, and it has a lot of contributing factors to your progression. I will give some pros and cons as to why I think people will enjoy it, or not enjoy it.\n\nPros:\nExponential gain over time is pretty fun.\nYou can run it in the background of any games, and move the game without doing much.\nIt's fun to be figuratively killing gods.\nProgress bars can be fun to watch.\n\nCons:\nTime sink, many people will not like this factor.\nIdle, many people want something to actually play.\nArtwork may be a bit lackluster, thus visually un-appealing.\n","May 30","true","176.9"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","0"

You start off small and go big like every other similar game. After the humans basically destroyed all habitable planets in the known universe, on the last planet they created a space dimension device. Using this device they were able to travel to a different dimension. In this dimension they noticed that the world was ruled and run by gods. The last human survived a long battle with the first god and developed a new ability: shadow clones. You create these clones and train them to basically do everything for you, that includes killing gods.\n\nWhat I thinkOnce starting Idling to Rule the Gods you are sort of confused on what to do at first. There's no visual tutorials that help and show you what you should be doing, how you should be doing it and where you should be doing it at. After some common sense you'll just be clicking these obvious buttons, "Build", "Train", "Fight", "Other" - Each button serve their own purpose. You build shadow clones via "Build" (it is automatic). You will then use those built (created) shadow clones in the "Train" and "Fight" tabs to increase your stats.\n\nIf you click the "Other" button you will also notice the "Story" tab. This basically tells you what to do, but as I said nothing is visual and you have to read (which in today's world a lot of people apparently don't know how to read or don't want to read). I didn't notice the Story button until later on during gameplay.\n\nYou might look at this game and think "Clicker", but that's it, it isn't a clicker. That was my initial thought until I read the tags and didn't see "Clicker". Almost everything is automatic by incrementing clones in a specific skill or fight.\n\nAfter so & so hours of playing I finally defeated a few gods and eventually Rebirth (basically start over with higher multipliers). Don't worry, I Rebirth with pretty decent multiplier values. Any who, after rebirthing I started over again with a nice force and within a few minutes defeated the first god. I'm now at 4 gods defeated, about to be 5. On that note, it honestly didn't take that long to get going. Most of my time playing was just to build up rebirth stats.\n\nThis game is time consuming, but once you get going it is amazing for such a very simple game.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nI recommend this title.\n\nI will make it easier if people don't feel like reading. Below is a pros and cons.\n\nPros Free to play\nTime consuming and what you expect out of this type of game genre\nReplay value (includes Rebirth replay)\nGreat story\nCreation boost when the game is offline and you start it back up\nAutomatic handling\nQuite a lot to do\nCons No visual tutorials or anything (maybe story?) explaining what to do at the beginning. There should be some pointers on how to get started.\nPet leveling isn't automatic. You have to constantly monitor pets to recreate custom clones to level it.\nCannot create while the game isn't active (Unless I'm missing something here?)..","May 30","true","70.9"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

I used to play this game all the time when it was on Kongregate.

And now I can see that there are new features added into the mix; I am really looking forward to playing with that. Overall,Idling to Rule the Gods is definitely something you should leave in the background whilst you do other things, and come back to see how the avatar "you" did whilst you were elsewhere. I definitely recommend a try at the very least, maybe you can grow to like the charms of this strange little idle game.\n\nEDIT: And now I found out that there are lores, detailed lores that outlines how you've came to be, why you are fighting creatures and gods, as well as how your powers came to be, and how they relates to gods.

Trimps has no graphics at all, neither does Swarmsim. So tell me, how do they have active cult followings and hundreds of active players?\n\nIdle and Incremental Games don't NEED graphics. The fact that this one has hand drawn art gives it a heck of a lot of charm to me, and if you choose to be a Goddess then you certainly aren't ugly. In my opinion, she's pretty cute, even without cosmetic unlocks ^^;\n\nThe progression is deep and will take you a good while, and content is added pretty often. I played a month or two ago on Kong, and now we have pets.\n\nI mean, pets? I'm a puny mortal suplexing Gods and beating the shizzit out of my Shadow Clone Jutsus, and a Mouse adds  a couple hundred power level to me? Sure :D\n\nOn a final note, (and hopefully the arrogance and master race level of this little comment doesn't get too bad,) a true fan of Incremental games will see just how much time and effort can be sunk into this game. I'm an absolute $lut for seeing small numbers get big, and this game scratches that itch so very, very nicely...\n\n...At least, until Solomon calls for me again. I can hear His voice now, from the depths of my Library...\n\n"You worship false idols.

It has a built in IRC client if you want to ask questions, a story, and from the looks of it a lengthy progression.  I should be able to defeat Izanagi soon; the only thing left to figure out is how the pets work.  It was confusing at first, but 20-30 minutes of trying things and reading the FAQ set me off in the right direction.\n\nThis game is not for those that want instant gratification, beautiful graphics, amazing UI design, etc.  This is port of a flash game (it really shows), but regardless I am enjoying it thus far.","May 30","true","196.5"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","7","21","2","0"
