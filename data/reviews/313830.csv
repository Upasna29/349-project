"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/313830/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","If you take a quick look at some of the screenshots you might think you’re dealing with an action adventure game here, but you’d be very wrong. See No Evil is actually an isometric puzzle game focused on sounds. No, this is not a rhythm game, but a game where you have to manipulate sounds in order to advance through the levels.\n\nThe (rather vague) story of See No Evil takes you through several chapters, each chapter consisting of a good amount of levels that will test both your patience and intelligence. Like pretty much any puzzle game out there the game starts easy but progressively becomes harder. But, to be honest, there are some pretty easy levels later on as well (or easier, at least). So it has a nice mix of both. Great for the gamers that usually get stuck later when puzzles sometimes become too difficult to solve (like me). But it’s not so great for those that are looking to be challenged until the very end of a game. I do think the difficulty is a bit inconsistent here, because the game doesn’t need to throw easier levels at you in order to tell its story. Still, I appreciated the fact that it made things easier every now and then. After a hard day of work I don’t want to think too long about how to solve a certain puzzle.\n\nSo, the game is based on sound manipulation so whenever your character moves pulsating circles can be seen at your feet. These circles mark a certain distance before anyone hears you; get too close to an enemy and he will hear you and finally start chasing you. But push a box in front of you and it will block a part of these sounds and because of it you can easily get past this same enemy.\nLater in the game horns are also introduced. Scream into one and the produced sounds will travel further. These horns are shaped like an L so if you rotate enough of them you can let the sounds travel around in circles, or other any way you want them to, until something (usually a row of blocks) stops it from continuing.\nThere are even more things that you have to manipulate before you can continue; for example, snow leaves a trail so it’s recommended to walk around a few blocks so that you aren’t immediately noticed by an enemy. Switches also have to be used to solve puzzles, sometimes with blocks, other times without them. The later levels will combine all of these elements together to create deep and tough puzzles.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty. It’s all made in 2D and the game itself has a somewhat dark atmosphere. But not too dark. There’s nothing twisted, freaky or creepy here, just some weird stuff.\nThe main character reminded me a bit of the character from Bastion. This could just be a coincidence I guess. Anyway, everything is well animated and it all looks good. Your character does walk rather slow, though, and it’s one of my minor complaints. Speeding things up with a patch would only break the game so I know for a fact that it won’t be fixed and it’s not even game breaking, but it is slightly annoying if you ask me.\nThe sounds effects are fairly basic, with some guns rattling and a whole lot of screaming. I must admit that I’ve heard more comforting sounds in my life, but these do fit the game’s style.\nThe music on the other hand is quite good. Good but also repetitive.\n\nSo far the game has taken me 3-4 hours to get where I am (I think I’m near the end of chapter 3) and since there are 4 chapters I guess it could take one roughly 5-7 hours to finish it, which is more than enough for a puzzle game these days. For the hardcore gamers the developer integrated New Game+. I only assume the game will mix puzzles up should you choose to do this, and maybe there are some extra puzzles in it as well, who knows ?\n\nSee No Evil is a love it or hate it kind of game I think. But, this is usually true for most puzzle games. I for one enjoyed it (still am enjoying it actually) because it has a good mix of simple and complex puzzles and its mysterious story kept me intrigued up until where I am now. I will definitely finish this one soon, that’s for sure.\nIf you enjoy puzzle games, even for just a little bit, then this is a game you should absolutely play. It can ‘easily’ be finished in one long sitting or in smaller sessions where you just finish a couple of levels each time. It doesn’t really matter; just take your time and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","September 2, 2014","true","4.7"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","45","48","2","1"

This game is fantastic. Very few games utilize sound as a game mechanic, and this one pulls it off perfectly. Your footsteps make noise and alert the baddies, your voice calls them in your direction. You should to manipulate the  puzzles. Simple premise that is rarely used and has so much potential and variety.\n\nThe game controls very easily which leaves you to focus on the puzzles which will sometimes cause you to take a step back and think twice before entering into a level. The animation and art styles are unique and beautiful, and the puzzles are challenging but not rage quit inducing.\n\nDefinitely worth every penny and I recommend everyone give this game a try at least once.

Make use of that when going for "no death" chapters.\n\n+ Okay music\n+ Okay story with cool delivery of the end\n+ Great art style\n+ Two instances, Game and Game Plus\n0 Spikes sometimes walkable\n- Some invisible walls and edges\n- Some odd or inconsequent decisions regarding controls\n- Some achievements are broken\n\nBasically, you play the Seer, a pretty literal description of the avatar and you try to escape a dystopian society, reminding me of 1984 and The Giver. In order to escape, the Seer needs to pass levels by solving mainly lever-based puzzles. Don't worry, there is a sufficient variety of "levers". At the beginning of levels you get encouraging and instructive text messages and discouraging voice messages, both vying for your attention and compliance. Those two types of messages well fit the background story.\n\nI really like the delivery at the end of the game, although the first time around I wasn't prepared for the end to come and couldn't completely enjoy the composition - well done.\n\nWhat made me play the game, apart from it being a puzzler, was the art style. It's clean and pretty, functional and decent. Congratulations on that.\n\nI did not quite catch when the second instance, "Game Plus", got activated. I guess it activates after the first playthrough and provides more levels as well as modified, read harder, versions of the levels in the first instance.\n\nThe second instance makes "no death" runs a challenge, although I couldn't be bothered to go for the corresponding achievement since a few of them are broken and if I can't get them all I'm not too enthusiastic about getting any.\nSpecifically achievements connected to the third chapters in both instances are broken. Each chapter 3 has one achievement for simple completion and one for "no death" run. Additionally, there is one achievement bound to a specific level and one OCD achievement - both of which can probably be earned in either instance (in theory). Of those six achievement I have earned all, with the possible exception of the OCD one, but I've been awarded only the level-specific one. By logic alone I should also have at least the simple completion achievements.\n\nThere is a number of odd decisions in the game. I didn't like that the Seer needs to stand still to scream.\nLevels are presented in an isometric fashion with its horizontal axis corresponding to the screen's horizontal axis and its vertical axis being skewed a bit to the left. Yet, the Seer moves along screen axes or diagonal.\nThe Seer has eight moving directions, less than enemies, and only four directions to look in, NSEW.\nI guess, the four looking directions come from the puzzle design and the moving directions got diagonal movement added so it doesn't feel like an '80s game. One problem here is correspondence of both type of directions. Looking up or down is favoured over right or left, so moving diagonal makes you look up or down. That makes the analogue stick too unreliable for puzzle elements requiring rather precise controls.\nSo unless you are in sort of a binary puzzle element keep your thumb away from the analogue stick.\nThe Seer only grabs boxes when grabbing after running into the box. Since the grab button is not used for something else I'd rather have it also grab when pressing the button first then running into the box.\nThe double-horns, i.e. phonetic redirectors, have inconsistent turn mechanics. Depending on the Seer's position relative to a horn pressing, for example, left will turn the horn clockwise or counter-clockwise. It's the same rotation for standing left and right of the horn but the other one for standing above or below. Turning horns felt somewhat sticky, i.e. I often turned the horn involuntarily when I actually wanted to walk away.\nI encountered only two or three invisible walls but a lot more invisible edge, i.e. obstacles where the Seer wouldn't move on without any visual representation. This may be connected to the movement not quite fitting the view.\nCutscenes are unskippable which might be just acceptable for the first time around but is irritating when repeated. There is not a lot of cutscenes, so that's not too much of a problem.\nThe scream ability sometimes doesn't make it across switches.\n\nDespite the above, See No Evil is a good game and I recommend it for people who look for the next puzzler. I might come back and see if I can get the broken achievements.","September 4, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
