Now replaced with fluff and filler, the complex tutorials and drawn-out narratives that take the place of what could be great gameplay. Shadow Blade follows in the spirit of the aforementioned hacknslash titles with it's to-the-point levels and their memorable designs.\n\nShadow Blade: Reload is a speed runner's paradise, through and through.\n\nIt includes all of the usual markings you'd expect from a solid action game from it's straight-forward yet deceptive level designs, to the quick arcade-like combat and addictive score chasing incentives. Your initial runs will be easy but they will be sloppy, and as you play you'll discover tricks and shortcuts that make conquering your past efforts a serious treat. The levels come in bite-sized pieced which keep the pace perfect and easy to jump into again and again to tackle your previous scores.\n\nWith 60 levels and counting set across 4 differently themed stages and a wealth of modes like easy and robust level-editor and a multiplayer Race mode for up to 4-players that brings Speed Runners style competition, this is already showing some serious potential in it's Early Access state as it continues to receive updates.\n\nIt's also received a hefty amount of changes and polishes to the combat since it's highly acclaimed mobile origins, most importantly the layer of depth and strategy added by Shurikens for well planned ranged shots, effecting how you approach each situation. With the addition of new levels, more secrets, more exploration and features, it's easily worth it even for those who have played the hell out of the original version.\n\nSeemingly simple first glance, Shadow Blade really begins to shine as the player revisits past stages and begins to explore it's possibilities for a faster run. There are loads of hard to spot tricks and little shortcuts that will cut down on your time, and going back to discover them and besting your previous scores just feels really good. All in all, this is the kind of game that should be played from the perspective of a speed runner to be enjoyed to it's full extent.\n\nShadow Blade: Reload hits the spot and keeps you coming back for more long after you've overcome the obstacles of it's many cunning levels.","July 23, 2014","true","23.0"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","6"

It’s fast, fun and often requires quick thinking. There are a ton of levels and a bunch of unique mechanics that can really be challenging at times. I particularly liked how upping the difficulty morphs the level – giving it harder paths, adding more traps, but it still has the same general layout. The controls feel responsive, the animations are nice and the music and sound effects are pretty cool too.\n\nThere’s even a degree of replayability, as you can always go back and try and beat your best scores on levels you’ve already completed, and if the devs end up adding leaderboards like they are planning to it will only add to that. Also, this is one of the few games that actually has a level editor. As it stands though, the editor is quite basic so could definitely do with a bit more stuff in it (I will update this bit if it changes upon the games release). Anyway, I’ve had a ton of fun with this and would definitely recommend it to anyone who’s into the Side-Scrolling Action-Platformer type genre.\n\nIf you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here’s a link to a 2 minute one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0kkWUeCaU\n\nAnd if you’re looking for a more in depth look at the game, here’s a link to an approximately 15 minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3f5vMNHC98\n","July 21, 2014","true","5.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

There is also a level editor which is quite basic currently, but I imagine will be touched upon as the game updates.  The controls are perfect, favoring speedy executions, air dashing and my favorite wall jumping approach in any game I've played.  I highly recommend it if you're into pushing yourself through speed running or if you enjoy a good platformer.\n\nOn top of this, the developers keep updating their game, fixing issues that happened to slip through the cracks of developing a game.

You never get bored or feel like you are playing the same level again and again. Which is a good thing!\nThere are several boss fight that have been set up using speed running mechanics. Adds even more variety to the gameplay.\nOverall, a very solid and pleasant experience if you are into the genre. Pulling off some tricky sequences can be extremely gratifying.\n\nOn the downside - still some minor glitches here and there, but the game is updated quite frequently and they are getting fixed pretty quick.\nAnd if you are not into the speed running genre, you are probably going to be bored pretty quickly.\n\nFor slightly more detailed look see the video below:\nhttp://youtu.be/DtoSexJWP5M","January 6, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Yeah Shadow Blade: Reload isn't one of those ninja games. As Kuro the black hooded ninja you carve a path of bloody rampage as you jump, slide, dash, and slash your way through a bunch of very short and pretty hard levels [but ultimately satisfying] in his quest to do stuff.\n\nYes that means no sneaking or whatsoever as you just run and avoid all the obstacles while raking up points for ratings and get to the end While playing through several themed world [that all share the same pool of enemy]. Anyways... review anyone?\n\nSoundYou get those little *squick* noises as you stab and slice into the enemy, some beeping and shooting noises, and grunts for the SFX which isnt too bad really.\n\nMusic only  serves as ambient noises but it never gets in the way until it forces you to mute it and put on some other tunes. In fact it's pretty relaxing listening to it as you restart over and over again dying.\n\nGraphicsIt's alright, nothing too fancy a little 3D here and there and at least the locale for the world changes for each of them. A shame the enemies don't even have a palette swap but hey I argue for gameplay purposes you want to be able to tell the enemy at a glance. Overall it's fine.\n\nControls, Optimization, Option MenuThe game ran at 60 fps nearly all the time but there are dips here and there especially when part of the scenery contains an outdoor tile, those usually run my fps down by 20-25 down to 40. Testing with an Intel HD4000 yields playable framerate although dippings are far more noticeable with it.\n\nOption menu is lacking to say the least, you get some audio options, SOME graphical options with some of them might help with your FPS if you're having issues such as resolution, AA, some other things. Overall it could be better but at least it does give you some leeway.\n\nControls, to preface I did not play the game at all the keyboard, sure you can rebind but god help me because this is a platformer game so you pretty much would want a controller for those precise controls, not that you can't play with a keyboard of course especially if you prefer it that way. At least the keys are rebindable. For controllers you might encounter a weird issue where the button on screen don't correspond to the buttons you actually need to press. But the controllers input are pretty solid other than the ledge grab being a bit too sticky at times.\n\nGameplayIs pretty simplistic as far as platformer games go. There's no upgrade, no new weapon unlocks and all those other stuff. Instead immediately following the tutorial you get all the tools you need to pretty much finish the whole game with.\n\nYou have the dash, the jump, the double the jump, the sword, the shuriken and pretty much that is it. Kuro only has 1 life and if you get hit or anything you will have to restart back at the checkpoint with a point penalties.\n\nLevels have you using all of these arsenals of yours to get from point A to point B without dying [too much] and along the way clicking buttons, stepping on pressure plates, dodging spikes in this improbable landscape architecture. Strewed throughout the levels in hard to reach places are kanji letters [that is Japanese letters for you folks] and orbs that gives a boost to your score. These serves no purpose besides grading you so if you prefer to just immediately run to the exit like what I did you are free to do that. Although the D can be a bit insulting. Replaying the level in higher difficulty not only changes enemy amount and placement but also adds more traps to the levels!\n\nEnemies come in a few easily discernable form with some of them being immune to only a specific types of attack while others are pretty free kill. The homing enemy however can get a bit annoying since the homing capability they have on them last a while and they lock on hard to you. But once you do get to know all these fine gents you can easily counter them even when they come in packs of 2 and 3.\n\nLevels come in 7 worlds with each world having between 5-7 levels each.\n\nOverall that's how the game plays, get to the end of the level, kill enemies, collect points, and not die.\n\nConclusionConclusion? I like this game a bit. The story wraps up nicely while using pretty cool looking comic artstyles for the presentation and at least it's coherent and has an ending that ties everything up. The controls are tight and there's hardly any bugs for the times I played it and for $15 for a 2-3 hours worth of entertainment of slicing and dashing you decide whether its worth for you. Hey if you're a cheapo you can always get it on sale.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: B-Rank [A pretty nice short game.]\n\nHere at Just Review\nWe Just Review Games~\n[God that was lame, feel free to follow us!]\nNo drama, Just Reviews","February 26","true","2.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","4"

Were it not for the listing on Steam or their logo in the intro, you'd have no idea that the same studio that made Garshasp made this game- the margin in quality is that vast.\n\nShadowblade: Reload is an action platformer with an emphasis on fast-relexes based around the small, yet versatile toolset the game gives you. Double-jumps, air-dashes, and LOTS of wall-jumping are the name of the day here. So there isn't a whole lot of variety in the actions you can perform- but the game is aware of this and thus enforces the need for a good handle on the nuances of these mechanics for players who want good stage-times or all the collectables. The controls generally do a decent job of allowing you to keep up with the pace of the game- though unfortunately they aren't perfect, occasionally glitching out and causing a cheap death here and there.\n\nThere is also combat in the game- though it is much weaker than the platforming. Most enemies can be easily killed by just throwing shurikens at them or performing your sword attacks in time while charging at them. Now this doesn't work on all enemies- the larger enemy types tend to require more specific methods to be dispatched... In theory. That is until you realize that ALL of them- except for a single enemy type- are insta-killed by your aerial drop attack. Even without that knowledge- there really isn't much to the combat at all, making the combat arenas the game occasionally throws at you the most boring parts of the game. The surprising contrary to that are the few boss battles in the game- all of which are actually pretty decent.\n\nAt least the animations for the combat are quite good as well- that's its main redeeming factor. In fact, Shadow Blade's graphics are quite solid overall for the most part. It runs well at a solid clip without losing a step and- again- has some pretty good animation for everything going on. The glitchy ragdoll physics and poorly done shadow effects are the main weak points. (I advise you leave shadows off in the options menu, they just don't add much and don't look good at all.)\n\nIt should be noted that the game can glitch out in ways that force level restarts though. Bugs I ran into included getting stuck at the end of an enemy introduction cutscene, getting stuck in a ledge grab animation on specific ledge corners, and falling out of the level when standing on a sliding door. Nothing game-breaking, since full level restarts generally fix them, but still annoying when they come up.\n\nOverall a great pick for platformer fans. Especially for those who like them fast-paced and/or speed-run focused. Good value as well- with its campaign levels being playable on three difficulty levels and the game having a level editor with Steam Workshop compatibility.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Simple, yet versatile fast-paced platforming action\n\n- Solid controls\n\n- Well done graphics and animations\n\n- Surprisingly good boss fights (Though there's really only 3 of them)\n\n- Good amount of content: All of the game's main levels have at least slight alterations through three difficulty levels, and there's a level editor with Steam Workshop support\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Somewhat buggy in places.\n\n- The controls are generally on point- but occasionally glitch out as well\n\n- Overly simplistic combat and enemy types","October 13, 2015","true","6.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Why? Do you familiar with this sense of screwing the level pace just for a second delay? Then pausing the game and restarting level is what you will do a lot in Shadow Blade. Of course you can play through all levels easily if you neglect 2 Hidden Marks and collectibles scatter in levels and prefer casual approach but you know, who wants to be a casual Ninja? So you run, jump, dash, throw shurikens and mixture of those to whether overcome platforming challenges which is the core of the gameplay or bringing enemies down. At the current state game has 4 chapters each consisting 15 levels and if they're not enough, there's also a Masterclass and Hardcore Edition of each levels which some of them are ready now and others under development. You can also jump in Dojo Editor and creates the levels you want to play or maybe challenge your friends but unfortunately there's no possibility right now to share created levels via Steam Workshop, a feature we will be assure that will add just doing ASAP guys!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/recommended/272330/","bolm","Gänseblümchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/","593 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBelow you'll find a quick analytical video preview of ShadowBlade Reload in it's current Early Access form, and below that a review in written form, should you prefer text over video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyG-5luXhN0&list=UUft3ypJdQ_aiUT8h8_HzjYQ\nAsthetics: The graphical fidelity in itself is quite high, especially considering the roots of ShadowBlade as a mobile game. For me personally though, the chosen aesthetics seem very generic. Random muscular bad guys, spikes, lasers, chainsaw traps, etc etc. This chosen style does not intrigue me.\nSound design: The sound quality falls into the same vain as the aesthetics. Overall it is decent from what you would expect from an asian/ninja settings, but also not memorable.\nGameplay: Your aim is to reach the door at the end of each level. In between you can OPTIONALLY collect gold orbs, Kanjis, kill enemies, all while going as quickly as possible and without dying. If you get frustrated easily, you could just leave those pesky side objectives behind, or in case you are looking for a more difficult experience, you could always select the hardcore or masterclass levels, which throw a bunch more obstacles into your general direction, similarly to the dark levels in Super Meat Boy.\nI do have some gripes with the game though. First, as ShadowBlade does not have animation cancelling, you need a moment to get acustomed to this kind of delayed precision due to finishing animations. This is especially weird if you play a lot of platformers like Spelunky (or similar games that allow animation cancelling). I personally prefer 100% responsiveness over smooth animations at all times. This also ties in with the kill animations, which are seemingly random and differ in terms of timing a lot. As soon as the leaderboards are added into the game, differences like these could make or break runs easily and as such, speedrunning is highly influenced by randomness.\n\nTL;DR: Once acustomed to the control scheme (rebindable keyboard and controller both work fine), you get a platformer with a surprising amount of content already. Add ontop the level editor with Steam Workshop support, you'll get a good deal for your buck. Should you be looking for a new platformer to sink at least a couple of hours into, ShadowBlade Reload might be for you.","September 17, 2014","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Everything moves with beautiful fluidity.\n\nThe controls are spot on too, as stated above I had a problem with the controller but a reinstall sorted that out and now everything is fine.  I press jump, he jumps etc.\n\nAll in all this is a game I will actually come back to quite a lot, ESPECIALLY with the community designed levels from the level editor that comes bundled in the game, I can see this one lasting.","August 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a really good action platformer. Probably not one that'll revolutionize the genre but a solid and very enjoyable one none the less.

Your fast movement and attacks allow for fluid gameplay without the need to stop, not even to kill an enemy. Double jumping and dashing is a great way of traversing the diverse maps that are currently set in 4 different environments. At the moment there is a total of 60 normal levels, with more on the way. Each level features obstacles, such as traps or minions. Enemies can be dispersed by using your blades or the ever-so-useful shurikens.\n\nFull Review: http://www.crypticgames.com/main/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=28","July 22, 2014","true","13.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Levels flow pretty well, the platforming is interesting, and it's very quick.\n\nThat being said, Shadow Blade: Reload needs to decide whether or not it wants to be a platformer, or a more combat focused game. Drop assassination is the end-all-be-all of combat outside of the Iron Fist enemy which requires the even more succint dash attack. On top of that, the boss fights are not engaging at all, a lot of it is just waiting around for the boss to hit himself or destroy the wall to the next area - if you have this combat system, why not use it in boss fights where enemies can take more than one hit before going down??? In addition to this, you're going to get killed from off the screen a lot, from enemies with rifles, kamikaze bots, and especially homing rockets - honestly, homing rockets are alright in platformers but these last waaay too long. Following the vein of ranged enemies, Iron Fist, and the pink haired enemies have a ranged attack with next to no warning/indication of the direction they're going, why???\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game, it's entertaining, but I often have to set it down because it feels like the enemies in conjunction with the level design is just so random and stacked against me.","February 6","false","2.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Only big downfall I've found so far is lack of good controller support as it lacks support for the X360 controller which I own and only seem to work with the XONE controller out of the box.\n\nBecause of the weird controller support (the buttons to be pressed also differ from reality*), it's quite obvious that this game is actually a console port.\nNothing wrong with that though, but no mouse in the menus at least? Come on!\n\nAs for gameplay, I would actually recommend this game. It's easy to play and the enemies are easily killed in different manners too. But the things around it, kill the game itself a little bit.\nI also miss my mouse in the menu and I think it's kind of stupid to not support the X360 controller at all, although in the menus the controller seem to work?\n\nSo I actually can't recommend this game, nor can I advise to stay away from the game. The gameplay is good, but some things could've been done way better, making this game an easy port from the Xbox One (guessing due to controller support) version of the game.\n\nI will revise this review when I see this game has been updated and has better controller support, which is a gamebreaker for me. Kind of.\n\nAnd yes, if the controller support gets better (it can't be that hard to add X360 controller support when an XONE controller actually is supported), I will definitly recommend this game to others.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis is a nice game gameplay-wise and although it's an obvious console port, some things (like X360 controller support and mouse in the menus) definatly could've been done better.\nWill review my review when things will actually change; in the meantime, I set the recommendation to 'No', hoping the developer will notice the complaints and hopefully do something with it. It would be nice and much appreciated! Untill then, I'd advice to only buy this game when it's for sale or available for cheap somewhere.\n\n* Compared to X360 controller buttons, at least.","February 13","false","0.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I get the feeling the developer wanted to make a really good platformer, but didn't really know how to go about doing that.\n\nFor one, let's look at the basic mechanics. You have a double jump because every game does now. You have a wall jump because every game does now. You have a dash because every game does now. Except these mechanics... don't quite work that well. The double jump is mostly fine save for instances where I ended up jumping the wrong direction (ghosting keyboard may be the cause of this though) but the wall jump is... a thing, it's really easy to detach from the wall instead of wall jumping, which is weird because the walls are also really sticky in this game to the point of annoyance. And then the dash, while fine in itself, doesn't let you perform any jumps after it, which is a massive limitation to the potential of platforming in this game and a baffling design decision.\n\nThe combat is really the biggest mechanic issue in this game. Aside from one type of enemy, the downward stab is an end-all in combat. In fact, it's so painful to try and use the combat system normally that I barely did unless absolutely necessary. The goal is always to one-shot enemies, trying to fight with multiple hits never works out well and usually gets you stuck in an enemy's annoyingly long parry animation, which will likely get you killed if any other enemy is in the room. The combat animations are also annoyingly long, though. Even the downward stab takes a bit longer than it really needs to, and the side-attacks are... well. Okay. Am I missing something or does it just randomly choose a different animation for every attack? There's one quick one where you barrel through an enemy, a slower one where you jump over them, an even slower one where you use some grappling thing to pull them towards you, and I feel like there was a fourth one but I'm not sure. But anyways. I can't tell why there's any difference in the animation length, especially because the longer ones will get you killed, often.\n\nAnd then there's the enemy types. A few of them I really dislike; for one, HOMING MISSILES IN A PLATFORMER ARE ALWAYS BAD. Always. Without exception. This game is not the exception. They're actually especially bad here, the homing is way too strong, they stay around too long, and move too fast. Even worse when there are multiple at once, you're basically already dead at that point. And then, the kamikaze bots. You have one shot to shruiken them before they, most likely, kill you instead. And they move fast. And they attack you from far away. Sure, they're only prevalent in one of the worlds, but that world is probably the absolute worst because of them. The iron fist enemies are also annoying because the only way to kill them is side-attacks, and I had an instance where it refused to give me the tell-tale shine you need to perform a side-attack, causing me to basically become stuck in a level for a few minutes. Until...\n\n...the glitches. Oy vey. Have you ever wanted to randomly phase through a wall simply by jumping against it? Because it's likely to happen. I also had an enemy push me down into the ground once, which is a -special- kind of awful. Aside from that, there are plenty of instances of my downstab outright not working, going right through the enemy, or getting me actually stuck in the ground and unable to move (thus dying to an enemy soon after). It's just impressive how much of this game fails to work on a functional level.\n\nThe level design is a mixed bag. Sometimes it works well, sometimes not so well. There are a lot of instances of offscreen enemies (usually the homing missile shooters) just killing you before you have time to react, and a lot of blind jumps or leaps of faith. There's also some confusing nonlinear levels where you have to go around an awkward maze of tunnels to collect everything. A few instances of awkwardly precise jumps, as well; this game isn't really based around precision and it never really feels like you have much in the controls department. There's a decent sense of flow to some levels, but many others lack that smoothness, and the experience in general leaves me feeling a bit dissatisfied. Even on the highest difficulty, the game is never that hard, and the difficulty levels do at least change up the level design somewhat, but rarely in a significant way, so it just feels like I'm playing the same levels again and again.\n\nOh, and, the bosses are all crap. Total garbage. First boss isn't really a boss, you just run a bit then have it blow up a wall. The second boss can be cheesed but is really obnoxious if you don't cheese him because he spams homing missiles. Third boss is a complete joke where the only challenge comes from trying to get him in the right position. Final boss is probably the worst, an RNG-fest where you're never given enough time to attack him effectively and he can just spam this shield attack that just drags out the fight.\n\nThe presentation of this game is fairly nice, though. There's a lot of detail in the backgrounds and each world feels unique even with the same black-rectangle style throughout, and the music's alright as well. Story's nothing special but the comic book style it's presented in is fairly nice.\n\nOverall though this game just left me disappointed, it's not a horrible game and if a "meh" option existed it'd probably get that, but I can't really recommend this when there are better 2D platformers out there for the same price or less.","January 26","false","11.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Everybody enjoyed his pencil until the evil banjo set been set el senior ate his pencil and he had to go on yet another quest to find it. When he got to the tortes yellow tree he found a long haired beast ( George Marsh) When he found out the marsh wouldn’t let home past. So he gave another pencil to his son john pier. All was well in joshing ton land until Alabama sit Bryn set alabmington ......El senior donkey gave HIM THE KEYS TO AN UNDERGROUND CITY CALLED LABAMA TOWN. Once there he gave a small nod at the dude ate front for and went into the deep dark brutal hairy slimy fuggy stinking yellow hole.\n\nBen finch st salaam town have him a another small nod to eat his pencil. Andrew the man didn’t know what to do until he found another town called Aaron best is the best and we will all say kook for you when he finds a way to eat all of it town. His pencil was getting tired, he had worked all day and had nobody to work for. His family was almost owned/pawned and he had to give his only bottle of water to untrue who gave another small nod at da fainting. WHEN ALL HOPE WAS LOST.\n\nHe gave another step up to the top when al hope was lost. Everybody gave up on all of it. He went into the cave and acted it all sizzle. Patterns are so important when the pencil eats all of the stuff. When the 2 boys ate everything that was important to them that entered Nathan sty pencil sat Nathan untrucington in de club while eating everything the wanted club. The club was very bright so they had to put there best glasses on. Untraced gave another pencil to him while having a cow inside of him.\n\nAfter the cows ate skin they spotted an amazing time trying to find how all da peoplez were made. Ian coke found a huge pencil with his ability to eat shake c`s. Everybody enjoyed shake c because it has many qualitys that are interesting to watch. Just as untraced came into the cave they noticed that he was getting interested in everything that is penilated. So he sent in his pet ♥♥♥♥♥♥c ( ian Coke) to investigate. Ian wandered through the lonely cave when he spotted another huge beast but this one was even more exhilarating than the last. This one didn’t have long hair. So it only needed to be shot in the head. But Andrew decided that it was to late for that as it would not let him as it wouldn’t let him in da club. Da club was very interesting to see as when you danced to da club it said hello sair and all went well after that. Untruce was also get quite inpoatint at it wad in club. He found out that I wouldn’t eat bryn bistics tulms.\n\nJames was watching alazbama town when he spotted bryns skin nocking at the door. Just then james started to shout….and shout…. And…Whisper (joking that would never happen) then he was getting moaned at for masturbalington in front of an ♥♥♥ ( Dinkey st alazmaba). Everything was getting feisty when everything was so feisty. James then started to get pwned/owned. Then an old man started waljin bytyhen james whisperd aye allrite boi. Naa cba said james I don’t want any alijiin brynrhen today.\n\n\nAndy cameToA smallHospital, Inside there wuz a few people that he didn’t like the look of. A guy with beard, a black guy , women in pink shiz and a biker. Iain then appeared with nothing more than the small little dreesssing gound that twas nothing more than a lttle bic of chayse. He then came beforth ontruse with a quest for him. Go fowth and destroy bing, the last of his race. Iain accepted the challenge and went forwth to find the bing and break him. But Arnold has other plans instore. When he found out that iain was going to kill bing, he sent his trustworthy guard sir sethathine to kill bing before iain. This wasn’t going to end well for the bing either way.\n\nIain climbed onto his trusty flying urine and galloped away.","July 17, 2014","true","0.9"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RabbitSenseiGaming/recommended/272330/","RabbitSenseiGaming","Rabbit Sensei Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RabbitSenseiGaming/","30 products in account","This game right here, is...Okay.\n\nThe idea behind the speed platforming gameplay is a good one, and will keep you entertained for a few hours. And, it does have a challenge mode, giving you a few extra stages to play, once you're tired of the story mode. However, this is all the game has going for it. As, the longer I played, the more problems with the game I spotted.\n\nFor a game centering itself around speed platforming (with a little bit of action), the controls can feel quite wonky, causing you to do one thing, when you mean to do another. This is irritating to the player, yes. But, what's worse is the fact that the game is full of game-breaking glitches, that ruin the fun for any person playing the game.\n\nThe two glitches I found myself running into the most were the following:\n\n1 - Passing through a solid wall, and out of the map, while trying to wall-jump.\n2 - Being frozen in my attack animation, after performing a downward strike on an opponent. That could only be solved by dying, or RESETTING THE ENTIRE GAME.\n\nThese two kinds of glitches are damning to any game. Despite how fun it can be, when it actually does work. And, for them to be in a full release, that isn't eary access, or even getting patched anytime soon...That's just inexcuseable. As is the "level creator" that is in the game. For, not only does it not work at certain resolutions, but it's ability to create is pitiful. As you have so few creation aspects, that there's no way in hell to make anything that you'd want to make in this title.\n\nLong story short: "This game does deliver some fun, but you'll be tossing it aside after about an hour or two, due to all the glitches. Plus the false advertising of a 'level creator' that doesn't even work."\n\nTrust me folks, save your money, and spend it on something else you've been wanting.\nUnless this game is on sale for $1, do not buy it.\n\nFinal Score: 4/10","October 1, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/truner/recommended/272330/","truner","Truner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/truner/","188 products in account","I stumbled across Shadow Blade: Reload randomly before it was even out. Already looking quite cool, I noticed that Shadow Blade was on iOS, so I bought it. It had me so hooked, I instantly bought the Android version and simul-played it using Bluestacks. Later on, I completed both of them once again on newer hardware, and even the free version of the game called Shadow Blade Zero (Android). Bought this Steam release in early access and then bought it again on iOS and have 100% completed both. But why?\n\nThis game is kind of like the love child of Strider 2 and Shinobi 3D. It's fast paced, focuses on platforming and minimal effort put into actual combat (you are required to end enemies ASAP). All of it is done extremely well, from the well made level design to the careful enemy placement. Everything just clicks.\n\nIt also controls like a charm. Kuro is easy to handle, he can double jump, dash in air, use several different ways to attack, wall kicks when needed and puts many other ninja video game characters to shame.\n\nThe music is catchy, but nothing to write home about. Ever now and then I catch myself humming some of the better tracks, but it could be better.\n\nThe game is not perfect, every version of it (even the originals) has collision problems, stuff ending rather abruptly, enemies glitching up or spawning at incorrect places. Sometimes it can get frustrating. I don't care.\n\nI don't care because I REALLY, REALLY loved this game. There's no perfect video game but as long as most of the game clicks together as in Shadow Blade: Reload, I will enjoy it. Can I recommend it? Hell yeah, it's easily one of the best ninja games out there and if you like those, or are into retro games, this will surely satisfy your needs.\n\nIt will last a while too. The game has three difficulty modes all with altered level designs and enemy placements, a challenge mode that offered some of the best thrills I've experienced in recent years (gaming-wise) and even a stage creation tool that also has the ability to upload it to the masses easily.\n\nI get it, this isn't really a review and it certainly doesn't help that I'm raving over this game. But look at that trailer. If you think the game looks cool even just a little bit, you should probably buy it. I doubt it'll disappoint.\n\nStill, I feel like this game was made for me. I have no other way to explain why I love it so much. It just clicks with me. Thanks for the awesome work, devs.","April 17","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
