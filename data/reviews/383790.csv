Although, it is limited to 4 players, which brings me to my first problem.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TssQgFAIIyU\nThe game at the moment of writing this review, is a bit limited. You can't add bots, and online play only allows for 4 players, so you can't really get the true The Ship experience unless you play LAN, which allows for 16 players.\n\nWith that said, the game itself is great. The graphics look gorgeous, and there are 4 diverse enough maps at the moment, with more to be released down the road.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of Early Access, but the Devs are being transparent, and even have a roadmap on their website detailing features that have already been implemented, and some that are planned. This gives me a bit more faith. Also, this is a remake of a great game, so you know that the main gameplay mechanics will be good.\n\nSpeaking of which, all the things you need to actually play a real game of the Ship are implemented. There's a security system where you can get caught, as well as a system that shows you who your target is, and where they are. The only problem I have at the moment is just the fact that I can't easily play it until they allow for more players per online match, as I, like many others, don't have access to a 16 player LAN group.\n\nThe game needs quite a decent bit of optimization as well, as it doesn't run as well as it should be.\n\nDespite some missing features, I'm going to be giving a positive recommendation due to the fact that the progress so far seems promising. The devs show that they are listening to consumers, as they chose to push back the release date once because of people that shared my concerns with the game's previous lack of features.\n\nTheir transparency with updates also gives me faith. Most importantly, the original The Ship was a great game, so they can only really build upon that great gameplay. If you don't feel comfortable buying the game in its current state, definitely support it in the coming weeks when they add even more features!","February 22","true","0.8"," 78 of 108 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","78","108","5","4"

Well it sertainly gave this game some life. I really enjoy rhis game. I did see some minor improvements just like they said they were going to be adding. Now I want to go over some Pros and Cons for this game I have experienced for playing this game the first time. Also I did play the original so I know. for this stage in early access here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1 incredible Badass Graphics.\n2 New minor updates that bring new life to the game\n3 overall a lot of fun to play.\n\nCons:\n1 Bugs and frame lag\n2 Limited Features (Will get fixed soon)\n3 Glitches with interface when playing the game\n4 More Bugs\n5 Sometimes when you die your screen goes completely black and it does not want you to exit the game\n\nAnyway these are some of the pros and cons I got for the game at this current stage? So is it worth buying it at this stage? Well when you get it for a deal like I got it for 40% off and you can get it for 15% go ahead and do it. The game will improve and I can't wait to see what happens when it leaves Early Access. If you have to pay 20 bucks I would wait a couple more weeks to see if anything has improved unless you want it that badly. Great game 9.5/10 Would play again.\n","February 22","true","5.2"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","41","54","2","0"

The graphics are very comparable to the Xbox 360 version of Bioshock Infinite. The weapon handling is pretty smooth, cameras seem to work better, and the AI is pretty good, although I think the AI could be harder. Also, you can see your legs, which is nice.\n\n\nIt's still in alpha but if you have $15 laying around, pick it up on sale. The atmosphere and core concept are unique, and the Art Deco designed ships are easy on the eyes and fun to play on.\n\n\nWhat Blazing Griffin can improve on or add besides what they're already wokring on:\n-more difficult AI, whether it be raising their movement speed, accuracy, ability to avoid cameras, whatever, just make them better at finding and eliminating their targets, even if the target is you or me.\n-always room for more weapons\n-maybe a 'hardcore' mode limited to the smaller maps where you have no hud and no hint as to where your quarry is.\n-ability to drop bundles of money, say $500 or $1000 to bait players into going into dangerous zones\n-do a free weekend to drum up business and build playerbase\n-4 pack with bundle pricing, or raise the price to $25-$30 but do like the old game did and get a gift to give to a friend so they can play too, this way you'd sell more copies, albeit at a discount, via bundling. The minimum order would be 2 copies but the effective price per copy would remain at $12-$15.\n","April 20","true","0.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","1"

The game of course has some flaws, being in early access is all. I feel like there is a lack of certain weapons that add to the fun and variety of the original game. I know, however, that they are still adding in new weapons, so it is likely that this review itself will be dated within a few weeks. But onto the point once again, if you're a fan of the old The Ship, then it might be worth it just to buy this new game for the updated graphics and engine. And if maybe you needed a little something more from the original The Ship, then this game might interest you too, as there are plenty of seperate game modes being made. The game had a 15% discount at launch, and if you own The Ship: Murder Party, then another 25% stacks on, making the game 40% off at time of purchase, so it's definitely worth the purchase.","February 22","true","0.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I mean, there's not a lot more to say. For those who eat trash for a living and snorted too much cardboard dust to know what The Ship is, it was one of the funnest multiplayer experiences around, in which instead of focusing on any sort of generic deathmatch mode the game was based around hunting and killing one other player on the boat while avoiding your own hunter, with a variety of weapons that are worth different values of money. If that sounds more familiar then it's only natural because you probably recognize it as the Assassin's Creed multiplayer, because after commissioning the Ship developers to develop an awful XBOX Live Arcade spinoff called Bloody Good Time, Ubisoft quickly sprung on the opportunity to let Outerlight go out of business right before the game's release, nab the profits, and promptly steal their idea for use in their recycling-friendly assassin franchise.\n\nBut aside from all that, it is worth noting that the game is in very early access. It's lacking a fair amount of maps, and the online multiplayer isn't fully functional just yet. But the developers are showing promising work on it, so it will at the very least be worth buying fairly soon. If you have a group of friends and someone who can host a server the original The Ship still works fine, but if you're looking for a game that you can just pick up and join a server then Remasted is the way to do it.","February 22","true","0.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

So far, the game is in Early Access - so you MUST definitely, absolutely, clearly understand that the game is going to have bugs at this time. Too many people seem to misunderstand this with many games that are in Early Access.\n\nBut onto my review - as a huge fan of The Ship ever since the first free HL1 mod, it's been fantastic to see how well the game has been developed throughout the years with all the new changes, new gamemodes, and now - a whole new engine! Whilst the game has had its ownership transferred through multiple companies (along with some developers joining said transfer) the game still has its incredible style you would come to expect from the game's series.\n\nAt the game's current state, it's mostly just eye-candy. It's playable, that's for sure - but it's still going to have the odd bug here and there that could possibly be game-breaking, but that's the fun in Early Access (which, again, a lot of people seem to misunderstand). I don't recommend this if you don't want to help with its developerment, but I definitely recommend it if your most interest is to be a part of a developing game and possibly have your idea/help introduced in a game!\n\nOverall, an extremely beautiful game and really nice to be a part of, albeit not necessarily playable just yet, but still really fun to play when you manage to find the people and/or don't mind the occasional bug!","May 11","true","6.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

Its a simple game but can be really fun to play alone or with your friends\n\nThe Ship: Murder Party has always been by my heart and I appreciate that a company like Blazing Griffin has taken the rights from the now defunct Outerlight and continued to perfect the game\n\nThe big choice is whether you should get it or not. In it's current state I'd say no don't get it. It's unfinished, doesn't have all the mechanics The Ship had and is constantly being updated.

If you are thinking this is a completely new game you will be a bit disappointed. It's a newer version of the older game, it has been updated and revamped completely, while still keeping the old charm that made it so unique and fun! Yes the game is in Early Access, so there will be bugs, but the game is still a blast to play, and of course more fun with your friends!

Right now this game is early alpha. Realy.\nBut... You can already see a lot of progress!\n\nWhat looks better than original Ship?\n- Ships(actually graphics) look wonderful, better than original ones(although i do love original ones as well)\n- Wow, new better animations? (no objects though, but ofc we will see them in next updates)\n- EVERYTHING is in the same spot. Like cookies at the coffee bar(I checked)\n- This thing is playable! (I advise you to arrange plays with someone on steam forums)\n- Since this game is a remake it has(or will have in updates) all the nice stuff from original Ship\n\nAlmost unnoticeable change: People now take shower not nude and covered by leaves, now they do it in underwear. Bring back the leaves!\n\nIf you don`t know what to expect, try original Ship.

I hoped to be able to use the maps and models in Source Filmmaker after playing some games. But alas, the devs switched over to *shudders* Unity, instead of sticking with the Source Engine again... I would've been more satisfied if the game had at least been made in Source, but it wasn't.\n\nAlso, while it seems that it might be good when all is said and done, I still prefer the original game more. Don't waste your money just yet until it's a bit more fleshed out.\n\nGameplay is okay, but it is a bit boring at the moment.

It looks almost the same as the original, but with fewer features and worse optimization. (I suspect this is because of the unity engine that some genius decided to use) I do realize this is early access and if you're looking to support the devs then sure go right ahead. But if you are looking to get some good gameplay i would def. go for the old one over this.","March 7","false","9.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Game is unplayably "laggy" even at a ping of 33. Still worthless. http://steamcharts.com/app/383790\n\nAnother update! 13/05/2016. Some servers are now reporting bots as humans skewing stats. Still pretty much no-one playing. However, the lag doesn't seem so bad today.\n\nOriginal review :\n\nUnless you convince your friends to also pick up this game, and play it over LAN, don't bother. There's essentially no matchmaking and the single player (against bots) is painfuly dull. It's surprisingly that there's no matchmaking, given that even the 3 man team for the 1.99 game Dino Horde managed it for early access.\n\nAt the time of writing no-one is playing the game, compared to 30 currently online playing the original Murder Party.\n\nThere's just no way I could pitch the game to friends ethically.\n\nAsside from this multiplayer game lacking any real multiplayer, No real work has gone gone into improving the character models or animations. Most of the visual improvements are from adding modern environment shaders. It is NOT the pretty game people are claiming.\n\nDon't bother yet. Even on sale. Wait for matchmaking to be released.\n\nNote : As long as you don't play more than 2Hrs of a game, you can get a refund from Steam.\n\nBeware underhand marketing efforts to downvote bad reviews and upvote the good.","May 9","false","1.5"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","0"

I'd say this game will be worth playing but I'd wait until it was in a more finished state. I have to give it to the devs though. They listen to their fans more than any others I can think of. Unfortunately in its current state playing The Ship: Murder Party is more enjoyable. If you want to support the development of the game buy it, but if you expect a finished product you will be disappointed and for that reason I wouldn't recommend it in its current state.","April 19","false","0.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

This is one of the games where I really wish there was a 'maybe' button. I've played The Ship: Murder Party and that was really fun, but at the moment the Remastered or 'Remasted' ,as BlazingGriffin have named it, is quite buggy. Of course, such bugs and limitations are to be expected as the game is still in Alpha. Seriously, I WANT the game to work out so I can murder my friends , then come home, relax and play The Ship: Remasted, but the game doesn't feel finished AT THE MOMENT. For example, if you hate the maps Andrea Doria, Atlanta, Batavier and Krassin, you're not going to have a very fun Alpha. Plus, I lag in the game quite a bit, even on the lowest graphic settings. My computer is an old piece of crap these days, but it can still run most games pretty smoothly with the graphics still looking good. Hell, there was no lag when I was killing zombies in The Walking Dead (go buy that game, too. WARNING: review may contain product placement) but when I'm wandering around a ship following people and slowly hitting them with some weapon, I get lag.\n\nThis game is about murdering people on a ship","February 27","false","2.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

However, though my computer matches the specs mentioned, the game is VERY laggy for me. It's a good start, but at the moment your best bet is to stick with The Ship (not remasted). Some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Excellent graphics\n-Bots act less like bots (more intelligent movements)\n-Easier multiplayer (though I would not reccomend multiplayer at the moment)\n-Developers seem eager to satisfy the gamers, so I feel the game will improve.\n\nCons:\n-Characters (bartender, bellboy, etc) look creepy (very very VERY blue eyes)\n-Graphics too good (as mentioned above, lags for me)\n-FOV seems bigger, so it takes getting used to\n-Mouse sensitivity makes FOV seem even bigger than it is, so it takes getting used to\n-Elevators are broken. Literally. It says out of service.\n-Ships like Andrea Doria seem abandoned. It's a lot darker and the pool and elevators are "Out of Service". The Ship (not remasted) seemed more alive, kind of like the roaring 20's. I just don't think they represent the same time period.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good start. But I don't think it's worth the money and I don't think it's quite ready. As I mentioned above, the developers seem eager to improve the game, but for 19.99, it's quite a risk.","May 11","false","0.9"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","9","31","2","1"
