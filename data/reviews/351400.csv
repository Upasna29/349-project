"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/351400/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","I would like to think I went into this game with low expectations, but I still came away disappointed.\n\nThis is a basic defence game where you defend against wave after wave of enemy that is coming your way. Every 3 or so waves you go to an unexplained shop screen where you can upgrade your character, equipment, spells and stationary defences using the gold you acquired for getting rid of your enemies. Every 10 waves you fight a large boss, culminating into a large final boss at wave 50.\n\nMy problem with the game, or main problem I guess, is that it is very unforgiving about how you spend your gold. With only finite amounts available every shopping round, no way to replay waves to grind for gold and no progress carried over between games (you always start from scratch with a fresh character) a misclick money on Intelligence even though you were going for a melee run can ruin your run. Or, rather than a misclick, just trying a new approach where you save up for some stationary defences for example. Or finding yourself stuck at a boss because it is out of range of the weapons you invested in.\n\nCombine that with rather vague explanations about what every upgrade does, unimpressive graphics, no real story and weirdly floaty jumping and the game just kind of breaks down to a tedium.\nIf you plan to go in with low expectations, lower them some more. Or better yet, maybe just don't.","September 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

I only played the normal difficulty - but the game seemed like a breeze until the final 2-3 stages where all of a sudden the difficulty spikes to a point where it seems there simply hasn't been enough playtesting.\n\nIt's a great concept and the devs have done a good job implementing it for a nice little indie game.  My suggestion is to check out the forums and see what the players are saying before purchasing.","May 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

It's just challenging enough, the shop system is great and there's many ways you can build your character. You have skills like leap, slam, fireball, lightning chain... You can mix both magic and melee and it is actually works pretty well!\n\nYou also have some melee skills which are based on strength and agility, so you can stay pure melee and still be very efficient. The best part is that you can build a castle if you want to! There's only one tower type, but you can stack them on top of each other or put many of them next to each others, then you can put troops on them to defeat ennemies for you! You can also put stairs and get up on your tower to shoot enemies from afar if that's your playstyle.\n\nPros:\n\n-Addicting.\n-Fun.\n-Great shop system.\n-Great balance.\n-Local multiplayer.\n\nCons:\n\n-Always the same waves, but there's 3 levels of difficulty and bosses gains more abilities in harder ones.\n-All 3 game modes takes about 5 hours to finish total.\n-Basic graphics.","April 17, 2015","true","6.2"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/351400/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","The Defenders: The Second Wave is a 2D action game where you have to survive fifty waves of enemies by whatever means necessary. You start off with a small staff that you use to whack ghosts but every third wave you are given the chance to purchase skills, equipment and even build tiny castles with AI controlled to defend you. The friendly AI is stationary and has an attack radius of when it can attack enemies so they work more like sentries than companions. They will need to be placed on castles and can not be placed on normal ground. A castle sounds very useful but remember you are fighting against ghosts so they will just effortlessly move through your walls. All this is purchased with money that you receive by defeating ghosts and are given some every 5 rounds.\n\nStarting off you will notice how boring melee combats is. All you do is wait for a ghost to approach you, whack him and he is pushed away a bit then its right back to attacking you. It mostly gets boring due to the AI. Enemies are programmed to rush right at you so it just becomes a game of trying to whack floating giant pinatas to get the gold inside. It does become more interesting when you build a wizard character as you have to keep track of your mana instead of just mashing the attack key. Oddly enough even if you are not a wizard your abilities like a simple charged attack takes up mana so you may need to spend money on intelligence if you want to use them effectively. For some reason a healing spell requires a lot of strength which makes no sense as character with a lot of strength has more health and regains it much more quickly than a fragile wizard that desperately needs it.\n\nThe game has up to four player local coop and it does feel like a game built around coop. You have to be very careful how you build your character if you are playing solo. It is most noticeable when you are being attacked by both sides and have no way to defend your back. Your best defense is a good offense as destroying them before they reach you is the only way to avoid damage. That does make playing a pure wizard in solo much harder as you will be pretty screwed if you run out of mana and have to wait for it to recharge. Some way to dodge the enemy like the Warrior's “brutal leap” ability is needed. Stats themselves are very important. You have to be aware of  of things like weight limit and speed when buying weapons and armor, so that makes it feel like more than just a simple upgrade and makes buidling your character pretty fun.\n\nThere are 12 medals to unlock which will let you purchase special items. They range from beating the game on hard to something weird like killing a dozen butterflies or attacking the moon. If you die you will start off again right after your last boss fight so that means a checkpoint every 10 waves. Even if you start the game over you will be able to start in wave 40 with a basic character but all the money you would have made if you actually played through all the levels. That is a pretty cool way of testing character builds. One thing that really annoys me is that every time you start a third wave to shop the screen immediately pops so you don't have time to reach any of the money on the floor even if it is right in front of you. They should have at least made it so that all the money is automatically added to your character or at the very least give you a short timer to collect the money before shopping.\n\nSome of the enemies are very annoying as well like the zombie hands that frequently pop out of the ground that will stop you dead in your tracks. Like the rest of the enemies you will not be able to dodge it as it pops up very quickly, so you will be attacking the floor when all is calm just to kill it before it can spawn. There is so much mindless clicking involved that you'd think this was a clicker genre game. The bosses are pretty huge and each are very different from another but most of their attacks are undodgeable making it a pain for wizard characters. If you are playing on easy the final boss will be a huge disappointment though. There are three difficulties which are Easy, Normal and Hard. I was barely able to beat it on easy with a wizard character yet was able to easily breeze through normal as a warrior. Moral of the story being do not expect to have a good time as a wizard while playing solo.\n\nGraphics and animations are very poor and remind me of something like South Park. Environments are bare-bones and besides the church there is nothing else to see. It was previously an Xbox Live Indie game so these are to be expected though. Music is rather forgettable as well but it serves it's purpose well enough. And here is the technical issue that negatively effects the game the most. It is locked at 30 fps which is never appreciated in any game. Having 60fps wouldn't have helped combat at all but at 30 it feels pretty odd. There are no graphics menu but it is set at 1080p which is nice and you are able to switch to windowed mode as well as having a music and sound effects slider. I don't know if it scales higher than 1080p unfortunately. Overall it is a decent port and I have had no issues other than the whole 30fps thing.\n\nIt is a pretty entertaining game for those that can take advantage of the local coop feature but for solo it gets boring fast. Due to the awful endings you don't really feel inclined to go through 50 more waves on a higher difficulty level unless you are shooting for all the achievements. Gameplay is just not fun or varied enough to make you want to spend a lot of time with this title. I did get a few hours of entertainment out of The Defenders and the very cheap price of the game makes it a much more tempting purchase. In the end of day I feel I got my money's worth out of this title and would be tempted to put more hours if I had someone to play it with more frequently. Recommended to those that want a local coop game or just a mindless action game with rather nice character building.","June 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

I am not going to tell you what is in the game, the description that you can find on the shop speaks for itself.\n\nI spent five hours to beat the game on Easy, Normal and Hard, playing alone with a pad. At first, it was difficult, even on Easy mode, but once I understood how to survive and kill enemies without taking too much damage, I really enjoyed the game.

I'm not sure why it's getting such mixed reviews. It was more fun than Bardbaraian, the closest equivalent I can think of. I have never had a problem with crashes or the difficulty. Sure the individual elements aren't excessively original (waves attack your character, drop gold, you buy upgrades every few waves) but I can't think of any other games off the top of my head that combine it all the way this one does. Every 11th wave you get a save point so if you die you can restart and shop with approximately the amount of money you would have made up to that point so you can try out different combinations.\n\nI originally bought it to play multiplayer with friends. Subsequently remembering that I don't have any friends didn't prevent me from having a blast playing it for 5 hours on easy then normal mode. Then a few months later I came back and beat it on hard mode to get all the achievements.\n\nIf the video and screenshots look even vaguely interesting to you, give The Defenders a chance.
