So our group had a surplus of these free Particula keys (30) so we all launched yesterday at 9:30 to investigate. Verdict = Really Fun. I highly recommend the Multiplayer; you must bring your own friends though which sucks!\n\nThe TD takes place within the human mind. Your towers are some sort of brain synapses that must eradicate negative thoughts such as jealousy, greed, self-consciousness and other negative thoughts that would cross one’s mind. Pretty clever on that front; this allowed the minimalist graphics to actually work and make sense. The levels are quite long and almost AFKable with some friends\n\nThere are quite a few things that didn't work for me. There was no tutorial; I was super confused at the start. Stick with it because the learning curve is quick. Multiplayer "works" but it’s dead since few play this game on the regular. There are only 3 levels to alternate between which include 6-7 levels of difficulty. This is cool but I'd rather have more variance in the maps instead. Finally, the chat box is MICRO; you can only type and read so much. Communication in multiplayer almost has to be done with voice to be effective.\n\nOverall, not bad for $1! It's short and you need to BYOF (Bring Your Own Friends.) Free at Accidently Reviewed!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

I got this game on a bundle, and I was glad I got it, though, as the game has a characteristic that is not usually related to tower defense games: it's a relaxing game, a game about keeping it cool while fighting balls of energy that symbolize all the things that can ruin our lives.\n\nThe game lacks a tutorial (only has a brief screen explanating the keys required to play. There is no story mode, only different scenarios and in-game achievements, most of them being related to playing the game once in a higher difficulty level. The music is soothing, and the sound effects are really nice and fit the game really well.\n\nGameplay consists of creating units to defend your mind from the negative forces, and you can upgrade these units using the game's currency, that is, the energy you get by destroying the negative forces. There is no explanation of the advantages of each unit, but a basic rule to play the game is be to keep removing old units as soon as possible and adding better ones, until you only have the best units. Then you need to upgrade the units to be faster (up to 2s between shots) and deal more damage (not sure if there is a limit to the damage per shot for each unit), and these upgrades also cost energy.\n\nI have not been able to play in multiplayer, as the game found no servers at the time. I will update this review if I'm able to play with someone, in the future, but the game page tells me up to three people can play at a time, and it is also possible to chat with other players, even if you are playing alone (I don't know why this is an option).\n\nTo sum up, I do recommend the game, but I must warn you that you will not have much to do in it, unless you really want to get all the in-game achievements or just need a game to play when you need to relax for some time. However, due to the lack of story, I can only recommend it if you get it in a really good sale or in a bundle (I believe a game should be reviewed as worth playing regardless of the price, as Steam has countless sales and indie games appear in countless bundles).","February 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","38","54","3","4"

There are several functions I feel are missing that should be there (start wave sooner, speed up the wave, etc (perhaps they can and will be added later?)), there are also some features I did not expect like a chat box (though I wish I could enlarge it somehow) and apparently a push to talk to chat with your coop partner. The music was nice and calming, but it wears on you if you play for a long period of time.\n\nIf you don't mind the price and you're looking for a chilled calming experience for 20-40 minute chunks of time I think you might enjoy this, however the price for me kills the deal at this time.\n\n","February 8, 2015","false","2.2"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","38","55","2","0"

In this case, the concept is pretty unique: "clear your mind" and "destroy negativity"...two things I often don't see associated with a tower defense game.  The visuals and soundtrack are pleasing, reminding me a little bit of "Osmos". The game is advertised as a three-player co-op game, though you can play it in single player if you so choose. At the time of writing, "Particula" is very polished and ready to play (though more content is coming in the form of maps, achievements, and server improvements).  It could stand to be improved in a few areas, namely the tower "update" system (less clicking, please) and the inclusion of a tutorial or in-game encyclopedia that tell you what the towers do before you build them.  Hopefully these are issues that will get ironed out before release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glKeFVLYj78","February 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","2"

But in this case, I'm leaning towards no.\n\nParticula is a very simple tower defense game. It has three levels and that's it. Each level has 25 waves of enemies, which are always the same, and that's it. And it has three different tower types, each with three different levels of effectiveness, and that's it. Upgrades to towers are also simple, with up to 10 speed upgrades (taking each tower from attacking once every three seconds at minimum to once every two seconds at maximum), and a seemingly unlimited number of damage upgrades, adding one point of damage with each upgrade.\n\nThe graphics are well done and the music is lovely. The controls are simple enough that the game doesn't need a tutorial. The game supports multiplayer, but I've not been able to find anyone else to play with, so I can't comment on that. From what I can gather from the Steam community discussions, the maps are still the same. And the game is very slow to play.\n\nParticula was an interesting experience, but there's just not enough to it for me to recommend it. It comes with trading cards, which is a nice bonus for those interested in them, and does have in-game achievements to encourage some replayability, at least, but these are not mapped to Steam achievements, which reduces interest in them to many potential players.\n\nWith a bit more variation and Steam achievements included, I'd not hesitate to recommend Particula. As it is, however, I'm still stuck leaning towards no.","February 28","false","4.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

The graphics are pretty basic and the music is very generic, the biggest problem is it does not stand up against any other tower defence at all, it might be good for beginners who are learning how to play tower defence.

Honestly, I wouldn't pay a dime for this game.\nParticula has absolutely no depth. The game isn't story driven and lets you skip about. It boasts five difficulties to choose from, each of which is as simple as the last. It isn't hard to ace each stage at any given difficulty. Saying it aloud, 'each stage' makes it sound like you'll get some interesting variety, which is an absolute lie. I present a 99 cent tower defense game with three whole stages. Three. Three. Two types of enemies as well, and I can't tell any difference other than size, color and health of the enemies. They don't appear to have resistence to any of the nine towers.\nI've noticed that other reviews have stated that there are a measly three towers, I'll elaborate on this. There are three types of three tower strengths. Each tower has a specific name, but really doesn't relate to the tower itself. "Basic", "Intermediate" and "Advanced" towers, with one of three energy types, Fire, Ice, or Poison. Each energy type has very similar abilities, damage, and speed. So realistically that narrows it back down to three.\n\nFor as much as I dislike about Particula, there are a few positive aspects as well. Faithful to the name, both the enemies and towers are particles. The art style is bright and intriguing. Each of the enemy particles have a negative title associated with an emotion, making it look like you're fighting depression. Spoiler alert: you aren't. The music is calming while the sound effects aren't basic tapping noises. Granted, even they get annoying after a while.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer, but I can't expect it to be good. For myself, at least, tower defense is relaxing and playing with people makes it seem expectation-y. From what I've read, you can sell your partner's towers, which should never be allowed. It breaks the game for both players. Cooperation in a game like Particula sounds awful.\n\nNo, I didn't spend nearly five hours actually playing this game. I idled for the Trading Cards. They're free, after all. It isn't human to invest that much time into a useless tower defense game. If you aren't human, or trying to grab as many games as possible, or have an undenying love for tower defense games, go ahead. It's your money, and only 50 cents on sale.\n\nThe verdict? Don't buy it.","February 10","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have gone through and struggled with negativity and problems throughout my life, as have we all, and this does put into a lovely true picture, what this is on a scope. Which is a universal exercise for us and everything else. It is necessary. For overall balance, basically.\nSo more onto the games actual consistency. It has a wonderful art scheme of beautiful space like clusters of marble colour and shimmering light. This is quite perfect in my mind and is the overcoming aspect of its entirety, as far as I know at least.\nYou can clearly tell the negative parts from the colour, title choice and wickedly moving nucleus. This does allow you to easily segment them and mind them as they go along the path. Now to quite the opposite and the possitive "Turrets" they have wonderful names which shimmer in their own mysterious light, reminds me of magic words such as Igni, a sign from The Witcher, it's like Latin. Also their animations and colours are just perfect as far as I will say. I have not played too deeply but as you may be able to tell, there will not be much of a stuck storyline, it is your own experience that is the journey. Tis not quite layed out yet.

Particula truly captures artistic style and gameplay without diminishing the overall value. As far as game mechanics, there is an incredible level of strategy in this game. Of the three different tower types, the variation is unmatched. It provides a mental...no, even physical challenge. You can really see the developers put an astronomical level of thought into their product. Just when you thought it was all over you realize you can defend your mind with up to THREE PLAYERS! From my 25 minutes of online 2-player co-op with a complete stranger (who is now my best friend!), I can only imagine how euphoric the three player experience is. The motion picture background is beautiful in the way that it tells a deep and compelling story about the presumed young boy it's based on. I'll stop there to prevent potential spoilers.

It seems three elements spread over three different weapon types. As for the functional difference between these, well your guess is as good as mine. They are at least different colours.

BrainPipe's not a(n endless) runner, per se - you're an eyeball moving down a tunnel avoiding obstacles - but yeah).\n\n\nI appreciate what Particula is going for, aye.\nIt seems a bit too simplistic, but what's there could be argued (if you're really into casual strategy (pardon the paradox) or the atmosphere) to be worth the asking price of $10; plus there's multiplayer, unsure how well it works.\n\n\nYou are protecting a mind (human head) from bad emotions and harmful concepts:\nRage, Hate, Shame, Confusion, Cheat, etc.\n\nWhen you are defeated, you are prompted that "Negativity Emerged!"\n\nWhether you're playing as... some sort of deity (for simplicity's sake), trying to protect your human charge, or simply a manifestation of your own mind, projected outward from within to witness the evil what is on the warpath from within, spurred by your surroundings - go ahead and roll one, hit your bro up and strike up a conversation, with Particula going on in the background, rather than sitting idle otherwise or actually focusing on something.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that your (")base(") can take 9 hits; there are orbs floating above the head that disappear when an enemy successfully breaches it. The Trading Cards cite these as "Life." So. When Negativity emerges, we die... not far from the truth.\nHow the hell'd we wind up like this?\nWhy weren't we able...\n\n\nYou've 9 towers to pick from; 3 different types with 3 different strengths each:\nIce, Fire, Toxic; can spend either 700, 5000 or 15000 Energy towards them.\n\nOnce you place a tower, you can click on it to find these options:\nInfo, Upgrade, Skill, Delete, Close.\nSkill just gives furthe Info.\nWhen Upgrading, you can increase Damage by either 2 or 10, or the Speed with which the tower attacks by 0.1 seconds (max of 10 upgrades in Speed).\nWhen done with a tower, you must Close that menu 'fore opening another one; you can't just click on a different tower with that first menu still open.\n\nThere is XP to earn; Level cap is 10.\nIt seems progressing increases the amount of Energy you start a map with.\nThere are 3 maps, with 5 difficulties.\n\n\nMy opening statements refute the Store Page Description of Particula "bring[ing] you a new perspective in gaming, helping you to concentrate..." but we both agree it's a good way to clear your mind.\n\nI recommend this game to those who like the vibe / message, like casual strategy / tower defense, like living like it was your last day.

That said, I don't know what's wrong with this game, the controls are just awful, the camera POV is awful as well, and it's as simplistic as it gets, there's only 3 types of towers, each with 3 'levels', and you seem to be able to upgrade the damage indefinately, only the attack speed has a limit. The route of the 'mobs' is not clear at all, and it's useful to find those out by just failing once, if you're curious what the route is, that is. There's also just 3 different kinds of levels in total.\nI'm wondering how they even thought of asking the current price for this o.O","March 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

BrainPipe's not a(n endless) runner, per se - you're an eyeball moving down a tunnel avoiding obstacles - but yeah).\n\n\nI appreciate what Particula is going for, aye.\nIt seems a bit too simplistic, but what's there could be argued (if you're really into casual strategy (pardon the paradox) or the atmosphere) to be worth the asking price of $10; plus there's multiplayer, unsure how well it works.\n\n\nYou are protecting a mind (human head) from bad emotions and harmful concepts:\nRage, Hate, Shame, Confusion, Cheat, etc.\n\nWhen you are defeated, you are prompted that "Negativity Emerged!"\n\nWhether you're playing as... some sort of deity (for simplicity's sake), trying to protect your human charge, or simply a manifestation of your own mind, projected outward from within to witness the evil what is on the warpath from within, spurred by your surroundings - go ahead and roll one, hit your bro up and strike up a conversation, with Particula going on in the background, rather than sitting idle otherwise or actually focusing on something.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that your (")base(") can take 9 hits; there are orbs floating above the head that disappear when an enemy successfully breaches it. The Trading Cards cite these as "Life." So. When Negativity emerges, we die... not far from the truth.\nHow the hell'd we wind up like this?\nWhy weren't we able...\n\n\nYou've 9 towers to pick from; 3 different types with 3 different strengths each:\nIce, Fire, Toxic; can spend either 700, 5000 or 15000 Energy towards them.\n\nOnce you place a tower, you can click on it to find these options:\nInfo, Upgrade, Skill, Delete, Close.\nSkill just gives furthe Info.\nWhen Upgrading, you can increase Damage by either 2 or 10, or the Speed with which the tower attacks by 0.1 seconds (max of 10 upgrades in Speed).\nWhen done with a tower, you must Close that menu 'fore opening another one; you can't just click on a different tower with that first menu still open.\n\nThere is XP to earn; Level cap is 10.\nIt seems progressing increases the amount of Energy you start a map with.\nThere are 3 maps, with 5 difficulties.\n\n\nMy opening statements refute the Store Page Description of Particula "bring[ing] you a new perspective in gaming, helping you to concentrate..." but we both agree it's a good way to clear your mind.\n\nI recommend this game to those who like the vibe / message, like casual strategy / tower defense, like living like it was your last day. Because tomorrow was too late. And I want a diam(ond) back. 'Cause Pimplecrack sucks.\nBut Particula doesn't... neither does it excel.","August 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Dragging  friend to play multiplayer with you is probably your best option because there is built in voice chat if you hold the ALT key...   ACTUALLY you're better off use voice chat because the chat box is too small and only fits 1 or 2 messages before scrolling off (both full screen and windowed mode).  In windowed mode the chat box actually covers the turret information window and makes it so half the button area unclickable (it opens chat).  You can get away with just building 2 15k turrets (fire/poison) at the beginning of the path and upgrade it nonstop and clear every wave....\n\nOh and right click deselects a turret or you can click close/hit 5.  You have to in order to select another turret.\n\n\n\n\nIf you actually let one of the large mobs get to the end of the path, it still only does 1 dmg... ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯ easy game","June 13, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But in this case, I'm leaning towards no.\n\nParticula is a very simple tower defense game. It has three levels and that's it. Each level has 25 waves of enemies, which are always the same, and that's it. And it has three different tower types, each with three different levels of effectiveness, and that's it. Upgrades to towers are also simple, with up to 10 speed upgrades (taking each tower from attacking once every three seconds at minimum to once every two seconds at maximum), and a seemingly unlimited number of damage upgrades, adding one point of damage with each upgrade.\n\nThe graphics are well done and the music is lovely. The controls are simple enough that the game doesn't need a tutorial. The game supports multiplayer, but I've not been able to find anyone else to play with, so I can't comment on that. From what I can gather from the Steam community discussions, the maps are still the same. And the game is very slow to play.\n\nParticula was an interesting experience, but there's just not enough to it for me to recommend it. It comes with trading cards, which is a nice bonus for those interested in them, and does have in-game achievements to encourage some replayability, at least, but these are not mapped to Steam achievements, which reduces interest in them to many potential players.\n\nWith a bit more variation and Steam achievements included, I'd not hesitate to recommend Particula. As it is, however, I'm still stuck leaning towards no.\n","December 10, 2015","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fine to get if it's on sale or in a bundle. The game is a very simplistic tower defense game. Ice towers slow the negative thoughts, fire towers burn (damage over time), and  arcane towers slow (less than ice) and poison (less damage than fire). The negative thoughts come in various sizes; the bigger it is, the more HP it has. As you defeat the negative thoughts, you get energy (the currency of the game) which allows you to upgrade towers and destroy negative thoughts more quickly and effectively. The game is easy but repetitive. Multiplayer games often take a while to play unless you're playing with friends, mostly because everyone else is playing with their friends. In short, try it out if you have friends, you have nothing to do, and it's on sale.","May 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

In the process you are "destroying" bad things that can come in your life. You can destroy the feeling of someone cheating on you, or Laziness. Whole game is easy altough i was little bit confused at the start, because my friend gave me a key to this game and after opening it i was sad that there is no tutorial. Game is also Co-Op, so you can play with your friends, altough i didnt try it yet but i dont think that one of the players will be able to control enemies. I personally love the soundtrack. It is relaxing and really matching the climax that is around the whole game. One of few minuses, is the camera. Camera should be a little better made, but it is decent, so it doesnt matter that much. Another thing is that its another Tower Defense game, and doesnt change anything. Its simple which is a Pro, aswell as a Con.\n\nPros :\n+Nice Soundtrack\n+Graphics are nice\n+Relaxing\n+Co-Op included up to 3 players\n+Simple...\n\nCons :\n-...maybe too simple\n-Doesnt add much to traditional TD type of games.\n\nOverall : 6/10","September 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's more like a mobile game though. I mean it's pretty simple. No big deal. Just put up towers to defend the 'head' at the end of the corridor. ♥♥♥♥ spawns at the other end and makes it's way towards the 'head'. You are supposed to protect the 'head'. If an enemy reaches the head, the head loses a life. If the head loses all lives, the level is lost. And you go to the toilet and cry.\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ Multiple tower types\n+ Tower types have different attributes\n+ Towers are upgradable/demolishable (Upgrade the speed or damage of the tower, demolish tower if you need the space for something else, like another type of tower)\n+ Weird nice environment\n+ Music/sound effects\n+ Multiple maps\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Well, it's boring. I can't explain it in any other way than this. I mean there is no action or anything interesting. Just plain and simple tower defense game.\n\nThe pros outweigh the cons (boringness) so I recommend it. You can play it for a couple hours straight before getting bored.

You must defend against this evil with magic. There is magic that can burn, slow and poison. You earn energy when the evil is destroyed and then you can upgrade and buy more magic defense. There are many games like this but Particula has a beauty to it in some ways\n\nPros\nGraphics and color are very beautiful and gives a sense of space, life and freedom\nDifficulty was very enjoyable and I liked how even the lowest difficulty was sometimes a challenge\nFlow of game After waiting for the waves to start, when you fight the spheres of evil and darkness (Rage, Oppression etc.) you feel like you've accomplished something when you finish an entire round OR game\nCons\nOnline Gameplay was very hard to get because there are hardly any servers on at all and any servers that are online are always filled\nSpeed of game was a medium speed during waves but was very slow when waiting and part of the game was just wasting time waiting to gain points or for the next wave to end/start\nLevels There were only 3 different areas to play on and they seem dull after you play it once or twice\nMy rating\nI enjoy how good it looks and feels but the gameplay wasn't very enjoyable while waiting and co-op isn't much fun. I would buy it for $1 but not any higher. I'm giving this a 4/10 so I do not recommend this game for many people.","March 20","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On of which for me was the graphics, yes they could be sharper but I still liked it. The game itself starts by simply throwing you in it. You see a face mask which I assumed you were supposed to defend. The defenses have names that you have to guess what they do, but they start you of easy and I'll doubt anyone fail during the first few waves. After awhile you get the hang of it and start to feel overpowered, no enemies comes futher than halfway towards the mask. But then out of nowhere a massive beast comes and waltzes through the defenses, with 50% hp left when he reaches the mask. This game need alot of fixes, but the biggest is a proper tutorial. I don't get why game developers think "this concept but with a twist" How does it work? "....play and find out" Yeah thx, In today's world that will make alot of people quit the game and giving it a bad review. I'll never understand it.
