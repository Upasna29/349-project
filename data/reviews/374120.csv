Since it's an Early Alpha game you would expect less polished objects but the developer has crystal clear textures on the objects.\n\nMultiplayer is riding around between other people, hoping you don't need the stack they're moving around.\n\nFor a Early Access game this is very well made, good to see that the developer has put effort into the game and is still adding new things to it.","May 20","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've driven fork trucks in games like GTA and the like but nothing dedicated to a realistic fork truck driving experience so I figured I give this game a try to see how it measured up.\n\nIt's not bad as far as the driving goes. One thing I was curious about was the POV since you often have to move around in a fork truck, leaning out, leaning forward, looking up, looking behind, etc, to make sure you're lined up, aren't about to smash into things, aren't about to stab something, etc and this game gets around that by giving you two forms of mouse look. The default lets you lean left/right/forward/back and holding left-click lets you look like you would in an FPS game. Pretty handy although I wish there was a toggle mode for this since you don't often use both types at the same time. I still have some issues with the driving but nothing major.\n\nThe main flaw is the lack of content and polish. It's Early Access but it's being sold for $8 so I won't hold back criticisms.You get a couple small levels and you can move pallets around within them. Your goals only include taking a pallet marked "target" and moving it to a "destination" area. Both are randomly chosen as you play. There is no way to damage the goods (although you can flip them over or cause them to be unrecoverable) and the destination zone is very loose so the "Challenge" in the title is a bit misleading. In a normal warehouse space is a big concern so you don't get to just loosely toss a pallet somewhere. You normally have to pack them into a rack like sardines without damaging anything. The game also lacks some polish like a way to back out of menus or reset the fork truck if you roll it over. Nothing that can't be fixed in time.\n\nOverall, it might one day be a decent title for simulator fans but right now I don't feel it's worth $4 let alone $8 so hold off and maybe check back in later to see if it's been improved. I will certainly update this review if that happens.","October 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
