Kudos to Pilgrim Adventures for this simple, yet charming game(s), with a straight-forward narrative and interesting world-building. I'll be looking forward for more games from these developers and writers.\n\nNonetheless I think this saga could had been extended into more episodes; I think the aforementioned world-building was cut short due to the 4 episodes limit. I feel like there was room for a wider narrative without necessarely making the story bloated. Still, it is better to conclude a story too soon than to conclude it too late.","March 5","true","8.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","0"

The two first parts are a little lighter both in tone and difficulty while the last two parts really adds a lot of story and puzzles that usually don't leave you hanging for too long. The journal is usually help enough.\nTechnically this installment is the best in the series with some animation, extra graphics and music. The third game had this as well but this one adds a little more.\nSo do I like the game and series? Yes and I would recommend it to anyone who likes story, puzzles and laid back games. It's an example of how good a game can be from available game making tools.","March 8","true","3.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

After escaping in 2 big parts of ActI your crew of rebels regroup on Venus before the final fight against the J.A.C. Besides Gail gets some visions of her past and must reprogram the merciless robot Emid.

Funny to revenge to well known ppl from the past and deactivate all the defences.\nIn the end Gail stays the famous ship captain and keeps on traveling with her Dad through the galaxis.","April 28","true","5.8"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

The puzzles are decent and generally not too challenging, but they all make sense in their context. The final closure wass good and satisfying, both for Pilgrim as a character and the whole universe the game is set in.\n\nThe game is still linear though, and the flaunted "decisions" aren't really there or make much difference: at least this time we get a bit of character depth though.\n\nThere's alot to like both in Episode IV and the saga as a whole if you're ok with its simplicity both in story and gameplay: for its price it's a good amount of fun.","March 13","true","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This episode is even longer than 3, and less dependent on taking long walks between places, and it even adds choices into the mix (and one of those choices is about sex, which is the real deal for us gamers let´s be honest).\n\nA very satisfying goodbye to an outstanding Sci-Fi adventure, altough I won´t mind more episodes (discreetly starts to wink in the developers direction). 300 billions out of 300 billions.","April 21","true","4.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

All in all it was a very well-crafted little sci-fi adventure game. The story does feel like it didn't quite reach its potential exploring an angle that was introduced in the previous episode, but it's still very good. When you consider the price and the quality of the writing this is no-brainer.

Quite the contrary.  This latest installment kicks off where the previous one ended (on a cliffhanger) and I've been playing the whole series for the past few days, each day coming back from work looking forward to playing. It has been a while since any game managed to do that. Too bad that this is already the last episode, the setup sure offers more posibilities for more storylines and episodes.","May 27","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
