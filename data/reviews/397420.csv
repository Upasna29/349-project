The faces look really strange to me.  Gone are the old players and side banter that made playing previous versions of Hoyle fun - I miss Roswell, Rhett, Marvin, and others.  There do not seem to be a lot of new games over the previous version, either.  I used to enjoy playing French Tarot in the 2005 edition of Hoyle, which they removed several versions ago and never added back.  I like that Hoyle is on Steam now, but they really need to go back and try again with this one.","November 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","48","58","0","6"

Sierra's version had a wonderfully rich set of characters who were fun and engaging to play with.\n\nThe characters in this version sound like badly synthesized text to speech. They have no personality. The elevator music ranges from odd to grating. It reminds me of the really bad MIDI files one could download years ago and sound just as bad. And who knew there were so many solitaire games! In that, I have to admit one gets their money's worth! *tongue squarely embedded in cheek*\n\nI get that they had to write this so it could be playable on a number of devices, hence its flat look. It just pales compared to past versions. Would that my old Sierra CD still work!\n\nGood effort. Just not a terribly interesting game.","May 22","false","46.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(piece of software).   It's of the quality that even EA would probably be too embarassed to put in their 'on the house' section, but again, it's a collection of card games, so....Don't get your tightie whities in a bunch about that: it's card games, and it goes relatively deep.  It has dozens of different solitares, kiddie classics like go fish and crazy 8s, amongst more complex ones such as bridge, hearts, pinnocle, gin rummy, and quite a few others i haven't heard of or delved in to.\n\nThere's a lot of unwarranted negging about it, but those complaining solely about the price, you're 100% correct.  The only problem with this collection is it's WAY overpriced. I bought it on sale for 6 bucks, and even that much made me raise an eyebrow after i opened it for the first time.  It really should be a 5 dollar game that goes half off once in a while.\n\nIf you like to have a no brainer timesuck card game sim in your library, this is the one, though i caution you to mind what you pay for it.  Certainly not worth 20 bucks.","May 23","true","130.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wanted to get a computer cribbage game for those times when I need my crib fix and my wife isn't up for a game.  This serves that purpose.  It's decent, but not fabulous.\n\nPros:\n-- Game runs in full screen.\n-- Seems to be totally bug-free (at least cribbage...I haven't had a chance to play the other games yet).\n-- The AI is alright.\n-- Some of the other reviewers seemed upset because, apparently, the AI avatars and voices in this version are inferior to previous installments (or something).  I dunno...I had an older version of Hoyle's card games on my old computer several years ago, and I personally don't remember the AI's "personality" being anything even remotely memorable.  I honestly don't give a rat's behind about any of that.  I just want to play crib, and this game lets me do it.  I guess it's important to some other players, but it wasn't an issue for me.\n\nCons:\n-- The soundtrack is atrocious elevator music.\n-- Muting the terrible soundtrack also mutes the sound effects and voice.  I mean, seriously?  Lame!\n-- The game uses rookie scoring methods for cribbage.  Anyone who plays crib knows that a pattern of cards like the following, JQQK or 4456, for instance, is known as a "double-run" and is worth 8 points.  But the AI scores it like a noob, counting it as two runs (3 points each) and a pair (2 points).  Here's another example: in crib, a three-of-a-kind is known as a "pair royal" and is worth 6 points, but the AI counts it as 3 seperate pairs, worth 2 apiece.  Why does this matter you ask?  Well, first of all, it's totally annoying to veteran players who are used to the standard scoring practices.  And, secondly, because one of the best parts of cribbage is watching your opponent overlook something as they count up their hand, and then stealing those points for yourself!  It's known as the "muggins rule".  The game does give you the option of playing with the muggins rule enabled...but, jeez, I can't imagine any better way to suck the fun out of it and make it a tedious ordeal, than by using the rookie scoring methods the AI employs.  I mean, I guess for someone learning cribbage for the first time the scoring MIGHT be helpful...but they could have at least given the player an option in the options menu to choose between "veteran scoring" and "beginner scoring".  Meh... :P\n\nConclusion:\n6/10.  When push comes to shove, it gets a thumbs up...barely.  It sucks compared to a real opponent, of course.  But the lame crib scoring methods and the sound issues are what really drag it down.  I got it on sale for 75% off, so I'm happy with the purchase overall.  I would have been disappointed had I paid full price.  Wait for it to go on sale.","May 18","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Thank god I didn't spend the 19.99 for it, but I wasted my money and it will just sit in my library not being played and I thought I would give it a try inspite of the bad reviews it got and they were right.

Just because i  like  to play  card games and learn  new ones. So far i had a  lot of fun  with  it.  i must say, that i'm not known with  the previous hoyle  card games. maybe  that  fact made me not dislike this game. but i can't say that  for sure.\n\nIt has  computerized  voices,  and i cant  enlarge  the  game on my screen  , or play  it  full screen. that is a bit the only thing that  bugs me a bit about this game.\n\noh  and the best part of it , they have  my favorite card game. CRAZY EIGHT.  just a simple time filling game that i play with my friends. So its  pretty cool.","March 1","true","1.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I just bought this pack this morning and took a quick look at it. The spiderette solitaire seems to work the same as previous versions. Looking at some of the others it seems they took the logic and RNG from the last version (pre-steam, by Encore I think) and used that engine for this game.\n\nSo what's different. The windows are given the windows 8 treatment for colour and style.  They took a sampling of previous games and included them. The face creator creates creepy faces. There is a selection midi music. The backgrounds, card faces, and card backs are okay but bland and don't seem to have any common theme going to match them together by color or style.\n\nIn terms of recreational card play, I think this game is the same as previous version.\n\nThe look and style is bland but varied. The entertaining characters are gone.  So with sound off and my own music going this makes a reasonable coffee break game.\n\n3 of 5 stars.","March 3","true","1.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
