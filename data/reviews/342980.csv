I don't have much experience with free games, except for android apps which are riddled with ads (which this is obviously not). I can only assume this author wants to put their work out there and get people to play it, I dunno. I'm really happy I did try it. Though, when I first saw it, it did connect with me. I saw it on the store page, thought "This looks neat" then watched the trailer and thought "this looks like what I've been waiting for". I say that because I'm the type to have a game (usually big name and/or great reviewed game) to play; I also want a simple mindless game to help break up the play through of that other game. This game is more than that though, its what you make of it. Nothing you NEED to master to play the game, easy to learn and you get better and enjoy it more thoroughly as you master it. This is asteroids physics, which I've not played a game similar yet on steam personally, I did see someone mention SPAZ, which I should check out at again.\n\nSo, you start in the basic ship, spend some time mining (by shooting asteroids... feels like punching trees but funner because of physics) to gain enough money to buy upgrades and better ships to fit better weapons. There is no direction in the game and a very minimalistic tutorial, but it feels genuinely like this was meant on purpose, kind of an exploration aspect, you learn the game by playing (which is fine). This isnt some rpg (apparently it does claim it is...), it is like "See how far you can get". This would be AWESOME and worth like 30 bucks if it were more refined and had more content. You'll find yourself saying "OH *this* should be added!" all the time.\nIt doesn't seem like there is any end game, but it is mesmerizing to say the least and is definitely worth the one second DL time and $0. I spent my whole evening playing it and bothered to leave a review.\nA couple tips: stick with your original blaster with unlimited ammo until you feel confident with the combat, the starting trade ship sells the ship your in already for 200 and the game will let you throw money away buying the ship you already own. Other than that, just jump in and F around!\n\nTL;DR: It's worth your time, not just because it's free\n","February 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 324 of 341 people (95%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","95","324","341","30","13"

For a freebie, its surprisingly fun.  Though very simple in its presentation, it is still a lot of fun to play.\n\nThe game has no story to it.  The player is given a small spaceship, some basic equipment, and a little money, then set loose in a random star system to roam the galaxy as they please.  Money can be found by breaking open asteroids or blowing up other ships, most of which are hostile.\n\nThe controls are very simple and appear to be based on the classic Asteroids game.  The player can rotate their ship, thrust forward, and shoot, although some ships can equip secondary weapons.  Each of the many playable ships also has a special ability, such as the ability to slow time for a few seconds, or knock down the shields of all nearby enemies, although these abilities use charges, which can be purchased at shops or recovered from destroyed enemies.  Most weapons, not including the basic blaster, require ammunition as well.  Blowing up enemies is a bit like smashing a pinata, as the loot scatters from the wreckage in the form of multi-coloured icons.\n\nA small on-screen menu allows the player to open their inventory to change equipment, and interact with certain friendly ships and stations, as well as access a system map or adjust the options ingame.  You can dock with friendly stations and trader ships to buy and sell equipment, change your ship, or even hire mercenaries to fight alongside you.\n\nThe RPG elements in the game are very basic.  The player becomes more powerful by buying or salvaging new equipment, or buying new ships (all equipment in the player's inventory is transferred).  The map is very simple and requires little explanation.  A skull-and-crossbones symbol marks areas with enemies that are significantly more powerful than your current ship.  As you get better ships and equipment, these symbols disappear, showing that you can safely progress to more dangerous areas.\n\nAmong the locations the player can visit are asteroid fields, where the drifting rocks are particularly dense, planets, where the player must contend with gravity and bombard surface structures to survive, and floating labyrinths, where the player must carefully navigate the interior of complex structures and battle their internal defences.\n\nIt's not perfect.  The game is quite small and only features a couple of systems so far, although it is apparently still being worked on.  The game automatically saves your ship and its inventory, but not its location, so each time you return to the game, you arrive back in a random system.  There is no background music and the gameplay is mostly limited to flying around in search of things to shoot, but for a free game it's not bad at all.","February 8, 2015","true","3.1"," 114 of 117 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","114","117","14","0"

It's far from perfect, but it's nothing that makes the game unplayable.

Explore a hostile corner of the galaxy, fighting off pirates and enemy crafts, mining asteroids and upgrading your ship and equipment.\n\nPros: You get to explore asteroid fields, giant space mazes and caves, you can land on planets in orbit, whose gravity effect is neatly realized: as you approach, the screen rotates to the incoming gravity force, pulling you in as you bomb enemy towers or land of ports. Such ports, as well as port-ships flying about, allow you to land to sell off salvage and buy better ships and equipment. Worm-holes allow you to speed your way across the map from/to fixed locations, although planetary objects locations will depend on their rotation around their star. Enemies, asteroids and debris seem to always re-spawn, making sure you never run out of things to do.\n\nCons: Every time you load the game up, you can continue with the same ship, equipment and money, but the game always regenerate a new sector, so there is no sense of accomplishment or progression. The graphics are retro, which just isn't my thing: I got to play games back when such graphics were the best that they got, but a nostalgia trip into "retro" graphics and vintage-tech sound effects shouldn't be a thing in my opinion.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis game isn't for me, but I have no doubt some love it. When approached as a casual game, the re-spawning galaxy makes each play session a "new game" without losing your ships and upgrades. Admittingly, I don't personally know many people I would recommend this game to, but it's free, so sure, give it a try! If it ain't your thing, no biggy.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

No strings atached, no microtransactions, no P2W b*llsh*t... It's just a game, for free, for ever!\n\nGraphics: Pretty good, there are some flaws here and there (the planet cores look horrible!) and I wasn't able to set my resolution (not a big deal really). I really like the artstyle, and it does a great job on setting the mood and giving everything a nice, grim-dark-ish touch that sinks in very well with the game!\n\nStory: Non-existant. Still a better love story than Twilight.\n\nControls: Great! There are lots of people complaining about how "stressful" or some ♥♥♥♥ the controls are, but those people probably haven't played any games of this genre.\n\nGameplay: Really fun and rewarding, challenging but fair and not overly difficult if you know where to go, and who to shoot. The light RPG elements really help give the game some depth, but some more mechanics like leveling, upgrading... etc, could make this game even better!!  My only complaint with the gameplay is that the different ships feel too similar, so I ended up sticking with the strongest one.\n\nSound: A bit lacking, some ambient music and more consistent sound effects (they seem to dissapear and reapear at will) would do much good.\n\nUI (user interface): Good enough, though it could be much better. A "character" or "status" window would be pretty useful, so you can tell what weapon slots does your ship have (I've accidentally bought weapons that didn't fit in my slots) and a bunch of other useful info.\n\nOverall, a really nice game, very fun and well polished. It has a lot of potential and room for improvement, and seeing as the dev seems to be a pretty nice guy who actually listens to the community, I see this game becoming better and better as time goes by. Give it a try, it's free and if you like space shooters, this game will definitely have you playing for hours!\n\nScore: A solid 9/10\n\n\n(BTW Steam doesn't seem to register the time I've spent playing properly, I've put at least 7 hours and Steam only registers 1,5.

I'd probably pay a couple bucks if there were more guns and stuff.\n\nOne stand out feature of this game is the lack of inertia and near constant collisions. That can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how well you drive. If you're like me, you drive like ♥♥♥♥ and only fight near asteroids and use them to block incoming shots and missiles.\n\nThis is a rather fun little game that plays rather well on my i5 built in graphics ubuntu laptop (though there is some video tearing, which is to be expected). The graphics are adequate and interesting enough to keep you engaged. The sounds are good and fulfill their role. There's no soundtrack (so far as I can tell), and no story to speak of.\n\nThis sandbox space game is rather fun. There are orbiting stations you can dock at to sell your loot, planets to land on and clear of pirate outposts and bombing ships, and a lot of ships you can shoot in space. Asteroids are a frequent encounter too, yielding money when you blow them up. When you have enough money you can buy new ships or mercenaries to fight along side you. All in all, a fun little game.\n\nOne of the only things missing from this is a little more content. The amount of loot and such is rather limited and there's really not much reason to go past certain items once you get them. I'd personally prefer a few RPG elements and a story, but I kinda like the simplicity of this game. You just boot it up, load up your ship, and kill some pirates. And for that this game gets a recommend from me. It's just another bonus that this game happens to be free. I hope they make a sequel because this little game shows that you don't have to have HD graphics or be a AAA developer to produce a fun experience.","March 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

After clearing out pirate activity on planets (At least, I assume the skull and crossbones mean pirate activity), there isn't much else of a goal to work towards. Sure, you can buy the biggest ship and get the best guns you can find, but, that's more of a means of getting somewhere, not a goal in itself.\n\n2. Clearing out pirate activity. Now this may sound strange when you look back on point 1, but read on.\nIt's never really clear how you wipe out the pirates, but when you do it, you have no idea how or why the dangerzones have disappeared on the map. The only in-game goal in Destination Sol is basically clearing this out, but it seems so easy to do that it just seems that if I buy a bigger ship, they just disappear straight away.\n\n3. Unclear main menu. There is hardly something in the way of options, you get just a few buttons for a set few resolutions, windowed or fullscreen, and sound volume from off to very high. While I am aware that this is a free game, there should've been put a little bit more thought into the options menu regardless.\n\n4. Performance. While the game runs very smoothly on my low-end PC, there is one big glaring issue I have.\n-It randomly freezes up my entire computer, thus having me hard-reset the thing-\nI am unsure if this is the case for other people, but if it is, there need to be some patches made to fix this.\n\n\nMy suggestions would be to add clear objectives and goals to work towards, adding missions, making it clear how to fulfill those missions and objectives and when you have fulfilled them. Make the menu a little more clear, perhaps with some sliders, for example, for the sound volume, and patching the game so that it doesn't freeze up computers at random.\n\n\n\nMinor nitpick: I have also run into some planet-related glitches. When tackling turrets on various planets, I often find myself warped into the terrain, unable to escape, thus having to exit the game and start a new one with my previous ship, or respawning (Which takes away some of your resources (Ammo, cash). Again, this is something that could be easily fixed.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I did find this an enjoyable game, but the lack of goals, some glitches and PC-Freezing make it less fun than it could have been.","February 20, 2015","false","5.0"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","13"

I was able to use my steam controller to play the game but I prefer the keyboard still for this one. Pretty simple space shooter game with some interesting twists. In addition to exploring and killing enemies you can engage in meteor mining to grab a few coins and upgrade your rig.\n\nIt's open world but that's somewhat cheating since it's a space game. I'd like to see some more elements floating around. They did a good job incorporating a map and different space stations, however navigation to and from can be pretty desolate. No other players in this one. It would be a great multiplayer game!\n\nThe controls are really challanging, but also really rewarding when you are successful. You must drift, and orbit using only thrust and ship direction.\n\nIt's Free! I'd check it out for sure.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Yet, despite it's addicting breed of shooting actiony gameplay, there are very few games that truly explore this genre.\n\nThis game is about half of what I want. I want to explore space and new planets and interact with a variety of people. I want to have harrowing space battles with pirates or rebels all while customizing my ship.\n\nReally, Destination Sol is good, but it's not great, which isn't a surprise for a free game. There are plenty of unique weapons to experiment with, and the galaxy is large enough to occupy a good four or five hours, but after that, there isn't much to do. There are no people to talk to, and practically everything wants to kill you.\n\nWhen you do die, which can be easy at times, you start back at the beginning of the game, and getting back to where you were is annoying because asteroids are so abundant you slam into them constantly (at least until you get to the light speed points, which are satisfying to use even if they take forever).\n\nGetting into orbit around a planet is finicky as well. They don't actually have gravity unless you're extremely close to them, and they're so small that your engines just propel you right out of their atmosphere and back into space, which is annoying when you're trying to take down other orbiting ships.\n\nHonestly, though, the game is free, and I suggest it to everyone even slightly interested. I'd be willing to pay money for this for the person to make it even better, even.","February 4","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeweight/recommended/342980/","makeweight","Mantissa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeweight/","102 products in account","Let me tell you my story...\n\nI was a young pilot, the galaxy was new, unimaginably massive, and my mind so small. With meager blaster in hand, shield and armor engaged, and thrusters firing, I was ready to take my first steps. The stars would tremble and shiver at my coming, the planets would bear the scars of my cannons. I was to be the greatest marauder the galaxy had ever seen. My mission was a single grand idea, a lone syllable to give me my purpose: Sol. Destination, Sol.\n\nThe first to feel my wrath was the nearby planet of Neso. Armed with naught but a humble Light Machinegun, I singlehandedly butchered their army, drifting like an ethereal sword through space and time, slaying them one by one until the only witness to the bloodshed was the planet, silent as a tomb. The nearby outpost thanked me for liberating them of their oppressors, and shared with me their stocks, for a modest price.\n\nNext came the planet of... Neso. Far more dangerous, these formidable adversaries were armed from toe to teeth, each ship hefting a slug-spewing demon on one hand and its twin in the other. But they were little match for my sharp aim and flawless tactics. Their planet fell just as the last, and now I had a superior vessel, and now I could summon the demons.\n\nNow I was ready to face the Miners. Famed for their ruthlessness, they stripped the comets on the edge of the system bare, leaving both their enemies and their mines silent husks. Their rockets and harpoons could savage an unwary ship in seconds, just another drop in the ocean of blood they had spilt. Their time had come. The comet sprawled wormlike, its brilliant passages meandering this way and that, the crystals sharp as an angel's pike. My hull groaned and scraped under the abuse, but I pushed onward. And in the center, there they were- But I had no time to bask in my discovery. Sirens blared as rockets and missiles homed in on me; I was nearly buried, not by rock, but by a ceaseless barrage of violence and hatred made into projectiles of fire. It was a hard-fought battle, and I feel no shame in saying that I had to call in a favor with some shadier friends. But once we were done, we knew the comet's gleam would remain eternally, for no miner would dare stray past the veritable ring of corpses we left behind.\n\nNow there lay only one objective left for me. A mysterious planet orbitting Sol which had no name. It is said that the warriors that inhabit this place are without match in technology and prowess, their warlike muster unmatched by any empire or being.\n\nUntil now.\n\nI descended upon their planet in my chariot of steel, striking rapid and graceful, now here then there, so that not a single shot could land upon me. Their armada decorated the snowy earth with fiery testaments to my wrath. From them I assimilated the most powerful arsenal in all of Sol, so that ships 5 times my size would shatter like panes of fetid glass.\n\nAnd then I was alone. All the galaxy, having been laid low by my hand, stood yielding to the might of the Imperium. What else was I to do.\n\nThe thought set in. That was it. I had bested the gods of our worlds, the truly greatest warriors our universe had to offer.\n\nI drifted away from the planet. What else was there to do? The pirates orbiting Sol would not dare touch me, fleeing from my grasp. My lances mercilessly violated the ones who dared stray into my path. Then I remembered, my purpose, my goal, my reason for existence. The thing that lay at the end of my bloody crusade. Sol.\n\nAs though fate knew my mind, as though some unseen hand was guiding me, I needed only lay still. I drifted slowly into the embrace of the Sun, Sol, the center of my ideology, the center of my being. It engulfed me in flame and wrath, and I laid submissive to its hunger. Sol, the only being that could best me, would be my judge. It held me in a trance, and my hands fell off the console like leaves in fall, leaving behind their purpose, seeking a higher level, some unatainable future.\n\nSol would consume me, just as I had consumed the galaxy.\n\nThen my Repair Kits kicked in and I OUTHEALED THE ♥♥♥♥ING SUN. 10/10 WOULD OUTHEAL SUN AGAIN.","February 8, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

That said, it is FREE, so all you lose is time.\n\nThe game art is really good. The tutorial is barebones but gets the job done. You start out with a small, weak ship that can only kill some satellites without too much danger. When you earn more money, you can get better ships. Even the second ship is good enough to fight some enemies with so you can do more. The combat with enemy ships was fun, but it was sometimes too hard to find them.\n\nThe game does a good job of communicating when you're near an enemy that will kick your butt too hard. One detail I loved is that if you fly too close to a sun, you start to take damage.\n\nThe problems with this game are mostly with the interface, specifically the camera. The only control problem is that you can only go forward and rotate. While it was somewhat cool to build speed and then fly backwards like the Space Shuttle reentering the atmosphere, it makes combat harder. The other problem is that because of the poor view, you have little time to react if an asteroid suddenly appears in your path. This is a big deal because collisions bypass your shields and damage your hull. The problem with this is that if you are stationary, you will automatically repair if you have a repair tool. If you have taken more than 2 or 3 points of damage, it will use up one tool, no matter if you are repairing 4 points of damage or 20. Unless you move or shoot, in which case it will stop, requiring you to use another tool if you want to repair again.\n\nThe camera troubles continue when approaching planets. It will swing around so the surface is below you, which is nice, but it gets annoying when you fly around that threshold and the camera keeps moving back and forth. Also, it's far too zoomed again, so you can't see the surface of the planet very well.\n\nI did have some fun with the combat, but ultimately there isn't much to do.  The game is the base of a much better one.","December 31, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Well, it's free, so why the hell not, give it a try. Definitely better than your usual pay2win, mobile-ported crap.\n\nThe concept is very neat, and the ability to seamless travel between space and planets is the definite highlight imho. Better developed, this could be a masterpiece (want it to be even better? Allow players to leave their craft and jump around platform style!).\n\nHowever, right now the game needs a serious amount of polish. The controls are awkward - I'm all for inertial flight, but no backburners? Why should I need to turn 180 and burn again to slow down? And if that has to be the case, couldn't the HUD/instrumentation help me in doing so precisely? Also, the menus are pretty ugly, and in general, all I managed to do was getting killed repeatedly by enemies way over my level. The tutorial isn't fully clear either.

Now, I've heard so many people say this to me about Blank Nova, but only now I begin to realize it. The problem isn't that there is no point, the problem is that it ceases to become fun after a short amount of time. With sandbox's, you can have no point, because the player can create his own content, in a sense. Now, when you add multiplayer, this expands into years of content and hours played.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Destination Sol needs to do either one of these things:\n-LAN or Online Multiplayer(Which is no doubt hard to do)\nor\n-Some system where a player can generate his own content(creating something)\n\nI like the game, and it has defintely gave me some ideas and insight, but it needs the time put into it to create a fun experience.","February 16, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Everything was bright and colorful, the graphics on the ads were spectacular use of my graphics card. The buttons all seem to be in the right places and everything seems streamlined and nice. Would I recommend this storepage? You bet your sweet third buttcheek I would. More review coming soon to a steam page near you.\n\nGAMEPLAY REVIEW EDIT: Ok I have played 1.9 hours of Destination Sol so by the laws of the internet, I'm now an expert on this game. I actually quite enjoyed my 114 minute playthrough. I started out shooting asteroids for cash money space bucks and ship parts but accidentally flew too far into an enemy planet's gravity-well. This led to be smacking into the ground beside a tower that began rudely shooting me. Just as I was getting into the heat of the action, I felt an almost inhumane gurgling and rumbling coming from inside my intestines. That's when I knew, I had the bubble guts. I didn't have time to turn the game off, I just ran to the bathroom while pulling my jorts off along the way. As soon as I made it to the toilet, I bent over and unleashed the most ungodly torrent of dooky juice. I'd like to say it all went well after that, but the sheer pressure from which my bowels were releasing their payload sent me rocketing out the still open bathroom door and over the railing of my loft area. I woke up an hour later on the floor downstairs, covered in my own juicy yet chunky excrement. I surveyed the damage my poop folley had caused and just knew I'd never get it all cleaned. Then I remembered Destination Sol was still unpaused and ran to my computer to check. It turns out the enemy turret got the best of my afk spaceship and, as if my computer knew of my heinous (rhymes with ♥♥♥♥ heh) crimes it decided to shut the game down and hibernate as some point during my first experience flying unaided but by the raw power of my own butt squirts.\n\nOverall, I give Destination Sol a 9 out of 10 but only because I had to burn my house down and buy a completely new one to save myself the effort of cleaning my explosive doodoo remnants. I highly suggest everyone get this wonderfully fun game but I warn you to play on an empty stomach or you too might pop an o-ring out your butt hole.","July 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I met an enemy or two every time I traveled to a new planet but it was nothing my shields couldn't handle. This game has a lot of untapped potential. You can't do much just yet but I believe with the right amount of work and concentration this can be something big. I already enjoy the mechanics and how the game plays out. The only thing I dislike is how boring it gets after an hour or two. It's that type of game you envy and enjoy for some time but get dissapointed afterwards. On the bright side it's a great time eater. You can play this to get by a long car ride or pass by the time waiting for your train to arrive to your designated destination. I have high hopes and look forwards to what this game can become.

You go to a planet shoot all the enemies on it, move on to another one.. in another solar system. Fight enemies on your way, find space stations to sell your loot, buy new stuff, ships and hire helpers! As you progress throughout planets the enemies become more and more challenging, no matter how armored you are or what shields, weapons you have. Every planet also has its own trade center, so you can go around the planet, shooting every enemy and when you made it around the planet... You can proudly sell your loot or keep the goodies!\n\nAnd now the stuff that i do not particulary enjoy about this game.\nThere are these flying trade centers that move around from planet to planet, to solar system to solar system. What i do not dislike about these flying trade centers is that its hard to get in the automatic door with your space ship.. because most of the time the trade center will be jerking around instead of staying still. Also they tend to fly in the Sun... which obviously ends up with you and the trade center burning to ashes.\nThe second thing is that the player and enemies / friendly's sometimes get stuck in a planet's ground... so the player or the NPC's are not visible nor you can shoot them.  This happpened to me once and i've seen atleast one enemy NPC get stuck underground..\n\nOverall this is a great game, it's free to play and you should totally download it!","February 20, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"Propulsion physics" feel nicely spacey; yet, the movement is responsive and arcadey. *And* it's for free.\n\nBut it kinda isn't: all enemy types except one are too strong for you at the beginning, and aside from asteroids there are very long stretches of nothing. Asteroids that you can shoot and get money from, to buy better equipment, that is – which quickly makes this turn into a farming game, 'coz there's nothing else to do. It's an action game where not much happens. Oh, and did I mention that there is literally no music?\n\nTo be fair, it might just be a working build.

It didnt feel like I was shooting and kinda ruined the magic from combat.\nThe physics were very intresting , it defenetly took me a while to get used to this type of mechanic.\nOnce you understand the game and being confident enough to carry out your journeys, It can be alot of fun.\nThe art style was fantastic; It has a weird type of "Heres some dark colours and rocky textures" but once you're on earth its more like "This is different , I can tell if im in space or on earth" which defenitly made this game more enjoyable than it is.\n\nThe game is Free to play. No strings atached.\nCOMPLETELY FREE.

It didnt feel like I was shooting and kinda ruined the magic from combat.\nThe physics were very intresting , it defenetly took me a while to get used to this type of mechanic.\nOnce you understand the game and being confident enough to carry out your journeys, It can be alot of fun.\nThe art style was fantastic; It has a weird type of "Heres some dark colours and rocky textures" but once you're on earth its more like "This is different , I can tell if im in space or on earth" which defenitly made this game more enjoyable than it is.\n\nThe game is Free to play. No strings atached.\nCOMPLETELY FREE. No ingame purchases , premium crap and such.\nI know, I can bearly believe it too.\n\nOverall I think this game is a great competitor in the F2P market.\nIt stands out from most games and I feel everyone should give it a try.","February 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can destroy astroids which drop money, or you can either defeat enemy ships and loot the leftovers. Pirate ships occasionally drop equipment, although they're not the best.\n\nI found this game really amazing and I see that it has great potential for to become one of my favorite F2P games.\nI hope this game get's updates weekly/monthly atleast to improve the game and focus toward a more completed game that allows someone to invest many hours of playing this open-world rpg.\n\nIt's be nice to make the universe a lot bigger, maybe add in something to auto-generate the universe the further you go away from the starting zone. Eventually add a lot of more ships to upgrade to, a lot more of Armor, Shields, and Weapons. It'd be awesome to add mini-quests here and there also that give you rewards of rare equipment that you aren't able to buy.\n\nOnce again, I find that this has a LOT of potential to become a really great game that I can enjoy in my free time as I progress through the the universe. If this game eventually has multiplayer implemented, that'd make an interesting aspect to PvP and also raiding on enemy infested areas.","February 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didnt expect it to be nearly as fun as I have found it to be, for it being a free to play game. But it would be a fast download so I said to heck with it and I downloaded it. Needless to say, I'm glad I said to heck with it.\n\nAs others have stated, it has a LOT of potential. I'm sure that many things will be implemented in the future and it makes me exited.(lol) You will find yourself getting frusterated..a lot.. for you will be very underpowered compared to the enemies. But dont worry you will be hooked as I did very quickly. The beginning is tedious, just spend a little time obliterating meteors or test your luck against a stationary hostile ship to get enough money for some upgrades or even a new ship. You will find extreme pleasure when you are the one dominating the enemies instead of them dominating you.\n\nOnce again I see a lot of potential in this game. It needs many things, like a plot/story, dialoge(so you dont feel lost and helpless), and maybe make the tutorial a bit more helpful/easier to understand, along with other things. If your on the edge just try it it takes like a second to download.\n\nTL;DR: The game is awesome and well worth a try. Just get it already.\n\n9/10\nWould get obliterated by another OP ship again","February 7, 2015","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is all I want out of a space exploration game, planets, orbit (kinda), enemies, and mining asteroids! One thing about this game is the weapons, there are heavy and light, although the better, stronger ships have only heavy, which is a con for me, as they are large, it would make sense for them to have turrets rather than fixed guns, but I digress. Whatever combination of weapons you choose decides how you must aproach things, for a while before my ship was a complete powerhouse I used the wasp and for my weapons, the blaster for mining and a heavy machine gun for defense. Once you are strong enough you don't need to mine, there are enemy units shelling the hell out of most planets and killing them yields mid tier loot, sell it and you profit ten times what you spent on ammo. On to tips and tricks, for new players, it's best to run from alot of fights, and don't be quick to buy things, but whenever you have enough buy the biggest ship on whatever planet you are on, the wasp is a great mid tier ship. Personally I have been using the vanguard which can be found on the imperial station in Sol, with imperial shotguns as weapons. I think the Vanguard is the best ship but I'm not too sure, I think it would be great if the devs would add battleships, like being able to pilot one of the imperial stations. In short this game is the best free game on steam right now, better than Dota and TF2 combined, and hey, it's tiny, just download it anyway.","February 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Komarov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/disgruntled_Alfred/","113 products in account","Imagine the concept of the orrignal Asteroids game fleshed out into a more hardcore production. Taking the simple thrust-turn-shoot mechanic and adding RPG and roguelike elements, and painting an aesthetic reminiscent of titles like FTL or AI War: Fleet Command (an overall product that reminds me of the Realspace 2). This could easily sell in the five dollar or greater range, though it could have just as easily been a f2p browser-based flash game in an earlier era. In an even earlier era, I'm pretty sure something similar went for about 25 cents per play, back when Atari made cabinets. ;)\nBottom line: give it a go. It's Asteroids with the depth and look of FTL, and there's even a bit of Moonlander mixed in when you land on a planet!

This is all I want out of a space exploration game, planets, orbit (kinda), enemies, and mining asteroids! One thing about this game is the weapons, there are heavy and light, although the better, stronger ships have only heavy, which is a con for me, as they are large, it would make sense for them to have turrets rather than fixed guns, but I digress. Whatever combination of weapons you choose decides how you must aproach things, for a while before my ship was a complete powerhouse I used the wasp and for my weapons, the blaster for mining and a heavy machine gun for defense. Once you are strong enough you don't need to mine, there are enemy units shelling the hell out of most planets and killing them yields mid tier loot, sell it and you profit ten times what you spent on ammo. On to tips and tricks, for new players, it's best to run from alot of fights, and don't be quick to buy things, but whenever you have enough buy the biggest ship on whatever planet you are on, the wasp is a great mid tier ship. Personally I have been using the vanguard which can be found on the imperial station in Sol, with imperial shotguns as weapons. I think the Vanguard is the best ship but I'm not too sure, I think it would be great if the devs would add battleships, like being able to pilot one of the imperial stations. In short this game is the best free game on steam right now, better than Dota and TF2 combined, and hey, it's tiny, just download it anyway.","February 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's like one of those games people make when they're still learning. And there's nothing wrong with that. It isn't buggy or anything.

Either uprade each ship seperately with money (preverable, giving money actual value) or just bigger differences in hulls other than just durability.\nsee below for those ideas:\n- increasable number of weponslots (for example three light weapons firing on one click, two heavy weapons seperately)\n- increasable ammocapacity (kinda like borderlands, or dependand on your hull [big ship=big capacity, etc.])\n- flightperformance (accelaration, topspeed, tolerance to crashing, durability in proximity to sun)\n- tougher enemytypes / enemies leveling with you (getting bigger guns or appearing in pairs as you progress)\n\n\ni have more ideas but i would be happy if you considered even one of them.\nI think your game is really promising, inspite being underdeveloped contentwise.\nThis is my first contribution to steam so take that as APPRECIATION! later dude","February 15, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is also very difficult, you'll get used to the controls but it's still kinda hard I don't suggest fighting other ships until you've bought heavy weapons, armour, and a heavy shield. This game reminds me o terraria but in space... it's just so... atmospheric. But like everything good it hase some very minor downsides, no soundtrack (that's ok if you like to listen to music while playing games) and the controls.

You know those bueroucrats, never give a working man his proper wage, i risk my life out here dammint!\n\nAnyway, back to the point, i turn up my bosters and start the usual strafing run. And then it hits me with a whole bunch of railguns at once. Shields are gone, i get the message and bail. BUT WAIT. Remeber when i said it was mobile? ♥♥♥♥ YES IT STILL IS! Apparently the petty moneyba... ahem... smugglers took offence and decided to hightail me ON A BASE.\n\nSo i burn the void and try to hide in the asteroids, nearly smashing my ship apart. Only too see other guy from the Department (who used me as a decoy apparently) fly up behind that behemoth of a hidden space station and open with all his guns. With predictable results.\n\nAll i could do was slap my head, sigh and go back to base for repairs. And THAT is when i notice the distnct yellow-greenish miner colours appearing from the nearby rock and start hearing crazed shouts about mining rights of free the system, or whatever, from the communicator. I couldn't even turn my ship before the nutter opened up and nailed me to an asteroid. Frakking miners.\n\nAnyway, welcome to Sol recruit, and never forget your emergency respawner on the base.\n\n\n\nThat stuff up there? Actual gameplay.

Then this one mobile base shows up and my first reaction is "Oh, great, finally a bonus to my wage". You know those bueroucrats, never give a working man his proper wage, i risk my life out here dammint!\n\nAnyway, back to the point, i turn up my bosters and start the usual strafing run. And then it hits me with a whole bunch of railguns at once. Shields are gone, i get the message and bail. BUT WAIT. Remeber when i said it was mobile? ♥♥♥♥ YES IT STILL IS! Apparently the petty moneyba... ahem... smugglers took offence and decided to hightail me ON A BASE.\n\nSo i burn the void and try to hide in the asteroids, nearly smashing my ship apart. Only too see other guy from the Department (who used me as a decoy apparently) fly up behind that behemoth of a hidden space station and open with all his guns. With predictable results.\n\nAll i could do was slap my head, sigh and go back to base for repairs. And THAT is when i notice the distnct yellow-greenish miner colours appearing from the nearby rock and start hearing crazed shouts about mining rights of free the system, or whatever, from the communicator. I couldn't even turn my ship before the nutter opened up and nailed me to an asteroid. Frakking miners.\n\nAnyway, welcome to Sol recruit, and never forget your emergency respawner on the base.\n\n\n\nThat stuff up there? Actual gameplay.

Perhaps I can't say for sure whether the game is good or not, since I've only played it for 1.7 hours. But I cannot recommend this to other players at the moment.\n\nI went into this game with high expectations; sure, it was a freebie, but it got very positive reviews. But after 1.7 hours, here is how I feel.\n\nThere isn't an overarching plot or story to the game. Sure, you pilot your ship around between two systems, fire your blaster or machine gun at anything orange on screen, earn some money, trade your ship in for a bigger one, etc. etc. But, in the end, since there isn't a story for the game, I can't feel that there is an end goal to reach towards, and I feel no sense of accomplishment for anything that I do in this game.\n\nPros:\n- Simple controls\n- Free roaming/Open universe\n- Space!\n\nCons:\n- No music\n- So little content\n- No plot or purpose\n\nIf this game were an early beta release, or if the developers are merely showcasing what they can do, I would understand that. Once again, this is a freebie, so knock yourself out if you want to try it out. But, considering my feelings, I can't recommend it.

It's easy to run out of ammo. If you run out of ammo, you have to go into the item screen to change  your gun, The game doesn't pause when you do this.\n\nPlanets are awful. The camera is so close to your ship it's hard to see if you're going to run into something. It's easy to get hung up on the ground or guard tower. When you land on a trade station, youir ship keeps trying to follow your crosshair. This can result in your ship rolling off the pad.j\n\nShips have no trade in value. If you buy a ship that costs $400, then decide you want a different ship that costs $300, you're out $700.\n\nThis isn't a bad game, per say. There's fun to be had here. It just comes with a lot of small annoyances.

It's got the whole space feel to it, with the whole "waiting to get there" kinda thing when you wanna fly to a certain far away place. And even though it's a little annoying, i like it. There are even little warp stations, and they're not too common and not too uncommon, and they take you to the right places, it seems. For me it seems that there's a big gap in the flow, im currently looking for good mercenaries to hire so i can try to take on one of those hostile planets, but i dont even know if i can stay on one for a solid 30 seconds. I'd like to see new systems, new blah blah blah, please add more stuff, i really like this game. and...uhh, well, there were two warp stations that kinda merged with eachother and...long story short, they split my ship into two and it crashed the game. other than that, fantastic work","February 9, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Altogether, it's a relatively competent entry into the genre of top-down space sims. That's the thing though. It's only "competent". Space physics and planetary gravities work. Weapons and secondaries work. Everything WORKS...but it doesn't work spectacularly. Steering with the mouse and a single button is awkward, though anyone familiar with the genre will quickly get the hang of reverse-thrusting to brake and pointing where they need to go with a series of quick taps to manuver. However, fighting gravity with the need to periodically aim up into space to keep aloft in atmosphere doesn't feel natural, particularly when enemy ships circle the planet so much more gracefully. Steering isn't so well controlled or natural that you won't end up crashing into things and losing health. Then there's the weapons. Firing with the mouse wouldn't be so bad, but it doesn't compensate for your momentum, so you actually have to learn to aim AWAY from your target to hit them. The starting blaster, which has infinite ammo, is more powerful than the limited ammo guns you can get for defeating hostile ships. The starting ship is just outright BETTER than the higher class ship you can swap to, which can't equip any guns at all unless you buy an expensive weapon for it, still needs ammo, and doesn't even seem to do as much damage, since the impressive number on said gun is divided among a spray of rapid-fire shots that mostly miss the target. Meanwhile the ship itself is a bigger target, and even with more armour than the basic ship, I found myself limping away with my tail between my legs from fights that the first ship could win with nary a scratch.\n\nAll of which begs the question, why on Earth would I recommend this game?\n\nWell, it may be flawed in many ways, but it isn't broken. In fact, it actually IS fun. True, those of us used to the tight controls and depth of something like, say, the Escape Velocity series may find Destination Sol lacking, but it has a unique charm and design of its own. The gravity well environments, while taking some getting used to, offer a new dynamic to the game. For all I may gripe about the upgraded ship not being as good, I find myself genuinely interested in practicing with that beginner ship, and seeing just how tough of opponents, what lofty challenges, I can face in it. It's not a game I'd play for hours on end, but it's a game I'd spend a few minutes on again and again.

While the patterns of flight may be off and this leaves the game lacking in some departments, game enthuisists and space nuts, both like myself, will enjoy this game. Its's harder to play style leaves for more work but feeds a desire to go indepth within the game.

Altogether, it's a relatively competent entry into the genre of top-down space sims. That's the thing though. It's only "competent". Space physics and planetary gravities work. Weapons and secondaries work. Everything WORKS...but it doesn't work spectacularly. Steering with the mouse and a single button is awkward, though anyone familiar with the genre will quickly get the hang of reverse-thrusting to brake and pointing where they need to go with a series of quick taps to manuver. However, fighting gravity with the need to periodically aim up into space to keep aloft in atmosphere doesn't feel natural, particularly when enemy ships circle the planet so much more gracefully. Steering isn't so well controlled or natural that you won't end up crashing into things and losing health. Then there's the weapons. Firing with the mouse wouldn't be so bad, but it doesn't compensate for your momentum, so you actually have to learn to aim AWAY from your target to hit them. The starting blaster, which has infinite ammo, is more powerful than the limited ammo guns you can get for defeating hostile ships. The starting ship is just outright BETTER than the higher class ship you can swap to, which can't equip any guns at all unless you buy an expensive weapon for it, still needs ammo, and doesn't even seem to do as much damage, since the impressive number on said gun is divided among a spray of rapid-fire shots that mostly miss the target. Meanwhile the ship itself is a bigger target, and even with more armour than the basic ship, I found myself limping away with my tail between my legs from fights that the first ship could win with nary a scratch.\n\nAll of which begs the question, why on Earth would I recommend this game?\n\nWell, it may be flawed in many ways, but it isn't broken. In fact, it actually IS fun. True, those of us used to the tight controls and depth of something like, say, the Escape Velocity series may find Destination Sol lacking, but it has a unique charm and design of its own. The gravity well environments, while taking some getting used to, offer a new dynamic to the game. For all I may gripe about the upgraded ship not being as good, I find myself genuinely interested in practicing with that beginner ship, and seeing just how tough of opponents, what lofty challenges, I can face in it. It's not a game I'd play for hours on end, but it's a game I'd spend a few minutes on again and again. At the low, low cost of free (at the time I am writing this, at least), it may not offer the best experience out there, but there's no real reason not to give it a little of your time.","February 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Then you go to a planet.  If you never had to fight things down near a planet, this game would be great.\n\nBut here's the big problem: if you are on a planet there is gravity.  Your guns are on one side of your ship, your engines are on the other side of your ship.  Enemies can shoot in any direction, you can only shoot "forward".  So... what happens when there is an enemy below you?  You have to aim your ship down.  "Then how do you not run into the ground?"  You don't not run into the ground.  You run into the ground!  "But you said engines were only on one side of your ship.  How do you back up?"  You don't.  You die to the easiest enemy in the game because you are stuck with your nose in the ground. "That doesn't sound very fun." It's really not. If they just didn't include the planets this would be 100% thumbs up.  But the inclusion of planets and gravity in a top down game ruins everything about this game.  Really disappointed.","March 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

Only saving grace is that it is free. Controlling your ship is difficult. You will just be constantly revolving around your target desperatly trying to slow down. Forget about combat on one of the planets as the controls really don't lend it's self to it. The basic ship you start with is ok and you can mine credits from the near by asteroids with easy. When you go for the next ship up you need to purchase the weapons seperately as the blaster from the first ship isn't compatible and you don't get any weapons with your purchase of the ship. You will now have a highly unaccrate slighly stronger weapon. Which also makes mining difficult and expensive as your ammo now costs credits.

I can never aim my ship where I want to, like a hitman that had one too many beers before his assignment, which is really painful because you can only move in the direction you are aiming. If you are trying to shoot asteroids (more on that later), you need to try to aim perfectly towards it while shooting. If there is an enemy, you will automagically lock on, which is nice. But you need to accelerate to dodge there attacks, which is bad because, when you stop accelerating, you still keep moving like a mouse in the middle of a ring of ice, and I get that this is a "space sim" and all, but when I'm in the middle of a space battle and I can't get to my target, it becomes a hassle because I have to try to turn around and prepare for another fly-by to dodge and get another hit or two. The enemies are standing still, by the way. And since space is such a barren wastleland, not only are the battles not interesting, but sometimes you lose track of where the enemy you were fight was.\n\nBut don't worry, there are planet scenarios, too. Except there are issues with that, too. First, it has the same momentum issue on the planets, except it drags you down to the surface (obviously). The issue with this is that you don't slow down on your left and right movement because you aren't sure if the big red button is ACTIVATE GRAVITY SIMULATORS or SELF-DESTRUCT, and if you do, I couldn't notice any until I hit the ground, which, more often than not, will do at least a little damage to you. And this becomes a huge problem with the randomly generated terrain. It also makes manuevability during battles a pain, as you attempt to target one enemy, and try to dodge it at the same time gets utterly painful against enemies with fully automatic weapons. Sometimes my aim would spaz out on planets because apperantly the drunk hitman was just waken up by a swat team and is still suffering from his hangover , which remember, you can only move in the direction that you are aiming, which would lead to my death because I can't escape a sticky situation like I normally can.\n\nThere are a few progression aspects, but getting new ships, weapons, and more ammo requires money. How do you get money? Grinding, of course! You could grind off of the previously mentioned space enemies, or you can get money from asteriods! Shooting asteriods, for similar reasons as enemies, is a pain, with much less payout, but since these don't shoot at you, it's less risky. What will you spend money on? Well, there are only a few types of weapons, only a couple per ammo type, and a good shield helps a lot, but the real key to success is getting tons of repair kits. Low on health? Stand still for a couple seconds and you're good to go! They really seem overpowered. Although, I guess you need them to carry Team member 2 "Bad controls" on their bare back for a chance at survival.\n\nWhile I was reading the reviews for this game, wondering what others said, I found one person complaining about how they were mislead into thinking they were going into a game with RPG elements. The developer responding to this, saying, and I quote...\n"We are sorry if "RPG" tag was misleading for you.\nActually this game has some RPG elements. It's not full featured RPG, but you can customize your ship with different equipment, grab and trade loot and you free to choose where to go and what to do in open world, therefore it marked with RPG tag."\nI don't believe these elements are stricting for RPG's. Customization and trading are both apart of Team Fortress 2, and the open world aspect is apart of Minecraft, two games I don't think anybody considers RPG's. And if they do, they are probably the drunk hitman. The point is, when I think RPG's, I think leveling up your character and their stats! I think party members! And quests! 3 things that Destination Sol has none of. Sure, it has mercenaries that you can hire, which is kinda like a party system, but that's not a permanent member of your team as far as I can tell. And that's only scratching the surface of possible RPG elements that the game missed out on that, let's be honest here, could have actually worked well.\n\nFinally, is there anything redeeming I could find out of this experience? Actually, a better way to put it would be "any enjoyment I could squeeze out by getting a dough roller and rolling back and forth for a nearly an hour", but the answer is "a little bit". The progression, while limited, looks like it has potential, and if the traction issue while flying is fixed, let go any direction while facing anywhere, as well as some aiming fixes, this looks like it could have been much better and actually pretty fun. Around each planet there is a teleporation device with a small fee, which, while the cutscene are overly long, like a makeout scene in a movie that your date is making you watch that you just want to end, is very useful.\n\nOverall, while some things smaller things in the game (like a suprising small world issue that I didn't address) rubbed salt in the wound, it was the terrible controls that opened the wound in the first place and poked a couple of razor blades in for good measure. If all my complaints with the controls were fixed, I would try it again, and I can see myself giving it a much better review. I can also see this as an experimental game, as this person isn't making profit what-so-ever, so, if the dev is reading this, just imagine this same review, but in a less rage-y form. There's your constructive critisism. As I said earlier, if there are some changes made, I'll gladly revisit this. But for now, I think I'll get the razor blades out of my arm, get that poor fellow out of the movie theater, give a bunch of pilots flying lessons, and try to get the hitman under control. In that order, of course. Let's see... I think we should yank it out! "Doctor, I-" SHUT UP NURSE! I KNOW WHAT'S BEST!\n\nEDIT: Ok, for some reason, this has gotten lots of bad ratings from people who liked the game. I honestly couldn't find much appealing. So, If you've played this game and you like it, how do you address my argument against it? No, seriously, I'm baffled on how anybody could like this!","February 6, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 30 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","6","30","2","0"

Having to always micromanage your inertia and speed slows down an otherwise great action game down to space simulation crawl. I know some people might enjoy this, but for the few of us who signed up for a 2d action game it would be nice to make the pyschics optional if only just for the ship. Otherwise it completely grinds against the grain of going fast that ction games usually have, so it's always usually just a juggling game of staying completely still and get to pieces or try and maintain control of your ship while it zips uncontronably around smashing into debris and ships alike.","March 8, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s got the feel of a top-down space ship fighter game, but has the physics + the gravity to match. The big open world filled with random enemies, space mines, huge suns, warp speed launchers, with a somewhat complex weapon/armor/perk system with enemies using and dropping the same weapons you can obtain. Art style is ok, mainly focused on making the ships look good. Mechanics are great, movement is flawlessly smooth, since everything is set in a randomized orbit, crazy things can happen. (i.e. I once had the main starting space station collide with a random small planet.)\n\nI feel like a good 3-8 dollars could be offered for this game and still maintain a reasonable price.\n\nA great recommendation for all comers, not only because of the no-price offer, but because it is an amazingly well-built game.\n\n~Wolfy\n","June 11, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game certainly has a lot of potential and I am excited to see what it becomes in the future, however, in it's current state it seems fairly empty to me. Destination Sol has all the mechanics it needs to become a great game, but it seems almost devoid of content at this point, I mean, it's tagged as an RPG but doesn't even have any quests (I think, I havn't played a massive amount). When this game gets some content to make it feel less empty, I will wholeheartedly recommend it, until then, I give it a 5/10, however if you're just looking for something to waste a couple minutes on, get it now, it's free, there's no reason not to, but if you are looking for an immersive gaming experience to play for hours on end, I see no reason to download this game.\n\nQuick Review:\n\nPros -\n1. Free.\n2. Fun if you just want to blow stuff up and crash into things, and admit it, we all want to do that sometimes.\n\nCons-\n1. Is quite empty in it's current state.\n\nTips For Developer:\n1. ADD CONTENT! At this point Destination Sol is all mechanics and nearly nothing else.\n2. Change the name, unless I'm completely missing the point of the game and I'm supposed to be going to the Sol system instead of wandering around fighting pirates, the name doesn't really fit with the rest of the game.\n3. Make the ship respawn automatically when you die, it makes the game seem more polished, just a tip though, not really a major thing to fix.\n4. Change the title screen, when I first got to the title screen I thought I had accidentally downloaded a horror game, it just looks like it would set the mood for a horror game better, try a sleek, futuristic look for the title screen if you change it.","May 11, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world while not huge, still very expansive for such a small game with many different types of challenging and fun enemies. The AI is hilarious as I found some of the trade ships running right into the sun.\n\nNot too many cons other than it is a short game atm, I found a few bugs due to falling into the ground of planets unable to get out but it only happened a couple times.\n\nVerdict: I found this a very fun game, I'm a huge fan of anything space, and I really hope they add to this game in the future, totally reccomend you at least try it.","August 29, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The in-game UI and stores/inventory could use much work as well. When I started playing about an HR ago I had in mind a game for the "NES" call'ed Solar Jetman: Hunt for the golden warship. This game could very well pull off a moderate version of that game, given a bit of work especially on the ship controls. Some the weapons are a bit... dull and make little sense.. Shotguns in space? My best advice would be too check out Escape Velocity Nova, SPAZ, and Solar Jetman on the NES. That would greatly help with not only ideas but also with nailing down some the issues with the games ship controls, the funky planets and "landing on planets?" But overall as it stands I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current shape until it gets a bit further along, especially better resolution support, and a more functional menu system.","May 30, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game certainly has a lot of potential and I am excited to see what it becomes in the future, however, in it's current state it seems fairly empty to me. Destination Sol has all the mechanics it needs to become a great game, but it seems almost devoid of content at this point, I mean, it's tagged as an RPG but doesn't even have any quests (I think, I havn't played a massive amount). When this game gets some content to make it feel less empty, I will wholeheartedly recommend it, until then, I give it a 5/10, however if you're just looking for something to waste a couple minutes on, get it now, it's free, there's no reason not to, but if you are looking for an immersive gaming experience to play for hours on end, I see no reason to download this game.\n\nQuick Review:\n\nPros -\n1. Free.\n2. Fun if you just want to blow stuff up and crash into things, and admit it, we all want to do that sometimes.\n\nCons-\n1. Is quite empty in it's current state.\n\nTips For Developer:\n1. ADD CONTENT! At this point Destination Sol is all mechanics and nearly nothing else.\n2. Change the name, unless I'm completely missing the point of the game and I'm supposed to be going to the Sol system instead of wandering around fighting pirates, the name doesn't really fit with the rest of the game.\n3. Make the ship respawn automatically when you die, it makes the game seem more polished, just a tip though, not really a major thing to fix.\n4. Change the title screen, when I first got to the title screen I thought I had accidentally downloaded a horror game, it just looks like it would set the mood for a horror game better, try a sleek, futuristic look for the title screen if you change it.","May 11, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The in-game UI and stores/inventory could use much work as well. When I started playing about an HR ago I had in mind a game for the "NES" call'ed Solar Jetman: Hunt for the golden warship. This game could very well pull off a moderate version of that game, given a bit of work especially on the ship controls. Some the weapons are a bit... dull and make little sense.. Shotguns in space? My best advice would be too check out Escape Velocity Nova, SPAZ, and Solar Jetman on the NES. That would greatly help with not only ideas but also with nailing down some the issues with the games ship controls, the funky planets and "landing on planets?" But overall as it stands I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current shape until it gets a bit further along, especially better resolution support, and a more functional menu system.","May 30, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels a little empty, and would absolutely benefit from more content, but what is there is a lot of fun to play.\nIt doesn't have a save system, which is potentially a point against it; I quit expecting to be able to return where I left it, and I can't. But that said, I'm not terribly upset about that, especially since it's a free game.\n\nDefinitely worth it.\n\nEDIT: The game does have what is basically a save system: when you start up the game again and click New Game, you have the option to start as a "Previous Ship", which loads you as the ship you last had in-game, complete with the equipment and inventory!

As soon as i got in the tutorial taught me the basics. Or so I thought. After playing for about 5 minutes I realised that I have absolutely no clue what the point or basic plot of this game is. Is there a goal? Why am I smashing these asteroids; and how does money seamlessly generate from the rubble left behind? Oh well, it's a space game right? With mediocre standards, and about 5 or 6 games to base my thoughts off of I would say that this game has to potential to become good but isn't in it's current state.\nwould uninstall again/10","March 28","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly, there is very little accessible for a good while into the game (as an hour into the game i found 4 competent weapons, two of which vagualy matched my preferences), as well as minimal customization options (you can get a ship that has a single slot for one weapon type as opposed to a ship that has a single slot for another weapon type).\nthe ship is controlled by exactly one thruster, meaning you accelerate in the direction you are facing, which can work in some games and some layouts. however, the turn rate is frustratingly slow and overtorqued, in the way that if you land on a planet (which considering it was highlighted feature is annoying to find it has absolutely no use) and you move your mouse slightly (the turn control and ALSO used to access your menu), you rock and roll around in a ridiculous manner, possibly causing damage to yourself and potentially moving into the line of fire of one of the generated enemies (did i mention that the only way to pause in-game time is to enter the main menu?).\npros (kinda):\ni will say the transition between outer-space and planetary space is seamless, although it was very disorienting the first several times as there is NO indication that your frame of reference shifts as you approach a planet and that the compass that sometimes appears is an idiation of 'universal north'.\nI have not looked into the open-source aspect of the game, but other than the point on the shop page, there is no indication of it in-game, or anywhere else i saw (i didnt look very hard either).\nthe game is truly as it claims to be when it says it is free, so i have no complaints about that.\nit is also smooth/solid fps, which is cool and enables you too see nice details on the planet surfaces like trees and snow, but it also makes it very easy to see all the things that are not-so-nice.\n\nTLDR:\nbasic rpg-ish with slow progression, there are no instructions at all, no key binding options, the controls overlap, messed-up motion mechanics, minimal items, interesting physics/inertia, entirely actually free, smooth, interesting graphics.","June 4","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
