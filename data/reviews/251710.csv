The largest amount of influence you have is to decide what gear you buy at the start of the game, after that a Choose Your Own Adventure novel allows more player agency. You get to decide whether to try to shoot before engaging in melee with enemies. That's the full sum of your available decisions in at least 90% of the average game.\n\nI suppose if you are really bored it might be worth it at 50% off. Do not buy this expecting the Games Workshop magic, though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/251710/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","01. GENRE: A Sci-fi boardgame adaptation with card driven encounters.\n\n02. SETTING: Chainsaw Warrior is based on the Games Workshop boardgame of the same name first released in the eighties.  It is set in a future version of New York, in the year 2032 which is under invasion from evil, otherworldy forces.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: A mysterious portal has appeared in the heart of the city from which deadly minions pour forth commanded by a dark malevolent force that calls itself Darkness.  After several failed counter-attacks to liberate the city a retired, almost forgotten war hero is called upon, to mount one last desperate attempt to thwart the evil that is about to consume the city and send it to the otherside of the portal.  As the player you take on the role of this soldier, armed to the teeth with the best gear science can offer.  With only an hour left before New York disappears forever, you face the toughest challenge of your glorious career.  Will you defeat Darkness in time?\n\n04. GAME MODES: As per the original boardgame; only one game mode - singleplayer.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY: Gameplay relies heavily on a combination of revealing consecutive cards and then choosing from a few key actions from the options that present themselves and/or rolling dice to determine the outcome of said actions.  Including combat, evading, discovering equipment, using items and avoiding/disarming traps. The games begins with the creation of a character by rolling the core stats, special abilities & starting equipment including: Melee weapons, firearms, heavy weapons, devices, clothing and special items.\n\nOnce the player is ready they must reach and kill Darkness within an hour of game time.  Movement is abstracted with the turn of a card representing progress made towards your goal is located.  Every card and each action costs 30 seconds in time.  There are two decks of fifty-four cards, each deck representing a day and night cycle.  Cards consist of encounters with enemies, traps and obstacles designed to slow progress, discarded equipment and special transit cards.\n\n06. MECHANICS: There are no complicated mechanics.  A combination of dice rolls and modifiers are used to deterime character stats, combat and action successes or fails.  Different cards are used to represent encounters and other events.  They split into four main types: transit, enemies, inventory and traps.  The final boss is Darkness and has a special card.\n\nEquipment has a huge impact on success or failure.  Melee combat takes a weapon's modifier adds it to hand-to-hand skill and the roll of a dice, compared to the enemy's skill and dice roll.  Firearms require a certain roll equal to or less to a particular enemy from dice rolls and the marksmanship modifer.  Devices allow you to perform certain actions or provide modifiers and nulify penalties in combat or in a given situation like if it night.  Firearms are also limited by the amount of ammo in the magazines.\n\nIf an enemy is encountered on any card the player can choose to shoot in the first turn of combat or engage in melee combat and thereafter remain in melee combat or attempt a special action.  Combat is determined with one or two dice rolls.  If the player loses a combat turn they take damage and lose 30 seconds.  If they win the enemy is killed.  In the event of a draw the player may be able to choose a special action such as: fleeing, taking a lucky shot or hiding.  Players are defeated by: dying in  combat, by radiation or venom, running out of time or facing Darkness without a special weapon.  Additional actions such as fleeing combat, hiding from enemies, taking a lucky shot can be made if the player is injured during a combat turn.\n\nThere are several types of common enemies including: zombies and rat-packs with different combat stats.  Chaos agents are varied come with special abilites such as; forcing the player to drop equipment or the ability to KO the player and losing them a large amount of valuable time.  Mutants, Slime and the Meat Machine are tougher, rarer enemies that are particular difficult to kill and in turn can hurt or kill the player in quick-time.\n\nThere are also around half a dozen different traps which have different effects on play such as: slowing the player down, disabling equipment or hurting the player.  All of these can be nulified or disarmed with equipment, devices or weapons if carried.  Day & Night is divided when you reach the 30minute mark.  During the night time your abilities suffer unless you are equipped with certain items and the enemies become stronger.  Fear not though as your character can encounter discarded items during their journey.\n\nAwaiting you is Darkness, the final encounter somewhere in the second deck. This end of game boss is a tough hombre and can only be defeated if equipped with either a Laser Lance or Implosion Vest.  The latter resulting in a stalemate.  Make no mistake Darkness makes for a worthy opponent and more likely that not you will die, even on Easy difficulty.\n\n07. A.I: Due to the simple yet elegant design no A.I is required.\n\n08. GRAPHICS: These are minimal 2D art based creations.  Nothing amazing but they do the job and immerse you in the game's setting.  The cards are well-drawn and a little variation is used to add to the sense of immersion.\n\n09. INTERFACE & CONTROLS: Point and click.  Basic interface includes HUD showing player stats, encounter information and dice rolls.  Action buttons display according to options available.  Placement is pratical and efficient.\n\n10. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A simple repetitive yet catchy tune in a Midi format plays continuously. It oozes atmospehere and captures the ambience of the setting, increasing in tempo as the action increases in pace.  Combat has some nice weapon effects.\n\n11. VOICE ACTING: There is none except in the opening cutscenes, unless you count the mocking laughter of Darkness as Voice acting.\n\n12. DIFFICULTY: There are three difficulties: Easy, Normal & Hard.   These affect the way in which player stats are determined at the start of the game.  Higher stats are more prevelent in Easy mode.\n\n13. PLAYTIME: 15-20 hours to complete all achievements.  Overall a typical game can take between 1 and 30 minutes depending on how long you manage to survive and reach Darkness.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems other than achievements not working, mostly in the week after they were added.  On two occasions. That said the developer fixed them a week or so later.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Overall there are no time-consuming or difficult.  They mainly consist of complete game at each difficulty level, perform x number of kills or actions, take y amount of damage, defeat Darkness z times. Perhaps the most difficult to discover is the achieve all 9 outcomes.\n\n16. DLC: No DLC.  But the game has a spin off - Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of Night.\n\n17. APPEAL: This game will appeal mostly to fans of the original boardgame and casual players, maybe those of you looking for some quick time-killing distraction that you can enjoy and forget.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT: Given the games limited scope, short games and repetitive nature it is very enjoyable in short spurts.  Ideal if you're waiting for something quick and need some distraction.\n\n19. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: The game was designed to be almost infinitely replayable, if rather repetitive.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: The game is fairly cheap and one that I purchased at full-price.  I haven regreted it one bit.\n\nVERDICT: A cheap enjoyable card-driven game.  Simple in its execution, elegant in its design, with a good deal of sophistication in its play.  If you are a fan of Games Workshop or the original boardgame, or fancy playing numerous short turn-around games then this is a good buy.  Its one of my favourite games.","March 21, 2015","true","22.1"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","34","40","2","0"

And into this, the Chainsaw Warrior, destined to bear the Laser Lance slung over a cybernetic shoulder. It is I, this reviewer, who alone can tell you of his suicide mission. Let me tell you of the minutes of heroic sacrifice."\n\nChainsaw Warrior was an old board game by Games Workshop, created in 1987. This version is a direct adaptation of that game. For this reason, it may appear overly simplistic for many computer gamers.\nBeings from another dimension threaten to destroy New York and you, a cybernetically enhanced elite warrior (think 6 Million Dollar man meets Snake Plissken) have 60 minutes to get in the quarantine zone, fight your way through zombies and mutants and reach the big bad "Darkness" and hope you'll be able to kill it.\n\n"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. The Chainsaw Warrior will be that man. Better than he was before. Better... stronger... faster."\n\nYou roll 6-sided dice to create your chainsaw warrior and pick your starting equipment.\nHow many dice you roll depends on which one of the three difficulty levels you choose. While all have the potential for the same stats, on higher difficulties these are more random.\nEquipment is either chosen freely on Easy or blindly on higher difficulties.\n\n"New York, 2023: The entire city is on the brink of destruction. The old municpal buildings' staircases are mined. The elevators are booby trapped. And an apoclyptic cult has everything locked down. They think.\nBased on the board game by Stephen Hand, Auroch Digital's Chainsaw Warrior:\nOne man must go in where no man stands a chance to ever get out. And if he fails his mission, our nightmare has just begun."\n\nThe game comprises of you turning over cards from a deck, each card being one room you search. Once the first 54 card deck is done, you proceed to the second one which includes Darkness. But the clock is ticking: each turn of a card, each round of combat, each other action are 30 seconds and there are 108 cards to turn. So you have to move through the building as fast as possible, conserving ammo and trying not to die of radiation or poison or zombie bites. In the end, when you finally get to Darkness, it may all come down to one stupidly lucky roll of double sixes. But that is what suicide missions with only a remote chance of success are all about.\n\n"So, did the Chainsaw Warrior banish the evil Darkness to its home dimension. And having no further concern, he returned to his hole-in-tjhe-wall appartment. Many cans of beer did the Chainsaw Warrior drink, trying to numb the memories. Yet honor and glory were heaped upon his name and, in time, he was called to save the world once more... And this story shall also be told."","October 10, 2013","true","18.4"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/251710/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","Single player card game where you dig through two 54 card decks on a time limit to defeat the very uniquely named big bad, "Darkness". Most card games have enough randomization because of the shuffling of cards, luck of the draw, and so forth, but for some reason Chainsaw Warrior feels the need to add die rolls to almost every action, including stats during character creation. On Hard difficulty the game can be over before its even begun because of bad die rolls for stats or bad card draws for equipment (because you're only allowed to chose catagory, not specific items). [Quick anecdote: Mark Rosewater at WotC noted that the main reason the Star Wars CCG failed was because fans hated having to roll dice for everything in a card game.]\n\nEven if you perfectly pick your loadout and get decent stats, many cards in the play decks have incredibly gamebreaking abilities. For example, one card makes you reshuffle all the cards in the deck and start over, another will break your sole win condition weapon, and another will make you lose several turns (randomly decided how many, of course). The most frustrating part is these cards might as well say "You Lose!"... but they just tease you into playing an unwinnable game. Many cards also have stat debuffs (zombie venom or radiation) that stack over time and are difficult to remove, providing yet another way for you to lose the game.\n\nOf course, being a cheap, direct iOS port also brings a slew of other issues. A touch screen interface with gigantic oversized buttons, "click-click-click to play" gameplay, and worst of all, savescumming. The decks are shuffled at the start of the game and are never reshuffled unless you trigger a certain trap. While this is realistic, it makes for bad video game gameplay. To put it simply, you can save the game every card and reload if you make a huge mistake or if you want to redo a fight (even the end boss!). This removed all of the challenge and distilled the game down into simple die rolls and restarts. While it is ignorable, you will still probably restart the game when you pull one of the previously mentioned "almost game-ending" cards.\n\nChainsaw Warrior was probably a lot more fun to play sitting on the couch on a weekend afternoon but is a huge headache in its poorly ported video game form. Only recommended for nostalgic value or for owners of the original game.","April 19, 2014","false","2.8"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","38","55","2","2"

Survive long enough and oppose all kinds of enemies and obstacles in order to defeat the final boss. The game itself is neatly presented and it looks quite good at first, especially for a solitaire board game.\n\nUnfortunately the nature of the game is very dependant on random number generation, from the character creation to the combat rolls. Which kind of makes it extremely random and luck dependant rather than skill and careful planning. Furthermore your options as a player are severely limited. Sometimes you will have to manage your inventory and what kind of items you want to take or use but overall you will just throw dice over and over. Each encounter is resolved by dice rolls and it's absolutely not spectecular nor interesting. At some point you are just so bored because it is not a very involving process. Also the actual animations are so minimal, that you won't get any excitement out of it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am a fan of board games and I do not mind minimal graphical presentation but this game is shallow and very boring at best.

That's how sad I am...er, WAS (I would never do anything like that nowadays, except for innumerable recent games of Arkham Horror by myself...but apart from that, NEVER)!!!\n\nThis is the first time I've tried one of these literal board game conversions, and I must say I do find it all a bit odd as a concept, but that aside this is about as successful as something like this could ever have been. And I've just spent a solid few hours trying to conquer all three difficulty levels, so there's obviously something a little bit compelling about it all. Having said that, I suspect there's a not a great deal of replayability once one has gained all three - count 'em, THREE - achievements, and I'm already two down, so how much this is worth the measly five buck asking price is up to you.\n\nMy advice would be to wait til it's on sale, and then the heck with it...how much playing time do you expect for two or three dollars? Skyrim won't be that cheap anytime in the next decade, so by all means, if you're as big a nerd as me, and want a taste of what we old ♥♥♥♥ers used to play BEFORE the Playstation 1 even existed, then it's surely worthwhile as a curiosity piece if nothing else. By the time I conquer all three difficulties I probably will have wasted five hours of my precious life, so that's about a buck an hour. Only the cheapest of cheapskates can balk at that kinda logic, surely...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","October 11, 2013","true","16.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","3"

Losing streaks like these are a result of dice-based mechanics combined with card-based ♥♥♥♥ery, which results in this game being a big ol' pile of NERD GAMBLING.

The digital version of the game allows me to play it much quicker.\n\nThe Game:\nYou take on the title role of the Chainsaw Warrior, fighting your way through a haunted building in New York filled with Zombies, Chaos Cultists, Mutant creatures, Rats and traps to the final boss. Your ultimate aim is to defeat Darkness, an evil being from another dimension who is intent on destroying you, the city and everyone in it because reasons. Mwuhahahaha! (cue spooky music)\n\nPlay is basically flipping through a card draw pile and dealing with the various encounters along the way. You are armed with weapons & equipment to help you beat the enemies & hazards blocking your path to Darkness. What gear you choose at the start is critical (pick the Chainsaw!), but more often than not the evil dice will defeat you long before you reach the final boss.\n\nThe Good:\n+ destroy Zombies with a Chainsaw\n+ plays just like the original game\n+ quick easy setup & play since you don't have to track dice rolls, counters & cards yourself\n+ comic book style card art & themed interface icons from the original\n+ atmospheric music and combat effects\n+ reasonably priced\n+ good replayability\n\nThe Bad:\n- plays just like the original game\n- dice rolls will be cruel\n- you may fail due to a bad draw\n- not especially deep\n- your decisions, while important, will often be trumped by random chance\n\nThe odd:\n- only some of the optional equipment cards from "Life & Death & An American Chainsaw" are in the game (an odd decision)\n- sadly the great Brett Ewins artwork from the original box & comic is not used (copyright issues I guess)\n\nIn Summary:\nBuy it if you owned (or wanted to own) the original and loved it\nBuy it if you want to play a unique piece of 1980's Role play gaming history\nBuy it if despatching Zombies with a Chainsaw appeals to you\nAvoid it if you hated the original since this is just the same\nAvoid it if losing often to an unlucky dice roll sends you into a frothing rage\nBuy it if it's ever on sale\nGift it to friends who like Zombie games and movies","June 26, 2015","true","10.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","3"

I however was neither of these. In fact it wasn't until the Exploration Sale (2014), that I found this game whilst browsing the usual Warhammer 40k games and came across this little gem. Since I'm neither a child of the 80's, nor was I a Games Workshop fan, I believe I can provide a fresh, unbiased review of this game. So please bear with me.\n\nFirst off, this game is completely about the luck of the roll. You roll for everything in this game, and I love it! You begin the game with a comic strip intro, and then you begin the game. You have to roll d6's to get your stats. There are no RPG "select this stat?" After you have rolled for your stats, you get some basic points that you can use to aquire weapons, HTH (Hand To Hand) weapons, and or clothing. But you must keep in mind you have a very, and I do mean very, limited amount of points, which usually for me, winds up being one gun, one HTH weapon, and that is all.\n\nAfter all this prep you begin the game full. You are thrust into New York with a background picture, on your left are cards, to your right, your actions. You turn a card face up, and then you proceed from there. Once you turn it face up, if it is an enemy, you must roll the d6, depending on what you chose. As a short example. Say you turn over a card and it is a zombie, you select say HTH, once done, a combat roll will happen and based on your starting stats, you must equal or beat a certain roll. Or conversely, you can use your weapon, say a rifle. If you roll badly though, you can and will miss and as a last resort, you will be forced into HTH or even made to try and escape the threat.\n\nYou go through the apartment blocks, and roll your way to victory! But not all the cards are of course enemies, you have some empty room cards, to which you must roll your d6's to see if anything lurks around the corner. You can get item cards, medical pack cards etc. But the majority of what you will be doing is rolling against the cards that are enemies. Once you have a chance to escape a building, you must roll through some more cards to make it out alive. Which if like me, you have been left with nothing but your HTH weapon, can be very tense.\n\nTo make it to the end you need good rolls, and you need to watch your bottom bar which includes a venom and radiation meter. If either fill up, it doesn't look hopeful for you. Amongst the threats lurking behind each card backing, is the ever present timer. Everything you do takes time. Be it reloading a weapon. Using an item. And such. Once it becomes night, your stats may go down and it may just get that bit extra harder. As if it wasn't hard enough!\n\nI'd recommend this game based on it's original HARD difficulty alone as it is brutal and who knows if you will get the rolls you need. If you're a die fan, then sadly this game only uses d6 dices. The game has the mentallity for just "one more roll, I just need one more good roll!"\n\nYou will be pulling your hair out with bad rolls.","November 30, 2014","true","4.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

The game itself plays out like a randomized card-game version of a rogue-like. I've seen many complaints about the unfairness of this game, due to its randomized nature and all, but I can't help but feel it's an unfair assumption to assume that just because it's a card game that this game is inherently intended to be a purely strategic experience. What it is at its core, is a quick-playing ride into hell.\n\nWinning is a rarity - I haven't even won one game myself, but I still like to come back to it for a quick playthrough now and then, because it's easy to learn and fun to experiment with. It's nothing more than quick romps through bloodshed and randomized weaponry, but it doesn't pretend to be more than that either. That, and although its randomized nature - including randomizing the player's selection of weapons and items - may make it seem as though there isn't any room for strategy at all, the game does indeed have strategy in the same way most gambling games do. You're hedging your bets. Betting that larger firepower won't be necessary, betting that the monster around the bend WON'T be a radioactive sludge beast, betting you can open that door without wasting bullets and thus saving precious extra in-game time to complete your mission.\n\nYou'll come close, it might be painful.

The concept and story are relatively simple: You are a super-soldier, and New York is about to be swallowed up by a black hole caused by ‘the Darkness’, a mysterious unknown entity of evilness and evil. It’s up to you to chainsaw the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Darkness and its forces, and to not let New York be sucked into an abyss in the process – you have an hour. Good luck!\n\nAs simple as the premise is, so too is the gameplay - you do anything, you roll dice. Essentially, the gameplay consists of location cards, each of which holds a certain event, and you need to deal with that event using your weapons, items, or just by moving on when there’s a clear room. Of course, chainsaw-ing a zombie in the face is still satisfying.\n\nThe sound is simple, but you’re basically just looking at the same screen with a different card all the time, so there’s not much complexity to be had, and whilst the art for the cards looks nice, don’t expect too much. Again, cards, not a 3D FPS or the like.\n\nThis particular title will probably be of great interest to Games Workshop fans, but new adopters may want to at least check the title out through reviews (see our video above) and the like before buying, as the replay value of it might be rather low to many.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332299749","October 26, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If yes then you will enjoy Chainsaw Warrior for what it is. If you were expecting anything more then you won't find it here.\n\nThe game involves creating a character via the use of dice and a selection of equipment cards. After that you'll go into the main game which has you clicking through a deck of cards to see what random events you come across, which can be traps, monsters, secret passages etc. At each event you can select between a couple of choices like using a item or attacking. Everything you do is delivered through the dice.\n\nThe presentation is okay. The art is mostly from the card game I guess, animations are basic and sound assets aren't anything special, the intro comic is quite neat though. But to me it feels so much more could've been done with this setting, like having the Warrior and Mutants visually on the screen and having them fight it out etc.\n\nI bought the game during a sale for a couple of dollars which to me feels like the right price for this game. The game is ok but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone except to people who want a digital version of the card game. The game length is also very short, but due to the random nature it can take you between 30 minutes - 3 hours depending on difficulty.","December 4, 2013","false","1.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

For those that can get into Card and Dice based game play, then you will find this a fun and challenging treat. Based/Remade to resemble the 1987 board game, this game pits one cyber commando on a near impossible mission to wade through tons of traps, mutants, abominations and zombies until he meets and defeats his hardest foe yet, Darkness!\n\nThe game uses a simple D6 based rule system. One of the really neat features of the game is you start off by rolling your character stats and equipment options. The built in tutorial does an ok job of explaining everything, there where a few occasions where i was left wondering how the game decided on a certain number i had to meet or beat.\n\nThis game is no pushover, and sometimes a bad roll of the dice will just ruin you. For me, that's the fun in it, trying to bounce back from an already bad situation. Even though the odds are stacked against you, there are plenty of goodies and items to help you along your way. All items offer different perks and stat boosts, allowing you to approach the game in a few different ways. Sporting three difficulty modes, it helps oneself get used to how the game works and allows for you to experiment with weapon and item combinations.\n\nIts a simple game at its core, but it has excellent replayability due to its hard difficulty curve and random encounters/events. Pick it up if you are into boardgames or looking for a challenge. The Doctor Approves.","May 12, 2014","true","10.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Warriors are thrilling. And yet, somehow, Chainsaw Warrior is not quite the be-all-end-all of gaming experiences I hoped it would be. Even so, it's still more enjoyable than any other sci-fi horror Solitaire game on the market. In this PC port of a one-player card game from Games Workshops, you play as the eponymous CHAINSAW WARRIOR, a cybernetically-enhanced combat veteran called back in for one more job - to save New York from a teeming horde of extra-dimensional monstroids led by the entity known only as DARKNESS. After a bit of preliminary character creation (which you have almost no say in), you are sent out into the urban disaster zone to murder your way to the top, hopefully with enough equipment remaining that you can take down the big galoot at the end and save New York from devastation.\n\nThe game plays out simply, and although it's highly dependent on luck, there's enough strategy and decision making involved to keep it interesting. After character creation, you head out into the city and are given one hour (120 turns) to plow through the two decks of encounter cards. Although there are some helpful encounters out there (empty rooms, ammo dumps, or short cuts if you're really lucky), most encounters are monsters or traps. Each encounter is likely to injure, poison, irradiate, or simply delay you, any of which will eventually kill you, so it's in your best interests to rush through encounters as quickly as you can. Actually clearing out both decks is next to impossible, but fortunately you (probably) won't have to. The final boss, DARKNESS, is shuffled randomly into the second deck, so you might only need to draw a single card from it to face him... or you might plow through all but one card and die, having performed a Herculean feat but still losing anyway.\n\nWhich brings me to the fact that this game is just absurdly unfair. No matter how skilled you are, six-sided dice are fickle things. One bad roll against a monster capable of killing you in a single hit will just end your game. The last boss can only be killed with two particular items, and they can be destroyed or run out of ammo along the way. An early encounter with a monster that reduces your stats permanently can hamstring an otherwise promising hero. Heck, just rolling awful stats in the very beginning, or getting lousy randomly selected equipment, can ruin your chances of victory before you even set foot into the battlefield. It's all aggravating, and the character generation process is drawn out more than it needs to be, and there's no quick reset option, and aaaaugh i hate you i hate you i hate chainsaw warrior diiiiiiie.\n\n...But honestly, winning isn't everything. There's something satisfying about the unpredictable generosity of dice rolls, very much along the lines of rolling a nat 20 and wresting victory from the jaws of defeat. As you play, you learn what threats you'll encounter, how the various items can compensate for your lousy stat rolls, and when it's justifiable to pull out your big guns and waste your precious, precious ammo. And on top of all that, the art style and general aesthetics are just the right kind of schlock 80's cyberpunk crap I adore, mixing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoonery with the occasional spot of authentically disturbing monster design... Just try to ignore the painfully bad voice-acting in the opening cut scene. I'm not about to call this a good game exactly, but it's certainly fun for a while, and the price tag is very easy on the wallet.","August 7, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My answer would be yes, as despite the random, luck based nature of the game, and its brutal difficulty, there is some enjoyment to be had here. It's based on a single-player card and dice game from the 1980s. I hadn't heard of it until the release of this version. I find it odd that it is single player as I can see the premise working well with multiple people, but I digress.\n\nIn this game, you choose a difficulty, and roll dice for your stats. Depending on your difficulty, you'll roll 1-3 dice and take various values, explained in game for your stats. Then you roll for so many equipment points, and you decide what type of equipment to take with you on your journey. From there, it comes down to what cards you draw and what equipment you have.\n\nYour goal is to get through one deck of 54 cards, and then through a second deck until you find "Darkness", the ultimate evil looking to destroy the city. Oh, and you only have one hour to do this. Every time you draw a card or engage in combat you lose 30 seconds, and you can lose time for other reasons as well. If you run out of time, well, that's it, you lose.\n\nThis game takes pleasure in screwing you, in various ways. For instance, it's entirely possible that the only weapon that can defeat the final boss, The Laser Lance, can be destroyed during the course of your game, or you can run out of ammo for it, and have to start a deck all over to get a new one. You can be forced to start over due to running into a giant chasm, running into a locked door without a way to open/break it, etcetera.\n\nDespite this frustration, there is enjoyment to be had here, and for $5.00, you can't really go wrong.","May 6, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art and sound effects are great for the setting, the intro is great the first time through (and skippable), and will challenge you, with some decent replayibility.

It is beatable on easy, but on the more difficult levels its all up to RNG.  You roll up your stats randomly, you chose your weapons and other equipment at random, you may use gear during the game on an unlucky card draw, and each combat encounter is resolved randomly.  And if that wasn't enough you are racing the clock to find the "Darkness" and kill it with your trusty laser lance.  The odds are definately stacked against you.  But still there is something about this game that I like.

You must slaughter countless zombies, rats, machines and other monsters to get to the final boss and success in defeating him.\n\nGameplay - You roll with dices to decide what happens, so the game is basically almost all based on luck. First you roll on how well your characters strats are, choose your equipment, and go battle. I must say the battles get somewhat repetitive after a while, though that doesn´t change the awesomeness and randomness of the cards.\n\nVerdict - The game tried to replicate the old card game, and it did well. The game has very suitable graphics, art style and game mechanics for it´s type. The music is quite enjoyable as well. For me, it deserves a solid 9/10. I would recommend it to anyone who likes card games. The minus point for it is not being realistic, I mean, my chainsaw ran out of petrol after 2 victims c;.

As always.\n\nScore out of 10:\n-Graphics: 1.0-9.0, what should I say...? It's a real Card game, with, you know, real cards...\n-Game engine: 6.2, has some minor flaws, like "keybindings" options without even working keys, except mouse, and long waiting time for main menu, but that's all acceptable.\n-Game mechanics: Board version 8.0 / Binary version 0.0 (it's not a smile), see below.\n-Game addiction: 9.5, like any Rogue-like game with permadeath. Updated: 7.0\n-Gameplay: 8.1, big mark for such simple concept, but it's interesting.\n\nTOTAL: 1d6+4\nSo, it's hard to judge this game for two reasons. First of all, it's a digital remake of old board game. Second of all, it's a 2014 now.\nGame developers had not so many options to make it nice to old fans and new-coming players (Should I mention fresh digitalizers like Space Hulk and Talisman or should I search for something older?). At least they can make user interface perfect, while you are not able to change or improve game mechanics. Why I can not turn "intro" comics OFF by default? Why the hell all three active areas (Cards deck, HTH-Shoot-da-Whoop and Roll buttons, Continue button) are in three different corners of the screen? Why asking always for something, that's present in single (weapon for Hth, for example). Why always Rolling character in beggining with SO many dumb button press? There is a rule of thumb: program should wait for user interaction IF and ONLY IF user can change the state of program. Here you have to press 7 times some "skip"-like button, just to see numbers appear on the screen. Hell, thanks, but no.\nOn the one hand, game mechanics are pure random in nature: "adventure map" - shuffled card deck, combat - dice based. You'll be shouting on your PC :D for sure.\nOn the other hand, game is hard to play and has a "moment of choice", moreover game will always punish you for mistake. You are not only skipping turns, waiting for some "random" output and lucky end. You have enough possibilities to change outcome, though they are limited.\n\nThe original game lacks of "horizontal balance": most of ingame items (cloth, weapon, device) can be separed on usefull in 100%  cases and useless in 100% cases. That's bad. Another problem is small amount of such items at all.\n\nWith all that said: it was fun to play. Please read AGAIN the total score I put in header for this game. It makes more sense than it seems to be:\n1d6+4 out of 10.","August 9, 2014","true","25.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is pretty much a perfect recreation of the game with some added value like no shuffling or card management and easy/medium modes. Even on easy where you get a thumb on the scales for your stat rolls and you get to choose your equipment, it's not guaranteed that you'll make it through to kill The Darkness.\n\nYou might hit the chasm, not have a rope launcher or the climbing skill and have to backtrack out of the building and lose time. The wretched lunatic might steal your IR goggles or, god forbid, your chainsaw. You might fail a reflex roll and break equipment in a fall. There are a lot (!) of ways to fail.\n\nAnd hard mode, which is the pure board game form, is brutal. Satisfyingly brutal. Killing The Darkness on hard is a nice mix of good choices and good luck.\n\nHaving played and loved the game once upon a time, it's hard for me to peek out from behind my nostalgia colored glasses (for us children of the 80's, it's probably a Miami Vice pastel...) to know whether to recommend the game to folks without that tie to the past. The game is certainly fun, but there is a certain amount of clicking through mob zombies en route to more interesting cards that's not especially exciting after the first 50+. And a lot of the game is watching what unfolds. There are actual player decisions to be made, but not every turn. A lot of times you are sort of reacting to what the cards have in store for you. It's almost a randomized adventure game in that sense. And the mechanics are a bit unbalanced. Shooting requires a reflex check to even be able to fie and has limited ammo whereas hand to hand is one roll. If you play on Easy, take the Chainsaw. :)\n\nIt's a great version of a great old board game. Hard as nails, patently unfair, good for a quickie 20-30 minute gaming session and deeply satisfying when on hard with randomized equipment you make your reflex check and shoot that smug prick The Darkness in the face.","November 29, 2013","true","10.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Bear in mind, this is essentially a card-based version of a roguelike. "Levels" are randomly generated by way of deck shuffling, your character by dice rolls, and events by card draws. You have one hour (of in-game time, spent by making moves) to reach the heart of a Warp-infested New York City, before the Army nukes the joint. Simple as that.\n\nMuch like Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, this game is meant to be played in short, fifteen-minute "coffee break" games. For the small sum of five smackers, you get a huge amount of replayability, if only because you'll need to replay the game umpteen-million times before you win at least once.

In the worst case I would get a few steam trading cards and kill some time.\n\nIn this game you take the role of a soldier whose job is to save the city. You have a limited amount of gear and a mere 60 minutes to fight your way through two decks worth of monsters and traps before using your Laser Lance (or implosion vest) to destroy “The Darkness”.\n\nThe game is very unforgiving and you should expect to lose. It is strongly recommended that you start with easy mode, the game is brutal enough that you will still need to fight tooth and nail for victory. Though the mechanics are mind-numbingly simple, the pressure of saving the world in “60 minutes” was surprisingly intense. Perhaps I just had the right mindset, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIf you haven’t already, watch the official trailer on the store page. It shows you exactly what to expect. The rules and interface of the game are most at home on a tablet, it makes no use of desktop capabilities. In fact, unless you want the steam cards, you should buy the tablet version instead. To those who haven’t watched the trailer, you click to turn over cards, you click to choose an action, you click next and then repeat the process.\n\nThough the game is largely mindless clicking with everything determined by dice rolls there is an element of strategy. You have a limited amount of time and resources to defeat The Darkness. Do you shoot now knowing you won’t have enough ammo to shoot through the next door you encounter? Do you run or hide? Do you charge head on with a chainsaw? Do you take the secret passage to travel faster but possibly miss out on finding supplies? There are lots of little choices which influence the game.\n\nTo enjoy the game you need to overlook some glaring flaws. As previously mentioned everything is random, even the equipment you start with. You may need to restart several times just to have a character with a fighting chance. There are also encounters which destroy equipment making the game even more unwinnable. To top it off there are the slimes which can kill you with one lucky roll.\n\nDespite these flaws I am thoroughly enjoying the game and intend to play until I complete all the achievements. Its an excellent time killer and you can save and quit whenever you want. I don’t really think its worth $5, but its certainly worth getting on sale.\n","August 13, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the cards are nice.\n\nThis game is worth the pain and suffering.","January 29, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a game of super graphics and 3D and all those shiny things that most people seek in a game.

One that requires pretty much no heavy thinking? And, to boot, one that pretty closely emulates a real card game experience?\n\nIf so, then this may well be the game for you. It's an authentic card game, right down to having actual dice roll on the screen, and the actual cards that you flip over. There's not a lot of strategy to it; you make your choices and the dice decides the outcome.\n\nI definitely enjoy playing it though, and it's very relaxing to play because of how little control you do have.

The game is heavily reliant on roll checks to defeat encounters, though there is a little strategy in the different weapons and equipment items you choose in the very beginning.  Beginning stats are also randomzied via die rolls, so there's no class selection or anything of the kind.  You can make your roll checks easier by choosing the easier difficulty setting, though Darkness (the final boss) will still have his way with you unless you're very lucky.  I think he could be made easier on the "easy" difficulty setting, personally.  All in all, worth the price (especially if you get the game during a sale as I did).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_q9gciZqzQ","November 29, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
