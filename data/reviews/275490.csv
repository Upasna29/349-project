That makes it difficult for me to recommend, because almost every time I try playing one of those old platformers again, I quickly lose interest. It's not that I'm against item collection by default. It's just that the act of collecting items needs to remain fun and varied throughout the game in order for me to enjoy it. In my opinion, very few item collection games successfully accomplish that. They usually become bogged down in tedium and make me feel like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nThe goal of each level is to collect whatever the game tells you to, such as gems, coins, treasure chests, or food. Doing so will unlock an exit portal, which you then have to find and enter before time runs out. Along the way you'll have to dodge enemies and various environmental hazards. The levels are usually open-ended and you can choose which area to clear first. As you finish levels, you can also unlock different characters with special abilites, such as magnetically attracting certain items, or having immunity to certain hazards.\n\nThe main problem I have is that it just feels like a chore to get anything done. Your jump height is low, so there are plenty of spots where you have to jump up multiple platforms stacked on top of each other, which feels awfully monotonous. Your movement speed is slow, so if you have to backtrack through an area you've already cleared, or loop around, it can take a while. Collecting items usually doesn't involve any creativity on your part; mostly you're just jumping from platform to platform a lot. Level mechanics don't evolve that much either, from what I've seen (about half of the game as of this writing). The game adds things like moving platforms and springs, but I never felt like there was enough to make individual levels stand out from each other. Level distinction is something I value very highly in platformers, and I don't see enough here, personally.\n\nAlso, this game can't decide whether it wants to be easy or hard. You can get hit multiple times by enemies before running out of health, and once you do, the game just respawns you somewhere nearby. In addition, you're invincible for a couple of seconds every time you're hit. So, there's little incentive to pay any attention to danger. On the other hand, each level has a fairly strict time limit, and if you run out of time, you have to start over from the beginning. On top of that, both health and time factor into your rating upon finishing a level, and if you get too many low ratings, you won't unlock the next world. What does this game want me to do? If I carefully dodge obstacles, I could run out of time; if I rush through everything, I could get hit plenty of times and get a low health rating. What usually ends up happening, especially in later levels, is that I have to replay stages to get higher ratings. That's a lot of item collecting- much more than I have the patience for.\n\nFinally, I don't like the menu interface. You can't use the mouse. The main menu constantly gets swapped with a high score table even while you're navigating it. There are buttons with pictures instead of text, and it's not obvious what all of them do at first.\n\nIf you loved the original game this one is based on, or if you're more fond of item collection games than I am, you might enjoy this. For everyone else, I can't recommend it.","April 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 135 of 182 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","135","182","0","5"

No witty wordplay or abstract analogy to somehow tie back in with the game I'm discussing, no recount of the developers history, and no commentary on how it fits in with the evolution of video games as a medium. That's because Canyon Capers allows absolutely no creative thought to entire or leave your head while you slog your way through it's glaring mediocrity, as silent pleas for it to end fill every crevice of your mind.\n\nThat likely sounds a little harsh, but Canyon Capers really doesn't give you much to work with in attempts to find fun in its hollow core. It's a floaty platformer collectathon, which unsuccessfully attempts to instill variety by swapping out the object you're hunting as you spin jump your way through nondescript, annoying designed levels as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized Cabbage Patch Kid. Controlling it is a chore, and levels are designed in such a way as to require you to go through long periods of backtracking with every minor mistake you make. It's monotonous, tedious, and so painfully amateur in every single aspect of its design that it would almost look out of place at a 24 hour game jam.\n\nI could likely go into greater detail on each and every aspect of one of Canyon Capers laundry list of flaws, but the thought of spending more time writing about it is almost as unappealing as playing it again, so I'm going to cut my short and assume I've spewed enough vitriol to get my point across. I couldn't recommend spending your time with this game if it was free in a browser, and I really can't see anyone coming away satisfied having actually paid money for it.","September 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

But even still it's hard to believe that this game made it past 'Greenlight'.  It's practically a poor man's flash game platformer, similar to the really bad titles you would see on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace (not saying all of them are bad, but a fair chunk of them are).\n\nFirst off, the graphics look cheap, and I mean REALLY cheap.  I'm just not a fan of the overly pixelated style graphics in general, but this makes that style look like a masterpiece in comparison. The backgrounds also have barely any life to them, with maybe one or two blinking eyes in a dark area or what-not and that's about it (At least that's how far I made it into the game, but I'll get to that part soon).\n\nThe sound effects are inappropriately used, whenever you jump on an enemy, a 'farting' noise is made. This sound is used over and over again and you'll soon be wanting to get through the game without going anywhere near the enemies at all. And that's another thing, getting actually 'hit' by the enemies does take your life away, but even when you die it doesn't matter. You just respawn in EXACTLY the same place you were before. So the illusion of 'game over' is completely gone.\n\nThere's also a time limit in each level, so you have to get the set amount of items and get to the exit portal before it runs out. Nuff' said.\n\nOverall, this game is a heck of a chore to get through, and if you must try it out, go to Indiegala and get it for free. Even paying for this game at a 75% discount is not worth it.\n\n-GabrielKnightStorm","September 4, 2014","false","1.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/275490/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCayon Cappers is a 2D plat former that usually handles pretty well, you unlock other characters as you get higher scores on levels (by unlocking stars). The whole concept of this platformer is to "collect all the things", after you collect the required items a portal opens and you finish the level.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I'm under the impression that you're an explorer, inside a canyon, capping gems, coins, fruit, and treasure boxes. There are 10 levels in each world, and 5 worlds to play through, each with their own "theme". Don't get too excited though, I saw little to no change in environment, only scaling difficulty at a dramatic rate, and different music.\nMost platformers don't have much of a story, you're supposed to like them because of their gameplay. Sorry, your princess is in another castle. There really isn't much else to say about the story, it's uninteresting, if barely existing at all.\n\nGame Play: I heard a great man once said, "There's a difference between difficulty, and a broken game." (I think it was either JohnTron, or ExtraCredits) As much as I wanted to hate Cayon Cappers for being a hard game, I didn't hate it until I ran into glitches.\nI would say 90% of the game is glitch free, but I ran into glitches that would respawn me in a kill zone, (aka: I would spawn and then insta-die. Good stuff) this type of failiure is one of the most frustrating that any gamer would need to endure. One particular spot on the LAST LEVEL of the LAST WORLD, I was killed and ran out of time while a bomb ticked to my immanent failure, because I kept respawning under a swinging axe blade of death.  ...After something like that you can only quit the game before you go Super Saiyan from Rage.\n\nAchievements: The first few achievements are freebie's, you literally get one for just playing called "the easiest achievement you will get". The toughest achievements are the "complete 100%" type. So if you're aiming for achievements this is doable, but only if you're good at platformers. I would originally say "this is an easy 100% for achievements", but I have reversed my opinion since world 4. I now lack 3 stars on one level: the last one. I have gotten 9000 points and still haven't gotten 3 stars. (finished it about 3 times)\n\nPrice:  I got this game for free, so I can't complain too much here, but the price for Canyon Cappers $6.99, which is a pretty high price, but if you know you love playing all playformers, you can probably make it worth it. But it would be best to get the game on sale.\n\nConclusion: I initially thought "yes! a playformer I can beat", but since the last two worlds were so brutal, my disposition has soured for this game. Additionally this game just make me feel bad for being bad, because the characters have huge smiles on their faces, and each jump is a flip.\nTo recap, the story was  nonexistent. the gameplay was painful. Achievements were pretty doable (and at times the only motivation for me). The price was reasonable. This game will appeal to people who love platformers and can over look a "childish" graphic style.","January 17, 2015","false","16.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Dino Jnr. in Canyon Capers was one of those forgotten games, personally I never played it despite being a fan of the genre and as such when I heard that some of the original developers had regrouped and made a spiritual successor in the form of Canyon Capers I was intrigued at this previously unknown entry in a genre I cared about so dearly.\n\nWhen you boot it up Canyon Capers doesn’t put its best foot forward to say the least. The menus are to put it lightly, completely terrible. They look like they were designed for a touch screen, yet this is a PC exclusive indie game. The whole thing consists of large generic buttons that as you gaze in awe of their poor design for a brief second are quickly replaced by a high score table that requires a button press to escape. It’s a minor annoyance but first impressions mean a lot. After getting past this initial hurdle however I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.\n\nCanyon Capers is intentionally ugly, at least I assume that’s what the developers were going for. Most of the environment art reminds me of the ugliness of Amiga games back in the day, while the playable characters look a little out of place and of poorer quality. The level environments have a good amount of charm to them, there’s some nicely designed tile art and tells for secret passages and such which in general looks rather nice in a charming, kinda ugly, way.\n\nI went back to see how the old DOS/Amiga game looked and it was pretty impressive how well the developers have captured the look of it. Everything about the art seems slightly dated but it’s all harking back to the original game, which is something I respect in a lot of ways, even if I find parts of it displeasing to look at. Hearing the game is equally old-school and intentionally dated. The music is fine but not memorable but the sound effects very quickly go from charming to irritating after you’ve heard the springy “Boing” when you jump for the hundredth time.\n\nThankfully, however, the core gameplay of Canyon Capers is pretty good. It’s aiming more obscurely than most entering itself into a sub-genre of platformers which focused around collecting objects to escape levels. A genre which relied on challenge in the shape of well placed enemies and level design and one which fell out of fashion quite a long time ago. The core mechanics are simple, you move and you jump. Jumping on enemies temporarily kills them and you want to jump and collect items to get out of the level. Each level has some kind of challenge, usually this consists of things like “Collect all of x coloured gem” or “Collect all the coins in a time limit” it’s simple and other games have fallen trying to use this kind of structure before but rarely do they have good controls to back them up which thankfully this game does.\n\nThe level design is actually pretty great and each level feels unique and rarely unfair, the platforming itself is responsive and fun and overall the gameplay is pretty much spot on. There are unfortunately a few levels that let the design down with springs that lead onto platforms filled with insta-kill enemies, a common one. The variation in levels is mostly “collect this instead of that” but leaderboards and scores for each level go far to encourage replayability. As does the good number of unlockable characters. There are multiple environments but they all feel pretty samey and the whole thing can all get a little boring pretty quickly.\n\nCanyon Capers is a simple, cheap and fun platformer that will definitely not be for everyone. Its’ dated art style definitely put even me off quite a bit and its mechanics are solid and well designed but perhaps a bit too simple and locked into the history of its name. That said, underneath its unimpressive exterior is a decent platformer that offers up a reasonably meaty experience and no doubt a nostalgia trip for players who grew up on DOS and Amiga games.","March 19","true","9.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

In most of the level’s game modes you have to open this vortex by doing one of three different quests:\n-	Gather all items of one kind (there’s gems, coins, treasures and food)\n-	defuse all bombs in the correct order (within an extra-timelimit for each bomb)\n-	pick up EVERY item to please the gods and collect their favor.\nIn the fourth and final game mode, the vortex is already opened and you just have to reach it, while collecting as many items as possible.\nWhile doing so, you have to deal with a strict timelimit, traps and monsters (which you can usually kill by jumping onto their head) and a leveldesign of increasing difficulty.\n\nThat’s basically what you do for 50 levels, and after a short while it gets really repetetive. The different game modes really don’t change much, especially if you want to reach a 3-star-rating for each level. In this case you’d have to collect every item anyways, so it doesn’t really matter, which game mode the level has.\n\nAdditionally there are situations where you simply die because of weird design-choices, for example when you respawn in the path of a trap, which hits you just as you respawn. Fortunately, you’re usually able to escape after one or two deaths, but there are situations which just don’t feel ‘fair’ to the player.\n\nTechnically the game has a lot of flaws aswell. The graphics are okay at best, the music is terrible (and after 14 hours of gameplay I’ve failed to find a way to lower the volume, there's just a mute-button) and the localisation is just awful. Apparently they used google-translator for almost every language, which makes anything besides english un-readable.\n\nDespite that, the game is not terrible. It’s just not good either. It’s definitely doable to finish the game in maybe 6 hours, with all achievements it might take 12. The question is: Do you really want to invest that much time (and 6$) in a subpar game, when there are so many better games to play.\n\nOn a scale from 1-10 I’d maybe give it a 3.","January 2, 2015","false","19.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Failed that section of platforming? Well you have to do it over again because there's whatever collectable you need up there. Oh, you did one moderately annoying section first? Well the exit's at the end of it, so you have to do it again. All within a time limit. And there's a horribly annoying beeping noise when your time is running low that lasts way too long, so have fun with that too.\n\nIt's not that I don't like games with timers, it just doesn't seem to work with the game design. If the game were a left-to-right get-to-the-end sort of thing then yeah it would make sense. But this is a get-all-the-things platformer where you can choose the order in which you get said thing, so basically if you go the wrong way first, you have to start over.\n\nThe music is unremarkable. The level design looks like it could be interesting, but the timer makes it so I can't really appreciate it.\n\nI get that it's going for a retro style, I think maybe Canyon Capers is leaning a little too heavily on that. Other games have taken the retro aesthetic and retro gameplay, but combine those with modern gameplay advances to make actual, enjoyable games.\n\nThere was a time when this sort of game probably would have been enjoyable, but that time has passed and I think we are much better for it.","January 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macktacular/recommended/275490/","macktacular","Charlie Foxtrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macktacular/","185 products in account","Short review: Don't buy this game, even on sale. This game is bad. I got the thing for free, no idea how, and will be deleting it off of my pc because I would rather have the empy hard drive space than own this game.\n\nControls: I don't know what people consider to be accurate terms for describing controls. Tight? Loose? Responsive? Floaty? The only way I can think to describe this game is "slippery". Your character controls like... other characters might in an ice level of a traditional platformer. Playing through eight levels of this game, I never got a handle on how the character actually controlled. When I jumped a gap I hoped they'd land where I wanted them to go, but could never feel certain. Vertical jumps were hit and miss; I'd make ones I didn't think I could, and miss ones I thought should have been easy.\n\nBut what about the character's attacks or special abilities? I can't comment on that because I have no idea if there even are any.\n\nUser Interface: It is at an absolute bare minimum. This game looks like it was made for a smartphone, with five massive buttons on the splash screen, all of which are just symbols. Want to know what the controls are, or change them? Too bad, no button for that. At least, not one that's readily apparent. Games don't have to have prompts to tell you how to do every little action all the time, but at the very least you should be able to look up your control scheme.\n\nThe hud is fairly bad. Your health-meter is a giant heart on the top-right corner of your screen. I have no idea how many hits I can take before I die, because it just gets smaller. You'll never be looking at it anyway, as it's pretty much opposite of the level time which is just a counting-down progress bar at the bottom of the screen. So yeah, everything is just vague.\n\nArt style: General: Many of the elements of the UI and such look like they were made in Flash. Now Flash can be a great and amazing program; when I say "made in Flash" I mean "made in Flash and put on Newgrounds in 2002". Much of the art uses things like oval tools and such in it's construction, such as the cow-head logo. You know, like you'd use to make art in MS Paint? It looks lazy and amateurish.\n\nArt style: Character: Character looks like they took a larger image and resized it at an unequal aspect ratio. No one wants to play as an ugly character unless you're playing a next-gen first/third person shooter ooh-rah.\n\nArt style: Enemies: Some of the enemies look alright, but many of them are things like little green mice and other cute things. They look like they should be rescued by you, not that they'll harm you. Hit boxes are fairly hit or miss as well.\n\nArt style: Level / items: You know, this is where the game is best... or least-worst. A lot of the art elements for the level design actually look pretty great. But there's a mixture of styles. You have these great shaded in-depth elements like rock pillars and platforms, or treasure chests, then off-set by cartooney coins or very flat-looking mine carts. It looks like several different people worked on different art elements and they just combined them together, rather than working together with one specific art style. It took me about four levels to realize that the pillars of flame shooting from the ground wouldn't hurt you but were actually just torches to light your way.\n\nLevel design: It's just platforming, nothing too amazing, right? Well there are parts where the game screws this up too. Some areas are only accessable by one route. That's fine for extra stuff, but when you have to transverse 2/3rds of the level to reach an area, then fall due to the poor controls, and have to start over again... in a game that's focused on timed treasure collection, that's fairly inexcusable.\n\nStory: As far as I know, there isn't one. But games don't always need a story if they're fun. But since this game isn't fun the lack of story harms it more.\n\nPlaystyle: There is no consequence for dying. There isn't a lives counter and your health meter is totally ambigious. So you could die a few times in a level and not even really realize it. When you do die, you often respawn in odd locations; there are no obvious check-points.\n\nWhen you are hit by an enemy you have invincibility frames, that's pretty great right? Except that you can't hit enemies during those frames either. So you may get hit by an enemy and then try to jump on another enemy, only pass through that enemy and "rematerialize" inside of them, which makes you take another hit. And sometimes you just go invisible, which isn't great in a game where you can't control your character very well when you CAN see them.\n\nOh and remember those minecarts I mentioned earlier? In other games you'd jump in one and it would "catch" you, like a bucket. Not in this game. You can slide or walk out the side of them. That's just poor programming.\n\nFinal verdict: There are elements here that could make for a good game, if more time had been applied, more experience been used... I really don't know. I can't tell if this was made by amateurs who gave it their all, or by a company that just slapped something together to try and make some quick cash. That's the boggling thing about a game like this; you don't know if it's failures should be depressing or infuriating.","January 8, 2015","false","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Stay away if you're used to casual toilet games like Deus Ex or ArmA. This is a real, hardcore, thought provoking game that requires intense strategy and foresight that the human brain completely and utterly lacks. This is the kind of game Steven Hawkin would have a hard time with. The only game series that is more thought provoking and strategetic than this is the Leap Frog series... That's how hard this is. I only recommend this if you have a lot of time on your hands and look forward to investing lots of time thinking and planning out your every move.","November 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","0"

Turns out it is quite good fun and I ended up playing it a chunk myself.\nIt works well with the keyboard or a 360 controller and is responsive and accurate with either. It plays nice and smooth too.\nThe graphics have a retro style/feel but without resorting to the usual blocky style many retro style games have.\nFinally the difficulty curve seems pretty much just right. Quite simple to learn but getting more difficult as the levels progress giving you that 'just one more go' appeal.  End of level score is based on how much you collected and you are also awarded stars - so theres a replay factor there too in returning to collect any missing stars.\nThe sound is the only real area thats a letdown. The music isnt especially bad and fits in well but starts to get quite repetitive and there seems to be very little in the way of different sound effects.\nOverall I can highly recommend Canyon Capers, its not going to be the next COD or GTA - but in terms of value and fun its great !\n","June 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

The controls are great, and support for controllers 'just works' fantastic. It was just as much fun and easy to play with keyboard.  There is a nice learning curve from the easy to hard levels, its very fun and I love the retro look. Will be playing this one a lot, and can not wait to play more. I want the Afro character in the trailer... he looks mint.\n\nI recommend everyone buys this game reminds me of crash bandicoot, mario and even super meat boy. Very happy with my purchase.\n\n\n","April 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 37 of 70 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","37","70","0","0"
