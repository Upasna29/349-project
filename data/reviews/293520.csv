That will always be the case. This game plays MUCH easier than theHunter: Primal since you're not scavenging for weapons and ammo and not being eaten by an OP t.rex after 5 hours of playing. You can literally jump right in and start hunting - taking down dinosaurs with as little as a single hit. Arcade-like feel? The perks you can upgrade are much more limited than in Primal, but satisfyingly easy to get.\n\nAs far as graphics are concerned, this has a lot better shaders than I thought it would have had (from early screenshots and video), though the textures and models of dinosaurs and the terrain do need to be polished... a lot. Still not as bad as the stuff  you see in a game like Beasts of Prey though. I also love the fact that you can visit different islands and areas to get different terrain, for example visiting a calm beach or a dense forest.\n\nOverall, when it costs as little as it does compared to similar dinosaur hunting titles, you'll have fun with it.","May 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 123 of 132 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","123","132","3","5"

Well having come from playing the first Carnivores back in 1998 a lot has changed.\n\nThe game looks great! The animations are well done, even though minimal, and the levels are vast open worlds with bits of lakes here or there that dinos like to hang around. Sometimes you find a mutated dino and it looks cool! That’s about it for the pros.\n\nAs for the cons of the game, let’s just start with the AI mapping. Seriously the dinos running away from you when you get spotted is hilarious! Not in a good way mind you. The dinos constantly running into trees and rock and random bits of debris can cause the hunting to slow down and it doesn’t happen just once. All the time. Especially when you are hunting the Mighty and Fierce T-REX!!! This would be scary if he didn’t bump into all the trees, rocks, and random bits of debris everywhere. You can also just jump on a rock, call in the T-rex, and snipe him with the .50 Cal. This is another problem I have. The weaponry. How is a crossbow more powerful than a .50 caliber rifle? How come when I max out the .50 Cal for max damage and hit a T-rex, or most dinosaurs for that part, in the heart they don’t always collapse instantly? How come I can’t hit the dino in the head and cause severe brain damage? Maybe I’m being too nitpicky here. Moving on. The Mutant Dinosaurs was a cool idea, but I feel it should have been implemented as a different level of danger and appearance. I shouldn’t look through my binoculars and not get a reading of what it is, because it looks slightly different. I shouldn’t call for it and it not respond to my call.\n\nLet’s talk about the lack of content. Can we please get some different weapons? Can we please get more dinos? Can we please get more levels and not just 3 levels with different lighting and fog. If anything make the level with RNG fog and different times of the day or even let you pick when to start the hunt. What about a challenge mode? Anything to draw out the life of the game!\n\nI think the game could have been so much more, but I honestly enjoy the first game way more. It was a challenge. T-rex could only be killed with a shot to the eye. And if you missed you didn’t get another chance. That is why they called it the big hunt. I also remember sitting forever calling in dinos getting them to come within sight and they would just run off if they caught your scent. That doesn’t happen in this game.\n\nWorking with what we have I would rate this game a 5/10. The elements are there, but needs a lot better execution.","January 6","false","12.0"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","38","47","4","1"

Very nostalgic.\nSmooth gameplay, very little fps stutter.\nGreat gameplay mechanics as well as gunplay.\nVery immerise and is more than capable of getting your adrenaline going.\nOpen world (while limited) leaves the player to make their own choices.\n\nCons-\nPeriodical crashes, could be simply on my end.\nRather unoptimized, can be difficult to run for lower end computers. Not many graphic options.\nRather few choices considering  gunplay. You either roll with an OP snper rifle or enjoy challening yourself.\n\nConclusion:\nI love this game. Absolutely reccomend to anybody who enjoyed previous installments in the series. I would love to see the addition of more dinosaurs (There's only 6 you can hunt in regards to a trophy. Kind of dissapoitning) and more weapons. Would absolutely spend more money to aquire that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/recommended/293520/","russianlot","Sir Russianlot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/","768 products in account","Carnivores 2 and Carnivores: Ice Age was the first games I got on my PC back in the day, and I played them to death. I even got my original copies somewhere...\nI even got mobile versions of both games on my android phone and play them from time to time. Those versions are actually superior to PC, since they both run extremely well and got some new creatures thrown in for free (18 in mobile version as of time of writing this review compared to PCs 9).\nSo how does this hold up?\n\nP.S. For short version, see TL;DR/ Conclusion at the end\nP.P.S. Many people will probably compare this to theHunter: Primal, but I haven't played that so only comprarison you'll see here will be with previous games in Carnivores series.\n\nStarting with positives:  1.  Even though it's a port of PS3 version, it runs well on PC. I tried it on both a hi tech Alienware PC at my friends house and my 6 year old scrapheap, and didn't experience anything wrong with this game whatsoever. Settings are a little bit limited, but decreasing LOD and turning off advanced grass will make it run even on laptop without any hickups.\n2.  Graphics, while nothing amazing like Skyrim or Witcher, still look pretty well, even on lower settings. There are some neat effects here and there, and if you're observant you can even track a dino by following his footsteps and blood trails, which is awesome.\n3.  Sound design is pretty good. There are some great ambient sounds and one time, I almost started swatting at a fly which I thought was flying close to my ear even though it was in game. Believe me, it was that realistic.\nDinos also make different growls and sounds and even though Stegosaurus sounds like a bear, which I personally find a little bit silly, it works when you are trying to locate a specific dino by sound.\n4.  Animations on dinosaurs are pretty good and their movement feels natural. Watching Ankylosaurus in his defensive position, stomping and hitting his tail club on the ground was extremely awesome.\n5.  Speaking of dinosaurs, they look way better and are more "up to date" compared to mobile and and prequel counterparts. Don't get me wrong, those dinos weren't plain bad, but a lot of things has changed in the field of paleontology and some things like size and looks are a bit outdated. Ceratosaurus for example, is bigger than Spinosaurus, which is just plain wrong.\nDevs probably didn't do their research properly or got something of it wrong, but they sure did it right this time, and it shows.\n6.  There is a "progression" system of sorts, where you can spend diamonds on upgrading your guns, player and Gadget. I say "progression" since upgrades are not permanent, and points can be taken away from one upgrade and be used on something else instead at any time or liking.\n7.  Shooting mechanics have been improved, and now, if you're skilled or lucky enough you can one shot dinosaurs if you aim at their weak spots, which will award you with more diamonds and better rating. Weak spots vary but with a little practice or with a help of one specific perk, you'll be be on top of things very quickly.\n8.  This game is also pretty cheap, NOT in early access, and support with more dinosaurs is already planned which is always nice.\n\nUnfortunately this is where the positives end and facepalming begins:  1.  First things first, there are only 6 dinosaurs to hunt...\nYes, you read it right, 6 dinosaurs. That was the biggest disappointment IMHO since, as I said before, mobile version has 18(!) completely different dinos to hunt. They really couldn't add more dinos?\n2.  There is also fewer weapons this time around.\nPrevious games had 6 (Pistol, 2 types of stotguns, 2 types of Rifles and Xbow) but this game only has 3 (4 counting Revolver sidearm perk). You could also carry all 6 if you could afford it, so why isn't it possible here? Your could go for a "realism" argument, but personally, I would like the option to be at least available.\n3.  AI on dinosaurs is pretty random as well, and feels like a downgrade compared to prequels.\nWhen it works it looks great and all that, times when they manage to get stuck between  2 trees and rocks, are just... bad.\nOne time, this Stegosaurus I was hunting got stuck in a rock and when I got closer, managed to go through it and with some struggle, out on the other side. While I watched this "rebirth" my lower jaw almost hit the floor.\nSure, it doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it kinda ruins the immersion... COMPLETELY.\n4.  Their reaction to gunfire is also pretty random.\nIn prequels herbivores ran away like maniacs when they heard gunshots while carnivores looked at it like a dinner bell running up to you and chewing your face.\nIn this game however, Herbivores usually don't care if their mate is shot in front of them or close by, unless shot themselves. Carnivores are a little bit less relentless, which is a little bit disappointing.\n5.  Levels themselves while big, are still smaller and less varied compared to prequels. Some of them are also covered in this weird fog, which in turn makes hunting dinosaurs more frustrating than everything else, since you can't see them 90% of the time.\nOne thing that I also found annoying personally was that some maps doesn't feature all dinosaurs. For example, default map only features Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus and nothing else. Want to hunt ALL dinosaurs on your favourite map? Can't do that! Must choose last map available!\nMy only questing to this is WHY?! In previous games you could hunt any dinosaur on any map, so why this feature is unavailable in this game is just bizarre.\n\nTL;DR and/or conclusion: Recommending this game is hard. With every step it takes in the right direction, it also takes a step back and if feels disappointing.\nI like the new visuals, updated dinosaurs, sounds, upgrades and other new features but unfortunately, mobile version has 3 times the dinosaurs, double the weapons and environments are more varied and interesting.\nI was really looking forward to this release of the game, but after 6-7 hours in this game, I had basically unlocked and upgraded everything this game had on offer and hunted all the dinosaurs, which is kinda disappointing compared to amount of hours I used on completing mobile versions.\n\nI'll probably recommend this games to the long time fans of the series, but new arrivals will probably be disappointed and bored fairly quickly with the amount of content available at the moment.\nI'll update this review as the game gets updated with more content etc.","May 28, 2015","false","12.8"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","41","59","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/recommended/293520/","drapocalypse","Doctor ☢ Apocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/","238 products in account","First off...this review caters to only a specific and special crowd of people. The Sim Hunters. An Interesting and rare breed we are.\n\nHaving said that if you are looking for the next action packed, no holds barred, intense Oculus Rift driven FPS shooter of the year then move along because I can guarantee that you will not enjoy this game.\n\nWho will enjoy this? The methodical, patience and slow sim hunting enthusiast. The hardcore Sim Hunter may not enjoy it as some will but I will touch on that.\n\nThis for all intensive purpose is a remake or reimagining of the wonderful and classic 1998 Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. If you ever fell in love with the original or its many expansion packs then this gem may have a special place reserved in your heart. Well enough rambling, time to talk about the game.\n\nWhat is it? Simply put it is a Dinosaur hunting game set in a distant future where you the hunter are scuttled about to numerous mysterious Islands of some unknown planet. There are a fair amount of set pieces to visit and each location is fairly large and varied with different themes and observable distances. Some may have heavy fog which can reduce and limit your viewable distance or some may be clear as day with a variety of Dinos to hunt down and add to your trophy room.\n\nBefore each outing you have the chance to modify and tailor your hunting gear a bit. In the beginning you are limited to a few locations, weapons, gear and Dinosaur types. As you confirm your kills and return back to "base" you earn two different types of in game currency, Gems and Score. Gems are rewarded for confirming a kill; these are the basic currency for upgrading your player, weapon and gear. Gems also unlock addition gear and weapons. Score is rewarded based on many factors. Kill distance, number of shots, size and tonnage of the Dino and Dino type as well. Score allows you to unlock the different map variants as you progress.\n\nOnce you suit up and pick a location a dropship plops you down on a fairly random section of the selected map. From here your senses are your only allies. Using a device called the M.I.S.T, this digital pda will allow you to observe a topographical map and can be upgraded to make your life a little easier. It also acts as a rangefinder and can be used to zoom in and scout around for nearby Dinos. Now it is up to you to locate, stalk and down your first Dino! Once you have confirmed your first kill (and maybe even added it to the trophy room if you purchased the corresponding hunting license) time to use the M.I.S.T to call for a pick up. This is the basics of the game.\n\nSo now that you have a very basic idea of how it works let’s talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nGOOD\n-Dinosaurs "act" like Dinosaurs. They themselves will seek out food and water, call out, sleep and move throughout the world as realistic as we could ever imagine.\n-The hunting grounds look pretty solid and give a great sense of being on an alien world. Unknown planets lurk in the skyline, Volcanoes erupt, winds bellow and the world feels fairly alive.\n-The weapons and gear feel great and offer players a small variety of options. Do I invest in more weapon power to down the T-rex or will I forgo damage for some scent masking options and maybe that camo vest?\n-The thrill of the hunt! In later maps the hunter can easily become the hunted. Noise, wind direction and concealment all come into play.\n\nBAD\n-The current selection of 9 maps are but a few variations of each other. Some are midday, another may be the same map but at dusk with more Carnivores lurking about. The lack of day/night cycles and changing weather could have really changed the way the game was meant to be played.\n-Small amount of gear and weapons. A larger variety would have been appreciated. Some of the gear can really take the challenge out of the game.\n-Graphics: To me this is a none issue, I think the game looks great. However it is a bit bland in some spots. Once you see all of the Dinos and Island variations you pretty much have seen it all.\n-The Dinosaur diversity is really low. Only 6 main Dinos to hunt and collect. The maps are littered with smaller stuff running around but they cannot be collected and do not act as a threat. A larger pool of huntable Dinos would have really benefited this game.\n-Once you get a swing of things the game can become really easy unless you are constantly hunting the higher threat Carnivores while handicapping yourself on gear selection.\n-The Sim aspect is not as hardcore as some Sim hunters would like. This game rides a fine line between casual and mid-sim range.\n\nUGLY\n-Chances of seeing a sequel are slim to none.\n-Updates have stopped and the devs are in limbo or dissolved.\n-Many users report crashes and graphical issues (I have not)\n-Dinosaurs can be downright stupid sometimes, they will sometimes get caught on the terrain while trying to escape…totally killing the feeling of immersion.\n-Mutant Dinosaurs: Apparently they are out there but I have yet to encounter one. Not sure what is so different about them.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable shout out to the Classic Carnivores. While fun it is a bit flawed but defiantly worth picking up if any of this sounds cool, it just doesn’t have the depth of some of the more hardcore hunting games that will keep drawing you back in for hundreds if not thousands of hours.

However I've always retained a soft spot for the original Carnivores; prehistoric reptile-hunting pared down to the bare minimum, and without the tedious weight of plot, or survival aspects to get in the way. I was disappointed over the years to find that Carnivores would no longer run on newer versions of Windows, so when I saw this my heart leapt a beat. I have to say I'm just an hour or so in, but I'm liking it for all the same reasons as before.\n\nThe graphics have improved over the first outing (given its been nearly 15 years)  but the feel is the same whacky future hunting scenario as before. As everyone else has commented it could defintely do with a few more species (hopefully some potential DLC?). The game size is tiny (less than a Gig) and I'd love to see this game format used in a big full budget environment like Cry engines latest 'Dino Island revisited' tech demo.\n\nConclusion-\nPleasingly pared down gameplay and solid immersion, the graphics are good but far from spectacular.

This is a dream to many people, including mine. Dinosaurs are cool, this game has them. The game also has weapons, although very limited in amount, you can get them all for playing the game. You can also upgrade your weapons, upgrade your character, upgrade your M.I.S.T (phone device which has many uses for tracking down dinosaurs), explore many different maps and much more. After you have killed or tranquilized a large dino, if you have the liscence for it (purchaseable with gems which you get for killing any dinosaur or tranquilizing it) you can then go up to it to confirm the kill and even get the dinosaur as a trophy. That was sure a breathfull of activites.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are poorly optimized or my PC is just not good enough. I have tried to turn on Advanced Grass, which seems like the best option to put into any game, made the grass look better and also reduced my fps to a very low, just the surface of double-digit frames per second. However graphics are still worthy of being on this review as the dinosaurs are from a long range most of the time, so they look HD. However this is still something which will improve to get itself at least Skyrim-like graphics with some 2K-4K resolution mods. After noticing whhat I said didn't make any sense, graphics right now are pretty from a long range, but will improve. There are many different graphical options. Dinosaurs look very realistic, and the models definitely have some work that was put into them. The weapons look badass too, just imagine being this character in real life, handling a crossbow, shooting down dino's in the sky, a bit of a dark though but sounds awesome.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nDinosaurs\nRealistic gameplay (the AI isn't that smart, though)\nWill be improved\nQuite a few maps\n\nCons:\nGraphically speaking, it's not that geat, but there is tons of room for improvement\nFinal Rating\n\nThis game deserves its rating of an okay-ish 7/10 - I will improve this review once it gets a ton better.\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

You brought back a classic from extinction for me :)\nBack in the day I purchased the original Carnivores.  As a dino lover I was intrigued but didn't expect much.  But this became one of my most cherished hunting games of all time. Went on to get Carnivores 2 and Ice Age.  Now the reboot is out and I'm happy to say that all the wonder and awe from the when I played the original are back.  Beautiful and open hunting locations with freedom to roam around and hunt how you want.    Great sound design and graphics.  As you wander the lush jungle of the first few hunting locations you'll find a lush green hunting zone with scattered rock outcroppings (which you can climb for a good view).  Shadows of lazy flying dinos criss cross the ground below.  On a distant island an active volcano rumbles.   You'll hear the mournful moan of a herbivore as you walk or the growl of a meat eater who just sniffed out your scent.  It all adds up to a great immersive environment to explore.\n\nGOOD:\n\nGreat graphics especially for a "budget priced" title.\n\nGreat sound design\n\nIf you bought the tag when you kill a dino you can put it in your "living" trophy room (and similar species of dinos will scale depending on their weight so that 3 ton stegosaur will look pretty big next to your 2 ton one).\n\nGreat reboot of a classic\n\nBAD:\n\nA few bugs here and there.\n\nSound of evac ship getting stuck in a loop on one expedition and drowned out all other sounds.  (only happened once in 4 hours of play time)\n\nDeleting trophies from my trophy room seems buggy.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong but when I try to delete one nothing happens and then after several attempts then I lost 3 trophies.   Hmmmm like I said might be doing it wrong but if that's the case then boy is it not an easy task.\n\nAll in all it's a great title and great price for what you get.  If you're a fan of the original I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nI'd LOVE to see Carnivores 2 and Ice Age updated or added into this one as DLC :D","May 27, 2015","true","15.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

For some reason the graphics and gameplay look better and play cleaner on the PS3 version I already played and beat of this game. I have a very high end system and with advanced grass on the game lag was unplayable. That needs to be fixed right away. I can max out more intensive games than this so hope that gets resolved. The graphics are not as good as the PS3 version overall which is kind of a surprise since one of the dev's said they would be better on PC.  Oh and on the cover photo why is there a brachiosaurus and I think a diplodocus but none in the game? Raptors? And why are the 2 smaller dinos and the pteranadon not trophy worthy? that bird was a lucky shot :)\nEven though the kickstarted I tried to help fund failed I hope they add more lands and dinos. That along with the graphics fixes would make this a killer game for any Dino fan or hunting fan appreciate. There are good's and bad's with this one verses The Hunter: Primal but worth it while we wait for updates. Just keep FOV down a little or turn off advanced grass..","May 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Greatly improved graphics since the originals, big open world. Game is a little too easy so far with the occasional dinosaur glitching about everywhere, but so far I'm having great fun. You'll be walking about and then hear a roar, you'll be like what the ♥♥♥♥ was that, darting about everywhere trying to find it.  You gotta take your time and be stealthy when tracking your chosen dinos. This means avoiding to walk downwind, keeping silent, keeping out of sight.

I bought this one because I used to have Carnivores 2 and Ice Age, which I enjoyed quite a bit. This game however was quite boring and very limited so I'd recommend watching some gameplay videos before you decide.\n\nPros:\nHunting dinosaurs! Same as others but it's a pretty epic concept and of course dangerous when hunting carniverous ones.\nGood graphics.\n\nCons:\nLimited dinosaurs to hunt.\nOnly a few weapons to use to hunt.\nOf the upgrades or perks or whatever most of them reduce your score when using. It makes sense for things like radar but why would you hunt anything without camo or cover scent, but both those remove 5% of your score each.\nInconsistant AI, shooting some dinosaurs and they won't even recognise. Shoot a carnivore once and it runs away for a bit, yet most of the time shrugs it off. Also when running they get stuck on rocks and such and end up running in place.\n\nMinor personal complaints:\nStupid freaking ship drops you upwind from everything 90% of the time.\nCrouching seems to just be for noise reduction as they see me just as easily as if I were standing.\nGetting the Gem things for unlocks feels grindy.","January 2","false","3.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

I have wanted a proper Dinosaur hunting game for two decades now, and this is it. Dinosaurs can hear and smell you, both of which are affected by the current wind direction and speed. You need to move quietly and shoot each dinosaur's weak spot if you wish to take him down in one shot (for maximum points). You get binoculars, a map, a gun, and then you are tossed onto a dinosaur-infested island. Different times of day and varying weather affect your hunting strategy as well. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes dinosaurs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaemonQueeN/recommended/293520/","DaemonQueeN","TactiCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaemonQueeN/","401 products in account","Not sure how to feel about this one. For comparison, been playing a lot of The Hunter: Primal, to which this game is slightly similar to. There aren't that many dinosaurs to hunt, granted, but the guns feel very good and the scenery is downright gorgeous. The worst thing is how long it takes to walk around the environment and how hard it is to find ammo and how easy it is to die even after you've got good gear. It's rather unforgiving at times.\n\nSo with that said, Carnivores: DHR, has a little more on offer in my opinion. It's a more arcadey type of game, with cartoony art and a UI that looks like it was made for smart phones (because former versions were developed for iOS and Andriod in mind) for very casual gamers in mind. So far I have been having fun with it. There doesn't seem to be much consequence for dying and there isn't really much to lose.\n\nHas way more dinosaur types than Primal does, though less guns, however there are attachments you can buy to improve your guns which outnumber the ones you can get in Primal. The gun handling itself also feels very arcadey.\n\nCarnivores is also sadly SP only, while Primal you can hunt online with friends or strangers.\n\nArcade vs Realism isn't exactly bad, it's just a different feel. I'm not sure I can rate one game over the other even if they are similar. Carnivores is almost too easy though, so you don't really feel much risk as you do in Primal. It's a far more casual experience.\n\nSo to sum it up, TL;DR:\nCategory        TH: Primal        Carnivores: DHR                Weapons:        More Realistic, Better Feel, More Variety (11 types), Limited Upgrades (May be able to attach a scope on some weapons)        More Arcadey, Less Variety (4 types), More Upgrades (3-4 per weapon, though not visual)                Scenery:        Very realistic, detailed, one very large map, very pretty        More cartoony, detailed, several moderately sized maps, nice to look at                Dinosaurs:        Very limited variety (5 species), mostly carnivores        Larger variety, (9 species) carnivores and herbivores                Difficulty:        Challenging        Casual                Modes:        Singleplayer and Multiplayer (PvE & PvP)        Singleplayer Only                Price:        $29.99        $14.99\nIt's rather a very good game for what it is.","May 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I know its DX9 but i can't max out LOD on my 290X with an i7-4790K without getting lag spikes in certain parts of some maps.  With that said graphics options are severely limited. Only FOV and LOD are configurable (excluding resolution). Hopefully some mods correct this in the future.\n\nOnce you unlock everything I don't see anything else to do other than beat your high scores.\n\nHoping for multiplayer feature sometime in the future now that the game is on steam, as of now there is none.\n\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS\nGame overall is a bargain of a remake for only 15$. Buy it if you want a good game to kill time with. Hope the developers add more maps, weapons, and dinosaurs in the future to update the game or as DLC.","May 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn drastically changes that, making the game much more realistic.\n\nIf your new to the game, let me tell you what this game is all about. As the title says, your a hunter, you kill Dinosaurs and you get points, you can also capture the dinosaur and display it in your trophy room. With the points you earn, you can get upgrades for the player, weapons, or just anything really. That's literally it, as small as it sounds, the replay value for this game is huge!\n\nPROS: -The game sticks to what it was known for\n-The graphics are pretty good\n-There are achievements to keep you entertained once you earned everything\n\nCONS: -The optimization could be better, but overall it's not that bad\n-The developers could have taken the chance to add new dinosaurs\n-There is hardly any weapons, compared to the other games in the series\n\nOverall, even though there are ups and downs with this game, It's a thrilling experience to hunt dino's then to see other dino's on the map, heading your way to eat you. If you like dinosaurs and feel like killing some, then get this game!\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","June 30, 2015","true","15.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So I was really excited to play a brand new Carnivores game!\n\nThe graphics are amazing and very much improved with a spectacular environment having lots of trees rocks etc. giving you many areas to hide! The gameplay is very similar to the original, being dropped on an island hunting dinosaurs.\n\nYou start by only able to hunt one species, and gain gems depending on the size and accuracy of the dinosaurs.\nThese gems are then used to unlock new locations, new deadlier dinosaurs, and upgrade your gear weapons and person attributes.\nThe amount of gems you need to unlock the new dinosaurs is kind of ridiculous but that's what keeps you playing.\n\nThere are a few things different compared to the original series.\nFirst of all the dinosaurs you hunt are 50 times bigger! Way more threatening and more crucial to hide.\nSadly there aren't as many dinosaurs to hunt including the Velociraptors. Which were super tiny, fast and hard to hunt without being seen/killed first.\nThe death scene isn't to interesting, in the originalyou saw your dead body while the dinosaur ate you or the T-Rex flinging you around. While this game just has the dinosaur opening his jaws in slow motion and ending the game.\n\n\nVery enjoyable, and it's a great game just like it's predecessors!\n\n10/10","September 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So this game has a lot of nostalgic value and just the words “Dinosaur Hunter” are cool enough to get you excited. Unfortunately, all the potential this game had just made us feel disappointed. It could have been so much more.\n\nYou hunt dinosaurs for sport with either a rifle, a crossbow or a sniper rifle. It sounds limited at first, but you can upgrade weapons (and your GPS) through gems you get for each kill. These upgrades usually go around making you more deadly and stealthy.\n\nTracking with hunting techniques is a cool concept, since you must follow footprints and awareness of wind direction is important so the dinosurs don’t catch your smell. The GPS radar will be your most trusty ally however, since it will help you find your prey through the games different areas (jungle, forests, deserts, etc.)\n\nBut this is where it starts going downhill. Nothing in the environment reacts to your presence or actions. It’s just there, being all static like a wall. And not a pretty wall, even. You don’t leave footprints, you don’t brush against bushes, and you don’t break branches you pass through. It’s like the game is constantly slapping you in the face to remind you that it is, in fact, just a game.\n\nAnd we know that every game has its limitations but the star of the game, the dinosaurs, are just not up to the task of making this a cool experience. First of all, there’s only 5 species to hunt. But the worst thing is the AI. They either run right towards you, making them an easy target or, even worse, get stuck on the map itself. And when they do kill you… oh boy… the animation is just awful.\n\nThat being said, it did manage to be fun for a couple of hours. So we gave it a 4/10.","July 2, 2015","false","4.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I've never played any of the other ones from this series but if they are anything like this, I don't know how people keep from getting bored. It turns into an arcade grind fest. And there seems to only be 5-6 dinosaurs that you can "actually" hunt. I'm not counting the random Pterodactyls you can shoot down for extra crystals. On the plus side, I will say the dinosaurs look good. Their AI is really buggy sometimes but that makes for some really funny hunting moments.

The gameplay isn't bad, just sprinting around an island until you find a dinosaur, but the AI isn't the smartest, they'll get stuck in trees/rocks/spin in circles a lot.

Wait for the developers to add some (will they?) and then buy it. Regardless of that game looks, feels and plays great.\n\nAnd now the details:\n\nPros:\n+A great remake of good ol' Carnivores 2 with all the original mechanics and a couple of new ones.\n+Looks great (a bit blury but you get used to it)\n+Feels great. Nowadays indie games are common to be really 'creaky' and not very responsible. Good thing this is not one of them.\n+Pretty optimized.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of content. Not just new one but content in general.  3 maps (plus their variations like fog or dusk), 4 weapons, 6 huntable dinosaurs and a dozen of equipment is all this game has for now.\n-Dinosaurs AI. Seems to be unchagned since 1999. Carnivores are not dangerous at all as long as you're on top of some rock. Herbivorous are likely to stuck (or even go inside) in rocks while trying to run away.\n\nOverall:\nAs it is now game is just for a single night. Hope it's going to get some deveoplment cause potential is really big.","May 30, 2015","false","5.8"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","5","16","0","0"

So most people can play the game without the lag wrecking the fun.\n\n- A LOT of upgrades to buy so you don't get bored as easily.\n\n-Awesome Trophy Room.\n\n-Realistic Dinosaur Sizes.\n\n-Awesome Intense Hunting System!\n\n-Great Music\n\n-EXTREMELY HUGE Maps.\n\nAnd now with the disapointment..\n\n~Cons~\n\n- ONLY 6 Dinosaurs to hunt (Not including 2 dinosaurs in the world)\n\n- AI is stupid and very easy to kill.\n\nOverall Great game but needs a bit of AI fixing and some updating with more dinosaurs to hunt!. Other else than that the game is Con free.. On a scale of 1/10 for rating of the game: 7.5/10.\n\nPlz like if you agree and make this the most liked review so the devs can see it!","August 4, 2015","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautiful graphics, neat new features, but the core experience of the original games. For those who haven't played it, it is a hunting game where you are put on a large island (there are several islands in the game) and you must track down dinosaurs and kill them. Each dinosaur has their own weak points on their bodies, and some like the Ankylosaurus and Triceratops have armoured body parts that make it more difficult. Each dinosaur has a unique sense of sight, hearing, and smell, and different behaviour patterns. For instance, the Stegosaurus is docile and will only run away when it detects you. The Ceratosaurus is a carnivore and will try to eat you, but if you wound it badly, it will retreat. I haven't encountered the T-Rex yet in this new game, but they are probably going to be much more aggressive.\n\nThe only negative thing I can point out about the game is that it is missing Velociraptors. They were a very unique dinosaur in the old games and I would have loved to see them return in the new one, especially since they are such a popularly known dinosaur.","June 21, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not enough weapons to keep you interested, there's not enough dinosaurs, there's not enough variety in gameplay between levels. Find a rock, get yourself as high as possible and pick off the dino's. That's it really, you don't notice any difference when upgrading your characters loadout.

I have heard many complaints about the lack of content. Unfortunately, because the Kickstarter for this game did not reach its goal, this game will have to develop its potential over time rather than being a blockbuster from the get-go. I myself am frustrated by the lack of huntable dinosaur species, but I have confidence that this game will grow and develop over time into something everyone can enjoy. The immersive realism of this game provides a lot of strength to it even in its current basic state. The upgrades to players and their equipment is also a handy new feature. I mean, just as an example, if you completely upgrade the basic rifle and bring the revolver and double ammo along as well, you've got enough bullets to go after a ton of dinosaurs in a singular hunt. The mutated dinosaurs are also an interesting addition. In other words, be on your guard, fellow hunters! Something fishy is going on on FMM UV-32. Whether DinoHunt Corp. is responsible or not is entirely up to your interpretation.\n\nAs for the downsides, I think the sensitivity of the Parasaurolophus's senses could be toned down just a little. You can hardly get close enough to nail them with even one shot sometimes depending on the location and time of day. Also, what is going on with the Ceratosauruses seemingly being able to phase through rocks? That's happened to me plenty of times on the Basmachee Rocks maps. I think the collision mechanics may need a little bit of tweaking. I also think that the animals need to interact with each other more. For example, if a carnivore is hunting an herbivore and you just sit back and watch, then the carnivore should be able to hunt and kill the herbivore and eat it. I've seen dead carcasses of Ankylosauruses and Parasaurolophuses in Basmachee being feasted on by Ceratosauruses or Tyrannosauruses, but did these predators take down those herbivores, or were they already dead? I also believe that herbivores like Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, and Stegosaurus should be able to defend themselves against predators. After all, they wouldn't have all that armor and such if they didn't use it for something, right?\n\nAs far as recommendations I would make for improving this game besides those above, as far as adding new dinosaur species to the game, I heard the developers talking awhile back about adding Allosaurus and Velociraptor to the game as additional predatory species because people were requesting them so much above most other species. Also, I think since the species present now are a mix from Carnivores and Carnivores 2, the developers could, at some point, add Pachycephalosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Spinosaurus in addition to Allosaurus and Velociraptor. That would bring what I would dub all of the "Original Eleven" species from Carnivores 1 and 2 into this new game. They could also bring all of the other new species from Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter for mobile devices into the game (including the Dilophosaurus from the drawing contest...don't know what happened with that). Frankly, I have made a handwritten list of probably almost 200 dinosaur species I would like to see put into the game eventually. Granted, such a large amount of dinosaurs being put into the game would take years, but you never know. If support continues, it could happen.\n\nOverall, I like this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hunting or dinosaur-based titles. I think this game has a lot of potential and just because it is limited now doesn't mean we should sell it short before it has a chance to show its talent and potential. In other words folks, let's just be a little patient and keep up our enthusiasm, and I'm sure this game will have a plethora of dinosaur species to hunt down and exhibit as trophies in no time. In the meantime, happy hunting!","June 20, 2015","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dinosaurs (as with every child) were a huge thing to me. This game brings back old memories and gets them all prettyed up and makes it feel just like it used to. Visually It's nice, not comparing it with higher-end games cause it's not meant to be one. My only gripe is with the sound design. I've heard a lot of the dino's grunts, screams, or what have you before and in some cases they don't really sound like they should. What i DO like, is they kept the old death scream the player character shouts before they get eaten.  Minor things of course. It feels good, plays well and rewards you for actually "hunting" instead of running around with a gun in your hand on an island full of dinosaurs. There seems to be 3 different maps but they are reused in different ways for variety like fog and time of day.  If you've played the Carnivors games in the past i definately recommend you pick this up. Even if you haven't, watch someone else play it.

The tutorial was informative enough to get started and have an idea of what to do, but it didn't feel over bearing either. One thing I had to do was turn up the brightness when I got in game, but that's a total nonissue. Game play is smooth, and as expected slow. But the slowness is what makes the hunts satisfying in my opinion after finally getting a kill, even more after getting it in one shot. Things such as wind direction, sound, movement speed all play a roll in how the hunt goes, so this game defiantly favors the patient player. There's no resupply points in game, or at least any that I've come across, so you have a limited number of rounds. If I remember right it's 15 until you purchase one of the perks. I think that this was a good idea on the park of the devs as this forces players to make each shot count if they plan on having a long hunt. In addition to the hunting mode, the game offers an observation mode that allows players to watch how their targets behave. I personally haven't used this feature yet, but I do plan to.\n\nYou start out with a bolt action rifle with no scope, and at first I thought that would be a sever limitation; I'm happy to say I was wrong. The starting weapon feels balanced enough to get started, although I feel that 500 gems to unlock the sniper rifle feels a little much at this point in the game, but I may change my mind on that. The game also offers a firing range to try out weapons, and targets will show the locations of vitals. I found this to be a very good idea, as this at least lets you get a working idea of where to aim on your target when you get into the field.\n\nThe AI is satisfying at this point, although the dinosaurs that I've hunted SO FAR have sounded like bears. Dinosaurs that I've encounter so far have acted pretty much how I would expect that species to act. One thing I did notice was that one of the little ambient dinosaurs would appear to almost clip when taking a turn while running around, but this didn't break immersion for me. The coolest thing, I think, is when the ship comes to pick up kills. The ship picks you up in the same way when you decide that it's time to leave the arena, an idea that I thought was awesome. There seems to be a decent selection of dinosaurs to hunt at this time, but from what I've read there are plans to add two more to the game.\n\nOverall the game is very good, probably a few things that could be polished a little bit more, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or anything that is super distracting. With a $15 price tag it's worth picking up.","May 28, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a gradual climb up the various forms of points allowing you to configure yourself prior to a hunt as well as unlocking new levels and targets to bring down.\n\nHowever this game is mostly a remake and suffers for it. While Dinosaur AI is improved, it's still nothing particularly interesting. Herbivores don't gather for protection nor do they listen to the cries of their fellow Dinosaurs. The maps used to feel huge and while they're not small by any means you'll eventually be making a circle or two and it feels more like the game spawns enemies near you as opposed to having missed a dinosaur.\n\nStill, fun.","May 28, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very good that the dinosaurs are much more realistic in this but the game has it's flaws too and could easily be a lot better with even just some minor adjustments. Original Carnivores games were even more about hunt or be hunted. In this game the only danger are the Ceratosaurs. It is sad that the T. rex is one of the easiest dinosaurs in this game even without the sniper rifle. The dinos become cannon fodder as they get stuck on trees and rocks so the king (the biggest animal in the game) will never get to you and you can hit his eye very easily with the standard rifle or even the revolver.\n\n-Make the dinosaur a LOT smaller. At the moment Parasaurolophus feels more like a Brachiosaurus in size and Ceratosaurus is about the size of a realistic T. rex. Also smaller the dinosaurs - less they would get stuck. The'd also be a harder target.\n-Speaking of smaller dinosaurs, this game really needs raptors. Small agile pack hunter would add some needed danger to the game.\n-Add the ability to mod things like dinosaur stats and weapons. RES.txt saved a lot in Carnivores 2 as you could add realism and more challenge to the game. Fans modding and adding content would be huge for this game!\n-Ceratosaurus and Parasaurolophus seem annoyingly fast. They seem to be skating, looks stupid. Also the player himself is more like Usain Bolt. Making you slower would also make the world seem bigger and give the hunting more emphasis as now it's more about running the dinosaurs down.\n-Make herbivores much more aggressive. Triceratops for example is always running away scared. I would enjoy moments when suddenly you would be the one running for your life (which never worked in the originals). Nothing is more scary than running away from an angry dinosaur not knowing if it's going to catch you this time or not. Well, maybe a "clever girl" kind of moment.\n-Power ups, there is no need for them at the moment. Dinosaurs need to provide more challenge. And also a GPS telling you if a dinosaur has noticed you?! And music signalling dinosaur related events during the hunt, why...\n-Adding more content (dinosaurs, maps, weapons) which is of course not a minor thing.\n\nAnd about the so called "mutant" dinosaurs. They aren't rare at all so I would think them only as males. This whole mutant thing that is going on feels so stupid. Why can't dinosaurs just be dinosaurs, "wow enough".\n\nBut all in all this game is worth what it costs. Let's hope there's more to come.","June 14, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The originals I played as a kid are played homage to and elements are improved. The atmosphere is scary, particularly when you hunt your first carnivore, and everything fits into place. You really do feel as if you're in the hunters shoes while stalking your prey.\n\nHowever, it must be said that the lack of content is truly astounding. Hopefully the devs don't leave us hanging with the pitiful amount of dinos the game offers to hunt. In all honestly I finished the game in under 2 days, with truthfully minimal playtime. In those two days I was able to go from basic rifle hunting Stegos, to sniper rifle hunting T-Rex. My perks/supplies were limited, but with an additional 6 hours of farming T-Rex, I had the ability to upgrade everything and use every perk on every map hunting every dino.\n\nI must give this game a 7/10. The game is truly immersive and fun, with definite props going towards the honoring of the original games. However the lack of content is largely a disappointment.","November 27, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play through it in a relatively short time, winning all the achievements and getting a fairly nice trophy room too. This could be improved SO easily, if they offered a few DLC packs with new game (a few more big dinos and a few small ones) as well as a TON more achievements, which would be SO easy to add... that would give more goals even with the current setup! ....also, a new map or two might be nice, as after a while you get used to the few they have. Some of those options are the same map with different weather/light conditions (like dusk or dawn) so it's too few maps in my opinion. Really, this game desperately needs more content.

Anyone who played any of the Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter games will enjoy this chance to head back into the jungle with an X-bow in hand.This takes everyone right back to that and with some massive improvements, the most obvious one being the graphics but including some really improved gameplay elements.\n\nFor those who remember Carnivores fondly and are wondering what all has changed (+ for positive, - for negative, = for neither good nor bad, all of these IMO)\n++++++The graphics. It's very pretty now.\n+They hybridized the vitals mechanic from carnivores 1 with the health mechanic of 2. Now the dinosaurs have health, which you can only effectively damage by hitting their heart or lungs. You usually have to guess at them, but you can pick up a tool that highlights them whenever you zoom in.\n+You now confirm all kills by getting up close to them with your GPS. While it seems like it would be annoying, it actually feels rewarding and adds a hint of challenge - if there's a ceratosaur next to your trophy and you're out of ammo, you'll be challenged to sneak over to it or evac without those points. You also get more points if you use fewer shots to take down yoru quarry.\n+The evac and trophy retrieval has been revamped. To collect a trophy, you take out your map tool and click while next to a downed animal. A ship will come to pick up and take 20 seconds or so. When you want to leave, you have to call on that same ship - it takes 10 seconds to arrive and then you have 30 seconds to get into a vacuum beam - and you can't start the call while the ship is busy picking up a dinosaur. In the earlier carnivores games, all trophies were automatically collected for you and to leave, you requested the ship and waited 10 seconds before magically being 'teleported' out (possibly magically avoiding a mid-pounce velociraptor). Now there's an added element of strategy - is that trophy worth risking the time to collect? Can you get to the escape updraft in time to escape the charging dino? Is the ship in a place you can safely get to or do you need to sneak off to call it elsewhere?\n-Tranqs now have no real difference between lethal ammo. In previous games, you traded your right to keep trophies for higher score values so you could move on to better dinosaurs and better guns. Now, the only thing tranquilizers seem to change is the position the dinosaur falls to. There's no change in reward and you still get to collect dinos that you down and keep them as trophies. It doesn't even affect the health mechanic - while gameplay-wise I think this is fine, it does make you kind of wonder why you need to hit the heart or lungs when the dart should only go a few inches under the skin at most....\n-The dinosaur count is way down: now there's only Stegosaur, Ankylosaur, Parasaurolophus, Ceratosaur, Triceratops, and T-Rex. That's sadly only two carnivores in a game *called* carnivores. However, Parasaurolophus is the only one that isn't at least a little bit dangerous now, so that does add back to the challenge a little. I'm hoping they'll make updates or allow the steam workshop to add in their own goodies soon.\n-There are now only three main guns you can choose from, and you can only have one at a time, plus the pistol. The classic favorite X-bow is still there, at least, but it does leave wanting for more. Again, hopefully they'll add more or let the steam workshop add some.\n\nFor all its fun, you can still do everything this game has to offer in about 20 hours, but after that it's still fun and a good, quick rush like solitaire. Still, with the price and the nostalgia, if you've played any of the previous Carnivores games and have fond memories, it is very much worth picking up.\n","January 7","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dare say remake because while it has the same feeling and style as the original, it is quite a different game. The visuals have obviously been significantly improved since the original and there are many things to upgrade and buy using this new gem currency. You can use the gems for so many things, like buying dino licences, purchasing different weapons, upgrading those weapons, buying equipment to make hunting easier, buying upgrades to your character such as running faster, being more difficult to smell, hear or see. You can also buy upgrades for your M.I.S.T, like a bigger dino spotting range, a dino roar decoy to make them come closer to you, and being able to call the drone faster for capture of dead dinos and evacuation. And none of these require you to spend real money, all you have to do is earn gems by killing dinos. There is also another currency called Score, which lets you explore new maps and allows you to buy the licences to more dinos using your gems. If I havent made it clear enough, there is a ton of replayability to this game, and if that isn't enough, there are also 12 achievements to unlock if you are an achievement hunter. The only gripes I have about this game is that, while the optimization isn't terrible by any means, it has clearly been ported from the PS3 version of this game, and i myself had to turn down the settings a tad to maintain a steady 60fps. Another small gripe is that there are only 6 dinos in this game, while the original had over a dozen, but Its not a big deal. In conclusion, if you love hunting games, dino games or are just looking for a fun game to pass the time, for just £10.99 this game meets and exceeds those expectations.","September 24, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty mixed feelings about it, honestly. While I'm really happy to see a new Carnivores game, this reboot is just kinda lacking in content. It has a good variety of gadgets, but there are only three guns, six dinosaurs, and three maps. I don't regret my time with the game and I recommend it overall, but that recommendation comes with a caveat. I really hope more content is added, but until then I'd probably tell most people to wait for a sale.\n\nhttp://indiegamesource.com/igs/reviews/carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-reborn-ne-r226","June 11, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tutorial was informative enough to get started and have an idea of what to do, but it didn't feel over bearing either. One thing I had to do was turn up the brightness when I got in game, but that's a total nonissue. Game play is smooth, and as expected slow. But the slowness is what makes the hunts satisfying in my opinion after finally getting a kill, even more after getting it in one shot. Things such as wind direction, sound, movement speed all play a roll in how the hunt goes, so this game defiantly favors the patient player. There's no resupply points in game, or at least any that I've come across, so you have a limited number of rounds. If I remember right it's 15 until you purchase one of the perks. I think that this was a good idea on the park of the devs as this forces players to make each shot count if they plan on having a long hunt. In addition to the hunting mode, the game offers an observation mode that allows players to watch how their targets behave. I personally haven't used this feature yet, but I do plan to.\n\nYou start out with a bolt action rifle with no scope, and at first I thought that would be a sever limitation; I'm happy to say I was wrong. The starting weapon feels balanced enough to get started, although I feel that 500 gems to unlock the sniper rifle feels a little much at this point in the game, but I may change my mind on that. The game also offers a firing range to try out weapons, and targets will show the locations of vitals. I found this to be a very good idea, as this at least lets you get a working idea of where to aim on your target when you get into the field.\n\nThe AI is satisfying at this point, although the dinosaurs that I've hunted SO FAR have sounded like bears. Dinosaurs that I've encounter so far have acted pretty much how I would expect that species to act. One thing I did notice was that one of the little ambient dinosaurs would appear to almost clip when taking a turn while running around, but this didn't break immersion for me. The coolest thing, I think, is when the ship comes to pick up kills. The ship picks you up in the same way when you decide that it's time to leave the arena, an idea that I thought was awesome. There seems to be a decent selection of dinosaurs to hunt at this time, but from what I've read there are plans to add two more to the game.\n\nOverall the game is very good, probably a few things that could be polished a little bit more, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or anything that is super distracting. With a $15 price tag it's worth picking up.","May 28, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing quite like stalking dinosaurs through the various settings trying to put down a T-rex at 400 meters. The guns are different and actually add tactical choices for the different terrain and dinosaurs. And there are plenty of upgrades for weapons, tracking, and personal use.\n\nThe downside. There really are two few dinosaurs to hunt, and the different locations get cycled with fog and dusk. It would have been nice for some night hunts as well, and a few more locations wouldn't hurt. Also it would be nice to hunt some raptors... or spinosaurus... or any number of additional predatory dinosaurs.

They have few unlocks and only a handful of species of dinosaurs to hunt, so they stretch them out and make the progression system slow and boring in order to make it seem like the game has more content than it does. But in the end the game is only wasting your time.\n\nYou'll experience just about everything this game has to offer in the first 30 minutes. There are only 1 or 2 unlocks worth having, and all of the unlockable dinosaurs are just more of the same.\n\nThis game might be worth picking up if you catch it on sale, but at full price it just doesn't have enough content to be worth it.","March 13","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are good as you may expect but the AI does some odd things some funny some not but Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn is a fun game in the end and may challage you and sometimes your patience.","January 24","true","79.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We could hardly wait. We bought it when it came out, didnt read any comments over the game, just so it wouldnt ruin the true experience. So, $15 goes toward the developers, while I was in the loading screen. I loaded a game, so far, the game looked amazing. Thats when the game loaded up, and my words i just spoke, fell to the ground like a rock. 20-30 fps on a fricken GTX 970. This game has very poor optimisation, also very little to adjust the video settings, like one little slider named "High Quality Grass"... (*&% me. Its not even in early access!No content whatsoever, i can find more enjoyment watching a Michael Bay movie.\n\nDO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","February 14","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They keep getting stuck on rocks/trees so you can just get behind and kill!\n\nThe visuals aren't too bad, for an indie game. The sounds could be much better... I mean, hearing a bear sound for a dinosaur? Really?\n\nThe fact that it is only three maps, recycled with a few variations, lacks variety. The three weapons is a major disappointment too! And how could the crossbow deal more damage than say, the .50 caliber?\n\nGame seemed promising but I can't recommend something I didn't liked nor had a good experience with.\n\nSave yourself some money and get something else... or if you wanna risk it, get only in a sale!","April 23","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
