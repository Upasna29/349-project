I can't pin any specific genre to it because it's a mix of many things. It's about a town full of Vampires so I suppose that may draw some and deter others from playing. You begin by picking either male or female and then choosing from many different faces and hair colors. The game kind of feels like a simulation in the fact that you have to work at a job to earn money for everything. (By the end of the game, there are a ton of jobs to choose from). You have to rest and/or eat to regain your strength. You also have to visit schools and learn new things to raise your stats in an RPGish sort of way. Then there's my favorite part which is dressing your Vampire up and decorating the interior of where they live. Buying better clothing will raise certain stats. Buying better furniture, knick-knacks, and pets helps your Vampire to relax more so they gain more health and mana when resting at home. You also help out a multitude of Vampires in Twilight City with different tasks. Some of said tasks involve hidden object scenes so you can add HOG into the mix. You can cast spells by buying them, learning them, and then drawing their symbol on your spell sheet. You ride a steed around town and can buy better ones that move faster and even heal you while you're traveling from building to building. And when I say steeds and pets, don't expect a lot of them to be normal. Vampires like undead and demony things. :p\n\nIn short, this was a pure pleasure to play and I definitely plan on going through it again.","March 24","true","49.7"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","30","30","0","7"

Too bad for you, you're a creature of the night, you're a vampire. The only way for you is to become human again, for that, you go to Twilight City, where you'll have to earn your life and learn spells, fighting skills or anything that can help you in your quest.\n\nIf the story seems common, I don't know how it's finishing as I was victim of a bug - in other words, don't use the teleportation spell while you've casted another one. Besides, if my character was moving, I wouldn't have to resort to that solution.\n\nAnyway, I was expecting the casual adventure games, I ended with a mix of management and adventures. Up to the point I've been, I stayed in the city, travelling through different buildings, because quests asked me to do so. Indeed, you'll have to take a job (like being a butcher in the tavern, a judge in the town hall or even a professor at the academy) because you'll need money to buy you clothes, pets and to pimp your room, without forgetting items needed to learn expensives courses in the academy or the casern. I should also mention that you can restore your energy through the tavern and your mana by watching spectacles in the circus. Besides, you can also buy potions. And if you don't want to spend your money, go sleep in your room and depending on how it's furnished, you will resplenish your mana and your energy at different levels.\n\nBetween these, well, quests will also lead you to find objects in an hidden object scene or just on the town. And when you're not casting spells, you can still work with the job you've chosen for the moment, as you can change depending on the promised income.\n\nIn other words, you're ending up in a casual management game, with a mix of skills that can be upgraded by learning stuff, wearing specific clothes or having friends (ghosts, skeletons, animals, even those you can ride). That kind of gameplay was a little boring at first as I wasn't expecting that, however, I got easily hooked up until I was stuck because of a freaking bad move.\n\nAlso, the ambiance is a mix between humor and darkness, kinda like Sinister City. Milena and Evelyn are jealous of each other, Edgar is only worried for his animals, Gregor is a crazy scientist whose experiments are often a failure, Victor is often in trouble with his assistants, as for Marcus, Alain and Cassandra, they're perhaps the most normal people you'll meet, though the latter is always pushing you to improve your looks, your room and to change for a better job.\n\nThe graphics aren't the most important here, as you see only backgrounds (that are moving a little) and a paper on the side with all you can buy, you can learn or work. The main town is mainly set in the dark and the weather is also changing with rain appearing often. The characters are well drawn, however, they don't look at all as vampires. Yourself, you don't look like one: you can customize your character by choosing the sex, their figures, their haircut, their hair color. After that, with the clothes, you can also choose the color.\n\nThe soundtrack is acceptable, I didn't really pay attention to that.\n\nTwilight City: Love as a Cure is a very good surprise, even if I was stuck and that I didn't want at all to begin a new profile. It's a nice way to play, even if I was expecting clearly more hidden objects and less learning or working. However, I find the price a little too high for it, so, either buy a bundle where it is or wait for a good discount.","April 2","true","2.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Twilight City will offer several jobs and shops to customize your character and your home and several abilities to increase and spells to learn in order to complete some quests. The game's title is certainly unfortunate and the gameplay is repetitive but the character design is good and the possibility to buy pets and furniture together with the spells and quests makes this game a curious mix between a rpg, the Sims and a hidden object game.","March 22","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd say got my money's worth.\n\nPros:\n- Awesome BGM that doesn't feel as repetitive as it actually is.\n- Pretty damned good looking graphics even though they're not top-shelf compared to some HO games.\n- Horribly repetitive task system (I know, weird that it's a "pro", right?!).\n- A decent level of "do it how you want"-feel.\n\nCons:\n- Stole six hours of my life.\n- Wish there was actually a purpose to the spells, but sadly *cue Lana Kane* "Nooope!"\n- Glitchy about the male/female dialogue. (Kept acting like I was a guy, even though my toon was a femme).\n- I absolutely hate being thrust into the story of a vampire that wants to be human without actually hearing anything about that until I'm far into the game; felt dirty.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd say if you're looking for a shameful #filthycasual game to play because you're tired of thinking/paying attention, this is certainly a good option.","May 8","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no intro to the story, so you don't really have a sense of what's going on. Then there isn't really much of a story the rest of the game either. You're are essentially tasked with doing the same things over and over. There is no voice acting in the game. I felt no connection to any of the characters. The game feels incomplete in the sense that you're leveling up your character, but you never really put those skills to use. This would be a lot more interesting if there was actually a combat component matched with the clicking simulator aspect that currently exists.","May 8","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
