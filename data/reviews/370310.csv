It's a platformer that fails at every part of platforming. The same annoying song plays throughout the whole game. Trying to use a gamepad doesn't work because your guy just continually runs forward. Using keyboard/mouse, controls are terrible, with L mouse jumping, even though it says space does it. Only 2 preset config, can't set your own. The levels are boring, bland, and uninteresting. The graphics are terrible, not in a retro or pixel way, but in a blocky ugly poopy way. The actual platforming mechanics are terrible. The jump super inaccurately and floaty like. Your wall jumps are incontrollable. When you try and use the jetpack you  lag down quickly but only ascend slowly, and its hard to control. The combat is just you spamming attack to throw knives, but it doesn't really work. You can only throw straight forward but there are enemies that attack you from above and below meaning you get hurt a lot. There are a certain number of lives, and then continues. If you want to buy more the has a shop that links to their website.....because this is F2P now or what?\n\nLook everywhere and anywhere else besides this game to fulfill your platforming needs. The 2 price tag is way too rich, 20 cents sounds more reasonable.","September 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Not just once, but about once in every level I found myself falling through the ground. Once I got stuck inside a wall and unable to get loose.. and the graphics? Sure I understand if the developer is going for that ps1 platformer feel but fix these damn bugs or set it to f2p. Its not very nice to make people pay 3,99 for something that's just about unplayable. Also found it funny how the aztecs owned euros... run out of ideas for the coin design? Not recommending this. Maybe when the dev decides to fix these bugs where you fall through solid ground and glitch stuck but else? Nope.\nEDIT: It's just been confirmed this game can't even be completed. I get to world 2 level 4, the game shuts down and gives me an error messages about a memory violation. My pc memory is just fine so its the game. And I can't get past this level cause it happens every time I start this one.
