My Army Group South's advance was stalling out, and I couldn't break the Soviet Defenses around Leningrad. Army Group north was closing in on moscow, but the feirce winter had my troops stuck in their tracks. Hoping to avoid Hitler's folly, I had build up winter equipment for my men prior to the invasion, but however these extra insulated uniforms and felt boots haven't done much to increase my chances of sucess. After just losing a key battle on my way towards Moscow I decided to pan down to North Africa. Here I had blitzed through the British Lines with my Italian allies, however it was becoming more apparent that we were going to be surrounded at the suez cannal. However I just had to hold the province long enough for my fleet of troop transports to go through the cannal and escape the mediteranian sea, where they would then drop reinforcements off in Somalia to bolster the failing Italian defensive lines. Then It happened. Out of no where the English navy blindly stubles into my fleet of unarmed troop transports and they sink every single one of them. Eight Divisons, a total of 104,000 Soldiers died at sea because of my blunder! I then saved my game and decided to pick it back up later. After just getting off the game, It hit me that I've been playing this amazing game for so long, and never publically voiced my opinion about it, so I decided I'd give this game and the developers, the credit it deserves.\n\nI have to say this is by hard my favorite grand strategy games of all time. The gameplay allows for endless possibilities such as alternate historical events and outcomes. The events triggered in the game catter to shaping a world that you desire. The game also has a plethora of many great Mods for it, such as "The Grand Campaign" which bridges the World War 1 Sencario with the World War II scenario, allowing you to start in the year 1914 and end in 1991. I've spent about 212 Hours playing this game on steam, however I've easily spent another 400 playing this game on Multiplayer via Game Ranger, which at the moment is the only way to play this game with your Friends, however it does not launch the game through steam. Not only will you being scultpting the world, but you also learn a great deal about history and geopraghy at the same time. This ultra realistic diplomacy, political, and war simulator will, Darkest Hour a Hearts of Iron game, will always hold a special place in my heart, and I do not think Hearts of Iron IV will even be able to top Darkest Hour.\n\n\nMy Favorite Strategy Game ever! Totally worth the buy! If you have it and are discouraged, don't give up, once you learn how to play this game you can have so so so much endless fun with it!","June 21, 2015","true","215.1"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","76","82","10","0"

I have changed the course of History in an infinite number of ways, and have played most nations, from Germany to the USSR to Cuba to Portugal. It is the best 20th century (until 1950, anyway) grand strategy game in existence. It is far better than Hearts of Iron III.\n\nBut what is just fantastic about this game is two things: the community and the mods.\n\nThe community is one of the greatest, best bunch of history maniacs and armchair generals I have ever seen. Going to the forums is a rare and wonderful experience. And they are exceedingly nice. And they will advise you and help you. And they will discuss intricate, microscopic details of historical events with you. And you will learn. And you will like it. And you will make friends. A fantastic bunch of people.\n\nThe mods, as if the game didn't have enough content already, are incredibly fun to play, and some are incredibly detailed as well. They are not that difficult to install, and you will have a ton of fun with them. I personnally recommend Kaiserreich (Germany wins WWI) and New World Order 2 (get to play during the Cold War as well, including alternative history events for a German victory in WWII). And, of course, the community has also dedicated itself to these mods, especially Kaiserreich.\n\nI have been playing strategy games since Civilization (the first one), and this is the best strategy game I have ever played.

I think I will list them in bullet points to make it simple\n-Compared to HOI III it is much less complex and much, much easier to follow\n-Graphically compared to HOI II it is a massive improvement. However, I also think that compared to HOI III it looks much better, but thats just my opinion, you should look at screenshots if graphics are important to you\n\n-I find the game to be Historically accurate, with interesting scenarios that can happen, caused by the player or sometimes not caused by the player at all.\n\n-The WWI senario also has an interesting amount of choices which no matter who you're playing as will have an interesting affect to the game as a whole, and are plausible\n\n-The WW2 scenario is pretty good though I always want to think of alternate events that can happen etc. etc. and there are certainly some missed oppertunities, but nothing major.\n\n-Mods, firstly the AAR mod, which gives the player an extended timeline from 1914 until 1964\n\n-Mod33 a French mod that gives new nations, new events, new units, new desicions, it is a very good mod, however the event text is in French, so it is also a way to practice your French\n\n-Modern Day scenario, a very good mod, as it says you get a modern day scenario, with all new techs, all new Units, and a load of new events, not to mention all new leaders,\n\n-And Finally Kaisrreich, firstly no 2 Kaiserreich games are the same, they always turn out different, in one the USA becomes Syndicalist (no communists), in another the Qing Empire re-unite China, in another game you might see an independent Siberia, chanes are you will see many of these in a single game, you might also see none\n\n-Kaiserreich is an extremely interesting scenario, the Central Powers win WW1 and you believe that scenario, in fact it is done so well, to the point where I remember someone on the forums saying "I don't play Kaiserreich that often, but when I do, I forget real History"","July 9, 2014","true","470.7"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","59","64","2","1"

I hoped to enjoy DH: HoIG as well, but really couldn't.\n\nWhy?\n\n1.\nThe advantage of HoI was that you could do alternate history, changing the course of events, etc. DH pretty much forces you into a very pre-determined course. I tried playing as Yugoslavia, 1936 and in spite of beefing up an army, fortifying borders, doing my best to stay out of the coming war, having excellent relations with Germany, Italy, etc, come 1941, scripted ultimatum by Germany, your choices are "become a puppet" - game over or "be invaded" - game over.\n\nTried playing as the Soviets, HoI gave you a choice "do Stalin's purges, lose a third of your generals" or "don't do purges, see your dissent skyrocket". DH gives you no choice, purges just happen, you lose a third of your generals AND your dissent skyrockets (weird actually, since the purges had a rather opposite effect, putting everyone in line with the dictator's commands).\n\nSo, basically the player has very little freedom of action, outside of the developers vision of how a scenario should play out. This, to me, defeats the purpose of a sandbox grand strategy game...\n\n2.\nBias or unbalance. I got a distinct feeling the game was very pro-Germany biased. I tried a 1933 Soviet scenario and tried to play a "nice Stalin" one that helps and liberates, rather than opresses. Got involved in the Spanish civil war, took over the troops, helped Republicans get a clean win. And the thanks for my effort? Minimal relations increase, no alliance, a puny 1% dissent decrease (but for changing a minister I ger a 2% dessent increase), no military experience, basically nothing.\n\nGot involved with the Chinese in fighting off the Japanese invasion, by inviting Commie China into an alliance. Automatically Nationalist China also becomes an ally. I soundly beat the Japs, annex Chinese territory which automatically transfers to (should at least ask me which China I wanna give it to) Nationalist China. Japan asks for peace giving all Chinese territory back and Korea and Pacific islands too. I accept, Nationalist China becomes huge, but both Chinas immediately break off the alliance with me and go into negative relations. I immediately liberate Korea, but my belligerence goes up. I get no option to liberate Pacific islands and am forced to give them to Korea if I don't want rebellions.\n\nI don't give any ultimatums or invade Finland, but they still hate my guts and try to assasinate my ministers. And French and British keep trying to assasinate my ministers. I don't accept Hitler's pact to divide Poland, but he still invades it, just instead of getting half of it, he gets all of it. My belligerence is still in its 70s just for helping liberate China without keeping a single province to myself, while German one after invading the entire Europe is in its 50s.\n\nI fortify my western border with bunkers, behind rivers, upgrade all my troops to latest level, research nothing but land tactics, beefing up my ground forces to latest standard of warfare, got 1941 tanks in 1939, good and skilled generals in command. No good. When the Nazi decides to invade, he's got at least 100 divisions more than me and in spite having lower organisational rating, still cuts through my lines like a hot knife through butter.\n\nOh, and Lend-Lease. US sent over 20,000 tanks and airplanes to the Soviets. What does DH game give me? Not a single tank or plane, but 50 units of roads instead.\n\n3.\nAirforce is entirely useless. When the Nazi invades, I got complete air dominance (his planes are likely over Britain). I pound an advancing column with my entire airforce of 4 Tactical bomber groups, 4 close-air-support groups and 12 fighter squadrons all in their latest 1941 upgrades. And all I kill is 400 enemy men out of 100,000, practically don't even scratch them. No organisational disruption. No advancement slow down. Nothing. All money spent on (expensive) airforce is completely wasted.\n\n4.\nDiplomacy. Pretty useless. Any alliances, non-aggression pacts, demanding territory, outside of scripted ones are practically impossible to achieve.\n\n5.\nIntelligence. Pretty useless. Chances for any actions are so low and so expensive, that the money is utterly wasted on them and coups, sabotages, etc are practically impossible or if they happen they're definitely not worth the money in the minimal effect they have.\n\nI suppose the only way to have a chance is to invest everything in a thousand infantry divisions with artillery attachments and all the money into research boosts so you get blueprints for stuff every time. All the other features are useless and a waste of time. I'm a stubborn person, so I tried same scenarios several times, trying to make some optimal decisions to enable me to gain the upper hand, but the game just keeps blocking any progress I make by its punishing mechanics, limiting diplomacy and disruptive random events. Maybe I should just play as Germany and steamroll everyone.\n\nVerdict: Forced. Unbalanced. Biased. Frustrating. Unrewarding. Punishing. Irrational.","May 26, 2015","false","39.9"," 135 of 181 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","135","181","8","7"

While improving Hearts of Iron II, Darkest Hour also includes a number of historical scenarios ranging from Operation Overlord to The Great War (World War I). Although it lacks the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 or the 1948 Arab-Israeli War offered by Arsenal of Democracy, Darkest Hour provides one of the greatest user modifications ever made -- Kaiserreich.\n\nAvailable for download on the Paradox forums, the Kaiserreich mod follows the "Legacy of the Weltkrieg." In this scenario, Wilhelm II secured victory in the First World War causing the Allied Powers to fall into disarray, and rendering the Nazis and their rise to power null. Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all experience turmoil and strife offering the player a large number of decisions -- the UK turns socialist, the US becomes fragmented... Mittelafrika is ruled by Hermann Göring... it's all very engaging.\n\nDuring my playthrough as Romania in both Arsenal of Democracy and Darkest Hour, Darkest Hour kept most historically accurate during the 1936 Road to War campaign. However it should be noted that Slovakia is formed almost always in Arsenal of Democracy.\n\nI highly recommend Darkest Hour to the armchair general sort of strategy fan. Its successor, Hearts of Iron III, is unfortunately bogged down with unnecessary complexity with an Order of Battle organizational structure that leaves users micromanaging at all times.","January 12, 2014","true","13.0"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","41","42","2","4"

There's no unnecessarily complex OoB system that you'd need to graduate West Point to master, there aren't a billion shapeless provinces in sparsely populated areas, and although the map and UI are pretty dated they're comfy to use. In contrast to the dryness of HoI3 which has maybe half a dozen decisions solely for the purpose of railroading the AI into doing what it's supposed to do, DH has plenty of dynamic event chains, and it feels like you're really impacting the world. DH also has more of a sandboxy feel to it, with different outcomes every game, but in HoI3 once you've played each of the 3 factions you've more or less experienced it all. Then there's the timespan, with a grand campaign in DH potentially lasting from 1914-1964, 50 years, compared to 1936-1948, or 12 years, in HoI3. And last, but definitely not least, DH is tremendously easier to mod than HoI3, and so has a very active and skilled modding community. Which brings me to my last point:\n\nKaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg. The amount of detail put into this alternate-history mod for Darkest Hour is pretty stunning, and is definitely a justification all on its own for buying the game. If you have even a slight interest in alt-history, you'd be doing yourself a huge favor by picking this up and installing KR.\n\nThe base game is easily a 9/10, but Kaiserreich bumps that up to a 10/10.","October 5, 2014","true","12.9"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","36","39","2","1"

Unlike many other games, where you can pick up and play immediately, this title required a little study on my part. The in-game tutorials give some of the basic concepts, but fail to connect the dots between the various resources, province improvements, economic impacts, decision points, and WAR. It also fails to provide the dizzying array of factors that go into waging war on the land, sea, and in the air.\n\nThankfully, the manual more than makes up for this bare bones set of tutorials, and browsing a few popular steam forum posts regarding getting started can fill in the few missing details that the exhaustive, and lengthy, game manual fails to provide. All told, I had at least 4 miserable attempts at cranking up my German war machine and 3 hours of studying the manual and online material from other players before the game actually clicked. But once it did I found the experience to be more rewarding then any other strategy game I have played.\n\nPlanning is key in Darkest Hour and the game will punish you for trying to switch horses in mid-race. You wanted to invade Africa with your newly formed Afrika Corps under Rommel? Too bad, you have been gearing up for an airborne invasion of England and neglected to station a fleet in the Mediterranean, and now the Brits have closed the sea to you with strong garrisons at Gibraltar, but think ahead next time. You have been throwing back the fascist surge into your Soviet Motherland and now you wish to strike at the heart of Berlin, but oh no! Your aircraft are being chewed up by a powerful Luftwaffe and the edge of your armored spear is blunted by withering ground fire that starves your leading troops of supplies, should have planned for better AA or better aircraft to take on the advanced German machines, but you foolishly invested extremely heavily into tanks alone. You are playing as France and your doom lurks to the East, but you masterfully united your country by focusing on monetary gains and consumer goods while spending lavishly on decisions that lowered your dissent and strengthened your economic base, while simultaenously extending the Maginot line like a family of beavers on cocaine, maybe this time Fritz will not have such an easy stroll through Belgium into the north coast.\n\nThese are only a tiny fraction of the possible ways to lose or win in Darkest Hour, and I will not even get into the actual warfighting, as 50 pages of manual only starts to do it justice. If you are crazy over 20th century history (yes WWI and one of the greatest mods of all time "Kaiserreich" is available in this game), you often ponder or discuss the blunders of Imperial Japan and the Wehrmacht, or you just love the thought of Stuka's pouncing on your broken and retreating foes to inflict additional casualties, this is the game for you!!!\n\nUnlike Civ V or some other strategy games, this one is about WAR. Playing peacefully is sometimes possible as a smaller nation, but play as a major power. That is how the game is meant to be enjoyed. Watch your Reich grow, or spread freedom to the enslaved peoples of the globe as the USA. But remember, if you wish for peace. prepare for WAR!","February 4","true","39.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

I have about 2000 hours in it, and I don't at all feel like I wasted that time. It's a bit old and clunky, but if you're willing to look past that, mod it a bit and learn the mechanics, it's well worth it. It's a bit less complex than Hearts of Iron 3, but I feel like that's more of a perk than anything. This is a strategy game, not a logistics simulator. Order of Battle and supply lines are not as important as your plans and your armies.\n\nIf I had to say one bad thing about this game, it's that it has a pretty poor domestic focus. Food is not simulated at all, and anything that doesn't contribute  to your war effort is lumped into the non-descript "consumer goods" category. Diplomacy is also a bit weak. Without an event or a specially coded AI tick, the AI is highly unlikely to agree to anything you suggest. War really is the best way to solve anything, and that's fine. The game accells at war. It is a bit frustrating that the belligerance mechanic punishes you for going to war, when it's often the only way to progess, but it would seem weird to leave it out, so that gets a pass.\n\nBut for the love of god, do not play vanilla. It's fine. Vanilla Darkest Hour is a very good, enjoyable game. But you're seriously missing out by not playing Kaiserreich, Boneparte Legasy, New World Order, Fatherland and the mirad of other awesome mods you can get on the Paradox Plaza fourms.

Regarding that, it was a huge disappointment as I planned using one of the minor European countries and making it a huge force before the beginning of WWII.

But it is certainly fun and interesting, I look forward to learning the mechanics a little better and trying again.","October 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoraFE/recommended/73170/","SoraFE","Mr ???","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoraFE/","289 products in account","It's pretty much the most in-depth WW2 strategy game ever conceived of. Manage diplomacy, production, upgrades, reinforcements, technological advancement, military deployments and fight the biggest war in history.\n\nTo be completely 100% honest the game is mostly a Germany Curbstomps The Earth simulator. The game is challenging and enjoyable with clear goals defineable by you or the nation you choose. Basically, Germany can choose NOT to start the war. Or it can do so much earlier. However there's a mostly 99% chance that as other countries, war will visit you in a semi-historical fashion. As USA you will be attacked by Japan in 1940-1941, and as any country but Germany there's no chance that the Germans WON'T invade.\n\nAs fun as this game is, I feel like it's seriously limiting sometimes. I've played the game for 800 hours and I still don't understand all the mechanics, but that's my fault (and let's face it, a hopelessly convoluted Naval Model for the ship combat doesn't help either). The limitations set in when you try to completely alter history. The game is designed to facilitate historical outcomes until the war starts; as a result Germany is stronger than Poland when things go down, and the Germans will have success in France and maybe even the UK. However Germany AI never really does well against the Russians, and usually by 1942 you're dealing with Communist France.\n\nThe entire game is basically designed to be played by one of the major belligerents. If you choose to play as a minor territorial expansion and leapfrogging to greatness is possible, but extremely difficult and time-consuming. Leading Cuba to conquer the Central Americas took 20+ years. The game starts in 1936, and my first invasion kicked off sometime in the late 40's.\n\nThe game is extremely complex and is basically an OCD person's worst nightmare. You'll spend hours just organizing and planning offensives before they even begin, and keeping it all organized as you advance is the real challenge. It's too easy to forget about a unit you sent that way only to read they were encircled and destroyed; the scale is such that you can suffer serious information overload.\n\nAlso, lots and LOTS of info. Constantly being relayed to the player.\n\nI recommend this game but with a HUGE caveat:\n- If you're not super into the strategies and tactics of maneuvering armies in WW2, but are more interested in the small scale, I suggest other games. The entirety of this game is played through a map of the world. Units are represented in terms of 15,000 men instead of squads of 4 like in some RTS games set in this period.\n\n- If you don't like micromanagement, then avoid this game. Micromanagement is part and parcel of the experience.\n\n- If you don't have patience then I'd avoid it as well. This is a game with a learning curve that is more or less a straight cliff. You absolutely MUST read the manual and play the game multiple times before you can understand how to play well. My first game as Germany, the Polish occupied Berlin. It's also a very time-consuming game. I call 5-6 days of continuous play a "quick playthrough" - games can often last upwards of weeks or even months.\n\nThis is the best WW2 Grand Strategy game available, but it's also not very user friendly. Those without the patience to learn how to play should avoid this game.","August 8, 2014","true","093.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.\nFinishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.\nGetting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.\nFlipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.","March 19, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","5","11","7","0"

The original HOI's are way better than this piece of you-know-what-i-mean.\n\nIn the name of 'loyalty to history' DH force history down your throat.  However hard you try, even if winning the battles of impossible, they will make all your effort void using their 'historical' events.\n\nTake 1914 Republic of China for example, dissent +5% events pops up about bi-monthly pre-civil-war, and the minute civil war starts, they take away every single general you have, leaving literally no one to command your troops for you.  You would think that should make it hard enough?  Not even close!  The best part is, you losing or winning the battles against revolutionaries does not even matter, at all!  Even if you disband all you troops, just sit and watch revolutionaries occupying your territory, they will stop at south Yangzi River anyway.  What if you manage to slowly turn the table, beating them and drive them into sea?  Same.  The war will suddently stop by the exact same event and you will handover more than just taken-backs to the revolutionaries.  Oh wait, there is actually a difference, any troop you left on the suddently surrendered territories will just be gone for good.  So the best way to pass through the silly event chain for that period is actually pull all your armies far from revolutionaries and wait them be stopped by the event of destiny.  Yeah, that's the best thing you can do, seriously.\n\nDon't even try, just let history reveal itself.\n\nYou call it strategy game, I see it visual novel.  Not even a good one.","October 15, 2015","false","12.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","1"

The tutorial is not helpful in the least. I could go on in length about the good parts and the many bad parts of this game, but I can sum it up very quickly. You can micromange 100's of things. You can do so much in this game. There is diplomancy, combat, strategy, etc. However this game does not do any of the well. This game is not entertaining or enjoyable. I am a vertan if strategy games stemming from the Command and Conqure series as well as Age of Empires and Civilization. With Age and Civ, a lot of things are generalized. With Darkest hour, everything is too granular. I bought this game because I wanted a very granular strategy game experiance. While it technically provides that, it does not go it in a manageable, learnable, or enjoyable game. Unless the HoI series of games is the only thing you have been playing over the last 10 years or you are a developer for the HoI series, this game will likely not be enjoyable for you. Unless you are willing to read the entire manual about 3 times over and watch many hours of online tutorial, walkthrough and gameplay, and you are wanting a strategy game this have absolutly no instant gratification, then this game might be for you.","May 28","false","2.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","2","9","2","1"

The first obstacle in this game is actually running the game itself, the developers decided to keep 16 bitrate, so every windows system past windows 7 is incompatible with it, making the game lag to complete ♥♥♥♥. You have to right click exe, and fool the program into running 16 bit, and set it to windows mode. So if you wanted to play this game in fullscreen on a system past windows 7, sorry pal. One thing to note as well, I have way over 2 hours but it won't show them because I have to run this directly from the exe, and steam doesn't recognize that I'm playing the game.\n\nDon't worry though, when you finally get the game finally running you surely won't be super dissapointed. Infantry takes months to make, because as you know it takes months and months to put a gun in some peoples hand and to send them to the front. It takes around 6 months to get 1 full division (assuming you put only 3 units in it) and you need tons of infantry as majors or you will lose. When I tried playing as the soviet union, by the time your first infantry is ready you will most likely have already lost since germany has over twice the industry as you, thus they can spam tons of infantry, and their manpower barely goes down so they can march their way right to moscow.\n\nThe game is also very veery narrow; you are discouraged to do any kind of alternate history or you will get boatloads of dissent which means you will have no ic to make infantry or anything. You need to dedicate ic to consumer goods to bring it down, which even if you dedicate your whole industry to making it go down, it still takes years for it go to back to 0, and it won't matter because some random event will occur where it brings it right back to 10%, keep in mind there is almost no events that bring down your dissent either.. If you have over 50% dissent, you may as well be finished. You will lose 50% of your industrial capability and will lead to an almost imminent failure because you can't make ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnother great thing about this game that I love so much is diplomacy and intelligence. Have fun trying to do anything in diplomacy that isn't a scripted event, as nothing will work. I've tried to make countless peace treaties before and it seems to always get auto denied unless its a white peace, probably because they couldn't program it to work correctly. Intelligence has such a low chance in succeeding that ignoring it all together seems to be the way to go, or you can go right on ahead and waste 650 money on trying for the 1% chance to coup a tiny nation. Intelligence also seems awfully unrealistic, why is uk and usa trying to sabotage me before the cold war even started? The allied powers had a good relationship before the defeat of germany, and they helped the soviet union during ww2, but still try to assassinate my ministers anyways. Not like it really matters however because of how utterly useless intelligence is in the first place.\n\nAt least in hearts of iron 3, I don't have to spend an hour to get the game running, infantry doesn't take months to make and barbarossa isn't 100% guarantee win for germans, diplomacy and intelligence have an actual role in the game, and when I get dissent I can easily get rid of it within a month without dedicating my whole industry to getting rid of it. In my opinion don't even bother with this or any of the hoi games at the moment, and pray that hoi4 will be the game that is possibly the divide between both games since hoi3 has its fair share of problems as well, but not nearly as much as I have had with this game.","April 15","false","1.9"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","5","17","2","0"

I created an account and attempted to verify with the link provided in a return email.  The link lands on a "This page does not exist" error.  The email includes a second link "In case" the first link doesn't work!  It does the same thing.  The email thirdly includes a "Contact an Administrator" link which sends an email to same which just got me an automated response.

Also there are more provinces included, as well as some changes to the units. The new system also has its flaws, but I think it is a good change.\nIn general you have to say that this game increases the depth of Hearts of Iron 2, while keeping distance to the overpacked Hearts of Iron 3. This is how HoI 3 should have been.\nSo, to sum it up. You did not like HoI 3 and want a game, which is closer related to the greatest of Hearts of Iron games?

I gave it a few goes, and immediately regretted my purchase. However, after trying again and again, I played my first few campaigns and it was great. Now, by using the Grand Campaign Mod, I was able to command any nation from 1914-1991, I chose Italy.\nThe War began, and, instead of leaving the Central Powers like in History, I decided that Italy shall remain. The Great War broke out, and I fought combat on many fronts, such as Africa (In which some Jihadists and the UK and French kicked me out), the Franco-Italian border (Made no Progress whatsoever), and the Expeditionary forces I sent to Austria Hungary to fight Serbia (Also no progress). My action caused the War to end early, in 1917, and as such:\n-Germany never made the full advance into Russia, which, in turn, STOPPED THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.\n-Austria-Hungary Still Existed\n-The Central Powers and Triple Entete still exist\nBy 1920, I had made Italy a dictatorship, and modernised it's military, now rising to almost Germany's Level of Power. Bulgaria and the Ottomans had given me Military Command of their army.\nThe Game is still going on.\n\nBasically, everything you do can change history, yes, you can stick to history, but why not see what you can accomplish with knowledge of what you can prevent?\n\n10/10","January 21, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The learning curve is very high, so read all of the tips and complete all tutorials before starting. It may be tedious, but trust me, it's better than playing the game incompetently for several months like I did. Once you get the hang of it, the game will be extremely fun and almost dangerously addictive, so beware. There is almost endless replayability value, and I have not even completed a full campaign as all of the major powers yet, even with 400+ hours invested. There are also many excellent mods for the game, most notably the Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg alternate history mod, which will give you more interesting scenarios to play through. The gameplay is very immersive and much detail is put into battles and diplomacy. There is also no shortage of challenge, so even experienced players on normal difficulty will have to constantly think. The technology and economy systems are also well done. Some criticisms are the lack of diversity actually required in your armies, something fixed in HOI 3. You can often win by just building countless infantry units and simply overwhelming the enemy. There are no combined arms bonuses, and often times, using aircraft during battles or to bomb cities seemed pointless. The AI is good in most areas, but AI concerning diplomacy could improve. Making peace extremely difficult in many situations, and even if you have completely occupied an enemy country, they can still reject peace treaties, and you are forced to annex them as a result. Other than that, I experienced few problems with the game. Once again, I highly recommend it.","August 17, 2014","true","699.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I keep telling myself that I'll figure out how to actually play this game and I already have with CKII and EUIV and I'm damn proud of myself that I did I wish my friends would sit and give grand strategy a try but all they play is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOBAS and LoL and I just can't stand the ♥♥♥♥. Here I'am off topic... *sigh* give this game an alcoholic shot I know I did.","July 13, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is very immersive and much detail is put into battles and diplomacy. There is also no shortage of challenge, so even experienced players on normal difficulty will have to constantly think. The technology and economy systems are also well done. Some criticisms are the lack of diversity actually required in your armies, something fixed in HOI 3. You can often win by just building countless infantry units and simply overwhelming the enemy. There are no combined arms bonuses, and often times, using aircraft during battles or to bomb cities seemed pointless. The AI is good in most areas, but AI concerning diplomacy could improve.

I like it alot. I played HOI 2 when it first came out and easily put 200 hours into that game. I recently fell back in love with the Grand Strategy genere and wanted to get HOI 3. But even though the base game is the same price to get the most out of HOI 3 you need to have all the DLC's (Thanks Paradox) and the total cost then is like 30 bucks. Being a student i.e. no money and eagerly awaiting HOI 4 I picked up this game for like 3 dollars during a steam sale. Best game I have ever gotten on sale. The gameplay is alot like HOI2 but less buggy and just overall better. The gameplay is great and while it runs a bit clunky it is still alot of fun. It is a grand strategy game. IT HAS A LEARNING CURVE. But mastering this game is so rewarding that you forget how much you strugggled early on. Building armies, diplomacy and planning make this game an absolute blast. That said, what makes this game so enjoyable for me might make it tedious for others. It is a huge timesink and requires patience. I highly reccomend getting this game if you want to get into the grand strategy genere and dont want to shell out 30 dollars for a smei-broken Hoi3. Also the mods for this game are great and imp-rove all aspects of gameplay, especially plane combat, something that has always sucked in the base games. The only cons for this game for me is updating it. Paradox requires you to register your game and such before updating which is a huge page as their forums are terrible and completly broken, something that is being fixed as of writing this review. Would reccomend to anyone, especially history buffs and grand strategy fanatics.\n\nAlso you can conquer the world as luxenburg (With mods) 10/10.","March 30, 2015","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Darkest hour is a Political/Military simulator, spanning from as early as 1914 to the 60's. You can pick any nation you want, ever wanted to see france defeat the german Blitz * Although this is extremely difficult.* ? And say you don't enjoy playing the nation you currently are, but you don't want to start a new game? You can just load up the scenario and pick a new one! In Darkest hour, you research tech, and try to maintain your nation. There really is no " Victory" in Darkest hour , its only what you want to achieve. Also, since this is a paradox game, the community is great for Darkest hour. There are tons of mods, Like Kaiserreich, Fallout mod, Modern day, etc. I myself usually like to play kaiserreich, where its a "What if" Scenario of Germany winning ww1, and the world is drastically diffirent.  For example, in one of my games I played as the Qing Empire. After amassing enough forces, I started to conquer my neighbors in order to re-unify China. But then, I had a major war * I won* in which I had to throw germany out of Central china and Indo China. So what are you waiting for?

Darkest hour is a Political/Military simulator, spanning from as early as 1914 to the 60's. You can pick any nation you want, ever wanted to see france defeat the german Blitz * Although this is extremely difficult.* ? And say you don't enjoy playing the nation you currently are, but you don't want to start a new game? You can just load up the scenario and pick a new one! In Darkest hour, you research tech, and try to maintain your nation. There really is no " Victory" in Darkest hour , its only what you want to achieve. Also, since this is a paradox game, the community is great for Darkest hour. There are tons of mods, Like Kaiserreich, Fallout mod, Modern day, etc. I myself usually like to play kaiserreich, where its a "What if" Scenario of Germany winning ww1, and the world is drastically diffirent.  For example, in one of my games I played as the Qing Empire. After amassing enough forces, I started to conquer my neighbors in order to re-unify China. But then, I had a major war * I won* in which I had to throw germany out of Central china and Indo China. So what are you waiting for?

I never have, so jumping into this game was one of the most daunting things I've ever done when playing a video game.  Seriously, I've taken college courses that were easier than learning how to play Darkest Hour.  There's a ton of things to understand if you're going to be successful.  If you think I'm exaggerating, get this: the manual is 158 PAGES LONG.  On top of that, there are not many Let's Play videos of Darkest Hour on YouTube, and there are even fewer good ones.  There are not many people on the forum, but the few people there are very helpful.\n\nIn short, learning this game as a newbie is going to be a steep uphill battle.  This game will punish you for forgetting to click a certain button or set a certain slider.  There are tons of little details and the interface is pretty hard to navigate.\n\nHOWEVER, this game is like a dream come true for someone like me, who has always loved reading about the 20th century and has always wondered what would have happened if Germany won WWI, if Japan attacked the Soviet Union instead of the United States, if Spain joined the Axis and attacked Gibraltar, etc.  The complexity of this game makes all the potential outcomes much more plausible, and therefore more entertaining.  And there's nothing like looking through the divisions you're commanding and finding the one your grandfather served in.\n\ntl;dr: this game is HARD.  Learning it will take many hours.  I'm not even close to mastering this game.  However, it's well worth the effort.  Winning a multiplayer match on any of your shooters isn't nearly as satisfying as winning a hard fought war and changing the world.","April 22, 2015","true","120.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also all of the former "titles" are included in this.\nThe old manpower-system has been replaced by a Conscription and Mobilization system. Also there are more provinces included, as well as some changes to the units. The new system also has its flaws, but I think it is a good change.\nIn general you have to say that this game increases the depth of Hearts of Iron 2, while keeping distance to the overpacked Hearts of Iron 3. This is how HoI 3 should have been.\nSo, to sum it up. You did not like HoI 3 and want a game, which is closer related to the greatest of Hearts of Iron games? Then you can go for this game without any remorse.","April 30, 2013","true","103.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They even have their own forum, although they also have the mod on the paradox forum, but you can't see that unless you register the game. Anyway, apart from the Kaisserreich mods there is an enormous variety of excellent mods that far outstrips any other WW II game that Paradox or other developers have produced. This game has excellent moddability.\n\nStrategy\nThe strategy in this game is excellent, although the economy side is a little underdeveloped compared to Arsenal of Democracy. The strategy in this game with the available missions on land, air and sea far outstrips anything other games can represent.\n\nAI\nThe AI is competent, the AI will destroy you if you don't follow your plan. If you deviate too often from your set plan the AI will absolutely destroy you since they are competent at doing the missions. The ability to control your puppets or the smaller countries in your alliance makes up for any incompetence they might present. The expeditionary forces ability gives you the ability to help your ally in need without the hassle of controlling them yourselves.\n\nTech teams\nThe number of tech teams is based on your Industrial Capacity, this means the more IC the more tech teams. The tech teams are a better alternative than the HOI3 model of just leadership points. The techteams have certain areas where they are competent in and the level determines how good they are. This means that some nations have an edge in some areas of research.","April 29, 2015","true","302.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
