The original 2014 version that looks like it's created using MS Paint and uses up for jumping. Then there's the new version which looks slightly better and introduces the worst ever implementation of wall jumping. The controls in both versions are really bad and in an insta-death platformer that's not a good thing at all. Those problems are severe, but if the game had at least any interesting levels or something else that would warrant playing the game, I wouldn't mind the control problems that much. Unfortunately both versions have bland, boring and unimaginative level with only one saving grace: You can turn into monsters to overcome certain parts of the levels. While this idea is quite good, the combination of controls and poor level design just make it absolutely frustrating to use.\n\nThe one interesting aspect of the game is hindered by a poor presentation, horrible controls and boring level design. Really not worth your time and there has to be a landslide of improvements (given there is already a second version) before this game is worth your time.","May 5, 2015","false","9.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

You have to CONSTANTLY tap to fly if you are in the shape of one the flying aliens. It is more awkward on the controller if you add the fact that the left stick is up/down and the right is L/R, it isn't all one stick to move, which is very common sense and normal in controller games. Jump is spastic sometimes, giving you a give burst jump, or at least it seems that way. Transforming causes you to do a little "hiccup" and if you are too close to an edge, you fall off because of that (which, with many of the corners rounded, you slip off instead of teetering on the edge). Music gets VERY annoying fast since it is like a 5 second bit on constant repeat.\n\n\n\nI REALLY hope this game gets updated with some decent updates, because I'd like to come back and try it some more. For now, I will just let it finish running in the background to get my last couple card drops.\n\nI will update this when and if there is a major update or several smaller ones, and I've retried it.

My general stance is to not buy Early Access, so I don't know how to rate them.\n\nI would say to wait until this is properly released, because currently it handles like someone fed your keyboard/controller sugar mixed with meth. A tiny tap is translated as six to seven hundred taps, and it makes the game rather difficult. Difficult in the bad way.\n\nThe game spends a great deal of time trying to get the idea across that it is supposed to be super hard, a real rage quit experience, but it's doing it in the way that no one actually wants to experience. Super Meat Boy is a real rage quitter, but that's because it's a challenge in the reflexes and puzzle solving sense. You are using super tight control and intuitive feedback to overcome an experience.\n\nThis game just gives you awful controls and next to no feedback on your actions and just says, "Well, uh, it's supposed to be hard!"\n\nSo yeah, wait and see if this is eventually released in a playable state.","December 13, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Majority of game duration is trying to get steam trading cards so ignore with regards to this review.\n\nIn short, I recommend that you skip this item.","December 30, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are awful, gameplay mechanic is unenjoyable and the fact that you can die 3 times and then game over is unbeliveable.","December 14, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
