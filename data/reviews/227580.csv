"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miraglyth/recommended/227580/","Miraglyth","Miraglyth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miraglyth/","390 products in account","To preface this review, I have beat the game. This review is not out of frustration for not being able to accomplish that, but it is out of frustration from the game in general.\n\nFor a match 3 game the concept is novel, adding a requirement of matching specific tiles to progress.\n\nUnfortunately once the novelty wears off, it becomes a chore. And the novelty will wear off, because the game is stacked against you in multiple ways, and requires you to lose repeatedly to complete tasks and buy upgrades (which soon become an artificial barrier to gameplay) before winning it even becomes possible.\n\nThe main barrier to fun in the game is the manner of losing - not the inevitability, as with Tetris, but the speed at which it can happen. Every obstacle requires a specific type of match - attacks or keys - and the game can at whim decide to deprive you of these, leaving you helpless to do anything but wait until defeat.\n\nOther problems with the control system compound this. For instance, sliding the tiles is not well designed. If you click a tile, it can only slide by the first direction the mouse moves. So if you want to drag a tile upwards but your mouse moves a LITTLE to the left first, your tiles will try moving left and right instead. You can try again while the mouse button is held down, but you've lost that time.\n\nThe matching detection is not great either. When you line or nearly line up a match, their tiles illuminate, however when you let go the tile you're moving can fit to an adjacent space, meaning the match does not occur and you have to start again. Once more, this costs time.\n\nThe game needs resource management - trying to keep a healthy number of attack tiles and keys on the board at all times to be ready for any obstacles that arrive, but a couple of things ruin this as a concept and make the game even less fun.\n\nThe monsters - particularly boss class monsters - require a LOT of matches and items to defeat, during which time you're losing time AND they hit you which also costs a nasty chunk of time. It goes without saying that despite the whole upgrade system, matching attack tiles is just not effective enough to keep the game balanced.\n\nThe game can and does throw numerous amounts of the same obstacles at you consecutively, such as two chests, a door and then another chest. Even if you kept a healthy number of keys available at the start of this, you probably won't have enough to get through it all which leads to a lot of lost time and defeat. The same applies to multiple tough monsters.\n\nMatching tiles or using an item JUST before you arrive at an obstacle will cause it to be wasted. There's no tolerance whatsoever. This can lead to situations where you're not blocked by an obstacle, and too afraid to do anything because you don't want to lose the matches you can see available to you. This is contrary to the game's advertised element.\n\nFinally, when you match tiles, more appear which can result in combos. Normally in this kind of game these are desirable, but in this game they can and will punish you by decimating a resource you can see yourself needing soon - for instance, if you're fighting a monster with a chest behind it, a few keys may fall in during the fight, matching with the ones already on the board and severely depleting the keys. Then when you win the fight you won't be able to deal with the chest.\n\nFurthermore, when newly-fallen tiles create combos, this takes time during which you are unable to slide any tiles to make more matches. This results in awkward situations where you can see multiple matches you want to make but are unable to do so because a useless combo is ongoing and killing you in the process.\n\nYou do get a very limited number of items, but most of the time an item does not even clear one of its respective obstacles. After a few hours of play to finally be able to challenge for the game's namesake 10,000,000 points (yes, you need to play for a few hours before winning a game even becomes a possibility), key items will not be enough to open a three-lock chest or door, and you will need at least three damage items to defeat a single monster.\n\nThis game had promise, but its execution is disastrous. Its visuals and music are very fun for a few hours, but they do not last the extended periods of time demanded of you when the game becomes an unfair and repetitive grind.","December 26, 2013","false","13.9"," 251 of 333 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","251","333","0","11"

Your matching skills control the time limit which is represented by a character above the puzzle who runs through a dungeon hacking away at enemies, opening chests and doors. Eventually you really need to keep your eyes peeled and make well thought out decisions to make it through. What helps make this game so addictive is the ability to upgrade your stats and weapons as the dungeons will progressively get more difficult. the goal is to score 10,000,000 points in one dungeon run, which seems almost impossible.

Now, it's not as enjoyable as the Puzzle Quest games but the game is not a complete trainwreck either. Despite the horrible controls (or morel like 'control' - it's mouse only and 'slide'-based, naturally intended for a smartphone device), it can serve you a bit of fun for a couple of hours. However, if you're out to get all of the achievements then you might be in for a long and painful grind. This is due to the very annoying RNG.\n\nAll the negativity aside, let's get more into how the game works. You start out with a simple character, trapped in a place with barred up doors. You want to break free from this prison, but to do so, you must get a 10 000 000 score. Simple, right? Well, not really. Your toon is weak and in order to become stronger and advance then you need to gather supplies and gold. How do you do that? Well, that's where the core of the game comes in! You will need to arm yourself and venture into the dungeons!\n\nAt first, you'll see the familiar match 3 board and you'll start to match tiles as you would in any type of game like this. Soon you will notice that you're not only meant to match them, you're meant to match certain tiles at certain times. Your toon will encounter foes with different abilities and weaknesses, knowing when to match the sword or the staff tiles might save you a lot of trouble here! There are also locks on chests and doors that you need to open by matching keys. Sometimes you will gain an item or a consumable by opening chests, but also if you match the chests on the tile board. These you can use to help you progress in the dungeons. Then there are the wood and stones that you need to upgrade the different shops.\n\nI had a lot of fun with the game in the beginning, especially when it felt like you made progress. Each new rank you unlock is a higher difficulty, and with each ranks there are several challenges to complete that grants you various bonuses. However, when you've reached the highest rank and completed all of the bonuses then the game kind of loses its potential. It takes a lot of luck and patience to even reach a score of 10 million, in any rank. I managed to 100% the game after nearly 13 hours of playtime. I've read about people who still hasn't been able to even after 30 hours, so keep this in mind if you're looking for an easy game to get perfect.\n\nDespite all the flaws and lack of fun end game I enjoyed it when I didn't feel too stressed out. The further you get, the quicker you need to be to match the tiles. You need to be able to notice when the border of your board turns red (encounters/events) or green (when your toon is mainly walking) and adapt to this in the best way possible. It takes time getting used to how the game functions, especially when it comes to matching the tiles by sliding the columns and rows. It can be extremely frustrating at times and I wish the developer had thought about this when porting the game to PC. It's already a challenging game and believe me, being defeated just because you weren't able to align the tiles perfectly due to whatever or any reason is just flat out aggrivating.\n\nI can recommend it if you like casual games that are a bit of a challenge. 10000000 is a challenge, both physically and mentally. In a good or bad way? Well, a bit of both to be honest.","May 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Though the game is primarily a Match-Three, every single type that you match provides an effect that drastically alters your current encounter.  Match three (or more for an increased effect) swords, for example, and you'll unleash a physical attack; match three magic wands, you'll cast a magical attack; match three keys, you'll unlock a treasure chest or door, etc.\n\nThe game is quite challenging, though each time you run through a dungeon path you'll acquire gold, experience, and items that will aid you in future runs.  Gold can be used to upgrade your equipment (swords, staves, shields, armor, etc.) by choosing a specific trait such as the sharpness of your sword (critical chance) or the material that it is made out of (base damage).  Experience can be used to purchase training upgrades which enhance abilities such as your lockpicking skills and increasing damage against certain enemy types.\n\nAll in all, it's a cheap game with a good amount of fun to be had as long as you keep that in mind.","March 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

While the game delivered less depth than the concept seemed to allow for, I still got a very fast-paced, addictive, and satisfying puzzler. It was cumbersome using a mouse to play a game that was clearly designed with touch screens in mind, but the gameplay was enjoyable enough at its core to ease that pain most of the time. The music was catchy, and the variety of things to level up provided enough incentive to make it through most of the game. What I most appreciated was the fact that you're unlikely to brute force your way to the 10,000,000 point goal by simply grinding enough to level everything. Success is ultimately the result of strategy, speed, and good fortune, which was refreshing after the way so many other smartphone ports that have made it to this platform just hand victory to the player after a significant enough investment of time and virtual currency. It's unlikely that you'll want to revisit this one after beating it, but the asking price is very reasonable for a game of 10,000,000's overall quality.","October 18, 2014","true","15.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Now, that may sound schizophrenic, but all the features actually mold together quite well to create a strange but fun experience. The gameplay consists mostly of dragging rows of cubes in order to match 3 of a certain type of cube, thereby helping you pass whatever obstacle you are currently faced with. Unfortunately, the game often gives you tons of whatever you need the least of at a certain time, leading to quite a lot of frustration. I remember one run in which I started out with a ton of keys.\n“Yeah!” I thought. “I’ll be totally set for this run!”\nI was then presented with about  10 or 15 obstacles in a row that required keys, and I ran out about halfway through and had to simply bide my time until the one match that I needed came along, using up all of my special items and powerups in the process. Now, whether that was built into the engine or I just have the worst luck in the world remains to be seen, but that kind of thing happens extremely frequently.\nThe gameplay sometimes gets as annoying as the music (an extremely loud 8-bit tune in an endless loop), with the aforementioned situation of having everything except the one thing that you need providing nearly endless frustration. The goal of the game is to get 10,000,000 points in a single run, because apparently that will help you somehow escape the prison you are in. While in a run, you can collect special items for use in a pinch, as well as building materials, gold, and experience. You can use the building materials to fix and upgrade your base. What benefit do base upgrades give? They help you waste all your gold and XP getting upgrades for your equipment.\nLater on in the game, the price of training skills and getting upgrades becomes completely outrageous, whilst you are left sitting on a huge pile of wood and stone with nothing to spend it on. One thing I did like about the game was the difficulty curve. As you gather more points and complete objectives, you rank up and are forced to face harder and harder monsters. Thankfully, this gives the game a natural flow. Every time you rank up, the super-hard boss monsters that used to always kill you before you could get any matches in become commonplace grunts.\nOverall, 10,000,000 is a fun game, and it is definitely worth 5 bucks for the hours of gameplay you will undoubtedly get from it. While many players like me will ragequit often, you’ll always be coming back for more. I hope we can see a more polished and less frustrating sequel sometime in the future.","November 25, 2013","true","8.9"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","35","54","0","0"

The core gameplay mechanic is the basic tile matching we've seen in so many games by now, 10,000,000's own little unique aspect to this rather tired mechanic is that instead of moving individual tiles you move entire columns. This however does not change the concept significantly and if you have played a tile matching game in the past you'll figure this one out in no time at all.\n\nThe interesting aspect of 10,000,000. And what separates it from so many other similar games, is the way it approaches the timing mechanic. on top of your screen you have a little guy running along in a dungeon, as he progresses he will encounter various obstacles such as doors and monsters each pushing him slowly out of the screen if you do not match the right tiles on the board below. This creates quite a bit more purpose than your usual tile matcher where you just match what you can, as quickly as you can. Here you might wanna save those keys in case you run into a chest, or be careful not to spend too many swords and staffs if you think you're getting close to a tough monster.\n\nThe game also feature a small metagame, as you match tiles and progress through the dungeon you earn wood, stone, gold and experience which can be used to open up shops and improve your various abilities.\n\nAll in all 10,000,000 is a fun little game, nothing spectacular, nothing really exciting but a solid time waster. Unfortunately while the time waster genre as such is perfect for mobile games it does not fit quite as well on the PC and although this one of the best examples I've seen in a long time it still doesn't quite measure up to the standards that you would expect from a game that costs money.","May 11, 2013","true","62.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

As with most games of this type, you don't need many words to describe how you play.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of sliding rows and columns of various icons so that three or more align, making the aligned icons disappear and making new ones fall out of the top to replace them. The spin that 10,000,000 has to offer is that you're a prisoner of a dungeon, and you must score, well, 10 million points to get out. You earn points by killing monsters and opening doors and chests, by matching staffs and swords, or keys, respectively. Matching backpacks gives a chance of earning items, which you can then use to kill monsters, to give you more time in the dungeon or to open chests and doors. There are also wood and stone icons, which give you those as a resource that stays the same between playthroughs. There are two other, similarly working resources: experience and gold, which are earned by killing monsters and opening chests. Once you run out of time in the dungeon, you return to the main hub where you can use the resources you've amassed to upgrade your statistics in rooms that can be upgraded. To progress through the dungeon you must complete quests such as "match x amount of y tiles", or "make x amount of triple matches". Eventually, a quest involving scoring a set amount of points during a round appears, and upon completing the quest, you gain a new rank and may now start the next run further in the dungeon.\n\nNow, that looks like a ton of words, but that is literally all the game has to offer. There is nothing else in this game (apart from the ending, which I won't spoil, but trust me when I say that I wouldn't need many more words to describe what happens after getting 10,000,000 points).\n\nThe game sports a "retro" feel to complement the mechanics, which works fine. The pixel graphics are good, but not amazing. The music is also pretty nice, but there aren't many tracks. After a few runs, it gets very repetitive, to the point where I, a person who usually sticks through with a games music until the end, had to use my music library instead.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these facts point toward the game being an obvious mobile port, designed to be played in short bursts of playtime. As a result, the interface is a bit huge when playing in full screen, and the options menu is very lackluster (not that it needs to not be, given the simple graphics of the game).\n\nThe RPG-ish equipment upgrading mechanics aren't bad (I love it when the name of your armor changes based on the aspects you choose to upgrade, possibly giving names such as "immovable cloth ring mail" or "soft diamond shirt"), but what's the point of having a visual representation of your character if he looks like a pixelated Indiana Jones regardless of whether he has mythril plate-mail or a cloth shirt? It's not like there's thousands of equipment possibilities.\n\nOverall, 10,000,000 feels very repetitive. It's good at what it does, and presents a spin on the "match 3" puzzler mechanics, but this doesn't remove the repetitiveness problem completely. The equipment upgrades seem like an after-thought because of how they do not affect the character visually. This game hangs in the balance between "I recommend it" and "I don't recommend it", but equipment non-visualization forces me to say that I don't recommend 10,000,000.\n\nThis does not mean it is a bad game at all, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most hardcore "match 3" fans. The developers still update the game though, so I promise to change the recommendation if they do visualize the equipment upgrades. In my opinion, a good "match 3" has to have a good core system and a great spin on the formula. Visualizing the upgrades would make the spin in this one great, instead of "just" good.\n\nEDIT 2015/05/28 - Noticed I misspelt the title of the game every single time by forgetting the commas.

It's kind of like Bejeweled. The matches you make down below push your character through combat and exploration above. Each "run" through the dungeon takes a minute or two. But as you run, you achieve a series of objectives which the game gradually presents to you, which leads to improved skills.\n\nThe game's genius is the way it rewards you not for a lifetime score, but instead for pushing your single-run high score higher and higher, until you can reach 10,000,000 in a single run. As your character improves a bit with each run, cresting your previous high score becomes theoretically easier each time you run the dungeon. Die, and you can either quit the game, or try one more run almost instantly.\n\nIt's not a deep game, but I can't think of many games that made "just one more turn" so compelling. Like, "Civilization"-style compelling. It's so easy to try again, over and over.

But the RPG elements added into 10,000,000 make it just different enough to keep it interesting. The upgrades and RPG elements aren't very deep or anything but I believe it is just enough of a twist to set it apart from other tile matching games. I would say if you like matching games it is worth $5.

The only obvious ways is to run through a dungeon while playing a pixelated more dungeon-ey version of Bejewled. While on those runs, you have to match sword blocks to attack, staff blocks to do a magic attack, match wood and stone to get the materials to upgrade your castle, unlock doors and chests with key blocks, and upgrade your armor with shield blocks. You try to last as long as you can while matching these blocks to stay alive and make it to "10,000,000" points. Once you get 10,000,000 points you are freed from you castle.\n\n\nUsing the money and purple stuff and gold and wood and stone that you aquire over your grinds of dungeons, you can fix rooms. These rooms are good for things such as upgrades, potions, etc. Some of the upgraes may be things like "Pay 200 purple stuff and 300 gold and you will have 10% more luck" etc. This is a vital part of 10 mil since you need to upgrade your dude to last longer and ultimately get freed!\n\nPros and Cons!\n\nPros:\n\n1.Loads of upgrades!\n2.Bejeweled style Gameplay!\n3.Puzzles!\n4.Missions!\n5.Hours of fun gameplay!\n6.Grinding! since i have nothing better to do :(\n7.Retro style!\n8.Pixels!\n9.The guys got a hat!\n10.Deep gameplay!\n\nCons:\n\n1.When playing theres this one group of  ♥♥♥♥ing pixels that is black on the left side of the screen.

The twist in this one is that the matching mechanic works in conjunction with the actions your character takes at the top of the screen. The character's goal is to keep moving to the right, clearing obstacles such as monsters, treasure chests and locked doors. In order to clear those obstacles, you need to match specific types of tiles (swords to kill monsters, keys to open chests, etc). Getting hit or not matching tiles causes you to slow down and creep towards the left side of the screen. If you get pushed all the way back, the run is over. After each run, you return to a dungeon where upgrades can be purchased using the resources collected during the run (wood, stone, gold and experience). And that's pretty much all there is to it. Basically, you just keep running through the dungeon and buying upgrades when you die. Reaching certain score milestones causes you to rank up, which allows you to achieve higher scores and travel further into the dungeon. The ultimate goal is to score the titular 10,000,000 points and escape. On the technical front, the graphics are extremely simple, done in a low-res pixel style. It works for what it is, but the visuals are really nothing to write home about. I did really like the music, though. It's pretty catchy and very NES-esque.\n\nIn summary, if you are a fan of "match 3" games and don't mind spending a few hours on the mindless grind it takes to complete (I would estimate around 5-6 hours or so), then by all means, give this a shot. However, I really must reiterate that the gameplay is the very definition of a grind - the whole experience from start to finish is extremely repetitive. If you have a short attention span or really don't like doing the same thing over and over for hours, do NOT buy this game. Additionally, I have to say I also think the price is a little too high. For some reason, it's double what it costs on iOS, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not saying it's a rip-off, but this might be one of those cases where you may want to wait and see if it goes on sale at some point.","March 12, 2014","true","11.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Unlike some games with additional RPG elements this game makes them necissary, your weapon and armor upgrades allow you to get further in the game and without the RPG elements it would be nearly impossible to get to the victory condition of 10,000,000 points in a single run. The graphics are visually uninteresting but that is not that big of an issue as you can allways tell the difference between the different tiles and enemies. It bearly takes up any space on your hard drive so it is definately good for weaker PCs. my only real issue with it is the controlls.

Upgrades are available for your sword, staff, armor, and shield. Plus you can buy additional training attributes through earned experience points. Then there are the potions which have both positive and negative effects that you must weigh to determine whether to activate them or not.\n\nThe gameplay consists of frantically matching gems to attack or unlock doors and chests in an effort to keep your character from hitting the left edge of the screen. Your character continues running to the right as long as you match the right gems to vanquish your enemies or open doors and chests.\n\nThere is no polish on this game whatsoever.

Well... ok...\n\nWhile the game does have an interesting concept it annoyingly relies on luck and what tiles the game decides to generate more than anything else, much like Bejeweled or similar puzzle games. If a monster is in your path, you'll have to quickly match sword or staff tiles to do damage. A locked chest requires matching key tiles. And as tiles are random, one might find oneself stuck, matching any tiles at all, hoping to match enough of what is needed before time is up.\n\nAt the start of the game, be prepared to lose, quite often, until enough materials are gathered to unlock upgrades. While initially the upgrades that can be purchased come in handy and allow one to make quick work of monsters, the upgrades have a max level which in my opinion is too low. Especially during the latter ranks, and especially when fighting bosses. Even completely maxed out requires, more often than not, way too many tile matches and wastes way too much time. However, there are items to find thru out the dungeon run which can help somewhat. Scrolls that will change wood or stone tiles to keys, swords, or staves. Various weapons and orbs to hurl at monsters. Skeleton keys to easily unlock chests or locks. And food items that will give you a time boost. With that said, the weapons, orbs and skeleton keys must be used rather precisely; if used a split second too early when arriving upon a chest or monster the item does nothing and disappears. The same can be said for tiles too. It would have been nice if there was some leeway as making sure the dungeon runner is close enough to an obstacle before using items can waste valuable time, even if just a split second.\n\nAnd possibly the biggest time waster in the game, combos. Match some tiles, more fall down and they match. Combo! They are sometimes handy like during a boss fight. Except when the tiles continue to fall and continue to match it becomes a potential death trap. Yes, I've lost more than once awaiting tiles to stop falling and matching others because during this time nothing else can be done. And if the reason I lost wasn't because I ran out of time, it was shortly after because the combo completely used up tiles that would have came in handy just a few seconds later.\n\nReplay value? Prepare to spend several hours upgrading everything before even attempting a run for 10,000,000. But after one does achieve freedom by getting to a score of 10,000,000, the only reason I can think of to come back to this game would be to try for a higher personal score (no Steam leaderboards), or to earn all achievements. Personally, once I complete all the achievements I doubt I will ever play this again.\n\nIs 10,000,000 fun? Sure, it can be. Would I recommend it? Hmm. Not at the full price of $4.99. I picked it up on sale for less than a dollar. At that price it was worth it. While I don't really want to vote thumbs down, I'm going to have to since Steam has no neutral option.","February 4, 2014","false","31.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

As such these games will take you on an emotional roller coaster; when things don't go your way you will feel deep low's of frustration. But when things are going your way you feel elation from the accomplishment of beating the odds.\nThis game can be very hard, you need to be extremely quick in matching tiles. There is a sort of 'continual countdown timer' where if you do not match tiles quickly enough then your 'session' will come to an end. You can increase your session 'time' by creating a match 4 or 5 of certain tiles or by eating food. On the other hand, if enemies hit you then your 'time' will decrease.\n\nThe style of 'matching tiles' in this game is similar to 'Puzzle Kingdoms' except in this game you can slide as far as you like along the entire row or column.\n\nYou will fail alot in this game especially at the harder difficulties as the odds are stacked against you. But 'winning' every play session is not how this game works. You just take each 'play session' as far as you can; you will earn resources and experience every play session which you keep regardless. You spend this upgrading your dwellings, weapon, armor, spells, equipment, etc. So the idea is that you are playing the game for the match 3 puzzle/challenge and just let the progression happen in the background naturally.I feel this game is more for an advanced or veteran match 3 puzzle player and will not be friendly to new comers of the genre.","July 4, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Too bad it only has a limited playtime (5 hours). It is a sort of tech-demo: the gameplay is solid, but the game is not so refined (for example, upon completing a quest you are forced to exit the dungeon for refreshing the others) and lacks some customization (no resolution settings), quality (bitmaps everywhere!) and variety (maybe different classes, hero's stats, different levels, and so on).\nWhat's about the gameplay? You advance the dungeon by combining items of the same type in your lower part of the screen: wands for magical attack, swords for physical attack, chests for loot and so on... enemies can attack you and slow you down (or kill!).\n\nAdvice: you can upgrade your buildings by clicking "upgrade" in the upper portion of the windows... It took me 3 hours to notice it.\n\nI am looking forward to 20,000,000!

The more tiles of the same kind you match, the more powerful the effect is.  For example, if you match 5 swords instead of 3, the effect is going to be stronger and you will deal more damage.\n\nThere are also many upgrades that you can get, and most likely WILL get before you actually finish the game.  The achievements were not too too hard to get, I wish they would have been more of a challenge, I kind of got them all during the playthrough except the one where you need to use all the potions, I had to do it once I finished the game.\n\nI think it definitely is worth it at its current price.

At the heart of the game is a "connect 3" game (I think that's the term...?); you have a board of tiles, and must match three or more to do something. While you're playing the game, you'll be faced with either enemies, a locked door, or a locked chest, and must match the correct corresponding tiles to advance. To combat the enemies, you must connect either the melee tiles (which can crit), or the magic tiles (which can have special effects, ranging from freezing them solid, to poisoning them). To combat the doors and/or chests, you must match the keys. Once you open the chest, you either get gold (one of three currencies used in the game to unlock / upgrade things), or a one-time use item that helps you in fighting. Other tiles that are used are: wood (currency), stone (currency), item (gives you an item to use in combat), and wildcard, which acts as anything, tile-wise.\n\nThere are a couple of things I don't like about the game, namely the fact that there are situations where it's virtually impossible to win. If the board gives you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand, you can't do anything about it (well, you can use an item to randomly change like, five of 25 tiles once...), and will lose. If you don't have any keys on the board, and you run into a chest, well, good luck. While I appreciate that the game has "stronger" and "weaker" monsters, they're not tuned very well; the dragons will make short work of you, unless you have items saved up for them specifically. The graphics might be a turn-off to some players. There's only one song, that's endlessly looped (didn't bother me, but I wanted to mention it). Another annoyance is that if you use your items early, before the enemy is properly aligned with you, you've wasted the item, and it does nothing. Really...? Finally, the hit-detection can be weird, since you *only* use the mouse for this game...most times it was okay, but I did notice it from time to time.\n\nWith all that said, I enjoy this type of game, and with light RPG elements, and the fact that certain tiles really only work with certain situations, I enjoyed the strategy... when I wasn't raging. As mentioned at the top, I would rate this a 7/10, but would only recommend it at around $1.00 or so (or if it's in a bundle).\n\n[I've played the game offline; I've got about four hours played start to finish.]","February 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It reminded me of Henry Hatsworth for the NDS, without the manual platforming elements. Your character will run automatically until you bump into an enemy, door or chest. Then it's time to match key, staff, rock, wood, shield, backpack or sword tiles. Sword and staff tiles will damage your enemies, wood and rock tiles will help you build your castle, backpack tiles can give you items and shield tiles will give you a shield (did you expect anything else ?). A little counter in the top right will count to 10,000,000 while you journey along. That's right, 10,000,000. That's a lot. But in fact it will take several minutes to reach it. That is, if you upgrade your entire castle and know what you're doing. It also depends on a little factor called luck.

Fight your way through hordes of monsters, while using your puzzle skill to kill them off. Who knew one day that puzzles would be the bane of dragons.\n\n\nGame play: 7\nThe game play is solid. You start off in a stone room with broken down doors everywhere, that leads into other rooms. With these rooms, you are able to increase your static, from better armor, to better spells, to better score multipliers, to more damage. To be able to unlock each door you must run the ongoing dungeon to earn experience to gain levels and to gain gold. While running the dungeon you are given a Bejewel style puzzle game. On the top of the screen you have the character running, He’ll run into monsters, doors, and chest. That you need to match up the squares to progress further into the dungeon. You are given a time limit. You will slowly be pushed backwards to the left edge of the screen. The faster you kill monsters or unlock things the closer you get to the right side of the screen. Once you pass a certain threshold on the screen you will gain a bonus to your score as long as you keep moving ahead. Each Square has an icon that you need to match up to be able to kill monsters or unlock chest or doors. Each icon has special ability to help you progress deeper. The icons you see are, Wood, Boulder, Wand, Sword, backpack, key and shield. Wood and boulder give you materials to use to build the rooms you see at the start. Wand and sword are attacks depending on the monster they can be either be weaker or stronger vs the type you are using. The backpack can give you items to use in your inventory on the right side of the screen. The key is used to open chest and doors, the shield gives you better armor to take hits better.\n\n\n\nOn the side, you have you’re inventory where you get power ups, From faster moment, to magic attacks, to keys and weapons. They can be very useful. After you die you are able to use the gold and materials you gained from the previous run to build the rooms, or you may hold on to them until next time. The overall object of the game is to get your score to 10,000,000 (Ten million). To be able to escape.\n\n\nStory: 2\n\n\nThere isn’t really a story going on here. You are a guy who looks like Indiana Jones who has become trapped in this dungeon that is now trying to escape. Having to fight zombies, demons, dragons and such. That’s pretty much it. This game doesn’t really need much of a story to really enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\nGraphics: 6\n\n\nThis game takes on the retro 8-bit style. Like many other indie games that uses 8-bit. They are pretty simple as it is. The mix of colors being used range from grays, to lighter colors like reds and blues. It’s a simple pallet of colors over all. The graphics don’t pop out as anything to flashy to it. they are Kinda of flat graphics. In its own right the graphics are decent.\n\n\nMusic: 5\n\n\nLike the graphics it takes on an 8-bit sound track. The music is decent sounding but not amazing but yet not horrible either. It does keep in decent pace with the game play. Other than that there isn’t really much else to the music.\n\n\n\nFinal Though:\n\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game a lot. It was fun, and challenging. I found the game play being the best part of this game. However this game kinda of lacks any real re playability. It’s a game that is great for a one time play and not touch it for a while. This game doesn’t stand out to other puzzle games. However the unique thing about this game is the RPG element which gives it a nice touch. Having the Bejewel style puzzle being what you use to fight monsters and unlock stuff with does give this game the bit of edge it needs to push it higher than your average puzzle game. With the mix of gaining gold and materials and being able leveling up to unlock more powers to make you stronger does make this game fun.\n\n\nIf you are a puzzle person or someone who simply loves Bejewel like myself you may want to try this game out. If anything this game is cheap so for a few bucks you can’t go wrong with this game.\n\n\nFinal Score: 6\n\nCheck out my Tumblr for more! www.rogue32807.tumblr.com","May 11, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Steady progress in the game allows you to gain the tools to break out of your prison.\n\nTitle: 10,000,000\nGenre: Action, Casual, Indie, RPG\nDeveloper: EightyEightGames\nPublisher: EightyEightGames\nRelease Date: 15 Jan, 2013\n\nMain Review\nIt's not an easy game, but it's addictive in how it works. Your character progresses in a dungeon and you match blocks together in order to keep on moving, matching keys to open a door or chest, swords or shields to fight. The game is a race against time. It's quite fast paced and easy to get into, though hard to keep going and finish it. The RNG can sometimes really screw you up - and you may need to reset a level just because you didn't get what you needed for a long time. It's satisfying to see the big numbers appear, and each shake of the screen when you match blocks is pretty cool.\n\nYou need to reach the score 10,000,000 in order to complete the game, and all the runs beforehand allow you to buy upgrades such as potions, weapons, gear, score accumulators in order to improve your score further, get better upgrades - until you're good enough to hit the top score to beat the game.\n\nYou can collect four items that stay with you even when a run fails, to make future runs easier. It can get really fraustrating, since even if you have every single upgrade, getting the final score is still difficult. However that also makes it fun! The music also helps a lot to get you more stressed.\n\nVisually the game at times make it hard to see what's going on, especially when managing your position in the game. The character screen is small. On the left of the main "running" screen is a skull, on the right is a finish line and a smily face. If your character is at the right of the screen, it's harder to counter a threat since you don't see it until it's already on you. If your character is on the left of the screen, you'll die a lot faster if you don't get the block combination you need to open a door, since your run ends if the skull catches up with you.\n\nPros and ConsPro's\n\nAddictive\nChallenging/Fast paced\nGood music\nFun system to work with\n\nCons\n\nAddictive\nChallenging/Fast Paced\nMUSIC MAKES YOU STRESSED\nRNG hates you\nThe screen doesn't move\n\nTL'DR\n\nOverall VerdictI recommend this game to other people.

It features RPG elements, item managements and potion selections at the start of your game. This game is as good for casual players as it is for gamers, because of the scaling difficulty and the possibility to farm for upgrades in the earlier difficulties.\n\nWhile the game has it's fair share of "Get lucky to finish certain missions" I found the game to be really enjoyable! The soundtracks are simply amazing, after playing for 2 hours I had at least 2 soundtracks stuck in my head. The graphics are ok low budget graphics, but again the game is only $4.99 USD.\n\nI've completed this game in around 5-6 hours with an additional 2 hours to complete the hardest achievements. As for the replay value, it's probably gonna be fun for an additional 5+ hours after you finish the game.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend to buy this game if you like tile-matching games!","September 24, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Then again, I have played quite a bit of Bejewelled Blitz so I was already fond of the control system - the hardest part was adapting to sliding rows/columns rather than swapping individual adjacent tiles.)\n\nIf you're looking for a casual game with an RPG feel, I certainly recommend '10,000,000'.","March 21, 2013","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a match 3 puzzle game (but instead of swapping two tiles, you move an entire row or column to match, so it'll take a bit to get used to), but instead of leaving it at that adds in some RPG and combat elements to keep things interesting. In short, you make runs to escape a dungeon (which happens at 10,000,000 points - spoilers!) by matching tiles; sword and staff tiles do damage to enemies you run into, key tiles open locked chests and doors, backpack tiles give items that aid you along the way, and wood/stone are resources you use to upgrade rooms in the initial area you start in. At the end of the day it's still a match 3 puzzle game, so if you're not into that this probably won't do anything to change your mind, but the system of progression it uses to keep things interesting is great. Relatively short, I guess, considering it has a definitive end, but you can keep playing after the end for more upgrades/higher scores. It kept me entertained long after completion on iOS and the PC version will likely do the same.","February 4, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's the gameplay beyond the tile-matching based upon what you need to get you through the obstacle you're currently encountering at the top of the screen whether it be a monster, chest, or door. I feel like too much is expected of this title for absolutely no reason. It's a game worth the about $0.99 you'll likely pay for it and can be a quick way to pass a bit of time while your buddy walks the dog and takes out the garbage before you get back to DotA 2, TF2, etc. It's got a somewhat satisfyingly simple play that, while sometimes awkward with the mouse, doesn't frustrate simply because you aren't playing because you're 'so into it,' you're playing because you need a time sink that you can put down and pick up.

The name you should never call your game because it makes it difficult to find in search engines.\n\nThe game combines classic match-3 gameplay with an RPG in a way that you wouldn't think would work well, but it does.  The game is quite simple: Venture into the dungeon and match the applicable tiles on the board to fight monsters, charge up your shield, collect resources, and unlock doors and chests.  The run ends when you run out of time (HP and time are the same) and you use the resources gained to upgrade your equipment and train new bonuses.  The ultimate goal is to make a dungeon run ending in a score of 10,000,000 points.\n\nThe gameplay is quite fast paced so you will need a quick eye and hand to succeed.  There is some strategy involved with your upgrade path as well as enemy damage resistance but also the inherent factor of luck in relying on a board of random tiles.  Sometimes you will fail because you just can't get the tiles you need.  Fortunately it doesn't really matter much in the long run because you still gain resources to use for upgrades to improve your next run.\n\nIt's a nice little game, give it a try!","May 29, 2013","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/227580/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","10,000,000 is a game that took me about five hours to beat.  I spent $1.25 on it a year ago and just finished it.\n\nI bought it expecting something akin to Puzzle Quest.  What I got was a bit different.  Sure, you have the same "match 3 tiles, get an effect" scheme, but the pace is quite frantic.  There's no story at all--you're some guy in a hat who wakes up in a run-down castle, you repair the rooms to the castle in order to power up your gear, and you run the dungeon hoping to get the required 10,000,000 points to win the game.  That's honestly it.\n\nGameplay's a little different from what you've come to expect from the tired-and-true match-3 formula.  Instead of swapping pieces around, you slide entire rows and columns to make your matches.  Pieces wrap around the other side of the field, and new pieces fall in when you make matches.  Attack monsters by matching swords and wands, give yourself a damage buffer by matching shields, match keys to open chests and locked doors, and match backpacks to give yourself a chance at getting an item to use.  Match wood and stone to give you resources to upgrade and repair the rooms in your home.  Get gold from objectives and chests to upgrade your gear, get EXP from monsters to spend on giving yourself permanent boosts.\n\nThe game is also timed, through keeping your little guy from reaching the left side of the screen either by damage taken or taking too long to clear the current obstacle.  Lose, and you're given a report on your run's score as well as the objectives you completed, if any.  The game tracks your progress through ranks and objectives for those ranks.  You have missions like "have an enemy die to poison damage" or "match five panels at once three times in a single run" among others.  Completing these missions gives you wood, stones, gold, and/or EXP, on top of unlocking new missions, of which you can only have three active at a time.  The final mission in each rank is to get a set score, and from there your rank (and difficulty) increase, but so do the score multiplier and the resource multiplier.\n\nIt's somewhat of a short game despite the high asking score to win.  I haven't 100%ed the game, but a couple more hours (or more if I do really badly) will see my get the rest of the achievements I missed, and there's not a lot of replay value since you only have one save file and the only thing that can go differently is how much money you put into upgrades.  Everything else is up to how merciful or cruel the game is regarding the board setup, but also how attentive you are with seeing potential matches and not panicking when you come across a boss creature during a particularly-good run.\n\nFor negatives, there's maybe a little bit of fake difficulty regarding how the game works with obstacles.  If you make a swords or wands match right before you stop to attack an enemy, the game won't register it.  Same with chests and keys.  You also can't make any matches while there's a chain going on, though that's never screwed me over.  There wasn't very much music, though that's up to the player if that's bad or not.  I didn't mind the pixel art, though I know it's dealbreaker for some people.  It's not terribly engaging, but this isn't a game that I'd sit and play for hours on end anyway.\n\nTL;DR:  I enjoyed 10,000,000.  It's short, it's cheap, and you can probably get a few of hours of enjoyment/frustration out of it.  It's not really easy or hard, but it does require a keen eye and some patience since you will fail repeatedly on your way to the top score.  It's fun enough and it feels good to do really well, just the same as it gets disheartening to keep doing badly.  It's less planning and more quick-thinking action, so if you liked the timed modes of other match-3 games, this might be of some value to you.","March 26, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just keep playing to get more gold to buy more upgrades to have a better chance at matching three to keep going deeper into the dungeons to get to the arbitrary goal of 10,000,000 points. I can see how a normal person playing this in short bursts of 5 minutes over the course of a month or more while on some public transit might think this is fine. On my personal computer that's not a thing. Maybe I'd be fine if this game was shorter and didn't feel like a slog, but it can take almost 10 hours to finish. That's pretty insane for a puzzle game that you see all of in the first 5 minutes you play. This game exists so you have something mindless to play while listening to podcasts.   Please, just go buy literally any other indie game that interests you. There's a good chance it's probably better than this.","April 15, 2014","false","8.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The touchscreen interface makes it significantly more responsive. I think Windows 8 with touchscreen would also be fine. It just plays smoother.\n\nThis game is basically Bejeweled with RPG elements. I love Bejeweled with over 60 hours clocked in on Bejeweled 3. If you're familiar with those types of block matching games, it's pretty easy to pick this up and play.\n\nThe game can be frustrating. You need to make appropriate matches to meet the needs of your character who is running a dungeon at the top of the screen. If there's a locked door or chest, you need to match keys. If it's a monster, you need to match swords or staves. When you're not doing that, you want to match wood and stone to upgrade various shops. Sometimes you just don't get the types of blocks you need and the game delivers a brutal beating if you stop to consider your options. You have to keep matching non-stop to advance. If you hesitate, it's over. Some of the dungeon objectives are survival-based like "stay alive for 90 seconds." It's not as easy as that sounds. As you upgrade your armor, weapons, and abilities, however, the game's difficulty decreases. One ability, for example, reduces the number of keys to open locks to just one key.\n\n10000000 is a fun game. It took me about 2.5 hours to level up all my items and rooms and beat the game. It's still fun to replay.","December 21, 2013","true","8.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If you're not a fan, I doubt this game will change your mind. Your success in this game often comes down to luck, but each run is quick enough that it can keep your attention and make you want to try again, especially if you've just unlocked something good. The pixel graphics are a bit annoying, but not enough to make you want to stop playing.

Each dive into the dungeon is a frenzy of matching three to buy you more time to match more three. Then at the end of the run you take the gold, exp, stone, and wood you get and make numbers go up so you can do more matching against enemies who themselves have slightly bigger numbers.\n\nIt's probably the emptiest gaming experience I've yet bought on Steam.","November 20, 2014","false","7.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Unfortunately, the control scheme on the Windows version ruins the game.  This is a game meant for quick swipes of the fingertip, which doesn't translate well when done via mouse.  Also, the game style is meant for quick 5 or 10 minute sessions, more likely when you are away from your gaming rig on a mobile device.  It's not worth the 5 dollar entry price, but worth a buck during a sale.  Still, if you buy this game, get it on Android.

They explain it once, but then give you little to no way to actually improve. You'll always fight monsters the same way with the same spells. And considering the barebones graphics, music, and the looming end, it adds virtually nothing to the gameplay other than an annoying distraction and an indicator of what you now need to match.\n\nSecondly, the autorunning nature feels more like an arbitrary way to make it difficult without ever having to change anything on the field or in the game. A vague "end" keeps chasing you. When it reaches you or passes you or some other vague idea of "you reach it" that seems to change from game to game, you lose. Except you can keep matching for a few seconds.\n\nAnd then there's the puzzle elements. They're, at best, clumsy. The game will not simply suggest a certain chain, it all but enforces it. See a skeleton? Get those staff and sword blocks. None of those? Fine, I GUESS get some resources. Oh there's a sword. Ignore that double/chained set, just get that sword or the looming end will get you! But that's not the worst of it. Oh no. The WORST of it, my friends, is that when you scroll it around the screen...it makes no difference if there are 3 blocks. They must be blocks that were initially placed in a way to complete a chain. If you scroll it around and there's 4 swords and you need four swords? Sorry, only the wood resource that had a 3 piece chain will count. Nothing else. This seems like a drastic oversight. Even the likes of Tetris Attack on the SNES would let you change blocks with no outcome, thus allowing a deeper gameplay. This offers no depth in that sense. It has to be already on screen, already apparent, and already set up.\n\nAll of this combines to create a tedious but inoffensive puzzle experience. But what makes it truly heinous is how many times you repeat a level to complete challenges to get resources to unlock do-Hold on, champ! You flawlessly performed all those tasks, but you need 500 wood and 500 stone for the next door! You only have 300 wood and 120 stones! Nope, get back to the time sink.\n\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend 10,000,000. It is a clunky, rushed, and overall ugly game that seems to hope to garner more love off the Atari-era graphics than any actual quality or effort.","February 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did enjoy the graphics. They are not super nice looking but they set the mode and are colorful. The sound is retro as well and is nice. The game is a little bit Bejewled and little like Puzzle quest with a super short timer. The gameplay is a match 3 type game so its easy to pick up and play.\n\nThats also probably its greatest failing is its got one trick and it plays it over and over again. Now like I said the gameplay is fun but thats all you do in this game is go the dungeon that generally lasts around 2 minutes or less and then once you have finished inside the dungeon then get better gear and head towards the dungeon. Thats it.\n\nI do have advice for what I love to see in a sequel if there is one. Skill levels for the clock as its super fast and games are super short. Make the dungeon a little bit more different the further down you go besides the different bad guys. Add torches or rocks or make it a different background color so you realize your in a different dungeon. I would like this expanded to include more unique gameplay other then going in and coming out. 7/10 for the price and the gameplay\n\nWhen the sale goes off I would rate it about a 6/10 this game is gonna drive some people nuts and some will love it.

I hesitate to call it a story, there is a intro bit that informs on the plot and that’s all you get. You have to level up your character and prison to get multipliers to even think you’ll get that score. There is lot of rpg elements like extra objectives, leveling characters, leveling weapons, and leveling up your prison. Also there is some action elements to go along with the match 3 game play.\nThe rpg aspects are very minimalist. You don’t level your character automatically as you play. You have to fix up the rooms with stone and wood you have accumulated through matching. Then buy your upgrade with the ingame gold or xp. There is extra objectives, such as ‘use an ax against a monster’ or ‘match 70 in one run’ which adds a bit of twist to the otherwise very grindy gameplay.\nIt could be considered an action side scroller. Your 2d pixel guy runs at the top of the screen, when you get up to something then you have to match three to get past that obstacle.  There is not anyway of saving up the match. If you get a run of drops it could be bad, first it slows you down as you can not match other stuf while it is falling, and it can clear the board of items you might need later. The match 3 is also a full slider style game play, instead of a single slide, flip, or twist style match 3. The control of the slide is iffy at times, forcing you to waste more time to get past the obstacle because you weren't right over the match.\n10,000,000 is a fast pace hectic match 3 with action-rpg elements. At $4.99 USD it's not a bad price if you like fast pace slide style match 3.  However if you're on the fence I would definitely wait and pick it up when its a buck or as part of a packaged deal. I would give 10,000,000 a 2 out of 5.\n\n* I’d have more time on the game but I personally dislike slide style match 3. However I am aware that others do.\n\nAlso be aware this game is apparently a port of the IOS version.\n\n\n\nneutral:\n\nextra objectives\n2d side scrolling aspect\nslider style match 3 game.\n\n\nPro:\nrpg elements to level up your character\n\nCon:\nno speed contral, it is a fast pace hectic game.\ncontrol is irritating (it's a port and it shows at times).\nthere is a lot of grinding\nmust level up to unlock the ability to buy the rooms.\nyou don’t know what the room is till after you unlock it.\n","July 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's one achievement, "The Jose", that's pure RNG and takes people many hours to complete; I still haven't gotten it, and quite frankly, I've given up. The only thing keeping me from changing this review to a thumbs down is the fact that the game in itself is enjoyable under its initial conditions, but this achievement in itself makes the game far outstay its welcome for completionists; at this point, it's down to more luck rather than skill in tandem with how much time you feel like wasting on something that's most likely not going to happen. I personally think luck-based achievements need to be in their own catagory that don't count towards achievement progress. Needless to say, I'm fed up with it and am putting this game down, accepting 99% completion because this game isn't fun for me anymore.\n\nThe actual review\nThis game is very simple, and it plays exactly how it appears; a fast-paced match-3 game. After each run that you don't score 10 million points, you're simply sent back to the main dungeon screen - the sanctuary, so to speak - to spend the resources you gained on your last attempt to upgrade your attack and defense, as well as various perks.\n\nAnd I can safely say that scoring 10,000,000 is not an easy task even if you've fully upgraded everything; I had a fully upgraded arsenal complete with all the potions, and scoring 10 million still took me several tries.\n\nAfter you beat the game, the game doesn't reset automatically; after the credits, you can continue playing to obtain a higher score (keeping your current stats/upgrades which you'll most likely have maxed out anyways), or you can delete your save data and start anew at any time.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of 3 songs - the "home" theme song, and 2 different dungeon themes - and I've found each of them to be fantastic; in all the time I've spent in-game, the songs never got old nor did they bore me. You can probably listen to the songs on youtube somewhere if you're curious.\n\nOriginally posted by Ness1228:It's like sex in Huniepop, but without the sex.","December 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

At first I was intrigued by it, and bought the game. After playing it for a while now I must say I should've heared on my instincts. A PUZZLEGAME, with PIXELGRAPHICS. Come on. The Game would even look better if it was made in Flash. The mechanic is interesting at first, but gets boring and repetetive just as fast.\n\nThe so called "retrolook" is in this game a very cheap excuse for pure lazyness.\n\nNormally I don't bash on games, I don't even care for the graphcs that much, in fact bad gameplay + gorgeous gameplay sucks considerably more than good gameplay and bad graphics. But this title is just bad and bad. It's like one of those puzzlegames on gameboy noone wanted to play because they sucked. So does this title. Don't buy for the Sake of the Game.\n\nTo Achievementhunters, especially the Achievementstats.com ones: The gameachievements don't score very high, if you can avoid the game, do so.

The plot is simple, you wake up in a dungeon cell and as the title of the game implies, you escape the dungeon for good when you score 10 million points in a single run. The game plays like bejeweled in that the player shuffles tiles on a grid by dragging a row or column in order to make 3 symbols match. Successful matches yields attacks, magic, keys, items, gold and materials that you can use to improve your cell, converting it into a base of operations which provides better gear, perks and special potions. The gameplay is easily accessable and there is a method to process of running dungeons that might feel hectic and challenging but never really feels frustrating. An average dungeon run takes only a few minutes but you can run the dungeon as many times as you like before returning to your base. The graphics are simple and have a Commodore 64 quality to them and the chiptune music is nicely composed.\n\n10,000,000 is simple, fun, and addictive. Easy to pick up and play, yet challenging when you want it to be. The price is very reasonable and the game is not graphically heavy so you can play it on an older machine.

Don't buy it if you don't already like match-3 puzzlers at least a little bit.\n\nYou will definitely be frustrated by bad luck when you just can't get enough swords, keys, or staves at the right moments, or realize you were desperately looking for a match when you could have just used the handy standby you had in your pocket and forgot about. However, if you're up for a little frustration in the search of fun and you like puzzles and old-fashioned Nethack-style dungeons, this is the game for you. I bought it at full price and had a lot of fun with it. It was a little like Super Hexagon in its ability to keep me playing for hours just trying to get that one run that does well enough.\n\nIf you're still not sure, go check out a YouTube video for some game footage. There's no plot to spoil, so you can still enjoy the game for yourself after watching someone else play it a bit, and that will probably tell you whether you want to try it or not.","May 22, 2014","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He attacks the monster! Staves? Magic attack! Wood? He...gets wood.\n\nYes, there are materials, and they're used as sort of...filler spots in the puzzle game, it feels. But, they're used to upgrade the hero, leveling up his sword, staff, armor, etc. The actual game is very frantic, as you're constantly under threat of being killed by...what can best be described as an invisible countdown. The screen keeps scrolling as you fight a monster, or try to open a door, and only by completing the challenge (match up keys to open the door, match up attacks to kill the monster, etc) can he dash forward, regaining some time. Eventually you fight the boss, and win, or die and start back at your cell.\n\nIt's a fun game, I feel. A little short, (you'll notice, I beat it handily in under 10 hours, the rest were getting trading cards) but good in bursts. Occasionally, you may have a little trouble with the mouse controls, and the monsters may feel OP (one is, in fact, designed that way. I love the little bits of interest on some trading cards!), but it's not the most challenging game of 2013.\n\nThe reason is the upgrades you build up over plays. It felt a little lax here; you don't -really- get new swords through loot drops or anything. You spend wood, gold and EXP to upgrade your original equipment. So, be prepped for gathering loads of those materials to get somewhat unsatisfying upgrades as you go. You don't find an awesome staff that kills things easier, you play until you you can level it up that way.\n\nRegardless, the core game is very enjoyable, and reminiscent of Puzzle Quest, if you were on a death-clock. It sounds bad, being rushed while trying to puzzle, but I think that's part of what lends charm and challenge to the game.\n\nIn short, I smell chicken cooking, and 10,000,000 is a really fun game.","December 24, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Meanwhile the other item types you can match give you resources to build up your base, or get bonus items.\n\nYou also have special subquests to do while running each dungeon, like getting a 5 match, or using only items to kill a monster, etc. It all adds up to give a bit of a strategic element to the basic match three gameplay, and a bit of a fun metagame building up your characters skills and equipments to get more powerful, fighting more dangerous monsters, and eventually achieve the titular 10,000,000 points to win your freedom.","October 30, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one, there is a story: You are trying to reach a score of 10,000,000 so you can get out of the dungeon/prison environment in which you are in. Simple enough, but this directly affects the gameplay, as at the top of the screen, your character goes through the hallways of the dungeon and has to fight or open doors/chests when you match these tiles. You also match wood and other materials to upgrade things after each quick play-through and armor to protect yourself against your foes.\n\nYou must complete achievements as well to get higher levels and more of special crystals, which also help you upgrade things (swords, armor, wands, ect.). It gives a very nice variety when you get bored of things like Candy Crush because of no in-app purchases, no limited number of plays, and an actual objective besides beating all the levels (even though there is no levels). The level itself is randomly generated, so you can play as many times as you want and it will almost always be different.\n\nIn all, it is a very unique puzzle game, and although it is suited best to only 1-3 play-throughs at a time, it is fun for the time you play it. If I had to give a rating, I'd say 8 or 8.5 out of 10.","August 27, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the main part of the screen you have are trying to match 3 or more of a symbol, getting cascades and so on for bonuses. The key twist is that your character needs specific types of matches at certain times - match keys to get through doors or open chests, match swords or staves when you are fighting a monster, and avoid spoiling/using such matches in between while the character is just running along. Meanwhile the other item types you can match give you resources to build up your base, or get bonus items.\n\nYou also have special subquests to do while running each dungeon, like getting a 5 match, or using only items to kill a monster, etc. It all adds up to give a bit of a strategic element to the basic match three gameplay, and a bit of a fun metagame building up your characters skills and equipments to get more powerful, fighting more dangerous monsters, and eventually achieve the titular 10,000,000 points to win your freedom.","October 30, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tiles you match on the board causes your character to perform an action - locked door in your way? Match key tiles to unlock it! Generic bad guy attacking you?

It's easy to pick up, and it's not TOO hard to put down. If you like slow-paced contemplative tile-matching that make take you an hour to complete a run, this is gonna be a little much for you.\n\nIt is expected that each run will only last a short time (a minute or two in the early stages), because you are working against the clock. Your hero runs through a long dungeon (displayed at the top of the screen) and meets various obstacles. The type of obstacle will determine what type of match will allow you to advance. The hero runs fast enough to regain time, but the screen keeps scrolling slowly while you are working on an obstacle.\n\nDoors and treasure chests require that you match Key tiles. Enemies can be attacked with Sword or Staff tiles. Most enemies will need to be attacked multiple times; they have health bars to let you know how you're doing. You must also endure enemies' attacks, which will reduce your timer (there is no HP, only the timer). Shield tiles can give you damage reduction, and Item tiles can generate useful consumable items for your inventory (one-use weapons and magic spells, keys, food to add time to the clock, etc).\n\nYou also match Wood and Stone tiles, which accumulate resources that are used back in your hub area in between dungeon runs. You build item shops which allow you to upgrade the effectiveness of each type of tile matches. You'll accumulate Gold and EXP with each dungeon run. Gold can be spent on your various tiered equpiment upgrades, and EXP can be spent on a variety of one-off permanent bonuses (like decreasing the cost of weapon upgrades, or granting bonus time for long combos).\n\nYou'll also be given up to three objectives to try to complete at the start of each run. These range from "match [X number] of Stone tiles over the course of your run" to "defeat an enemy by only using Items"\n\n"Beating" the game requires getting a cumulative 10,000,000 points across all your runs, though you can keep playing after that.\n\nI've played through the game before, and I'm on my second playthrough now that some new content has been added. It's a nice way to kill a few minutes before I go to work, or a few hours when I get home.","November 6, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This wasn't the first time, and each time seemed to be more infuriating than the last. This was after hours of trying, and with every upgrade and perk purchased. This was the final nail of the coffin, and if this doesn't convince you of why you should avoid this game, please, continue reading.\n\n****\n\nThe game does shine at first, promising variety and throwing you straight into the action, but the game quickly begins to demonstrate an abject amount of laziness. The graphical style is retro, to say the least, but the game is very modern, feeling like a frankenstein of other popular mobile games crushed into one jagged mess. 90% of the sceen is devoted to a very archaic match 3 game where you have to move entire rows instead of individual tiles,  and is where you will be putting your focus, but the top half is where the "action" occurs. Up top is an endless runner directly tied to what you do in the match three. Match up swords, you'll attack the monster. Match up keys, you unlock the chest. However, if you don't address the problem in front of you, you'll be slowly pushed off screen and your game will end. Good in concept, but here's my biggest issue: like every match 3, score is a large component, especially given how the game is literally named after the ideal score. However, to do this, you must compile the best combos and deal with the problem at hand, but you have to do it directly infront of the creature or object. If you matched the correct set a second before you stop in front, be it in anticipation or by accident, it doesn't stack and your move becomes invalid. This is particularly frustrating when you have to match certain sets to move on, only to watch your carefully calculated moves get screwed up by a chance mega combo. Too many runs have been ended that way, and to have treasure chests be a mandatory to unlock is absolute bull. There is absolutely no option to skip anything you encounter, which would've spared the game some frustration, but the game just doesn't care enough. Another mobile trope is the "meet one of the three objectives" thingy that also grinds my gears, as they don't enhance or challenge, but merely infuriate as their increasingly impossible demands completely based on luck (or in my case, rawheaded stubborness) to recieve, solely to unlock a harder difficulty with more objectives.\n\nNote how I said difficulty instead of level. This is because there is only one level in the game: A grey dungeon hallway. A hallway that never ends. Monsters, for the most part, are simply pallet swaps with other monsters, which is uncannily lazy for a game in which even the most complex characters are composed of 20 pixels and are the size of your thumb. The only thing you can change is difficulty, which ramps up quickly and is basically required of the player to grind for hours just to recieve some paltry bonuses to attack just to HAVE THE CHANCE to get by. Quickly you learn that some monsters can only be substantially hurt by magic and others by striking, but the problem, once again, is that you rarely have the right board to fight them. Even during your best games, your best is never good enough, for the board may just vomit out a variety of support tiles that do absolutely nothing to help your awful situation, and then your run ends. Outside of a couple items you might get by chance that are specifically one attack or the other (and even they don't always finish the job), the game never gives you the advantage for long, if ever at all.\n\nTl;dr: 10,000,000 demands concentration and strategy when it builds itself around luck and reflex. Conflicted even in design, the game never fails to give you the worst possible set up in front of the most dangerous to the most menial tasks, matching frantically until you either lose or move past the obstacle for another few seconds before you're forced to beg again for lady luck to bless you again. Like the trials of Sisyphus, your attempts to push forward will gain you ground, but will very quickly add momentum to your downfall. Unlike our unlucky boulder rolling friend, however, this game is not your punishment for defying the gods, and you can easily skirt this suffering by not buying this game. So don't. Please.\n","July 21, 2014","false","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes a game like Bejeweled, combines it with a Dungeon Crawler RPG to get 10,000,000. What I like most in this game is how easy it is to get into. When I first got this game, I was kind of worried that I wouldn't get it. But once I started, I literally couldn't stop playing because it was so fun. Along with it's great soundtrack, gameplay is fluent and keeps you wanting to upgrade your gear over and over again. I think this game could use a decrease in difficulty for people like me who are just now starting, but I guess that's the fun of the game right?

But at last, freedom!\n\nA blocking point for me was that it wasn't very obvious that rooms in addition of being unlocked could also be upgraded, so I got stuck at middle game wondering why I couldn't easily advance anymore as most monsters were kicking my back. Once I figured that out, completing the rest was rather easy. I guess that other people who complained the amount of grinding needed to win the game also incurred in the same problem.\n\nThis game isn't meant to be finished in a single sitting. It can get a bit repetitive after several tries, but if you limit it to a few ones a time, it will remain a fun game for quite a while.\n\nNote that I played it on my PC with a Wacom graphics pen tablet, I guess it isn't as fun and easy to play with a mouse. Actually I imagine it would be a bit frustrating, given the few painful quirks the tile control system has.

Don't buy it if you don't already like match-3 puzzlers at least a little bit.\n\nYou will definitely be frustrated by bad luck when you just can't get enough swords, keys, or staves at the right moments, or realize you were desperately looking for a match when you could have just used the handy standby you had in your pocket and forgot about. However, if you're up for a little frustration in the search of fun and you like puzzles and old-fashioned Nethack-style dungeons, this is the game for you. I bought it at full price and had a lot of fun with it. It was a little like Super Hexagon in its ability to keep me playing for hours just trying to get that one run that does well enough.\n\nIf you're still not sure, go check out a YouTube video for some game footage.

Your goal is to match tiles to hurt and kill the mobs and when done, the character runs forward again.  A great game for a way to kill a few hours if you are not looking for something too complicated.\n\nThe most complexity this game offers is from having the ability to "level up" your characters gear between runs.

This wasn't the first time, and each time seemed to be more infuriating than the last. This was after hours of trying, and with every upgrade and perk purchased. This was the final nail of the coffin, and if this doesn't convince you of why you should avoid this game, please, continue reading.\n\n****\n\nThe game does shine at first, promising variety and throwing you straight into the action, but the game quickly begins to demonstrate an abject amount of laziness. The graphical style is retro, to say the least, but the game is very modern, feeling like a frankenstein of other popular mobile games crushed into one jagged mess. 90% of the sceen is devoted to a very archaic match 3 game where you have to move entire rows instead of individual tiles,  and is where you will be putting your focus, but the top half is where the "action" occurs. Up top is an endless runner directly tied to what you do in the match three. Match up swords, you'll attack the monster. Match up keys, you unlock the chest. However, if you don't address the problem in front of you, you'll be slowly pushed off screen and your game will end. Good in concept, but here's my biggest issue: like every match 3, score is a large component, especially given how the game is literally named after the ideal score. However, to do this, you must compile the best combos and deal with the problem at hand, but you have to do it directly infront of the creature or object. If you matched the correct set a second before you stop in front, be it in anticipation or by accident, it doesn't stack and your move becomes invalid. This is particularly frustrating when you have to match certain sets to move on, only to watch your carefully calculated moves get screwed up by a chance mega combo. Too many runs have been ended that way, and to have treasure chests be a mandatory to unlock is absolute bull. There is absolutely no option to skip anything you encounter, which would've spared the game some frustration, but the game just doesn't care enough. Another mobile trope is the "meet one of the three objectives" thingy that also grinds my gears, as they don't enhance or challenge, but merely infuriate as their increasingly impossible demands completely based on luck (or in my case, rawheaded stubborness) to recieve, solely to unlock a harder difficulty with more objectives.\n\nNote how I said difficulty instead of level. This is because there is only one level in the game: A grey dungeon hallway. A hallway that never ends. Monsters, for the most part, are simply pallet swaps with other monsters, which is uncannily lazy for a game in which even the most complex characters are composed of 20 pixels and are the size of your thumb. The only thing you can change is difficulty, which ramps up quickly and is basically required of the player to grind for hours just to recieve some paltry bonuses to attack just to HAVE THE CHANCE to get by. Quickly you learn that some monsters can only be substantially hurt by magic and others by striking, but the problem, once again, is that you rarely have the right board to fight them. Even during your best games, your best is never good enough, for the board may just vomit out a variety of support tiles that do absolutely nothing to help your awful situation, and then your run ends. Outside of a couple items you might get by chance that are specifically one attack or the other (and even they don't always finish the job), the game never gives you the advantage for long, if ever at all.\n\nTl;dr: 10,000,000 demands concentration and strategy when it builds itself around luck and reflex. Conflicted even in design, the game never fails to give you the worst possible set up in front of the most dangerous to the most menial tasks, matching frantically until you either lose or move past the obstacle for another few seconds before you're forced to beg again for lady luck to bless you again. Like the trials of Sisyphus, your attempts to push forward will gain you ground, but will very quickly add momentum to your downfall. Unlike our unlucky boulder rolling friend, however, this game is not your punishment for defying the gods, and you can easily skirt this suffering by not buying this game. So don't. Please.\n","July 21, 2014","false","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along with it's great soundtrack, gameplay is fluent and keeps you wanting to upgrade your gear over and over again.

It's easy to pick up, and it's not TOO hard to put down. If you like slow-paced contemplative tile-matching that make take you an hour to complete a run, this is gonna be a little much for you.\n\nIt is expected that each run will only last a short time (a minute or two in the early stages), because you are working against the clock. Your hero runs through a long dungeon (displayed at the top of the screen) and meets various obstacles. The type of obstacle will determine what type of match will allow you to advance. The hero runs fast enough to regain time, but the screen keeps scrolling slowly while you are working on an obstacle.\n\nDoors and treasure chests require that you match Key tiles. Enemies can be attacked with Sword or Staff tiles. Most enemies will need to be attacked multiple times; they have health bars to let you know how you're doing. You must also endure enemies' attacks, which will reduce your timer (there is no HP, only the timer). Shield tiles can give you damage reduction, and Item tiles can generate useful consumable items for your inventory (one-use weapons and magic spells, keys, food to add time to the clock, etc).\n\nYou also match Wood and Stone tiles, which accumulate resources that are used back in your hub area in between dungeon runs. You build item shops which allow you to upgrade the effectiveness of each type of tile matches. You'll accumulate Gold and EXP with each dungeon run. Gold can be spent on your various tiered equpiment upgrades, and EXP can be spent on a variety of one-off permanent bonuses (like decreasing the cost of weapon upgrades, or granting bonus time for long combos).\n\nYou'll also be given up to three objectives to try to complete at the start of each run. These range from "match [X number] of Stone tiles over the course of your run" to "defeat an enemy by only using Items"\n\n"Beating" the game requires getting a cumulative 10,000,000 points across all your runs, though you can keep playing after that.\n\nI've played through the game before, and I'm on my second playthrough now that some new content has been added. It's a nice way to kill a few minutes before I go to work, or a few hours when I get home.","November 6, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I'd be more disappointed if I'd spent more than that. It's an ok way to kill time, but unless you're really into the core mechanic of matching tiles, it's really just matching lots of tiles while numbers get bigger. You can buy stuff along the way to make the numbers get bigger more quickly, and there are sub-goals and achievements for getting your numbers big enough along the way, but there's not much substance to it. It does do what it says it does for the most part though, so there's that, aside from the mouse occasionally hitching when sliding tiles around, which I've heard works better in the mobile version (which is easier as a result). I got tired of how repetitive/grindy/luck-based it gets toward the end, which is a poor combination with my life-long inability to read ahead beyond the current move in match-three games.","February 7, 2014","false","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was surprised that the RPG/Action portion of the game actually added to the experience and meshed pretty well with the match-3 style, since I normally find added components to be poorly done, distracting, and just there to try to get attention...

It's nearly impossible to beat, even with full upgrades. What's really annoying is the random nature of what tiles the game gives you makes it impossible to "get better" without the upgrades. There are a lot of points where the game simply decides to be unwinnable by refusing to give any useful tiles or drop items. If it were a bit shorter, or the upgrades did a bit more good, I might recommend it. In any case, it's a fun time-waster.

I'm slow since its a long time since I played a matching puzzle game, in fact I don't usually play these games.  But there is no learning curb within the game to "train" you.  With only a few "levels" supplied in the game it wasn't on sale at 80% I wouldn't have bought it since it rendered the game less then £1.\n\nAll in all, this it is, a game thats good for wasting a few hours, that you'd be mad to buy at full price.\n\nOverall its enjoyable, but to ranked up some of the conditions to move onot the next dungeon means you at points must ignore what you dungeoneer is doing to execute a 3 or 4 match combo.  This means your game is risked being cut short suddenly mid-combo.  So while your fumbling around to find a 3 match keys, the clock is ticking and you might have to throw a 3 part combo to clear enough to hope some keys pop up.\n\nOnt he other hand, I will note when the game DOEs through the right combos and pacing out for you, suddenly you breeeze through it without challenge... Rendering it the same as any match puzzle game.... Only 10x more fustrating. Top it off, things like XP are WORTHLESS, you train everything so quickly within half an hour you can have bought the entire lot.  I've got 4,000+ XP by the time I reached Dungeon Crawlere and theres no use for it?  Might as well not be there.\n\nIronically, the resource you need the most, money/gold/whatever is often harder to find. To the point finding it sometimes actually breaks the flow of the game.\n\nIf the issues were fixed, I'd buy a sequell, yes, but based on first impression of this game... It would take a steam sale before I'd buy that too.","February 6, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/priestbilly/recommended/227580/","priestbilly","Priestbilly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/priestbilly/","111 products in account","I got this game on a whim during it's 0.99 cent sale. At the time, I was suffering from a very painful toothache, which was almost dehibilitating. I wanted something I could do that didn't require focus, so I figured I'd try this game. Two things of note; one, my estimate for not requiring focus was completely off-base. Two, I played it from install to near completion in one 5 hour sitting. My toothache was an afterthought. I have no more praiseworthy sentence than that.\n\nThe concept is simple; it's a match-3 game. Even worse, it's my least favorite kind of match-3 game; a move has to end with 3 or more matching. Nothing akin to, say, Tetris Attack, where you could meticulously plot out an amazing chain, one block move at a time. So why would I recommend this game, even when the first two paragraphs of this review are faintly condemning it?\n\nBecause it's amazing, that's why. It takes cue from other match-3 games with the simple but addictive gameplay, and then adds it's own finess to the mix. You're exploring a dungeon, and your actions are based on matching tiles. Clear 3 Key tiles to open a lock on a treasure chest, match 3 Sword tiles to swing a sword at an enemy, you get the idea. Run the dungeon as long as you can, slaying enemies, collecting loot, and get as far as you can. Strive for that 10,000,000-point mark.\n\nWhat makes this work so well is it's so frantic. At any given time, you're matching in the grid, while watching your inventory of special, one-shot items, while at the same time plotting for the next encounter. Fighting a dragon? Forget those keys, those wood, you need lots and lots of attacks. At a chest? Those swords do you no good, you're waisting them as only keys will open the locks. The most stressful moments for me were the time between encounters; "I have a five-chain of attacks lined up, I hope it's not a chest or door next..."\n\nThe game rewards you for each attempt, too. Clearing wood tiles and stone tiles give you those in currency form, you collect gold and EXP from felled monsters and opened chests, and you can refurbish and upgrade your impromptu-home with facilities. Not got enough 'umph' behind your swings? Upgrade your sword at the smithy.\n\nIt's a repetitive cycle to be sure, but there's no greater joy than building up a horde of gold from your failed runs, pumping up your sword's destructive might, and then laying waste to enemy after enemy with your newfound strength. However, the cycle doesn't continue forever, and once you hit max, that's it. The game will get no easier from there, and all that's left is you and your 10m goal.\n\nIt's certainly not without it's own flaws though. Early on, the runs are frantic and short. Very, very short. Even in the tutorial run, you won't completely grasp what's going on or even how to plan things out because it's ALREADY OVER. It takes running after running to finally get a feel for the game, and then it goes out of it's way to make you attempt sometimes rediculous maneuvers to advance. These goals include simple things (get a certain score, get a certain amount of EXP), to difficult without planning things (defeat a ranged mob in less than 5 seconds) to downright infuriating (use a scroll to get a triple clear in one shot, seriously? No amount of planning will get you that). These shortcomings I don't nessicarily say are the game's fault, rather, the intencely random nature of this brand of match-3 makes them far harder than need be.\n\nWhen all is said and done, it's welcoming enough for beginners (given some time to adjust), and has enough depth and breadth for hardcore gamers to get a good kick out of it. At 0.99 cents, this was a steal of a game. The full-fledged pricetag of 4.99 is still low for the enjoyment you'll get out of this game. Expect to clock in at least 5 hours of good, solid gameplay before completing, and based on how much the random number god loves (or hates) you, another 3 hours until 100% completion. Even then, it's just fun to do a quick dungeon tromp to burn some time and some dragons.","February 6, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I'd be more disappointed if I'd spent more than that. It's an ok way to kill time, but unless you're really into the core mechanic of matching tiles, it's really just matching lots of tiles while numbers get bigger. You can buy stuff along the way to make the numbers get bigger more quickly, and there are sub-goals and achievements for getting your numbers big enough along the way, but there's not much substance to it. It does do what it says it does for the most part though, so there's that, aside from the mouse occasionally hitching when sliding tiles around, which I've heard works better in the mobile version (which is easier as a result).

Your character runs through a dungeon, and all of his actions are controlled by the blocks you match. Need to unlock a door or a chest? Match some keys. A monster blocking your path? Physical attacks are executed by matching swords while magical attacks fire off by matching staves. Standing still by not matching causes the timer to tick down, pushing your character to the left, and getting hit by monsters also pushes you to the left. The damage aspect can be mitigated by matching shields, which are absorbed instead of pushing your character. Fall off the side of the screen and it's game over.\n\nTo supplement these mechanics are a set of shockingly deep loot, item, upgrade, and experience systems. Monsters can drop loot, and you can also get loot by matching backpack tiles or unlocking chests. Loot can either be gold to buy upgrades or actual usable items. A few items you'll come across are a red orb that'll damage whatever monster is in front of you, a key to instantly unlock a chest or doorway blocking your path, scrolls to spawn more tiles of a certain type on the board, and much more.\n\nEvery time you start up your game and get ready to explore, your character lierally Jumps out of bed and is ready to rock, I first noticed the score and the goal, which reminded me of one of those Awful motivation posters that were en vogue in the 90's and acts like one too.\n\nYou really need to think about the games mechanics, because 10000000 doesn't tell you much beyond the qwerky loading hits, and leave you on your own to explore, I find that this works perfecly with short playt sessions, and adds a sense of discovery that I found fun.\n\nIf you have one of your 10,000,000 runs that lasts more than a minute or two you are doing considerably well, it gives you a chance to catch your breath and break down what you learned during your last attempt to reach your goal of 10,000,000.\n\nThis is a game with a protestant work, and you have to Aceept failure as part of the Journey, and try your best to do a little better every time.\n\nI have really enjoyed my time so far playing 10,000,000 and I hope everyone else can have some fun with it too.\n\nI would rate 10,000,000 a:\n4 out of 5\nAs it does what its intended too exactly as it should.","February 6, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterseed87/recommended/227580/","winterseed87","Buckets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterseed87/","69 products in account","This game is just sliding tiles. It tries to seem like more with the RPG elements but that is little more than a skin. The game rewards you for making as many matches as possible, as fast as possible, regardless of what is happening in the top section. Sure, you have to match the right tiles to proceed past each obstacle, but that happens naturally through frantic matching. If you try to play the board strategically you'll find things simply don't happen fast enough and you'll fail the level because time is always ticking down and you HP usually is too. The whole experience feels like it was designed by a gambling cartel trying to get me addicted to slots.\n\nThe upgrade system was compelling at first but quite quickly became a chore and no longer enhances the experience after a few hours. There is a little strategic freedom in how you spend your resources on upgrades and perks but it really doesn't affect gameplay, it just shifts difficulty from one element to another. There is also an arbitrary wait while upgrades are occurring in which you can't do anything but watch the progress bar. This wait increases with each upgrade for no reason. It isn't long but it is completely unnecessary. The investment type perks are pointless because they effectively just adjust how much grinding is necessary and players won't know how much grinding they want to do until they've missed the opportunity for the investment to be economically viable. I honestly think they game would be better served by automating or removing the entire upgrade system and just implementing a few sliders so players can adjust how good they have to be at tile matching to not lose.\n\nThe only thing which is still interesting after a few hours is the challenges. There are at most 3 challenges active at any time and new challenges aren't made available until space is made for them by completing an existing challenge. They are things like 'Kill an armored monster with only staves' and 'Open a chest within 5 seconds'. Challenges provide a reason to adjust strategy which helps stop the game becoming stale, however I'm fairly frequently stuck on (a) challenge(s) and the game stops being fun at all. Completing an overly difficult challenge is a relief, not a reward, because a combination of grinding and luck is what gets me there. An option to skip challenges would fix this but might reduce the worth of the challenge system.\n\nTo put it simply, if you're expecting anything more from the game than a pretty good tile matching time-waster you might be disappointed. I think there is potential in the format but a lot more weight needs to be given to the RPG elements for me to enjoy this as a hybrid puzzle RPG and not just a puzzle game with a guy running at the top of the screen.","February 6, 2014","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What makes it unique, though, is that as you match things you build up resources for use in between rounds. The progression system is fun, and the goal is to become stronger with better weapons and armor until you are finally powerful enough to score 10,000,000 points in one session. The game is not especially deep, but that makes it very easy to pick up and play. You will grind the same dungeon multiple times until you have the resources to make yourself stronger, sometimes, but it never stops being fun.\n\nThis game is available on Android (and maybe iOS?) as well, which is where I typically play it. That is why my play time is very low here on Steam!","December 24, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the cover it looks like just another match three game, but once you actually get into action you'll notice it's just so hectic that it's super fun and addictive. And then you notice that  you can actually upgrade your character. To do this you must combine some specific blocks like wood. The upgrades generally provide you more time. So in the beginning a round might take just 15 seconds, but once you're upgraded to the max you'll be in the dungeons for minutes.\n\nThere's actuallyl not that much grinding if you know what you're doing. Just use the right potions and you'll get an extra amount of wood and stone. Complete the required objectives and you get more skill points. The game never gets frustratingly hard, nor is it too easy. It's just more down to luck of which blocks the game gives you. But once you learn to manage the field properly, even that shouldn't be a big problem.\n\nBut in the end, the game is just a match 3 game, so if you don't like them, this might not be for you. Although I'm one of those people who doesn't like them, and this was just a blast from the beginning to the end.","April 3, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/discrider/recommended/227580/","discrider","The Best Class in TF2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/discrider/","405 products in account","This is a puzzle game at heart. If you line up 3 or more coloured tiles they disappear from the grid, they disappear. In much the same fashion as Bejeweled, new tiles then fall down from the top of the grid to fill in the now empty space. The only way this differs from Bejeweled is that instead of swapping two tiles, you instead can drag any row left or right, or any column up or down in its entirety to make a match.\n\nHowever, this is only half of the game, and is frankly the boring bit. Each set of tiles you clear does something different, with the aim of keeping your man running through the dungeon above the board as long as possible. So sword and staff attack monsters, shield defends you, keys open locks, backpack provides items, and wood and stone help you upgrade your base. So this balance of keeping the right tiles on the screen, especially when different monsters are weaker to different attacks, is what keeps this game enthralling.\n\nThat said, it does have some problems with artificial difficulty. Your health/stamina is represented by how far along the top of the screen your man is. Once this runs out, you have to restart the level for another try at the high score. However, as your man runs through the dungeon, the time it takes to slide backwards along the track  gets shorter and shorter, decreasing your max health no matter how well you are playing. As a result, you often need to start at a later checkpoint to have any chance of progressing to a higher score. I'd have much preferred just a straight run through increasing power/health monsters than a backwards slide down my character's own abilities.\n\nSo overall:\nNegatives:\nThe match game is Bejeweled and requires little strategy.\nDecreasing power through out a run gets on my nerves.\nPositives:\nThe dungeon combat system is inspired and brings the strategy that Bejeweled lacks.\nThe power increase due to upgrades between runs is well thought through and well paced.\n\nIf this game had an endless mode, that is a mode where monster health/attack power went up constantly until you die, I'd recommend this in an instant.\nBut without this it lacks replay value as you feel like you're hitting a hard-coded wall instead of the limits of your own ability.\n\nSo a reasonable game for 3$, is enjoyable, just don't expect too much playtime from it.  7/10","March 23, 2013","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The added twist of needing to match specific blocks to pass obstacles in engaging and implements well.  As was mentioned in another review, you will occasionally have several of the same obstacles in a row, which will see you run out of the blocks you need.  This doesn't seem incredibly common, and may just be a fluke of the radomness of the obstacle generation.\n\nIt will take a lot of runs to get the resources you need to escape.  This isn't much of a problem, as it's incredibly nice to have an actual objective in a game like this.\n\nOne  gripe with the game is that it seems to be perfectly geared for playing on tablets or other touch screens, and that using a mouse handicaps you.  It's a minor problem, and one that might just be because I'm terrible at games.\n\nThere are currently some bugs with achievement completion, but that only matters if you care very much about achievements.\n\nIn all, it's a charming little puzzle that is definitely worth the price.","December 13, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrocop/recommended/227580/","gyrocop","Gyrocop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrocop/","870 products in account","Let me just say that I only BARELY recommend this game, and that you would really do yourself a service getting this game while it's on sale or something.\n\nMain premise:\nThe point of this game is to reach a score of 10,000,000. This is done by playing a Chuzzle-esque tile match game wherein the tiles you match has an outcome on a dungeon battle. If you by example matches 3 tiles of a sword the guy attacks, 3 keys and you can open chests and doors, 3 wood or stone and you get resources to upgrade later in the game. The game include upgrades, shops, potions, bosses, and a suprisingly big number of valuables (experience, wood, stone, points, and money).\n\nGraphics/Sound:\nThe game originated on phones and tablets and you can definitely tell that by a lot of factors. First of all the graphics are in a very heavy and sometimes grating 8-bit style and the sounds and music are entirely in chiptunes. The chiptunes are not bad by any means, but they're put on a short loop and they can get rather repetitive and annoying. It's not a game that needs to be great looking or sound amazing. It does its job, with average success.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is a grinding puzzle game. The main point is to get as far as possible and then retry again and again, until you can buy more upgrades and get a little further into the game until you reach the target score. This is a slow moving process. There really isn't much progress in terms of mechanics. All mechanics of the game is presented in the first 30-45 minutes and then the question is if you actually want to continue doing the same thing for a few hours.\n\nThe main problem here, is that the game does a very poor job at spacing apart and adding game mechanics as you go along so everything feels fresh. This makes the game stagnate pretty quickly, and you get bored by it easily. You can only play this game in short bursts.\n\nThis game has two parts to it; the action-puzzle part, and the management/upgrade/RPG-ish part. The first part, is mostly pretty well executed. The tiles do what they do, and you can most of the time tell that a bad run was mostly because that you didn't do well. The game can be a bit unfair in the distribution of different tiles, giving you 3 key tiles in total, when you really need it, but other than that, the nature of the game makes it difficult enough to be challenging, but forgiving enough to not be frustrated.\n\nThe problems with the game originates from the second part, which is poorly executed. It has the growing of character RPG elements. You know, you start out as a weakling, but then you become stronger and stronger the more you play. Except that this game makes you not feel like progressing at all. It's hard to describe, but I got the same feeling out of playing Defiance. Despite constantly leveling up and progressing to the next level, and fighting tougher enemies and buying more upgrades and improving your various weaponry, it doesn't really feel like you're making a difference. Well, maybe a little, but 2 hours in the game, you don't feel that your character has gotten that much stronger since last. I speculate, that this is because that the core game (the tile game) does not become easier or harder, only the outcome becomes greater.\n\nThis, together with repetitious gameplay, makes the game stale after longer amounts of play.\n\nStory:\nThis game does not really have a story, and for a game like this, it's fine without.\n\nReplayability/Concept:\nI really like the concept, and I feel that with a bit more tweaking and tuning this game could have been a lot more fun and a lot more addictive, which it isn't now, because of the repetitive nature of the game. There is also a bit of originality by this concept, mixing two genres together only really done well in PuzzleQuest.\nOther than achievements, there is no real reason to start over and try again.\n\nLength and fun factor:\nTo be honest, I haven't beaten it yet, but judging by where I am at right now, I estimate a total play time of 3-6 hours.\nI find the core game (the tile puzzle game) to be very entertaining. It's hectic and it's stimulating, however it's hard finding joy in having to do this, let's be honest here, primitive game over and over again just to feel a bit of evolution and progress.\n\nFinal Thoughts and judgement:\nIf you are a big puzzle fan, especially of things like Chuzzle, PuzzleQuest, Bejeweled or even Candy Crush, and looking for a simple tile game with even simpler RPG elements over it, then this is recommendable. The puzzle aspect is fun, and if you're into that, the RPG part will not totally ruin it for you. For anyone else this is hard to recommend. For what it's worth I have found entertainment in this game, but some of the core aspects are flawed.\n\nIf you like puzzle games and you see this on a sale it couldn't hurt to get this (and therefore earning my thumbs up). There are just much better alternatives.","February 17, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's easy to pick up, and it's not TOO hard to put down. If you like slow-paced contemplative tile-matching that make take you an hour to complete a run, this is gonna be a little much for you.\n\nIt is expected that each run will only last a short time (a minute or two in the early stages), because you are working against the clock. Your hero runs through a long dungeon (displayed at the top of the screen) and meets various obstacles. The type of obstacle will determine what type of match will allow you to advance. The hero runs fast enough to regain time, but the screen keeps scrolling slowly while you are working on an obstacle.\n\nDoors and treasure chests require that you match Key tiles. Enemies can be attacked with Sword or Staff tiles. Most enemies will need to be attacked multiple times; they have health bars to let you know how you're doing. You must also endure enemies' attacks, which will reduce your timer (there is no HP, only the timer). Shield tiles can give you damage reduction, and Item tiles can generate useful consumable items for your inventory (one-use weapons and magic spells, keys, food to add time to the clock, etc).\n\nYou also match Wood and Stone tiles, which accumulate resources that are used back in your hub area in between dungeon runs. You build item shops which allow you to upgrade the effectiveness of each type of tile matches. You'll accumulate Gold and EXP with each dungeon run. Gold can be spent on your various tiered equpiment upgrades, and EXP can be spent on a variety of one-off permanent bonuses (like decreasing the cost of weapon upgrades, or granting bonus time for long combos).\n\nYou'll also be given up to three objectives to try to complete at the start of each run. These range from "match [X number] of Stone tiles over the course of your run" to "defeat an enemy by only using Items"\n\n"Beating" the game requires getting a cumulative 10,000,000 points across all your runs, though you can keep playing after that.\n\nI've played through the game before, and I'm on my second playthrough now that some new content has been added.

An odd name for a game, yes. But it is also the purpose of the game. To reach 10,000,000 points and escape the dungeon is your ultimate goal. So is the run worth it, or should you just pass this one up and find a new number to satisfy you? Let’s find out.\n\nThis one will be short and sweet, like the game itself turns out to be. Well, maybe not so sweet as it does tend to end with you dying. Quite a lot in fact. The gameplay is the tried and true match-3 formula we all know and love. With some minor combat elements tossed in, of course. Match three or more swords or staves and you will do damage to your enemies. Beat them and you continue along your merry way and earn more points. Along the way, you will collect gold and various resources, which can be used to upgrade your weapons, magic, and armor. Upgrading these will in turn allow you to get further in your run, collect more gold, upgrade more, and so on. The end goal is to reach 10,000,000 points and earn your freedom.\n\nIf you’re a fan of addictive match-3 games and enjoy some RPG-lite gameplay, you won’t go wrong with this one. The game clocks in at around 5-10 hours, and is well worth the small price tag.\n","February 11, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those simple games that gradually gets harder as your progress through the dungeons, and the game is set in a way where you "bejeweled" your actions. There are many different actions and completeing a dungeon is just carry out 3 challenges in one run. You are able to upgrade your tiles, by that I'm refering to your weaponry, magic, and armor and other perks that you can unlock with the experience you build, and use them to your advantages. Completeing a full dungeon, even after you clear later dungeons, is rather difficult, especially when the boss tends to be a dragon.

This wasn't the first time, and each time seemed to be more infuriating than the last. This was after hours of trying, and with every upgrade and perk purchased. This was the final nail of the coffin, and if this doesn't convince you of why you should avoid this game, please, continue reading.\n\n****\n\nThe game does shine at first, promising variety and throwing you straight into the action, but the game quickly begins to demonstrate an abject amount of laziness. The graphical style is retro, to say the least, but the game is very modern, feeling like a frankenstein of other popular mobile games crushed into one jagged mess. 90% of the sceen is devoted to a very archaic match 3 game where you have to move entire rows instead of individual tiles,  and is where you will be putting your focus, but the top half is where the "action" occurs. Up top is an endless runner directly tied to what you do in the match three. Match up swords, you'll attack the monster. Match up keys, you unlock the chest. However, if you don't address the problem in front of you, you'll be slowly pushed off screen and your game will end. Good in concept, but here's my biggest issue: like every match 3, score is a large component, especially given how the game is literally named after the ideal score. However, to do this, you must compile the best combos and deal with the problem at hand, but you have to do it directly infront of the creature or object. If you matched the correct set a second before you stop in front, be it in anticipation or by accident, it doesn't stack and your move becomes invalid. This is particularly frustrating when you have to match certain sets to move on, only to watch your carefully calculated moves get screwed up by a chance mega combo. Too many runs have been ended that way, and to have treasure chests be a mandatory to unlock is absolute bull. There is absolutely no option to skip anything you encounter, which would've spared the game some frustration, but the game just doesn't care enough. Another mobile trope is the "meet one of the three objectives" thingy that also grinds my gears, as they don't enhance or challenge, but merely infuriate as their increasingly impossible demands completely based on luck (or in my case, rawheaded stubborness) to recieve, solely to unlock a harder difficulty with more objectives.\n\nNote how I said difficulty instead of level. This is because there is only one level in the game: A grey dungeon hallway. A hallway that never ends. Monsters, for the most part, are simply pallet swaps with other monsters, which is uncannily lazy for a game in which even the most complex characters are composed of 20 pixels and are the size of your thumb. The only thing you can change is difficulty, which ramps up quickly and is basically required of the player to grind for hours just to recieve some paltry bonuses to attack just to HAVE THE CHANCE to get by. Quickly you learn that some monsters can only be substantially hurt by magic and others by striking, but the problem, once again, is that you rarely have the right board to fight them. Even during your best games, your best is never good enough, for the board may just vomit out a variety of support tiles that do absolutely nothing to help your awful situation, and then your run ends. Outside of a couple items you might get by chance that are specifically one attack or the other (and even they don't always finish the job), the game never gives you the advantage for long, if ever at all.\n\nTl;dr: 10,000,000 demands concentration and strategy when it builds itself around luck and reflex. Conflicted even in design, the game never fails to give you the worst possible set up in front of the most dangerous to the most menial tasks, matching frantically until you either lose or move past the obstacle for another few seconds before you're forced to beg again for lady luck to bless you again. Like the trials of Sisyphus, your attempts to push forward will gain you ground, but will very quickly add momentum to your downfall. Unlike our unlucky boulder rolling friend, however, this game is not your punishment for defying the gods, and you can easily skirt this suffering by not buying this game. So don't. Please.\n","July 21, 2014","false","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to match tiles to hurt and kill the mobs and when done, the character runs forward again.

Your goal is to match tiles to hurt and kill the mobs and when done, the character runs forward again.  A great game for a way to kill a few hours if you are not looking for something too complicated.\n\nThe most complexity this game offers is from having the ability to "level up" your characters gear between runs.

On the cover it looks like just another match three game, but once you actually get into action you'll notice it's just so hectic that it's super fun and addictive. And then you notice that  you can actually upgrade your character. To do this you must combine some specific blocks like wood. The upgrades generally provide you more time. So in the beginning a round might take just 15 seconds, but once you're upgraded to the max you'll be in the dungeons for minutes.\n\nThere's actuallyl not that much grinding if you know what you're doing. Just use the right potions and you'll get an extra amount of wood and stone. Complete the required objectives and you get more skill points. The game never gets frustratingly hard, nor is it too easy. It's just more down to luck of which blocks the game gives you. But once you learn to manage the field properly, even that shouldn't be a big problem.\n\nBut in the end, the game is just a match 3 game, so if you don't like them, this might not be for you.

However you can't just simply add on the points you have to constantly beat your score to win by not letting the left side of the wall catch up to you. There are also challenges to help you as well but completing them can be awfully obnoxious.\n\nSo the gameplay itself is a puzzle/RPG, you have to match tiles to either get resources for building new structres, attack enemies, use magic, get keys to unlock chests and doors and complete challenges to either earn more points or gain gold to make stronger items or train to gain new abilities.\n\nI haven't completed the game myself because to be honest tile games don't interest me very much. This one though I have made an acception of playing either when I am waiting for something to download or just when I am in the mood for matching tiles. It is also something even your family could probably play and have interest in, but the only way that would happen is if we destroyed Facebook and all the other freegames on it!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo anyone who has read this please excuse any mistakes that you see in this post.

The tiles you match correspond to your characters actions as he travels the games "dungeon", i.e. match keys to unlock doors. There are also stone and wood tiles which allow you to upgrade your home base, which allows you to upgrade your character between runs; and a couple of different attacks to help with monsters. It's very subject to the whims of the RNG so some runs can end very quickly whilst others will have everything fall into place with little effort. Pun not intended. The graphics are a little rough around the edges but do their job and the same could be said of the audio, all in all this is a cheap time waster that is sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating. I give it 4/10 and wouldn’t want to pay more than $2 for it but it has its charm and a nice RPG gimmick to separate it from other match 3's.\n\nGood\n- Lots of gameplay\n- Fun, when you get on a good run\nBad\n- Graphics are simple and unpolished.

If you're a fan of grinding, this game has unlocks for days. How fast you progress depends mostly on how quick your mind is but wise use of potions and resources are also factors.\n\nPros:\n-One more run for that new sword\n\nCons:\n-You WILL be doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nIf you understand what you're getting into, definitely grab this game up.","February 20","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's deceptively simple in its artstyle, UI and objectives but it has a 'Just 1 more go' feedback loop that makes it maddeningly addictive. Match swords for physical attacks, Wands for Magical attacks, Shields for defence and resources to build your home base which unlocks upgrades.\n\nEach run only lasts a matter of minutes but with every failure you earn a little more to upgrade your character and eventually hit the magical 10,000,000 which wins the game.\n\nIt's a perfect budget game. Easy to grasp premise and concept, mechanically excellent and a fun little diversion.\n\n82/100","May 18","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll pass the time, though if any of that sounds like something you wouldn't like, probably give it a miss.\n\nOtherwise have at it, and good luck with trying to complete the goal on explorer difficulty (seriously, that achievement is really hard).","May 18","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
