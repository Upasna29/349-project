You can see your opponents piece placement, but not what those pieces actually are.\n\nBattles play out on a diamond shaped board with sixteen territories, your pieces can only move forward with some pieces and board spaces having powers that can allow exceptions to this. When you move into a territory with an opponent present, your opponents piece is revealed and a battle begins. Your strength and your opponents strength and power are revealed. You then play an additional card from your hand prior to the battle and then you and your opponent reveal cards simultaneously. Cards can generally only be used once and are not replenished until they have all been used. Your piece strength, special powers and the card you played determine the outcome. Get your Prince to the home territory of the shadow forces to win, or if your'e playing shadow forces, get three of your pieces to the light side home or kill the prince for the win.\n\nGreat game. Well implemented. I love seeing these great board games making their way to steam.\n\nMulitplayer games play out in real time (no async) and the game does have an integrated chat box.","September 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

I supported it on Kickstarter and I'm happy with the final product. Mac version seems solid and the introductory tutorial is well done (usually tutorials suck on most board game conversions). Animations and game mechanics all feel very well polished. Kind of wish the game had a campaign mode with a story, but fighting the AI in solo mode works too I guess. Could also use a bit more settings to adjust the resolution and windowed in-game, but can also hope those come in a later patch.","September 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

There is a bit of a learning curve if you haven't played the board game before, but the tutorial takes you through the basics.  The rest you'll learn pretty quickly in a few matches against the AI.\n\nThe choice of playing as either Light or Shadow gives the game a good variety of play, as each side has some very unique and interesting characters, character abilities, and special cards.   So far I've played against both the AI and real opponents, and both game modes are fun.\n\nHighly recommend this game for anyone who loves board games or turn-based strategy games!","September 30, 2015","true","17.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
