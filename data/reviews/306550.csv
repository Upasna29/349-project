Runers ditches the sugar-coating and fluff in favor of pure action and customization to help craft an experience that revolves around how you want to play.\n\nBanished to the confines of a dark and dank dungeon with nothing but your arcane knowledge and the magical power of the Runes found within. The moody melodies and grim dim-lit rooms beckon you deeper in to the randomly generated chambers of ongoing dungeon floors which each act as an arena, staging chaotic top-down battles and sometimes throwing objective based events at you for a chance at an additional skill to level up and increase your survivability in these diabolical crypts.\n\nOn the surface Runers may seem slightly rough around the edges in terms of aesthetics with its art and sound effects having a very hand-made and appropriately gritty quality to them. This is however not at all a bad thing and will actually be a welcome feeling among old-schoolers who remember the early days of PC gaming, as this has a very similar feel visually to the obscure dungeon delving titles of the early 90s many are fond of.\n\nRuners features the grid-like map progression and dungeon exploration of a classic Zelda game with the fast-paced horde slaying arcade-action of a Gauntlet title. There's no drawn out plot or complicated goals present here, instead Runers takes a more score-attack oriented approach testing the players ability to survive and make the best usage of their findings. Most of your early runs will end swiftly in humiliating defeat, but the more adept of players will experiment and explore the hundreds of possibilities made available through Rune crafting.\n\nRunes come in the form of different varying elements, from burning Fire spells to Air spells with the ability to knockback. Combining the different spells can be done in pairs of two or three depending on the amount of combiners you have. Combining two spells is as simple as using a Rune Combiner which are generally dropped off of the tougher Champion type enemies as well as mid-bosses. In order to obtain the more useful and generally passive or evasive three-spell combinations you must accumulate 4 regular Combiners. This provides an even deeper level of decision making forcing you to choose between going with the instant gratification of a slightly stronger 2nd level combo or saving your Combiners up for the often life saving 3rd level spells.\n\nThe easiest way to meet your maker is to become surrounded. The game features Diablo levels of swarming from your adversaries and the worst thing to do is get trapped in a corner or against a wall as you'll quickly be blocked in by swathes of dangerous creatures with no escape other than the sweet solace of your own magic-blasting runes making way. Although you'll be overwhelmed early on much of the time consecutive runs will last longer as you learn the necessities of preparation, especially prior to facing the hectic boss battles and their bullet-hell styled patterns.\n\nThe rune system is the bread and butter of the game, providing hundreds of unique and effective combinations of magical runes all with different attacks and properties. Throughout the levels you'll find differently sized rune combiners which will allow you to combine different runes into bigger, better attacks to use on your ability bar. The abilities are unknown at first and to unlock the hundreds of useful attacks you'll have to experiment with the different complex combinations. Runes can also be stacked onto powers in the ability bar that use similar elements, strengthening a particular attribute tied to it. In the end what you have is a very free-form combat system with an extremely high skill ceiling, the limits being that of your own discovery and persistence.\n\nRuners is the most customizable encounter I've had in the roguelite genre, complimenting the play style of every attribute be it speed, power, or wit. It offers a level of creativity and choice in how you approach battles that is unseen for dungeon crawlers, and offers enough variation to always keep you coming back. For the modest asking price, Runers is an engrossing experience with an amount of content and combat options that surpasses anything like it.","September 4, 2014","true","44.5"," 81 of 95 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","81","95","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/306550/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Runers is a top-down, may-as-well-be-twin-stick shooter with roguelike qualities, including permadeath. Contrary to what you might have expected after glancing at the screenshots, the game does not feature traditional loot, consumables, equipment or an inventory system, other than what’s required to craft spells. With this in mind, I didn’t expect it to have much depth but was pleasantly surprised to be proven at least partly wrong.\n\nThe main attraction here is the magic system that lets you combine a catalyst with one to three runes from eight elements to create 285 different spells. Most results are unique in both animation and effect and generally fall under buff, debuff, direct single-target damage, area of effect, or some combination thereof. Spells can be further upgraded in power by dragging duplicate runes of the same element onto them, which augments their damage, knockback, cooldown, bullet size and speed. Runes, and the catalysts needed to combine them, drop from enemies and destructibles and are presented as a reward option when descending floors.\n\nSpell quick slots are limited, maxing out at six after you’ve beaten a few minibosses, and excess spells must be in one of two storage slots or discarded. Two primary spells can be set to autofire so that they blast toward your cursor each time the cooldowns are up, which really makes casting feel like a twin-stick shooter without actual twin-stick support. Spell quality varies wildly with a few feeling overpowered, many feeling useless, and most falling somewhere in between. Casting does not consume resources and is only limited by cooldowns, so it’s fun to experiment with different builds.\n\nAdventuring begins with choosing a difficulty, a racial passive ability, a class that determines your activatable special ability, and a starter spell (or, in roguelike fashion, just hit “random” and let the game decide these things for you). After this, you’ll be placed in a ten-floor dungeon with a toggleable map overlay that shows which rooms you’ve visited and any items you’ve left behind.\n\nEnemies often feel just as, if not more, powerful than you because they cast the same spells available to you and can quickly fill your debuff bar. Combat involves a lot of running in circles as a result, dodging projectiles like you’re in bullet hell while slinging your own spells toward the pack of enemies that’s chasing you. Emerging as the victor will unlock the exits in that room and let you progress to the next. Rinse and repeat. The bulk of Runers’ depth and imagination went into its magic system and there isn’t much in the way of surprises outside of that. There are really only three room variants in the game: rooms containing a throng of enemies, a boss or miniboss, or a challenge (which is often just another throng of enemies whose conditional defeat rewards you with a perk).\n\nUpon leveling up or completing a challenge room, you get to choose between four perks that are drawn randomly from a huge pool. With a few exceptions, these bonuses are more about augmenting your spells to be as deadly as possible and less about traditional character stat building. Even though death is permanent, a runedex keeps track of all the spell combinations you’ve unlocked thus far and a bestiary does the same for all the enemies you’ve encountered. There are also leaderboards for each difficulty and 30 optional, standalone challenges.\n\nAs long as you delve into Runers with an open mind and no expectations of it cleanly fitting into a particular genre—and you’re prepared to deal with the difficulty of projectile hell—you should enjoy the ride.","October 21, 2014","true","9.1"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","49","51","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994641567/recommended/306550/","76561197994641567","Zen Tractor","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994641567/","358 products in account","Runers has high hopes, and a fantastic spell crafting system, but is held back in just a few too many ways.\n\n\nThe game is full of strange design decisions.  For example rune combiners are needed only for new spells.  This means that early on in your play of Runers you will find yourself unable to create many complex spells, and once you have died a few times and unlocked a lot of spells, you find yourself with combiners falling out of your pockets.  My question is why?  Surely the game would play better if combiners were always required but were more common?  Then you'd have to be careful about which complex spells you created, and would make each run more varied.\n\nThen there's the fact that drops are completely random.  I can kill an air mage and get an earth rune!  There's no rhyme nor reason for anything, and as such each run tends to blur together.\n\nSound levels are also just strange.  Some enemies are much much louder than others.  Some barely audible, others annoyingly loud.  And this happens on every single 'I got hit', not just for special attacks or anything.  Oh, also, your character doesn't have a 'I got hit' noise.  That's rather important, and yet entirely missing.  The music is really quiet.  Again, this is odd because they sell a soundtrack edition, so clearly they're proud of it.\n\nYou can rebind keys*.  You will want to do this, since hitting 1-4 while using wsad to move is rather lethal.  *Caveat: However, you can't rebind the left and right click spells.  Which is odd, because they end up being the spells you click the least often, since they have an autofire option.\n\nThe whole pace of the game is bloody fast.  It's a test more of reaction speed than skill, most of the time.  The main thing is movement speed.  You move fast, your enemies move fast.  So fast, in fact, that it's hard to control.  The game suggests that you can use destructible objects as cover, but I genuinely had a hard time stopping behind them with any sense of consistency.  It's that fast.  I don't think this is a good thing, not at all.\n\nThere can be a lot going on in fights, and you just don't have the time to comprehend it.  After level three there's a miniboss, called the bombadier.  He throws bombs.  Makes sense, right?  Except that he also throws fans of knives.  And he also summons randomly spawning rocks throughout the room.  And also there's at least four different types of bombs he spawns.  Also he can run very fast, and spends most of his time off-screen while you're frantically trying to figure out if this bomb explodes in a + or an X, so you can't even throw incidental damage at him while dodging.  And this is just a miniboss!\n\nEnemies can spawn in huge clusters right near the doors, giving you no time to react.  If you get mobbed you're kind of in a spot.  Unless you have a knockback spell equipped then you have to physics your way out of them.  It's nice that you can push enemies around, but the game is so quick that often it's all you have time to do.\n\nWhen you level up, the game waits to tell you until after the fight.  This is pretty great.  It automatically pops up the box that gives you the choice of perk and you don't have to worry about getting mobbed the moment you click one.  However, the game also doesn't let you click anything until it finishes playing the 'you levelled up' ditty.  It just... stops for a moment.\n\nThe spells.  My goodness, the spells are so good.  You can make one-, two- or three-element spells, with repeats allowed.  The game tells me that's a total of 285 spells, and I believe it.  You start off knowing all of the one-element spells, and I have crafted all of the two-element ones and a half-dozen of the threes, and they're very well varied.  There's direct damage spells, aoe spells, buffs, debuffs, you name it.\n\nThis is where the wonderful variety of statistics comes into play.  You have damage and bullet speed and bullet duration and size and dot damage and knockback to name just a few that appear on spells, and then characters have movespeed and health and armour and elemental skill and crit chance and density and so many others that there is just a whole heap of room for spells to be different in!  It's great!\n\nThe game makes you feel like a pretty badass wizard, and I have to commend it for that.  It's really fantastic in that respect.  It's one of the best games I've ever played like that.\n\nLevel design is good and varied.  Each arena is different enough to feel interesting, and the enemies with zones of effect are just the right size to have an impact and let you play around.\n\nEnemy AI seems pretty smart.  If you go invulnerable then they run away from you.  They can try to dodge bullets, especially elites.\n\nBosses are hugely varied, but, again, perhaps a little too busy.  There is an awful lot going on in any boss fight, and it gets very hard to follow very quickly.  This was my experience in the first boss I encountered:  "Oh, so he's immune to damage?  Okay, I'll wait it out.  It's not ending.  Oh, so I can stand on his head to hurt him.  King of the hill, no problem.  Okay, so those are knockback attacks bouncing around.  Makes sense, this is the storm boss.  Okay, so bouncing off the walls deals damage?  or is it those red areas?  Okay, so dodging is hard when his face covers the spells, but almost down to the last quarter and- oh.  Dead.  So he shoots lightning at the end, centred on his head, where I had to have been standing to damage him up until this point.  Well that's good to know if I ever have to fight him again.  Back to floor one again."  And this hasn't been an isolated incident, this has happened with just about every boss.  There's just no way of knowing what the attacks are going to do, or what hurts or where to stand.  There's no telegraphing.\n\nI encountered a fair number of bugs, but the devs seem to be working on most of them.  It's a small team, so this is entirely understandable and I don't hold it against them.\n\nAnd now for the nail in the coffin.  My final comment:  The art is...  There's no two ways about this: it's really bad.\n\nThere is a grand total of one, yes: one, casting animation.  In a game about casting spells.  A firepit is a reddish smudge, a mudslide is a brownish smudge, ice is, you guessed it, a bluish smudge.  An air elemental, a creature, is a whitish smudge  Every other creature in the game is done in pixel art, but not the air elementals.  This is probably my biggest gripe with the game.  I think that hiring a professional artist could double, perhaps even triple the quality of the game.\n\nNow you could argue that it's going for a "retro pixel style", but that doesn't stop it from being a terrible example of such.  The only animations that you ever see are: walking in the four cardinal directions, walking while shooting in four cardinal directions.  And notice that that's the direction you're shooting.  The animation's the same no matter which way you're going if you're shooting, say, to the right.  That's it, that's all there is.  And it's not even a particularly good walk animation, just leg up, leg down.  Standing still is even just a still frame from the walk animation, as far as I can tell.\n\n\nSo, the verdict.  Is it worth your money?  Not at the moment.  Perhaps after a few patches, and preferably a makeover, then I could recommend it, but not as it currently stands.\n\nI will edit this review if anything changes.","November 18, 2014","false","24.3"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","60","71","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/recommended/306550/","bolm","Gänseblümchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/","593 products in account","Below you'll find a very in-deph, analytical video review of Runers, and below that a review in written form, should you prefer text over video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0b1yF0mgHs\nAsthetics: Decent pixel art style that seems rather generic due to low variety. Especially the floor, the walls and the spelly icons look particularly bad. The spell effects themselves are rather pretty though. Very simple, no doubt about it, however this simplicity also allows for easier recognition (as enemies use the same spells).\nSound design: Overall average. The sound effects are again generic, but what you would expect. Water drops create satisfying splash sounds, lightning sparks like broken electricity and fire spews crackling sounds of a train running on charcoal. A gripe worth mentioning here is the forgetable music, which ranges from alien space tunes while fighting in old ruins (huh?) to base heavy tunes in the depths of hell. Luckily the game does have a seperate music switch to turn off the music and play a choice of your own music in the background. I highly recommend playing heavy rock or metal, as I found it most fun to slaughter monsters alongside.\nGameplay: The heart of Runers and by far the strongest component that carries the game. Before starting a new run (due to the permadeath mechanic of roguelikes), you create a character based on one out of 20 classes and one out of 20 races, which influence how you try to develop your character. Afterwards you are dropped into a procedurally generated dungeon, where you face hordes of monsters with distinct abilities and strategies to defeat them. There are also several special rooms you can find. Certain rooms have an aura attached to them that randomly affects your (and the monsters!) stats, either by lowering them or by increasing them. There are challenge rooms that completely change the objective, for example protecting a portal or dodging fireballs. On some floors a boss awaits you. These fights are particularly interesting as most bosses require a special strategy to defeat. For a great example, please watch the video and the fight against the Air boss Nimbirrus.\nWhile defeating enemies, you will find an array of drops. Among them Runers, Double and Triple Combiners. The Runes can either be used on their own to upgrade an existing spell or in conjuction with a combiner to create an entirely new spell from a pool of 285 spells! After unlocking all double and a reasonable amount of triple spells, I can honestly say that a lot of spells play very differently and this whole spell crafting system adds a really fun layer of exploration ontop of the game. There are some weaker points in terms of gameplay too however. Completing a floor or reaching a level up rewards you with a choice of four possible upgrades, which can be runes, rune level, combiners or passive upgrades (the latter for level ups). As the passive upgrades are mere stat upgrades, completing a floor does not feel rewarding enough on itself.\n\nTL;DR: Overall, Runers is an honestly brilliant action roguelike with an incredibly in-depth spell crafting system and a huge variety. The small gripes I have in terms of asthetics, sound design and unrewarding level ups do not diminish my very positive opinion of Runers. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you are into roguelikes like Binding of Isaac, Our Darker Purpose or A Wizard's Lizard.","September 2, 2014","true","11.2"," 58 of 83 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","58","83","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iyagovos/recommended/306550/","iyagovos","Iyagovos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iyagovos/","1062 products in account","The most beautiful thing about starting a new rogue-like game is seeing the different options that are available to customise your first play-through. Binding Of Isaac shows you the 6 characters you can unlock, Risk of Rain presents the three classes you can play as. Immediately you’re thrown into the game knowing full well that you can choose to play however you want, and that your choices are going to matter, and that’s what makes rogue-likes my favourite genre, because you have such control over your playstyle from the get go.\n\nRuners developed by Let’s Get Kraken is no different. Wait, let me rephrase that. Runers is different. You’re not provided with 5 characters, or three classes. No sir. You’re give 20 of each. 20 blessings and 20 classes. Let’s do some maths for a minute. That’s 20 x 20 playable combinations. And while I’m sure the majority of you remember your 6th grade multiplication, I’ll do it for you here. 20 x 2 = 40, and 40 x 10 = 400. That’s right, 400! Class/race combinations. That’s an incredible amount of choice, and you haven’t even started the game yet! if you played through the game 100 times changing only those beginning choices each time, you’ve only played a fourth of the game! I know I’m starting to ramble here, but re-playability is a major thing for me in a rogue-like, and Let’s Get Kraken absolutely nail it from the get go.\n\nOnce you get past this selection, you’re offered the choice of ten runes to choose from. Each of these changes the way your character plays. The Spark rune lets you shoot lighting, while the Mind rune shoots a bolt that goes through things. The Earth rune shoots a bolt that pushes back enemies, and the Fire rune one that burns. As you look through these spells, you think to yourself, “Wouldn’t it be awesome if I could combine these to make a spell that shoots lightning AND burns?” And you’re in luck. Combining and modifying, and even experimenting with spells happens to be the main method of upgrading your characters arsenal. Runes drop as you defeat enemies, from each of the 10 elements that you could pick from at the beginning. These can have bonuses to bullet size or projectile travel speed, and occasionally can be combined with other runes to create more powerful attacks. You need a relatively rare drop called a “combiner” before you can do this, but once you find one the spells you can choose from rise from the 10 runes, to the 65 combinations that you can now make. Every spell is different, and can change your gameplay style totally. The experimentation of these spells is what I personally think is the most fun part of the game. Once you find one of the even more rare “triple combiners” you can then combine three runes at once, opening up the spell bank even more which modifies what you can do even more.\n\nOn top of this, your character gains experience through kills, and levels up. Upon leveling, you can choose between four traits to gain, which are randomised and provide a small bonus that makes certain tasks easier. One of my personal favourite traits is one that upon dying allows you to lose all your traits and resurrect yourself. And for those of you that have played rogue-likes, you know how valuable a second life can be, especially when you get further along into the dungeon.\n\nSpeaking about dungeons, Runers has a pretty nifty map layout. Rooms can contain enemies or challenges, and never both. These challenges can be herding wisps into portals (one that I really don’t enjoy) or having to defeat waves of enemies in a time limit. There are more, but I’ll leave those discoveries to you. Each room also has the chance of having a staircase in it, which takes you down to the next level. Each level has a random enemy buff, making the room harder. These can be things like a 20% increase of enemy bullet size, or 10% increase of enemy health. Nothing crazily overpowered, but enough to keep you on your toes throughout the whole game.\n\n\n\nThe enemy variety is fantastic, with 140 different enemies being thrown at you as you play. From skeletons that you need to run over after killing, to swarms of rats and cockroaches that keep you on your toes as you sprint away from them. These can also be upgraded into champion level enemies that deal more damage and have more health. The coolest thing about these enemies is that Runers features a Beastiary, where information about the enemies killed is stored. When killing an enemy for the first time, a small pop-up shows in the top left, noting that the enemy’s details have been added to the logs. This makes the game feel a lot larger, and allows the players to spend time learning about their opponents, and craft different spells with which to take them done.\n\nBoss fights are force to be reckoned with, but I won’t spoil them for you. Look forward to them, I guarantee that they’re a dangerous part of the game, and definitely a trial that stands up to the trope of a boss fight.\n\nArtistically, and musically, Runers feels lovingly crafted. The soundtrack (which is also available for purchase on Steam) is light and wonderful, and provides something that adds so much to the atmosphere on the dungeon you’re in. The music flows well, and makes the game world feel much larger than it would otherwise.\n\nRuners takes the ideas of the rogue-like genre that have become set in stone, and improves and modifies them to create a masterpiece of rogue-like action. Providing the player with a bevy of choice, and a huge amount of content to discover, fans of the 2D rogue-like action genre owe it to themselves to play Runers. Launching today, you can find Runers on Steam for the modest price of $7.49 for the next week, with the price going up to $9.99 on the 9th.","September 2, 2014","true","4.2"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/306550/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Runers is a rogue-like shooter with randomly generated dungeons and shown from a top-down perspective. We’ve seen more games exactly like this. So, is it good ? No,… it’s great !\n\nNow, Runers gives us exactly the same stuff as other top-down rogue-like games, but with one little twist: along the way you’ll find all kinds of different runes. These runes can be used to create a new spell. One isn’t usually as effective as two or three of them, but sometimes you have no other choice. You see, you have to use Combiners (also found randomly) to combine two or three of the same runes. The more runes you add the more powerful your spells become. After creating a spell you can continue to upgrade it even further by placing the same sort of runes on top of your (newly) created spells. It’s amazingly deep and it gives the game an insane amount of replay value.\nThese runes can be found in crates and can be dropped by killed enemies so you never know when you’re going to get it, or what you get, of course.\nKilling enemies gives you experience that will level your character up. You don’t upgrade stats like endurance or strength, but you do get to choose between several perks, like more damage, but less armor. Things like that. These perks usually have a trade-off, so it’s not always a win-win situation.\nIf you finish a floor you’ll also be able to choose between five perks and these always have a positive effect, like extra Dark or Light damage, for example.\nWhen you first start the game you’ll be able to choose between quite a few races and classes, each with their own pros and cons, and these influence the gameplay quite a bit. Again, tons of replay value because of this. You can make the game easier or more difficult by just selecting a certain class and race.\nSo, the dungeons are randomly generated. You can use a map to see where you’ve been, because the rooms usually look alike. When entering a room you’re usually met by at least 10 enemies, often even more, and by pressing both the left and right mouse button (or one of them) you can shoot your primary spell and, if you have found a rune, your secondary spell. There’s even room for 2 additional spells that can both be used by pressing 1 or 2 on your keyboard.\nRooms also have different types of objectives; there can be challenge rooms (for example, dodge fireballs until the time runs out), event rooms (like saving a character by killing all enemies) and boss rooms (which don’t need any explanation I think).\nThe game is pretty hard, depending on what kinds of spells you can create. The first floor is usually easy enough and from the second floor and onwards the game becomes increasingly difficult with tougher enemies or enemies that deal more damage. It’s absolutely recommended to keep moving because standing still will get you killed.\nStill, dying isn’t the end of the world. In fact, I’ve had tons of fun by just dying. I find it absolutely fantastic to unlock new bestiary entries and create newer and more effective spells. Besides, the games usually aren’t that long. They range from 30 to 90 minutes I think. But this number depends on several factors like exploration, luck and skill. So some games might take longer than that, some even shorter.\n\nRuners isn’t the best looking game out there. There’s nothing fancy about it. But the spell effects stand out the most I guess and they look mostly fine. The characters are usually too small to notice any sort of details and the gameplay is so fast that you won’t even care about it anyway.\nThe music is mysterious and fits the dungeon part of the game and the sound effects like shooting spells or the sounds enemies make when they are killed are solid.\nThis game isn’t meant as an audiovisual experience. It’s anything but that. But the gameplay is the most important part of it all, and I really can’t complain about that.\n\nI think Runers has become one of my favorite rogue-like games of the last 6-12 months.

The combat is enjoyable, the crafting system is interesting, and even on the easiest difficulty, the game is very challenging.\n\nAnyway, before I start my written review, if you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here’s a link to an approximately 2min video: http://youtu.be/V_eBJRdylj8\n\nIf you’re looking for a more in depth look at the game, here’s a link to a longer video: http://youtu.be/FsQ2Lnw4SqQ\n\nI just want to open by saying, this game has a completely free demo where you can play through up to 3 floors (including a boss fight), so if you are unsure, you can always go look at that.\n\nI think the main thing that sets this game a part from other rogue-likes is the spell system. It’s beautifully done. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of spells, all of which have unique animations. Crafting is really cool too, as when you start the game you have absolutely no idea what you are creating, but once you have crafted a combination of runes once, it will go into your Runedex so next time you try to create that particular combination it will let you know what it is and what it does.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, and there seems to be unique death/spell sounds so you aren’t just hearing that one sound over and over.\n\nWhile the general aesthetic may be considered average, the particle effects are absolutely gorgeous and the enemies well designed. One thing I liked in particular is that most enemies act differently (and there is a fairly large variety), so every fight doesn’t just devolve into you kiting a bunch of creatures around the room in a circle. Also, if you die it’s your own fault, not the fault of the game, which in my books is another big plus. Finally, the boss creatures actually have really cool unique mechanics. I won’t spoil any, but I have fought 4 bosses, and was pleasantly surprised upon fighting every single one of them.\n\nThere’s also a ton of replayability. I played the game a fair few times, and each time I got a completely different experience when it came to spells and events. And speaking of events, there are some really cool ones. Since there are also so many different Passives and Classes (20 each!), with all unique abilities, you can pretty much play the game however you want, as there is a passive and class for every possible playstyle. There are also 30 or so challenges you can attempt, ranging from simply dodge creatures or fireballs, to attempting to destroy a certain number of objects with limited spells or killing enemies while maintaining a certain degree of accuracy.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you are a fan of rogue-likes, you will probably like this one. It’s fun, unique, challenging, has a ton of content, and is well worth it for the price. Also, if for some reason you’re finding it too easy; there are 5 difficulty levels to keep you challenged!","September 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Unlike most roguelikes, this one comes closer to being one. It's also crazy fast-paced. Being a real-time game, there's very little opportunity to plan out your moves and attacks. While you can pause the game at any time, the sheer speed and volume of bullets, enemies, hazards, and repositioning effects makes dodging difficult. Add to that a low invulnerability period when hit, and you will find it is very easy to die in this game.\n\nI underwent a strange journey in my experience with Runers. I began with the curiosity phase. The game seemed simple enough - fantasy Smash TV with procerdurally generated levels. It sounded intriguing, and I gave it a whirl. After the tutorial, the game opens up with a fairly large character selection screen, my weakness. I made what I thought would be a melee character, a Dwarven Paladin. I started the Wimpy-level game, and noticed I was throwing ranged attacks. How odd! I tried to play him like a melee character, and while he did okayish, the only reason he survived was because of the generous life drops on the first floor. That didn't last very long, however, as the life drops became more and more scarce as I went down, and I finally died. After a few more class and spell combinations, and that's when became clear - this game doesn't have a proper melee combat system. Sure you can craft a sword spell, but you'll get obliterated pretty quickly if you keep that up. Fair enough, now was the time to experiment.\n\nThe next phase of the game was discovery. Having made my first double-rune spells, and seeing how much better they were, I got excited and wanted to make all of them and see what suited me best. I tested all the races and classes to see what they would bring to the table. The opposition was tough, but I was careful and prepared. I made my way to the first boss of the game, Blazia. After a long, dangerous fight, Blazia's tactics suddenly changed drastically. Her fire maze is where I promptly got my ♥♥♥ handed to me. The next run, I made it down there again, but instead found Dash. Dash was much easier to combat, and I beat him without much trouble. The next few floors, the scarcity of health drops did me in, as it seemed to do quite often. After a few more runs, I finally made it to the 10th floor, and beat the game. But wait, I didn't unlock anything at all! So I tried the next difficulty level. And, well, that didn't go so well.\n\nFiguring that I would need the powers of triple-rune spells to make any meaningful progress, the time came to discover all 285 spells. This phase of the game was tedium. I can't begin to tell how grueling it is to get triple combiners. This process would have been so much more enjoyable if the triple combiners were not needed. It's not like players are going to find crazy good spells right off the bat, because there's such a large volume of lackluster triple-rune spells. When so much time is spent to waste one triple combiner with three runes that could have been used for something meaningful, that's just adding insult to injury. The Runedex helps out a little with this problem thanks to categorization, but you're still probably going to make a worthless spell regardless.\n\nAfter forty hours or so, I managed to acquire and test every spell in the game. Now came the revenge phase. I planned out which spells I would want to use from now on, and forged my way ahead. Armed with the tools I wanted, what was once fiendishly difficult became manageable. The game is still plenty tough, but I successfully made it through a few more difficulty levels. Still stuggling with higher difficulty levels, I suddenly discovered something far more potent than any triple-rune spell. I can only assume it to be a bug, but this skill provided grossly overpowered buffs, to the point where I could decimate rooms at will. For this reason I was able to plow through Apocalypse difficulty, a worthy end to the crazy hard game.\n\nNow onto the nitpicking.\n-The game is poorly optimized, even in low performance mode. There is	` drastic slowdown when a lot of action is going on, especially when you crank up the size of bullets and swarm the screen with effects.\n- Global cooldowns in the game are not intuitive. When you have many low CD spells, some won't trigger because the game doesn't adequately explain about this.\n- The lack of auto-fire for other skill slots seems pointless, since the game implements a global cooldown system for every spell.\n- The races and classes could use rebalancing. I imagine many of them are unused because they are simply not competitve.\n- Leveling up feels weak most of the time because selections tend to be poor. You don't even gain HP or other stats, unless you pick a skill that does so.\n- There's far too many weak triple-rune spells. Either these should be buffed, or triple combiners should be removed. There's so many spells to learn, but if people rarely get to see them, what was the point in making them?\n- I'm not sure if the game mentions that spells do not require combiners once it's in your Runedex. At the very least the game should probably mention this on the inventory screen.\n- Every hostile room locks you in for a fight to the death. This gets old pretty quick. I'd kill for a spell that lets me open doors or something. Or leave some doors open to begin with.\n- Occasionally monsters will spawn right next to the entrance of the room.\n- Enemies use the same bullets you do. For this reason, it's difficult to tell when something belongs to an enemy or not.\n- Some enemies leave lingering effects well after they die, such as Mud Golems. Oftentimes I re-enter a cleared room and still find the effect lingering there.\n- Repositioning attacks are excessive. Spending lots of time not being in control of your character is unfun.\n- Minibosses are oddly harder than real bosses themselves. At least tone down their firing rates.\n- The damage output of some enemies is far too high, such as necro skeletons (which shouldn't be ranged!). Since there is a very low invulnerability period, you will often suffer multiple hits at a time.\n- Most single-target spells are not competitive. In general it's best to use spells that can level entire rooms.\n- The game as a whole is just too fast. Even some enemies are faster than you. Trying to dodge the fireball room without spells is just ludicrous. And because some enemies move so fast, it's bloody difficult to hit them with single-target bullet spells, which makes up a large portion of the Runedex. The ability to pause is no excuse for making everything move so fast.\n- I would have liked equipment such as robes, and cash to buy things from shops.\n- How about a way to mash 3 runes into a new random one?\n- It would be nice if there was an icon above your character sprite to show status afflictions such as confusion.\n- Allies or hirelings would be a fun addition (not including the escort or class abilities). Something more permanant.\n- I found a couple game-breaking bugs.\n\nRuners is a difficult game for me to rate. I had a lot of fun discovering spells at first, but to get all the triple-rune spells is nothing more than a chore. However, once you DO have all the spells, the game becomes more interesting.The devs clearly want this game to be tough as nails. While they may have succeeded, in doing so, the game becomes inaccessible to a broader audience, which I feel is a shame to an otherwise fun game. If I were to describe this game, it would be Kiting: The Game, because that's all you do. Unless you're using nuking strats, you're just circling around, spraying and praying to hit something, ad nauseum. I rate Runers a 7/10. There's a lot of room for potential, but as it is now, I imagine it will only appeal to diehard players.","October 7, 2015","true","56.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

You slowly power up as you venture, through rooms, deeper into the meat of the game.\n\nRuners is challenging. Heck, it is downright brutal. After three hours I finally beat the first boss (and mostly because I fought one of the easier bosses) only to die right away in the next area because it introduced stuff I'd not yet seen. That's what makes these games great, when they can hit you with a curveball just as you begin to think you can hit a homerun.\n\nThe rune system of developing spells is pretty intriguing, albeit very tricky just starting out. I am noticing that entire runs can be dedicated to trying different combinations of runes hoping to find that one spell that really accents my playstyle. The rune system is interesting, furthermore, because it challenges you to decide between upgrading your current spell and building a new one altogether which, if you're a newbie, is kind of like playing a slot machine.\n\nThere are definitely flaws with the game, however. It doesn't have that level of polish that the Binding of Isaac has, nor does it really feel flushed out and well balanced. The art is consistent and classic-style, which is great, but it gets lost in the level design. The maps are pretty much all the same, on the levels I played. Rooms are slightly different looking but there are only a handful of room types and things that might happen in those rooms. You've got the boss room, normal rooms, and challenge rooms. All of which might spawn as an aura room, but for the most part you're looking at only three room variants. Hopefully in a future patch we'll see this expanded upon, as it is certainly one of the major lowpoints for the game right now.\n\nThe music is solid, and the controls feel  well thought out. There is currently no controller support which is a bummer, but it plays just fine without. I do have one complaint, however, with the keybinds for hotkey spells. With all the frantic action it is incredibly frustrating to stop what you're doing to hit a hotkey. If you're using your mouse buttons to fire your primary spells then the hotkeys will not (at least not for me) activate properly. You've got to stop moving or stop firing to shoot off the hotkey spells which makes them near-useless.\n\nGreat game and I'm sure we'll see my concerns addressed in future patches.","September 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The runes and spell combining system is really cool! I liked discovering new spells and trying them out. Level up bonuses are....weird, but not in a bad way. There are some great ideas, but this game is broken by major, major flaws that never should have made it out of alpha testing.\n\n1) The sound effects. Dear God. When you fire two bullets every 0.7 seconds, they should not each be ear-splitting "ZWOOOOOP"s.  If you're killing fifty enemies every room, don't make every one ♥♥♥♥ing scream in agony. The sound design in this game is so bad that it's funny, until you're actually playing it and actually have to turn off the audio because it's hurting your ears.\n\n2) Tedium. Why are there half a dozen destructables in every room that serve absolutely no purpose at all except to make you stand in front of them, mindlessly firing into them as they slowly run out of health? If you want upgrades, you have to destroy them all, every time. Devs, did you actually play this? Did you find this fun? Or was it boring as hell?\n\n3) Cooldowns. You have a 60-second "big" cooldown in addition to your fast spells. The optimal play is to use it every room, then simply wait for the cooldown to elapse before venturing into the next room. Pro tip for devs: don't ever make the best play the least interesting (see point 2). Have all cooldowns reset when you clear a room. Basic ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI cannot recommend Runers in good conscience. Reinstall Binding of Isacc and play that instead. It's better-designed in every way, and a heck of a lot more fun.","February 1","false","2.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/306550/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I’d played this game for roughly two hours before writing this, it’s good.\n- With the large number of races, classes, procedurally generated maps, random loot and huge number of different spells you can create there is a lot of variety to the gameplay\n- Because of all the choice presented in character generation and spell creation you a fair have amount of freedom to play the way you want\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Pk9knk_-S-0\nhttp://youtu.be/GE8qjJ47gkI\nYou have the choice of undertaking a series of tutorials ranging from basic movement to spell creation. These worked well and didn’t take excessive time.\n-----When starting a new adventure game you select you race which benefits a unique passive ability such as regenerating health after damage is taken or increasing your damage when your health is low. Then you select a class which provides you with an unique active ability, as well as determining your appearance. Active abilities have long cooldowns and give you powers such charging attacks or an aura which stuns enemies.\n-----You then choose your basic spell before beginning your adventure. The environment you will find yourself in is made up of series of rooms. Most rooms contain random hostile creatures which you must defeat in order to leave the room and enter another adjacent room. One room on each level houses a downwards staircase which will take you to the next more difficult level.\n-----At the start of each level you will have the choice to continue playing or to save and exit. Apparently you can only load a save once, so you cannot attempt the same instance repeatedly.\n-----On death hostile creatures or destructible objects may drop healing items or a random rune. There are several kinds of runes such as shock, fire, cold and so on. You can then use a single rune or combine two or three different runes of any combination to create new spells. The spell created depends on the runes used and will be unknown to you prior to combining multiple runes. Most spells are projectile attacks but some are more unique and have different effects.\n-----To use spells that you have created you must assign them to slots which correspond with mouse buttons or hotkeys. You are usually able to hold down both mouse buttons and hot keys simultaneously to alternatively cast spells. A quick firing spell can fire several times before the cooldown of slow firing spell is up. Spells can be upgraded by investing more of the same runes into them.\n-----By the default the hotkeys are number keys one to four. These are actually difficult to use while you are controlling your movement with the WASD keys. Because enemies move fast and you basically need to constantly move to avoid them. But you are able to rebind the hot keys to something that suits you better.\n-----Your character will gain experience and level up as your progress through the dungeon. Each time you level up you have the choice of four random perks, which vary in their usefulness. Some seemed to have negligible effects such as a small damage buff but others had valuable utility such as stunning all enemies once you reached critically low health.\n-----The game is fairly challenging. I played through three or four times and usually only made it to level three. I only made it to a boss one time, it had a really interesting attack sequence. On death you will lose your experience and spells. However knowledge of new spells created and new creatures encountered will be added to the runedex bestiary for future reference.\n\nSo the graphics are quite basic, reminiscent of old 2D console games. But I thought the game looked fine. There is a quite a bit of variety in the types of creature you encounter and the look of the different spells you can cast. I think it would nice if the graphical and sound effects made the spells feel a bit more dramatic and feel more powerful.\n-----Upon entering one stage I was presented with a little bit of dialogue. So I think there might even be a touch of narrative in this game, but that’s basically all I encountered of that nature.\n\nThere is quite a bit to this game. Playthroughs take half an hour to an hour or more. I only scratched the surface of the game in two hours. There are 7 more levels that I didn’t complete, a lot more enemies that I didn’t come face to face with and so many combinations of runes that I wasn’t able to experiment with. I enjoyed playing it and definitely recommend checking it out.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","September 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

But the drop rate is so unreliable that I've had many runs with an inventory full of runes but no way to combine them.\n\n2. Some spells are just stupid. There are what, 280 something spell comabinations to make? So the game wants us to experiment and try out new spells - that's good! But you don't know what you'd get UNTIL you've made the spell (wasting the runes and the valuable combinators)! Some spells are not only underpower/worthless, and some can be downright dangerous. Like a trinity combination "Pyromaniac" (fire, mind, speed) that basically stops you from casting other spells, but the spell itself is highly unpredictable. WTF? This game has A LOT of these useless spells. And there's not a damn thing you can do with the new spells you don't like. If you make a game that requires us to make new spells, then don't punish us for doing so!\n\n3. Character leveling is underwhelming, and intentional gimping of spell slots. You can pick 1 out of 4 random perks on leveling up. Some of them needs other perks to synergize with, that's fine. But some perks are just useless, and buggy. The "ghost" perk or whatever it's called can bug out if you level it up too many times (something like level 8 or 9). As for the spell slots - you can only have 3 active spells that shots constantly, i.e. you have 6 spells equiped, even if all of them are fresh with no cool down, you can only fire 3 of them at once. Doesn't mater if you mesh the buttons. Now imagine you have all these cool spells at your disposal - but you can only pick 3 at a time. I guess the developers wanted us to slot in some longer Cool Down spells... The design may have worked well IF we actually get to choose the runes and spells we'd be getting. WIth bad luck, you could have all low Cool Down spells. It's just fustrating.\n\nI'm not even to go into the level and AI designs. It's fun for a short while, but once the novelty wears off, I simply see no reason to return to the game.","July 11, 2015","false","10.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

The customization options are huge (285 unique spells to be discovered? Best get started) with the ability to select not only your race, but your class. All of which are varied and interesting (And so far, fairly balanced which is surprising) That, alongside talents you can pick every time you clear a floor, or level up (with enemys getting random bonuses as well) hell, you even get to pick your own starting spell, which is always nice (So far, much love to shock!)\n\nThe difficulty curve is what you can expect from this genre, brutal at the start, but fair. You'll die. A lot. But it's never the game tricking you. Every death is a learning experience.\n\nBack to this specific game, the replayability factor is huge, due to the previously mentioned customization options, as well as the leaderboards. Come on, who doesn't like to see their name up in lights? Ok, so you might not be able to rank it in the global top 10, but there's always personal bests/friends high scores. The challenge system also adds further layers of depth, which is great.\n\nThe soundtrack, I'm a fan of personally, and the graphics, while basic...serve the purpose. Considering the pricetag on this game, I'd strongly suggest picking it up.\n\n\nAll in all, I could sum it up in just a few words; If you even have the slightest interest in this style of game, even if this is your first...try the Demo. Right there, on this page.

At first combat is pretty much all about crowd control and trying to hit things while staying in motion.  Eventually you get an idea of which enemies you should be shooting first, and I'm sure choosing the right spells will become important once I figure out what more than 5% of them do.\n\nIt does come with standard roguelike caveats, of course.  You aren't guaranteed to get the stuff you want, some rooms will spawn you in the middle of a horde of monsters that bite your face off, and so forth.  Life isn't fair, but at least it's short :P\n\nAlso, it's hard to go wrong when you can play a free demo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madpear/recommended/306550/","madpear","madpear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madpear/","26 products in account","Runers is a great game for folks who want a challenge and a multitude of strategies to defeat it.  My recommendation to first-timers is to do the tutorials once before you start, then again after a few hours of gameplay.  You'll be grateful you did since coming up with your own winning build requires a good understanding of the mechanics, the more advanced of which are best learned once you have a good understanding of the basics.  The game is challenging, both in gameplay and in build-creation.\n\nHere's a quick example of the diversity of the game.  There are 285 possible spells, of which I have discovered just under 100, and already I have 3 or 4 high-powered builds that are capable of winning (at least on the easier difficulties).  Throughout the game, you will complement these skill-builds with a set of unique abilities you acquire from accomplishing various in-game feats (e.g. completing a floor, defeating a boss, succeeding at an "event room", leveling up).  You can base the abilities your spells or your spells off your abilities, but certainly you will want to think about how they will pair with each other to make your character perform best.\n\nAs far as the enemies, I haven't counted, but I would say there are well over a hundred unique types.  Developing a strategy on how to approach each enemy type is another critical part of succeeding.  The game is not easy to win, even on the "easy" difficulties, so be prepared for a challenge.  Once you get to know the majority of the mob types, you will find yourself laughing in the face of enemies that you used to curse for their ridiculous difficulty!  Except for bosses... Boss fights are just as diverse as the "normal" room fights, with what seems to be at least a few dozen different bosses that you can encounter.  These will range from "Oh, I can easily beat this guy when he does such-and-such" to "I'll never beat this guy!" (don't worry, you can definitely beat him, the question is are you resourceful enough).  All of them are distinctly different experiences which is what kept me coming back to replay it again and again.\n\nAs far as the different difficulties, well, I haven't beaten it above the first two difficulty levels, but that is mostly because I've only tried the harder ones a couple of times at this point (the game is pretty new, after all).  As I said before, even the "Wimpy" mode presents a challenge and I would recommend sticking to this mode until you've honed your skills and developed several effective combos that you can be prepared to deploy.  You have to be ready to be effective regardless of what rune types start dropping from the enemies you dispatch.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty stellar game.  I quickly grow weary of a game that either feeds me an easy win or sits me in a rail-car and doesn't let me deviate or forge my own chosen path to victory.  Runers does neither of these things, and is winnable with literally thousands of different builds/strategies.  And just when you think you're a master, you realize you're playing on "Wimpy" and it's time to up the ante and break into the higher difficulties.\n\nRuners has been fun so far and hopefully some of the remaining spells I discover will give me the edge I need to beat it on Apocalypse.

These features combined with a decent learning curve and amount of difficulty provide a great amount of replayability, and makes the rogue-like permadeath feature not as frustrating as I thought it would be.\n\nSummary: Runers is a great dungeon crawling, rogue-like shooter with plenty of features to keep you coming back for more.

It really does. But the many problems make it frustrating to play.\n\n1.  The drop rates.\nAll items seem to drop at unreliable rates. I sometimes got too many health pickups to use, or so little I have no ability to regain health. The combiners are the worst offenders of this. They are required to make new spells, but the drop rate seems so low that getting them is rare, and once you actually get a combiner, you get some useless spell you can't use even if you want to. More on that later.\n\n2. The rooms. Everything about them.\nThe concept of randomly generated rooms (in this particular game) is really cool and sound like tons of fun. The problem  comes from how the generation is designed. In every room there are around 6-8 destructibles. These destructibles drop items on occasion. Seems pretty good right? The problem is that each destrucible takes many hits to destroy, so you just sit there blindly shooting it until it's gone. If I wanted to be bored, I would go outside. The enemies are also a pain in the ♥♥♥. They're not challenging, they're unfair. What you will find yourself doing most of the time is running around in a circle, while enemies chase you at great speeds. This gets very boring. In some rooms, enemies spawn right next to the door, and you immediately get ganged up on, taking vast amounts of inescapable damage.\n\n3. The spells.\nIn order to create new spells, you need a combiner. These are hard to get as mentioned above. When you do get a spell, you have no clue what it is. Having some hints could be cool, but you get none. (As a side note, almost every spell using entropy runes is worthless.) Many spells are also not worth getting. Many spells are situational, which is ok, but since you have limited slots for spells, you end up getting the same spells you always get and sticking with those. This destroys the need for spellcrafting. Why create new spells when you already know what spells you are going to get?\n\nThis game has enormous potential, but is held back by many design flaws.","May 29","false","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Runedex is cumulative over all lives (deaths), so you are always learning new ways to win, new spells to smite foes, new abilities to change the game, & new passive traits to empower your hero.  It's fast & fun shooter action that's been modified with tons of RPG quality & oldschool charm.  In fact, many so-called ARPGs could take note from how complex this roguelike truly is.  The AI is intelligent and surprising, lauching all sorts of magical tricks and traps along the way.  Quests as well as Boss fights are intense & rewarding, changing the pace up of the dungeon crawl, getting adrenaline pumping as fast as any AAA FPS or Action game.  The way magic is modified is like the system "Gunstar Heroes" always dreamed of but never realized.  "Runers" stands up to "Realm of the Mad God" as it's solo arcane bullet-hell brother in arms.

Sure enough it has an interesting concept, however the implimentation of it doesn't seem very successfull. You will find that most spells you discover are just plain useless either because they are too weak or don't make sense against the AI. Another big problem is that you depend on using 5 different spells at the same time. This itself is not a problem, but I really couldn't enjoy it since there isn't a comfortable control "layout". I ended up having to bind 2 spell hotkeys to different buttons on my mouse and using 1 hotkey on the keyboard for spells with long cooldown.\nThe bossfights seem to be pretty nice, I can't say this for all of them since I only did the first 3 before I stopped playing the game, but I got to say that they were enjoyable and unique.\nAll in all I would not recommend this game, simply because it feels unpolished and not comfortable to play.","March 19, 2015","false","5.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Yes it has some good concepts, when it's running faultlessy and it's actually fun to play, once it works.\n\nThe game reminds me a bit about an arcade game that stood in the early 80s in the parlor of our movie theatre. Yeah, I lost a lot of DMs in it, and it was fun to play. Something in this game reminds me about this simple shooter. Yet there are a lot of features that make you think about a more complex game. Each time you start an adventures it's procedurally designed, some would call that "Roguelike" but for this game the name doesn't fit. Some spells though might give you a strange aftertaste...\n\nPro:\n- Simple and fast gameplay, you could say it's intuitive.\n- Once you understand the deeper layer of the spells, you want to know what the specific rune combination actually does, you are forced to play to know. Don't rob your fun reading Tips and Tricks about the game.\n- There is no loot to speak off, but you have to pick up Runes, Healthpacks and Combines. This is of course giving you total control over the most necessary stuff to pick up.\n\nCons:\n-Crashes too often, and sometimes at the most inconvenient time. This game requires some finetuning from the developer.\n- The graphics and sound can make this game a bit annoying, especially if you just want some quick run and are forced to reach at least the next stair down.\n- The same gameplay that makes this game interesting can quickly turn into it's biggest setback. It can annoy you to no ends if you have a dungeon full of Runes without combines or if you have a run with combines, but no runes... or if healthpacks drop so infrequently that you are forced to play with utmost care. There is a built that can give you a bigger survival chance, but I wont spoil it to you.\n- There are some spells that need to be changed, they are either too overpowered or too underpowered.\n\nAll In all, here is the result:\n\nI recommend the game conditionally\nPals, look the game this way, it's a dungeon romp missing some important parts of a real dungeon romp. It's a mixture between the old Gauntlet game and Berzerk of the 80s ... It's doing a lot of stuff just right, but sadly it also does a lot of stuff the wrong way. The developers need to fix the bugs that keep the game crashing, for a starter. And there is also some unbalance in some spells. You'll be able to enjoy the game, but you'll possibly equally bored to death by the game because you have to live with the stuff you get, there is no guarantee, that the runes fall in your favor.","July 17, 2015","true","26.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However you need double-combiners to make spells with 2 runes and extremly rare triple-combiners to make spells with 3 runes. In about 30 minutes of gameplay you can on average get about 1 triple combiner, and 3-5 double-combiners. The game has 285 spells and unlocking all the spells takes forever - also in your first runs before you unlocked some good spells you can't get very far. If you want to try to enjoy this game you NEED to use a wiki and look up the powerful spells because 80% of the spells are completly useless. I didn't use a wiki and eventually i called this game "disappointment simulator" as a joke but it really isn't far off.\n\nAnother problem is that is constantly crashes, in my 15 hours with the game it crashed at least 10 times, the developer also hasn't updated this game in over a year other than a language patch - so it will most likely never get fixed.\n\nThe combination of a grindy game with lots of disappointing spells and constant crashes makes this game terrible and you should avoid this game even if you are a fan of rogue-likes.","October 16, 2015","false","15.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You get a lot more health and often it is easier to refill it but the trade off is that there are far more enemies on screen and many of them are ranged/mages. The gimmick is the magic system, which allows you to craft spells from a single rune or a combination of two or three provided you have the appropriate item (which drop infrequently).\n\nYour first handful of runs will inevitably involve determining the best initial set character set up (you get to choose one passive and one ultimate essentially), your favourite opening spell and then the best combinations. To be frank I did not make it far into the last step because I got tired of running the same levels over and over hoping to find not only the combiners necessary but different runes to find a play style I would enjoy. Also the game crashed a couple of times which was frustrating.\n\nThere have been a few other magic mixing games out on steam as well as a deluge of roguelikes, and as such it's difficult to recommend Runers as a must play, especially at $10. The primitive art style, tedious rune gathering and the frankly ♥♥♥♥ level up bonuses make the game a painful, unrewarding slog. Maybe the desire to experience a variety of crazy spells will work for you, but getting to that stage will require a lot of patience.","February 24, 2015","false","3.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Majority of the fun can be a up down experience depending on how fast you make super broken lightning spell, before we get there though when you defeat an enemy there’s a chance they’ll drop one of ten elemental runes and if you’re lucky enough to have picked up a dual or tri combiner you take the enjoyable elements of that Doodle God game we spent ages playing for some reason along with the random enjoyable elements Binding of Isaac had when you started combining death rays with the power of Satan’s fury.\nYou see Runers boast that they are over 250 possible spells at your disposal as you play around combining the 20 runes, while granted I swear around 50-100 of these are bloody useless I generally did enjoy combining my super broken lightning spell along with shadow rays that knocks baddies away to the chuck my giant bouncing spirit bomb.\n\nI do feel I need to mention though that whilst understandably this game was developed by Let’s Get Krakken games, an incredibly small indie dev so it’s understandable that visuals aren’t going to exactly be on the same spectrum as Hideo Kojima’s Fox Engine but I can’t help but feel incredibly underwhelmed by the presentation. Visuals are that modern take on 8/16 bit graphics but without any of the charm, honestly I’ve seen flash game’s include more key frames of animations in their main characters.\nWhile it’s nice that you are represented by whatever class you picked (though not race oddly enough), all of them are incredibly stilted with the same sprite animations seen in Final Fantasy 2 & 3 (not 5 & 6 btw, the actual FF2 and FF3) that is only made painstakingly obviously with the ludicrous speed boots you can accrue and the occasions where you realize why everything is zoomed so far out as to avoid revealing how badly pixelated things can get.\n\nRuners isn’t bad but I’m still not sure how long I really feel like committing to it, there’s a genuine level of creativity with the spells, tons of random elements like rooms slowing everything down or being laden with fire traps, event rooms to test your skills, challenge modes and boss rooms every three floors or so. On paper, Runers ticks every box for getting the genre right checklist minus the visuals and even includes random level up traits like reducing cooldowns for spells when an mob dies or healing causes you to sustain the next attack without taking damage so really it has replayability oozing out of every orifice.\n\nSo why do I sound like I’m still undecided about the whole thing, sadly for it’s vast array of spell combinations some of the game still feels bare bones which I know I’m harping on but I feel is mostly due to the lack of a driving force so I just don’t see the point in putting myself through the trial and error to beat the final boss or collect the pixie dust (seeing as I have no clue how the game ends); I know having fun should be motivation enough but I like to pretend I’m doing something for a cause and honestly feel no need to put myself through hell unless there’s a willing princess, magical sword or a lifetime supply of loot down there.\nNeed be told though that for $10 or $7.50 should you pick it up this week, it’s a fast paced bullet hell-ish rogue-like that will probably have you sinking at least your monies worth into it that it would be a crime not to give at least the demo a go and any devs who when their kickstarter doesn’t succeed still keeps at it to release their dream project that I just rudely critiqued deserves some praise.\n\nSo in the end I don’t need to get out the angle grinder for this one and can instead look at it even with my rose tinted glasses and actually enjoy myself; I just need to pretend that there is a princess or something at the last floor to congratulate me.\n\n\n\nPros:\nPlenty of creative spell combinations,\nLots of replay value,\nGenuine balance of challenge and gameplay.\n\nCons:\nVery underwhelming visual presentation,\nNo motivational drive,\nStale sprite animations.\n\nFinal verdict,\nRuners wasn’t exactly an instant win for me but it did grow on me and who doesn’t like a super broken lightning spell with a score of 6/10.\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nFor more gaming reviews come check out morbidplay.com\n","September 2, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The gameplay reminds me a bit of Smash TV with customization options similar to that of Dungeons of Dredmor (you can choose race, class, starting spell, etc.).  While it may appear brutal in terms of difficulty, the spells you can unlock will persist from playthru to playthru.  Unlocking a spell requires the appropriate runes AND a combiner, though once you unlock a spell all you'll need is the runes to gain access to it again in a future playthru.  With over 200 spells to unlock, you'll find that ten bucks is a great value for the amount of time you'll spend trying to unlock everything.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKNYUEj3em0","September 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Like most rogue-like games the game thrives initially on exploration, in this case the collection of runes, enemies and different status-elements that can be found through casts and rooms. Unfortunately, almost all of these 3 mechanics seems kinda lost in this game.\n\nLets start off with the collection of runes and the alchemy-style combination of different runes. The idea is clever and could be interesting and rewarding if the spells are unique and rewarding. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Yes, almost every spell and combination is different, but most casts lacks uniqueness and character and sometimes seem to dull. Most casts differ in color, different animation, different damage modifier, and sometimes in tactics ♥♥♥ well, but mostly I don’t get the idea having created a great spell which impacts my progression (I guess this has a lot to do with my dislike to the aesthetics of the game). Eventually, when most spells are discovered there isn’t much going for the game because its lack of unique elements.\n\nSecondly, most enemies seem to be dully animated moving sprites. Specially the bigger enemies, which seem to be a scaled version of the smaller ones without any additions or anything (some of these enemies are really poor scaled, like the big rat/guinea pig, where you can see the resolution is equally to the smaller one and see the pixels of the sprites. Guys, this is really poor work!).\n\nThe status effects doesn’t seem to change the gameplay a lot. To be honest, I haven’t played the game long enough to really experience this though, but what I’ve noticed didn’t really impress me.\n\nAgain, this goes all pretty much with my dislike for the aesthetic of the game. The graphics, animations, music and gameplay feels like a flash-game or run-of-the-mill dungeon crawler created by some guy in late 90’s at game maker because it's his first "real game". Most of all, it lacks in a lot of ways.\n\n2/10","October 24, 2014","false","3.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

I literally just died to a boss that simply automatically damaged me at regular intervals, so it was purely a DPS race while also having to dodge.  Due to the random nature of the runes you will acquire and your traits, this indicates the game has no interest in being fair or completeable.  Avoid this game unless you're the kind of person that loves to fail repeatedly regardless of the quality of our efforts.\n\nI cannot advise you against purchasing this game enough.\n\nIt's clear the developers put a lot of effort into the mechanics, as there are hundreds of unique spells with unique effects on the world which required time and dedication, but the presentation, layout, controls, and fundamental gameplay are clearly areas that failed to be given even half the same amount of energy.\n==========================Original Impressions===============================\n\nCool idea, but the gameplay is fundamentally spammy, or really slow.\n\nI've played a few runs and a lot of the perks from leveling and progression seem inconsequential, and every single death feels like I couldn't have done anything to prevent it.\n\nFurther, while spell combination is cool in theory, your first so many plays are going to be best served by just making spells you don't know, just so that you know what is even available to you in the future.  At base, there's almost no sense of what a spell will do prior to making it.\n\nGood idea, poor implementation.\n\n\nAlso, minor complaint: apparently the steam achievement tracking is broken.

The game has a\nnice variety of creatures and bosses, and the music does well at setting the\natmosphere.  The challenges, while not anything new in their content, do offer\na nice addition to the game.  They don't feel tied into the game, and offering\nsomething like a passive buff would have helped make the challenges feel more\nsignificant.  Another nice addition to the game is the variety of classes, and\npassive ability, which help bring more personalization to how you enjoy playing.\n\nThe game is based on a rune style system, where runes are collected and combined\nto create different levels and styles of spells.  There are many spells, and they\ncarry through each time you play, but there is a lot of grinding required to\nget the right combination of runes and combiners in the randomly generated levels. Finding the right spell to enjoy your play through can also be a bit difficult.\nI go into more detail in the video about this issue.\n\nThere is a large variety of passive abilities.  Some passive abilities do a good\njob of making you feel more powerful, but due to the randomly generated\nabilities, a certain amount of grinding is required to build up the right spells\nand to build up the power needed to defeat higher levels.\n\nThe combat suffers from unoriginality, and feels more like a spam/shooter.  It\ndepends more on luck in what runes you find and what spells you create, rather\nthan taking advantage of the crafting system to customize your experience.  This\nleads to a lot of repetition until you finally get that one item you have been\nlooking for.  There is a lack of progression due to these issues.\n\nOverall I felt that I didn't accomplish anything; the large variety of spells is\nlimited by what the randomly generated levels might offer. This takes away from their being more depth in this game.  I didn't feel like the game wasted my time, or disrespected me but I would not recommend this game to those looking for a balanced, enjoyable experience. I can also see how this game can be enjoyable to some people even through it falls short in the depth not allowing it to be as beautiful as it could of been. None the less, it can still be a fun experience for more hard core rogue-lite fans who don't mind a grind.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of\nwhat I cover in my video.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 12, 2014","false","10.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

You have to find the runes then combine them in different ways to get different abbilities which has you sat there thinking what If I do this? Or this? Sometimes you get poor abbilities but then you'll combine the runes in a way that produces an epic abbility that has you destroying the mobs that come at you. And believe me they come at you. Some rooms you go in and you own the mobs quickly and easily. Other rooms your litterally on the edge of your seat trying to stay alive and kill everything thats flying at you.\n\nThis game is brilliant.

RUNERS\nIn a Nutshell\nRUNERS is a rogue-like, dungeon shooter, with a synergistic and staggeringly deep spell-crafting system, emergent player customization, randomly generated content, and a varied and steep learning curve but subsequent ease of play from the two-dev team, Let's Get Kraken. It is hard as hell, fast, chaotic and tense but ultimately fun and rewarding in both short play sessions and returning delves. If you are still reading, good for you. You got moxy. This game is great and you SHOULD PLAY IT. Let's check out the points!\n\nBuild your starting character from 20 passive trait sets, 20 classes, and 10 starting spells for over 4000 possible combinations BEFORE you even set foot in your first dungeon.\n\n285 unique spells that you craft through experimentation. Each spell has over a dozen aspects to it that make for some truly unique effects. This is the heart of the game and provides your venue to truly craft your unique character each run. Once you've figured out a spell, it gets added to your 'Runedex', allowing you to craft that spell forever provided you have the correct runes in your possession.\n\nCast multiple spells at once, as each spell has it's own utility and cool-downs. How you use/combine your spells are up to you. Slot in and cast 4 different spells at a time with room to store a backup spell and switch them at any time.\n\nNot all rooms are created equal in this randomly-generated loot arena. Room Events, Room Buffs, Boss Rooms, and the ever-critical stair rooms that provide access to deeper levels of the dungeon are all handled clearly on your automap/inventory (to quickly check your rune and combiner stock) once you discover them. The interface is really detailed but also very easy to navigate and parse at a glance.\n\nThere are 140 different types of creatures, with their own attacks, debuffs, and spells, and each with boss variations, roaming the dungeon and depending on what other creatures are in the same room, each type may behave differently. Creatures are affected by room buffs/debuffs as well, so factor that one in too. Are you getting a sense that customization and variety-of-play were a key design goal in this gem?\n\nYou will die a lot. If you do well, each run will see that you've crafted a new spell or two through lucky and clever rune combinations, so that you have more known spells available for you to craft and use in subsequent runs.\n\nWith 5 difficulty levels (I can barely handle the normal level and there are 3 more above that), 50 achievements, and 30 challenges you will not want for ways to test your skills and creativity.\n\nThe graphics are cool and charming in an old-school way. Beautiful, I don't think so, but evocative of theme, clear and telling of what is going on, absolutely. The visuals, sounds, and GUI design are spot on and have a very DIY-feel that is endearingly telling of a small dev team crafting a hidden gem that will be pined over by loyalists for decades to come. That loving craftsmanship should not be discounted when you are looking for a gaming experience that will give back what you put into it.\nConclusion\nRUNERS is damn near perfect at what it does. After 6 hours of game time I honestly don't think I've explored one percent of what this game has to offer. It is a play experience that I come back to time and again because of its direct and simple play... once you figure things out. It always rewards with some sort of gained knowledge as the variety of builds, runes, buffs, monsters, spells, level-up perks, and individual play style meld into a unique formula that generates a fresh experience each time you make a run. I love it.\n\nGive yourself 30 minutes with the demo and play the tutorial. THEN decide if it's for you. I almost gave up on this before I pushed through and took the time to learn from the tutorials and tinker around. MAN, am I glad I stuck with it! It's one of my very favorite play experiences and if what I covered in this review sounds good to you, buy it. I think you'll be happy.\n\nHappy gaming,\nM13","June 16, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game was fantastic; take your good old fashioned Tower Defence game, but give em upgrade paths that change based on what elements you pick. You start off with a good old fashioned fire tower which would amount to good DPS with low damage over time, but then you could upgrade it with a water element with a steam tower that weakens enemies and does pure damage over time, OR you could upgrade it with the earth element for a LAVA tower, or you could upgrade it with the wind element for a BRUSHFIRE tower, or you could upgrade it with the light element for a FLARE tower. The possibilities were endless and it was always great fun playing around with each possibility, discovering new ones and seeing what worked best.\n\nRuners is a Rogue-like Binding of Isaac-style game that works off of exactly the same principle as Elemental TD; you start with a single element and as you play you pick up runes which you can combine to create new spells. If you think this sounds like a neat little idea for a gameplay element you are wrong because it is actually the most freaking incredible and flawlessly executed idea ever conceived and I am legitimately quite angry that it has taken THIS long for someone to put it into a game. You can stick with 2 different elements for all manner of projectile attacks, but later on you can get three-stage combiners to make spells from THREE different rune elements, allowing for literally hundreds of potential combinations. The game is pretty unforgiving with it's bullet-hell challenge but as you learn more spells you become better equipped to handle it.\n\nIf you die in Runers, true to the Rogue-like genre you are forced to start again with nothing, however you do get to keep the knowledge of potential spell combinations in your 'runedex', easing the challenge more by arming you with knowledge rather than stat increases. You also don't need combiners for spells you have already discovered (though the game wont actually TELL you this). This is a very rewarding way for players to feel like they're making progress, knowing they have to figure out the best possible combinations of spells rather than just being able to brute force through every level with basic spells... well.... I'm sure that was the idea, anyway, as it all sort of gets ruined by the chaos rune.\n\nWhen you start a game you pick a race, a profession and a starting rune, the race and profession are inconsequential and  differ depending on your own playstyle, and starting spells are spammable, each having anywhere between a 0.2 and 0.5 second cooldown and either a 0.1 or 0.2 second GLOBAL cooldown. The global cooldown is in place to prevent players from putting base spells on all of their mouse buttons and spamming like crazy, since each individual spell has its own cooldown. Chaos, however, does not give a sh*t. With it's 0.2 second cooldown and 0.1 second global, if you happen to find a second chaos rune in the first few levels you can put one on each mouse button, hold them both down and glide through the first 5 levels machine-gunning everything you see. It is undoubtedly an optimal strategy but I guess I cant fault the game because it took me a while to figure it out, by which time I had already figured out a good portion of the game.\n\nSee there are two ways to play runers; the way where you jump on the wiki immediately to find out what all the most powerful spells are, or the way where you play for 10 minutes and fail spectacularly before going on the wiki to find out what all the most powerful spells are. In all seriousness though I had full intention of getting through this game and unlocking all the spells without cheating but I cracked when I used three upgraded runes, prepared to use the ultimate spell of creature destruction and was given a soggy weet-bix cannon with a 30 second cooldown. The game became significantly less fun after I had this knowledge though, so I implore you to play for as long as possible before resorting to this.\n\nMy one major complaint with the game is in the spells. Some of the spells are really fun; you can shoot, use force pushes, gravity, sound powers, stun powers, speed boosts for yourself, there is a telefrag spell, and yes there is at least one super-powered nuke spell which kills everything near you. I feel they did not make the most of the medium, however, and copped out on a LOT of potential. Some spells are just pathetic as well, especially for spells that cost three runes and extremely rare 3-stage combiners to make. I seem to recall there being an ultimate ability that did nothing but move the creatures around a bit and change the direction of missiles slightly, but not enough so that they don't hit you. There was also a dark rain spell that slowed and did damage over time to a certain area that was so small it never did /anything/. When you unearth a flop spell you generally just chuck it immediately, putting a little cross next to the spell in your runedex so you never craft it again, and it's possible that some spells were meant to be useless; like I'm sure there is a spell in the world of Harry Potter that can only be used by the top wizards of the world that does nothing but turn bread into spiders or something. It just sucks when you waste an entire run getting the resources to craft a single ultimate spell only to have it be a move that drops fluffy marshmallows where your cursor is.\n\nAlso the link between the spell you get and the elements used is beyond tenuous for the mostpart. Dark, light and wind = sleep spell? I mean... yeah, okay... I mean I probably would /not/ have been able to think of much better for that specific spell slot but some of them really are a reach.\n\nRuners has a few flaws, but none are in the gameplay. I actually think this is as solid a game as you can get from an indie developer; gameplay is fun, replay value is INSANE and there is always something new to explore. Runers is one of the most fun rogue-likes I have ever played, and I forgive any shortcomings it may have.","June 8, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
