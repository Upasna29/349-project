The game is easily the best golf sim I've played. The fact it has an unblievable course creator just puts it over the top. It's intuitive, fun and beautiful. You can play your course as your build it to ensure its exactly what you wanted. From placing objects such as buildings, trees, signs to sculpting a simple sand trap, you'll be in love with the ease at which it's all done.\n\nOntop of that the game is gorgeous to look at, runs great and simply the best representation of golf you can find on PC. With an interesting multiplayer aspect you can challenge your friends or take on their ghost ball of their best score.\n\nSo if you like golf, or golf creation and horribly written reviews, you should get this game.","April 17, 2014","true","92.8"," 284 of 340 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","284","340","0","12"

Very limited PC graphics optimization and horrible performance issues prevent me from recommending this game in its current state. With wonky putting, an unreliable swing mechanic, and lackluster ball physics (seriously the same bounce on every terrain except sand), you'd best save your money until this is patched.\n\nOn the plus side the sound design is top notch and the course creator is a great feature, however its certainly not enough to justify buying a game that feels like its still in beta.","August 19, 2014","false","20.5"," 216 of 289 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","216","289","0","4"

You are able to create and customize your own golf course - It can be fully randomly generated or you can hand craft all of the holes, bunkers, trees, hills, anything you could think of, and you can share it to the public.\n\nAs it is currently Early Access some game modes are not available as of yet, such as Tour's and Tournaments (These have a coming soon sign).  Stat tracking is also on the way.\n\nAs far as I can see, there is no online multiplayer, however you do get to play against other players ghosts and The Golf Club supports local Multiplayer.\n\nGraphics wise - Very good, very nice looking game.\n\nAudio is also nice and the commentary that is in the game is a little different from games such as EA's  Tiger Woods games, and that is a nice change.","April 17, 2014","true","4.9"," 106 of 136 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","106","136","0","4"

Luckily I got The Golf Club before it got too negative, because I personally have never had any issues with the performance of the game.  I don't doubt those who say they have, but I have had nothing but fun playing this game.\n\nOn the hardware side, my PC has an i5, and a GTX760, and the game runs very smoothly, with the exception of the rare course with massive amounts of trees.\n\nAs far as content, well, you play golf.  Some people appear unhappy that there is no career mode, and while that would be cool, it wasn't part of the game I bought, and my family enjoys just sitting down for a round of golf when we get together.  I guess a lot of people are looking for a replacement for their previous favorite golf sims, and they find The Golf Club lacking, but if all you want is to play a round of golf when you feel like a round of golf, then this fits the bill nicely.","December 22, 2014","true","103.4"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","3"

While the game initially fills void and you can play some video golf , it becomes increasingly frustrating the more you play it.\n\nThe user created courses are the heart of the game and it's fun to play others creations.   This is best part of the game.  Course difficulties and ratings help you find what you're looking for.  I love this part of the game and applaud the effort that a lot of users make on some truly creative courses.\n\nAs I put hours into the game my frustration level with wind and putting has increased to the point where I can't even finish a round.  It gets boring and repetitive.  Long drive, approach misses because wind is inconsistent, and 2-3 putts because the putting is next to impossible.  Approach shots become increasing difficult if you don't need a 100% shot.  I've played the other series for years and never had even close to this much difficulty.\n\nIf any game needs a putt preview, it's this one.   The "touch" required on putts took awhile to learn, but the aim will never be right.  If you think you need to aim the ball 5' right on a 15' putt, you better move it to 12' right.  Sometimes you won't even see the hole.\n\nFWIW, I'm using a Dual Action game pad.  I may be switching to other controls soon, but those don't sound like any fun to me (yet).\n\nOverall I'm happy the game was made.  I just can't recommend until the playability is fixed.

So those of us that thought we spend $20 on a golf game just found out that we have to spend more money to get the other half of the game. On top of which the game still has a lot of development left despite the current release status. I felt this information was foremost to what I had to say about the game play that I experienced.\n\nDon't get me wrong. With the demise of the Tiger Woods Golf franchise us fairway junkies have been waiting for a game to come along and give us our knee pant, 9 iron fix. This game will be that, one day. Right now the game is being updated side by side with the console build of the game. Very little effort has been put into the controls for mouse users. So you either need to play with a Xbox controller for the PC or struggle to figure out the who what where when and why of how the game registers your mouse movement. There seems to be no ability to control roughly how hard you whack the ball, I still haven't seen much influence from using the fade and draw features. It makes it hard to not want to break your digital club around the electronic trees surounding you on the course. That all being said the game is still in early stages, one day the game might be the next great golf game for both PC and console. One day. Right now they are putting too much into social features like friends lists and competative play, meanwhile very little into the ability to teach players how to use their control systems to get precise shots. I'm no stranger to golf games but I'm having a very hard time being consistant with this game.\n\nEdit/Update: I've had the chance to play a few rounds with an XBox controller, and I've found the controls equally as hard to master. I think the problem still lies in not having a meter system either in game or at least as part of a learning feature that help you adjust to the control scheme.\n\nAs for the rest of the game. A lot has been put into implementing the social features. The game has single, tournament and tour features. I really like the choice of play variety. However unless you happen to bring 3 other golfers in your bag at the bottom with the loose tees good luck. There is no match making feature that I've come across. So if you don't have other players to play with you wind up being matched with imaginary ghost players who represent some of the best players that have played that course. Talk about frustration. As I have said the controls will drive you batty, but it's worse when an imaginary player with a -7 is driving them right to the green, taunting you while you try to work your way out of the sand. The feature was so annoying the do now have a way to turn it off. So obviously this game does want to promote social play. But for those of us who don't have golf loving gaming buddies it would be nice to have a match feature to meet up with other single players for some rounds.\n\nI have not used the course making feature, but I've read that it too can be very difficult to use. However there are many well made player designed courses, that is a great feature of the game.\n\nWhile they are constantly improving the social features of the game, the frustration of the controls combined with the under developed ability to actually use the full social interface make all the implemented features still seem far off. I will revisit this game soon hopefuly after some more updates to see what they have done.\n\nFebruary 2015 update: I finally uninstalled the game. The last updates have seemed to revert the controls back to being wonky and unpredictable. Which is a shame because right before that I was finally have to have a full round with a negative score. The controls seemed to be getting better. That has seemed to change. I'll check back maybe in the spring or summer to see if after a few more updates if the game has made any improvements.","May 27, 2014","false","5.3"," 88 of 125 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","88","125","0","4"

This is almost that game.\nPros: Beautiful scenery, fairly natural swing control, solid in-game physics, wide variety of available courses, and a course editor that is a lot of fun.\nCons: Charging extra for a Season (Career) Mode is lame at best, any joy created by Season Mode is removed by fact that the software engineers chose to cheat the game horribly so their software would not "lose" - no regional Pro-Am EVER had a an entire top 10 at -11 in a single 18 hole round! Makes it tough to care about playing through it.\nOverall, I would give the game as it stands right now, 3/6/16, a B-.

Save yourself $9.99 and skip skip it.\n\nadded 3/7/16: Apparently the last update weighted all AI scores in all single player competitive events to the realm of absolutely stupid.

There is nothing in the way of a practice mode, or even a basic tutorial. You're thrust into the game, and left to figure out how to play on your own. I don't understand why there was such an oversight in this design, and the developers even acknowledge the lack of a practice/tutorial mode in a video on their own page.\n\nThat being said, it is great fun. The courses, while not real world copies, are challenging, and quite rewarding to those that take risks in their shots. The game mechanics are good, and the game is engrossing enough to have you looking for you club, when you've missed a shot by inches, and decide to throw it.\n\nThe bad is this. I felt like I've played this game before, at least, I've played PGA Golf Games before, but they felt like there was more to it. This feels less than, because it's more simulator, and less casual. Putting is challenging, and there aren't 15 different types of overlays setup for you to use. Instead you get a grid, and a camera you can move. It feels basic, but it's more challenging in the end.\n\nIf that is what the devs were going for, which I believe they were, then they hit the mark. This is not a Tiger Woods game, this is a Golf Simulator, rage included at no extra charge.\n\np.s. please add some sort of practice or tutorial modes. That's really a rookie mistake.","December 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

Otherwise, long ago I would have thrown myself in the nearest water hazard along with my clubs. Enjoying a nice day on a gorgeous course is enough. The Golf Club captures this essence in both the challenge of perfecting your swing and the pride of being able to create your own gorgeous courses. But, is that beauty enough?\n\nThe game's course creation tools are impressive in their ability to not only let you build detailed courses, but the scalability of the tools themselves. You can apply some macro-levels rules to shape your course with simple min/max sliders – like if you want your course as a whole to be hilly or have lots of water – or dive into placing individual trees, objects, and even whales. The menu presentation is straightforward, but there are times like placing water, for instance, where the macro and micro tools can cause confusion on how to exactly get what you want. Regardless, the game puts a lot of power in your hands, and with a little tinkering you soon learn how to efficiently work with the tools and start making some sweet courses.\n\nI was really impressed with the naturally adaptability of your holes in the broader context of the world's environment. Moving a hole en masse, rearranging holes' order, adding/subtracting holes, and even switching out the overall theme of the environment (you can choose from desert, autumn/forest, rural, alpine, and the wild Scotland-like links terrain) is well done.\n\nYou can also dive in and playtest your hole at any time; dropping your ball in a specific location or playing the whole thing. Finding and playing other people's creations is easy as well, and you can use them to put together your own tour of courses.\n\nThe golf gameplay itself is challenging and satisfying. The right analog swing requires precision, especially when applying draw or fade, and a minimal pre-swing HUD is hard at first. Gauging your swing power while putting, in particular, takes getting used to, but it won't take long to develop a rhythm and feel to your swing.\n\nAs well-crafted as the game is, it's missing a sense of progression that drives you forward. While creating the course of your dreams (or someone else's nightmares) feels good, I missed a larger structure. Visual or physical golfer upgrades, an overarching rewards system tied to your stats, or even a career shell are missing and there's lost momentum within the game because of it. Seeing what kinds of courses I and others could come up with and the challenges therein is motivating, but the sustenance it provides is impermanent.\n\nThe Golf Club delivers as a course creator, and it's no slouch swinging the clubs, either. What's missing is the personality: the larger career structure and personal investment in your avatar to spur players on and elevate the experience from a nice set of features to the complete package   9/10\n\n\nAppsy doodles","June 22, 2015","true","35.0"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","6"

Folks that are looking for an arcade golf game, probably won't like it, and will quit before they give it a chance.\n\nPersonally I really like the game.  Once you get used to the controls, it "feels" like you really are playing golf.  You have to concentrate on each shot, and not every shot is perfect, some are really bad, sometimes you hit it perfect...but thats how it is when you really play.   The point is, the feeling you get with the controller, is about like the feeling you would have really swinging the club, from the mental point of view.\n\nI'm not sure of the specs of the reviews I see that say the game is not optimized or runs slow.  It runs perfectly fine on my machine  and the graphics look beautiful.  Multiplayer works great also, a friend and I play together and take turns and it is quite fun.\n\nThe only cons I have is that there is no tutorial or practice area that I could find.  It would be nice if they at least had a tutorial in game describing the controls, and a driving range that you could click on and practice swings.   I think I eventually found this info on their website, but it was hard to find.   Also, a bit of advice, if you are using a controller, make sure you have an Xbox based one, not the older D based (Sony) kind.\n\nFinal verdict in a nutshell - GREAT game, very much worth it, IF you put the time in to learn it properly.","December 31, 2014","true","24.0"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Eventually they dug their feet in the ground and decided they wanted 'realism,' which completely killed my desire to play the game.

At least for me (some may disagree).\nConsequentially, I felt like I had wasted my money, which inspired this less than positive review.

The main selling point of this game for me is the GNCD, the course designer. I have spent many hours on this and once you get the hang of it, your only limited by your imagination.\nThis is a worthy successor to the EA TW series and plays a lot like it too, well if you consider that most of the people that worked on that game are the ones that developed TGC. The good thing about this game is the fact that the developers are still working on it and fixing bugs and adding stuff to it all the time, once it’s finished then this will be a solid and enjoyable title for everyone to play.\nThe only real problem with this game for me is the graphics issue if you own an AMD Radeon card, especially the newer models, but I think this is more to do with the Unity engine than anything else, as playing this game with an Nvidia card seems less problematic and appears to run better.\nAlthough this game has been developed for the PC it still very much feels like a port, as its main focus IMO is for the console market, after all that’s where the money is.\nAnyway, if you’re in any doubt about buying this game, then I would recommend you do, especially if you like golf and have been looking for a worthy successor to EA TW series. There are also more updates coming soon, and with the number of courses made by the community, then its longevity is assured. It’s not quite the golf sim this has been hailed to be, as that title I think belongs to another game currently in development.\nAnyway this is money well spent on.\n\nUpdate:\nI can't believe that this game has now been out for over 20 months, it has had a lot of fixes applied to it and it certainly has improved since its early access days. Graphics wise this game is great to look at and I can’t fault it on that front, however the gameplay is a lot easier than it used to be IMO, it’s easier to hit straighter shots and plays more like an arcade game rather than an actual golf sim, even with all the aid’s turned off. This game still suffers with issues, originally with AMD cards and then with Nvidia cards, although fixes have been applied to fix the Nvidia issues, I wish the same could be said for AMD users, anyway putting those glitches aside, this is still a great game and I would still rate this up there with the likes of EA TW series. The games real selling point for me has been and will always be the Greg Normal Course Designer and the thousands of community designed courses out there, some of course (no pun intended) better than others. And the great thing about it is that they are all free to play, let’s hope that this stays that way.\nPlayer customisation has been cranked up and the variety of shirts and trousers available to dress your player up has increased, but I would like to see more with also some community made ones thrown in too. The selection of golf clubs has not changed and I believe that this is something that could certainly be improved along with the option to hit shots with more back spin etc.\nIf your looking for a game to play against AI, then you'll be dissapointed, although you can play against the "ghost" of other players who have played the courses, whoch is better than nothing I guess.\nThis game does not have crowds, as it was only ever inteneded to be a week-end golfer type of game and not a full blown EA-TW clone as it does not have the PGA logo or backing.\nThis game has only had one DLC to date, which the community was in arms about, but IMO you don't have to buy it, it wasn't like the game was unplayable without it.\n\n@King Kyne, for a while I did feel this was a good Sim game, but then I started to play PG and somehow the gameplay in that was a lot harder and felt more realistic IMO. TGC feels a lot more arcade-ish, and since the updates, hitting the ball straight has become a lot easier. The game feels like its holding your hand and not letting you make mistakes too much, it almost feels like its restricting you. I don't associate a SIM game with something difficult, far from it, a SIM should allow you to do your own thing, it then becomes as individual as you. I have played PG for a while now, and since they introduced the horizontal swing mechanics, I personally feel that the game has improved in my estimation, not because it’s become harder, but I can now shape the flight of the ball better, if only it was that easy in real life! The reason the mechanics in PG works for me is that there is an option to create a draw or a fade, make the ball go higher or lower, but it still depends on how you “swing” the club, so it’s down to the player’s skill rather than the settings that you dial up.\nPlease don’t get me wrong TGC is a great game, but it feels like something that you could pick up straight away, while PG is something else and needs practice if you want to get better at it.\nI guess that’s my definition of a SIM, it needs to feel natural and with enough practice you start to reap the benefits for all that hard work you’ve put in.\nI play with all the aids turned off in both games, and PG still feels more realistic IMO sorry to say.","February 28, 2015","true","689.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good solid golf game, but it's certainly not perfect. Probably easiest to sum up with a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\nThe core of the game is rock solid and realistic. The feel of the swing, the look of the courses, the physics, and the action of the ball are all great.\nFantastic course editor - best I've ever seen in a golf game. You can play courses created by other palyers or generate a fresh new course with just a few clicks. You'll certainly never run out of courses to play. Very satisfying when you put in a good round because you know you earned it. :)\nSkill is not stat based. If your get better at the game it's because you've learned to play better.\nDevs are still improving the game. I've been playing since the first day of Early Access and the Devs have been communicating and responding - while still sticking to their gameplan. They haven't fixed all the quirks, but the game has seen steady improvements over the months.\nCons\nSome machines might struggle with the graphics. Seems to recquire more CPU/GPU power than you might think. Only a few graphics settings to adjust.\nThe swing controls can be hard to learn. I love the controls (I use xbox 360 controller) but some people seem to get frustrated. No option for the old 'three-click' method that is popular in other games. I think this is part of the 'level playing field' that the devs are shooting for. They have worked hard to make the competition skill-based and fair.\nThe interface is sometimes clunky. All the info and controls are there, but sometimes they are not intuitive.  Took me a long time to figure out what the two different distances on the putting green were (one is distance to the cup, and the other is the distance to your aiming marker). I still can't figure out how to properly show an instant replay. :)\nNo career mode or similar extra features. The Tiger Woods games were full of all sorts of extras and some people might expect them here. Presentation is somewhat sparse. The voicover/commenter is well done, but there is very little 'juice' or graphical embellishments to spice things up.\nFor me the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This is one of my most played games of 2014 and I expect it will be in 2015, too.","January 4, 2015","true","103.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

There is a trust factor that you hope the developer upholds.  Assetto Corsa, Planetary Annihilation, and now The Golf Club (TGC) have formed an elite level of Early Access titles.  These games exemplify building a customer-developer relationship founded on trust.  The quality that is already built into TGC has me feeling satisfied, and VERY excited for the future of the product.  I am amazed at the depth of challenge.  Right when I thought that I "got it", I played Coronaca against some ghosts, and the greens positively whipped me (not to mention the devilishly placed fairway bunkers!!).  This game has so much potential.\n\nI can't wait for tournaments!  Building in a course designer from the start was pure genius.  You have instilled a sense of value for me.  What I really want to compliment are the design decisions.  You are making really smart moves.  The ghost method of multiplayer suits me very well.  I don't have to wait for others, worry about lag/disconnects, or even if I personally run out of free time.  The swing method is awesome.  I love that it is based on the character model swinging, not some power meter.  It really makes the game a challenge and requires that I keep my head in it.  Once I start to get lazy, there goes a slice into the woods!  There are subtleties that I love too, such as you never cut off the guy doing the voice over.  Even if I quickly move through the scorecard to the next hole, he finishes what he is saying.  I like that.  It feels polished.\n\nThank you HB for getting me excited about a PC golf game again, and living up to expectations.  Job well done!  I'll happily continue to be a part of The Golf Club.","April 20, 2014","true","21.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

They opt instead to go for a meterless true motion swing that ends up being played best from a gamepad then a keyboard and mouse, if this bothers you then perhaps its not quite the golf game your looking for.\n\nI still play and enjoy the port of Golden Tee golf on the PC and for years there was no real suitable replacement and while there is no "replacement" for GTgolf, I do find this game just as enjoyable but for some very different reasons. The Golf Club comes into its own for the way it deals with sloping surfaces and also implements probrably the greatest putting grid known to man. It also happens to have some great 2015 graphics and where it lacks in flair it more then makes up for it with a very solid golf simulation.\n\nWhile it drops the ball in adding some excitement via sound effects and lacks more engaging commentary, it says nothing about the simulation beneath it, which is crisp.

Now there are basically The Golf Club and WGT. And between the two, I'll take The Golf Club any day.\n\nThe graphics are good - I won't say GREAT - and the sounds/speech is good (although the commentator gets a bit annoying after a bit). Mechanics are solid, certainly better than the ridiculous 2 click meter used in WGT. If you like real swing method using your mouse, rather than clicking on a meter, TGC is for you. It doesn't quite rise to the level of the swing meter on Tiger Woods - which I consider to be the best golf game ever - but it's not too far off. All in all, you can play 18 (or 9) holes and have a darned enjoyable time; for true golf enthusiasts, this is probably as close to the real thing as you can get without lugging your clubs out to the local links.\n\nA few negatives: the match-making. NOT easy to jump into a multi-player game against real people. The menus are not very easy to navigate, despite their initial appearance with large labelled icons. You have to click and click and click to find a course to play, set up the paramaters and match type and difficulty, then when trying to find opponents to play TGC will automatically locate "players" and fill your roster to the number you have selected (2, 3, 4, etc). The only problem - no guarantee you will actually get REAL players. Once the round starts, most of the time you find yourself playing "Ghosts" of the actual players. I.e., they are not logged in, but TGC selected them based on their skill levels, rating on the course you are playing, etc - and popped their "ghosts" into the game with you. Huh??? So, 8 times out of 10, you will find yourself playing against basically 2 or 3 other computer AI players. Needless to say, not a very social occasion. Try chatting with them. The ONLY way you can play against other REAL live people is if you manually select someone you have "Friended" and who you KNOW is in the game. If they aren't in the game, and you locate them by UserName, you will just get their "ghost" again. You CANNOT just randomly play games against other live players. This is one of the biggest faults in this game to me.\n\nI do find the game fun, but there is .... something... missing. Hard to put a finger on it. Individually, all the components of a great golf game are there. But put together, it falls a bit short, and I wish I could describe specifically what that is.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it IS hard to get below par (and I've played a ton of golf games for a lot of years, and consider myself pretty darn good). Putting especially is a pain in the butt. There is NO power meter. On ANY swing. So you have no real idea how hard you are swinging.  There is NO swing meter, so you have NO idea how far your backswing is. There are NO bars period. You just totally wing it. Most of the time just pulling all the way back on the mouse for a full swing works, but what about that sand wedge just off the green? It says it is 40 ft from the pin, and your wedge has a maximum distance of 50 ft, so you don't want to do a full swing - but how do you judge what the right backswing is? 80%, you think? OK - so how do you swing the club back around 80%? No meter=no way of knowing how far back you are swinging your club. Again - you just wing it, and 9 times out of 10 you will wind up doing a full swing even though you didn't want to. Or you overcompensate, and wind up doing a little 20% chip that sends the ball 2 feet. VERY annoying. I read all of the other reviews saying they LOVE this aspect, but they are "purists" who think that any kind of power or swing meter is "cheating." Whatever. If I want that level of realism, I'll go play real golf at the local course. For a game - I want at least some idea of how hard I am "swinging" my "club."\n\nAll in all, I give this a thumbs-up, but to be honest I have stopped playing it very much due to the swing mechanics described above. If they ever add a power/backswing meter, and if they make it so you can actually play REAL LIVE people randomly -  I will be reinvigorated to play, guarantee it. In the meantime, if you love golf and virtual golf games, you will definitely enjoy this game, even though it may not rise to the top of your "Favorite golf game" list.","November 21, 2015","true","958.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

I can't speak for whether or not it will satisfy hardcore fans, because I'm not one.\n\nSo, I've been looking for a good PC golf game for a while. I'm not a golfer in real life, nor am I a particularly hardcore fan of the genre. I just played Tiger Woods '06/'07 on X-Box 360 a while ago, thought they were fun, and have been looking for something similar. I stayed away from The Golf Club while it was in Early Access because, well, I don't do Early Access. And I kinda forgot about it for a while.\n\nA few days ago, Jack Nicklaus' Perfect Golf came out, and I thought "Hey, maybe this will be my cup of tea!"\n\nI honestly can't even tell you if it's my cup of tea or not, because Perfect Golf's UI/UX is absolutely atrocious. After 20 frustrating minutes of fighting against the game just to try and learn the basics, I uninstalled it and got a refund. Maybe there is a good golf game in there, I don't know, but I should not have to untangle a convoluted mess just to understand the basics of the game.\n\nThen I saw the Golf Club was out of Early Access, and I grabbed it.\n\nWithin THREE MINUTES, I had a handle on the game.\n\nNow again, I'm not a hardcore golf guy, so maybe there's a bunch of depth to this game that I'm missing. There probably is. I can't tell you the difference between a chip and a pitch, and I can't remember which side is draw and which side is fade, and I've never adjusted the point of impact on the ball. All of that stuff exists in The Golf Club, so I assume I still have a long way to go to mastering it. But unlike Perfect Golf, the basics here are simple and intuitive. Everything about the controls, the menus, the UI/UX experience, makes sense. If you put a controller in my hand and tell me to play a game I've never played before, and I've got the basics down in three minutes?

The gameplay,   and the course creator will keep this game growing for years to come.   There are some incredible course designers that put courses out on a daily basis so the replay value here is crazy good.    The devs are quick to fix things and add new features but they're a small team so you have to be patient.     The game has grown leaps and bounds within the last year and it's light years better than some of the current competiton in my opinion.\n\nA few cons is that they really need to work on the social aspect of the game so that it's easier to find multiplayer games.  They are lacking typical gamemodes that you expect to see and they don't and will never have a conventional lobby.   They basically just have you send an invite to a friend to join you a the course but only half the time it works.  You are constantly having to kick your friend from the game and re add him to just see him play.    Like I said,  it's still the best game I've played but the multi player taking a backseat to some of the other features has always left me scratching my head..\n\nThe course creator is revolutionairy,  it's just flat out amazing.   This game appeals more to the guy that wants a relaxing real round of golf without all the EA sports glitz and glamour.   This game can be played with a controller,  PS4 is what I use..  I own the game on my ps4 and PC,  and I get all the updates on my PC as soon as they're ready which is awesome.  Honestly though,  the game plays just as well on the ps4.  It seems to me that they've taken lots of time to optizimze it for the consoles and I can certainly undertand why considering that is the majority of their audience.\n\nI give this game maximum stars, even with it's issues...   Also,  if you play the a course insipred by the "Delta Theme"   I was the guy that named that theme!!!  I won a "name that theme"  competition and the boys from HBS sent me some cool swagg for my winning submission.\n\nOne of the big fish up at the golf club name is Anthony Kyne,  and he is a very likable chap,  who does live streams often where he takes questions from us mere mortals...

I wish I could get my money back for this turd but Im sure thats about as likely and hitting a hole in one.","October 12, 2014","false","10.1"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","30","49","3","0"

Been playing it for a while in early access and have enjoyed it immensely.  Now that the game's out, I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, the mechanics of the swing (I play with an xbox controller) are good and the way the ball reacts to the environment is very good.  However, something about it just seems rushed and unfinished.  I'll get hours upon hours of enjoyment out of it and hopefully it gets improved down the line because it's a good game, with the chance to be great.

What really brings out the glory of this title is the Greg Norman Course Design feature.  Creating your own courses is quite enjoyable.  Whether its for yourself with a local track, or its for the masses as a famous track or just something strait from your imagination.\n\nThe GNCD offers many different themes to choose from when starting out your course, and they keep adding new themes in on a regular basis, along with sew tools and "stuff" to use while creating your magic.  The good news here is,  the themes just keep getting better and better than the last, it seems the dev team is really taking note on the feedback from the community on what people want and like.\n\nOverall, I have been playing since day 1 of open beta, and after 1500 hours of game play time, I still enjoy and look forward to playing TGC.

While I realize this game is advertised as a sim, I wasn't under the understanding that sim implied 0 degree of consistency over the controls. This game seems to be optimized to use a controller as opposed to the standard keyboard mouse input of a typical golf game (non-sim) which is fine, but I think this game could do well to have some gauge that could be toggled on or off to show you at least somewhere in the ballpark of how hard you're hitting.\n\n"We’ve created and fine tuned a swing mechanic that is more about feeling and fluidity above the users’ accuracy of hitting a marker on a power bar. Whilst anyone will be able to pick the controller up and play comfortably, the best players on the global leaderboards will be those with the best feel for the different golf shots and who are able to take into account ball lie, weather and terrain conditions."\n\nI find the above to be utter garbage. The mechanic relies in NO way on feeling or fluidity, but instead an attempt to make visual placeholders of where a club is to indicate how powerful you're going to hit the ball. I also highly doubt most people will be abl to "pick the controller up and play comfortably." I only wish I hadn't believed their sales pitch, because it's anything but accurate. I can only hope it changes in the future, but I kind of doubt it, as the mechanic is already in place.\n\nI find the only way to fine tune your shot is to adjust the loft, which seems silly when normally one would simply hit the ball with less oomph. In short, the controls for this game, while refreshing and new, are in massive need of improvement/options. Had I known ahead of time what the controls were like, I very simply would've kept my $35. The big caveat to Steam is that there are no refunds, and now I'm out money for a game I likely will not play in the future.\n\nThat said, the game itself is beautiful, and the audio is crisp, if not a bit repetetive (the actual sounds you hear on the course ie.) your ball hitting the ground, seem to be one and the same.) making it a very aesthetically appealing experience. Unfortunately I'm a firm believer that gameplay > aesthetics.","May 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","34","58","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaveMentman/recommended/269730/","PaveMentman","Pave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaveMentman/","3037 products in account","Alright, since the game currently is more closer to "complete"-golf-game nowadays, I suppose it's finally a time to give an overview on this title.\n\nFirst of, what "The Golf Club" is:\n- "Bare-bones "just golf""-game with emphasis on simulation.\n\nWhat "The Golf Club" is not:\n- "Arcade-like"-golf game with "Career"-modes to become stronger, more "bling", or anything else similar: It's "Just-golf".\n\nI personally have nicknamed this game as "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online "without gorilla-suit" and with perma-TrueSwing-mode"; not much else to comment about that aside that both games are / were quite well built into Unity3D-engine.\n((Those who are interested though, the "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 - Masters" is quite similar both the UI and the golf-play-wise, minus of course the (identical) "Greens Fee" and other things that were in "PGA Tour Online."))\n\nIn other words for the most part your avatar customization is mainly limited to "etique"-abiding outfits.\nAnd your golf-equipments are standardized performance-wise, meaning that there are no "power-golf-clubs". There might be more "style-suiting" equipment-options available in future (E.G slightly more wider+lighter-clubs to allow pitching from tougher spots with less "carry" due lessened-weight), but that's just one personal wishful-thinking.\n\n((Fair to mention that I personally mainly play with the least amount of "assistance-UI" as possible (green-grid, shot-direction-reticle, wind-indicator, and such), to which I base my overview on))\n\nAs hinted earlier, the players are also limited to "semi-TrueSwing" system, since it's by design that there is no "traditional 3-click-system" in-game to emphasis on more "feeling"-gameplay instead of being cold-hard-mechanical.\nUnfortunately at the moment, there is no "dry-hitting" so playing by just "the feel" alone isn't necessarily working for the favor of the players.\nAnd since the "hitting-indicator" isn't currently working exactly in real-time either (it appears only after the hit is done), the game turns unfortunately into quite fiddly "percentage"-game because players are semi-forced to number-crunch with the "lofts" of their clubs if they want to make more accurate shots. So in the end the hitting-game (currently) is mainly limited to adjusting the loft of the clubs and hitting with max-power, since for the most part the "fine-tune-club-action" seen in various other "TrueSwing"-game is quite non-existent.\n\nPoint being, the swing+putting-system could be better since it's currently heavily dependant on "power" only (indicated by how "back" you "Pull" the clubs). But it suffices, somewhat.\n\n\nAs for the courses (of the amount which in theory are infinite), I personally can only give a / some warning(s): Given that the major-amount of the courses are done by "everyday-non-pro"-players, there are going to large amount of courses not following the "official" (real-life) recommendations; This is very important thing to remember, especially if you're into regular tournament participations.\n\n- Especially before the "Out-of-Bounds" (or "O.B")-system was implemented in, there is large amount of "Trap-courses", meaning that if you are very unfortunate to hit your ball into one of the "trap-valleys", you're going to be guaranteed end-up getting that "+9" (or any other "max-hit"-amount set).\n\n- Since the game doesn't yet support the "cup-place-randomization", you're going to end seeing a huge amount of these placed in the middle of "spiral-macaroni"-greens.\nWhat I am trying to say is the a quite a little amount of course-designers follow the following recommendation: "A player putting from above the hole should be able to stop the ball near the hole." Okay, that is just one part of the whole thing....\nFor those who are interested for more info, here are few links:\nhttp://www.barryrhodes.com/2011/11/position-of-hole-on-putting-green.html\nhttp://www.randa.org/en/Rules-and-Amateur-Status/Guidance-on-Running-a-Competition.aspx?chapter=4&section=2\n\n\nIn overall, "The Golf Club" is a nice change in the golf-game scenery in which you can simply jump-in and jump-out freely without need of worrying whether your have enough good "gear" or otherwise "stats" to simply play both by yourself and competing with other players.\nThe issues mentioned above aside, the gameplay itself is pretty solid.\nAnd this game  isn't all that power-demanding alongside the game itself is being quite stable (at least on my quite low-spec-computer).\n\nOn a extra note, the game also features a quite extensive API for those people who'd like to make more organized leagues and similar organizations.\nThis allows websites such as tgctours.com to have more accurate data on the players themselves.\n\n\nWho knows though what the developers will eventually bring to this game; the possibilities are almost unlimited!","July 22, 2015","true","136.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

And to be honest most of them become boring because they are way to easy to master. The golf club however always seems to have a new challenge up its sleeve.\n\nI have read many reviews slamming the inconsistency of playing with your mouse. My experience is that yes it is challenging but fair. I have played and struggled but learned with each round (Pro Tip, get yourself a proper mouse and a good gaming mouse pad I recommend a Gamdias Pad). Through practice and practice you can achieve amazing things and compete without a gamepad or building a swing rail(cheating in my opinion.). Now my in game handicap is at +9 and getting better(Just shot a 55 at Flathead).\n\nYou would think that if you played off a +9 you have mastered the game, but you would be mistaken. In elite tournaments playing on your handicap will only just get you in the top 50. Its all about the quest we as golfers share but never attain...Perfection.\n\nThe quest to be the best and the opportunity to really compete with thousands of other golfers is what makes the golfers club an amazing golf game.\n\nNow to the game play. Is it perfect? No, there are problems, especially regarding the rules. With rules I refer to the lack of dropping in the game when you are unfortunate enough to land in a water hazard of end up in an unplayable lie. Most times the re-hit option is enforced only on a rare occasion does the game will drop for you. As for the unplayeble situation, it play it as it lies(or restart ;-) ) There is no custom drop option which is annoying.(They have rectified the droping problem with the last update!04/05/2015)\n\nHow do you become good? Swinging straight is only 10pecent of the battle. You really have to think about you shot: Club selection, Shot Type, Height, Shape and the most important part of all, where do you want to hit the next shot from. Especially when it comes to where you what to putt from. Speed and rythm of your swing is also very important. Don't think a fast back and through will do it or get you more distance.\n\nThe Golf Club is an Awsome golf game and I feel it is one of my best purchases on steam to date. I can't wait for the Seasons DLC to come out. No problem with buying it as a add on. I feel I have gotten more that my moneys worth so far.\n\nHighly recommended!!!!! You get out what you put in just like in real life golf!","April 27, 2015","true","185.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/recommended/269730/","PhearMark","The Angry Hamster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/","329 products in account","The Golf Club is a great idea. Place a golf sim game on the PC platform when other developers refuse to and give it a course creator. What could possibly go wrong with such a strong idea? Many things.\n\nFirst and foremost this game does not run well. Even on powerful machines you will innevitably find yourself playing on Medium or lower settings just to get a decent and constant framerate. This is something that can be overlooked by many but still needs to be stated as it is important.\n\nBall striking is solid and good until you get close to the green. Due to the minimal control you have over shot distance anything other than a full 100% shot into the green is unlikely to land anywhere near where you intend it to. Putting is also a widely varying affair where getting correct distances is nearly impossible.\n\nThe course creator is one of the shining positives in The Golf Club. It has enough functionality and customization to allow for a large variety of course types and difficulties. However, more recent updates had altered some of the terrain functionality making it difficult to create smoothed surfaces with large scale changes. Still, the course creator is definitely a strong point.\n\nThe largest issue with this game currently is the seeming abandonment of the PC Platform. With their release on PS4 and XBox One, HB Studios have given continuous updates to both of the console platforms, yet have not updated the PC release with any of that content for 2 months as of this writing. ('Release was on October 8th, currently December 15th) This is the most diseheartening thing HB could have done. The console versions now have more HB created cources, 2 more course creator themes, and more bug fixes than the PC version.\n\nWith this last point in mind, I cannot recommend this game. It is a wonderful idea with a nice course creator that seems to have been abandoned before it could be made into something great. If you really want a golf game on the PC platform and have no other options then pick this up when it is on sale for 50% off or more, otherwise just steer clear. If they ever come back and give the PC platform some love, it may be worth the asking price, but as it stands it is not.\n\nEdit: As of 12/19/2014 the PC and console versions are finally on the same patch. Going forward it is difficult to tell if they will become split so disparately as before but this does not change the core idea that it is better to wait for a sale for this game than to buy it at full price.","December 15, 2014","false","121.4"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","29","49","0","2"

This game looks amazing... when the graphics decide to function correctly.  At random times they will glitch causing anything from horrific mutilations of the course, to blinding you, to preventing critical info like wind speeds and pin distance to show.

It's a game that you're going to struggle with at first, but as you keep playing and practicing, you will get much better.  There are no special power-ups, pants, or hats, just an equal playing field where the individuals that are the most skilled, shine.\n\nThe creator is accessible to everyone.  You can have it design the course for you and automatically generate a course based on some random parameters you enter.  Or you can start with a blank slate, place the 1st tee and green wherever you want and draw the fairway in between and then plant the bunkers.\n\nThe creator may seem daunting to some and they may find themselves intimidated by all the features and controls.  But there is an incredibly active community on the game website's forum http://www.hb-studios.com/forum/index.php#c7, and a well built community focused on competitive tournaments that are cross platform http://tgctours.com/\n\nBest parts about this game is that it's constantly upgrading and improving.

Courses are very good, plus the added fact that the in game Course Designer, is very simple to use, so you can design Courses with ease, you don't have to be an expert to do this.

The scenery looks very nice and the basics of the game are easy for pick up and play; however the hardest courses can be a tough challenge for any experienced player. This game also has, in my opinion, one of the best level designers I have seen in any game (it can be a bit wonky at times but after 1 or 2 courses you can easily put together a unique custom course in a couple of hours, or just randomly generate a course in a matter of minutes)\n\nThe main complaint I see if that the game is not complete, which is true. However every big patch the developers release is exceptionally solid, although maybe a bit slow they release meaningful and necessary content every time.","May 23, 2015","true","129.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's a great looking game, and difficult without being frustratingly so. In fact, I only bought the game earlier today and I've already spent about six hours playing it, which in itself should indicate how much I've been enjoying it.\n\nSo far, I think the only negative thing I'd really have to say about the game is that the customization is pretty lacking. That is to say, relating to the amount of choice in cloths and accessories available to outfit the player. The course designer on the other hand looks pretty amazing.\n\nAnyway, I'm not one to ramble on so I'll cut this short. Suffice it to say if you're looking for a quality game of golf on WIndows look no further. I'm really pleased I decided to pick this up today.","May 4, 2015","true","9.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's so realistic. No arcade elements make this game as close to a real golfing as possible. I have no idea why this game has "Mixed" reviews. Maybe it's the fact that there's no meters or gauges, so it's a little harder to make perfect shots. But it's possible. And once you master the shots and putting, it's awesome game...

The course generator needs to add a backdrop for tropical courses.. also to be able to click on the hole listing to the right when you want to edit a hole rather than going to overview of the course looking for the hole and , well you know the deal.. some things could be a bit easier for designing.  BUT I am having fun creating courses. and also playing  the game itself.. I suck.. but then I sucked in real life golf as well.

The graphics are excellent on my laptop (i7 2.4, Geforce GT740 and 16g Ram) - smooth scrolling and sharp, clear detail. I found a controller the easiest / best way to play the game.\n\nIn my opinion, the game does not need a career mode as suggested by some players. Yes, it can be repetative, but so is the actual game of golf. There are currently in excess of 50,000 user created courses, some better than others. You can create your own course in five minutes if you like, or spend hours adjusting pretty much any aspect of each hole. Having access to user created courses, competitions and tours adds an extra dimension to The Golf Club that I have not come across in other golf games. I have no problem with the wind and find this fairly accurate, along with 'clubbing up or down' depending on the height of the green\n\nThe introduction of the Handicap system means you can continually try to lower your handicap on the handicap rated courses or simply play as many different courses as you want.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is a layout map of a course (like you get on the back of a scorecard) before I select to play it. Some more courses from the developers would also be good.........\n\nOverall, the best golf game by far - no gimicks, just as much golf as you want. I can see why some may not like this game because of it's simplicity - if that is the case, get yourself an old copy of Tiger Woods :-)","March 8, 2015","true","554.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"
