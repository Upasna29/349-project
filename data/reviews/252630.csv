I know I do!  But if you're like me, it's a private pleasure and no one must know.  So you creep out at night, ducking behind cover, keeping low to the ground, slowly rotating your irregular bit of rock (sedimentary perhaps), finding the grip to put the perfect english on it, listening for the hop-hop sounds of the fish-man as you slowly peak out, glancing briefly to see that his dopey face is turned away revealing his moist, tender cranium...\n\nWhat was I talking about?  Oh, yeah, Eldritch.  It's pretty good.\n\nNo, scratch that, Eldritch is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ miracle.  Procedural generation and permadeath, the marks of the roguelike genre are two things that used to send me running like I'm trying to outrun my fat, juicy friend, who is also trying to outrun some squamous monster from the primordial deep.  But somehow the dark wizards behind Eldritch managed to create the perfect combination of play to reach all the way deep into this previously forbidden zone of mine.  Well, that got weird.\n\nAnyway, what does Eldritch do so right?  Well, it allows you to move in the least efficient way possible!  Crouching low to the ground to move slow and silent, sliding from a run, peeking around corners while still counting as being behind the corner, jumping and pulling yourself onto ledges you can't quite clear (i.e. mantling).  Those up on their gaming history might recognize these as the controls for the early Thief games and any game that has them and implements them correctly gives me a stiffy.\n\nNext, the game traps you in a nightmarish loop from which you can never escape... something, something, profit?  When you die, resurrecting is only a click away, ensuring that you can get right back into the fray armed with new knowledge that may save your dumb ♥♥♥ next time.  The game also takes a bit of the edge off the permadeath by allowing you to store artifacts (the game's currency and fuel for your magic) in banks that will carry over if you die.\n\nAnd the in-game map is brilliant.  Really?  I'm trying to sell you a game based on its in-game map?  Yes, I am bloody-well trying to sell you a game based on an in-game map!  The procedural generation works nicely, never feeling like you're being led nowhere.  Every square on the map has something to reward your exploration and the map I just touted comunicates it to you brilliantly.  The map doesn't show you fine details, but simply breaks the dungeon into a leveled grid, marking off which squares you've been to and if they contain a major feature.  You couldn't ask for a better companion in seeking out forbidden items spewing particle effects for you to get your sticky human hands on.\n\nFinally, the main game is just the right length.  Doing a patient stealthy run, you can easily finish in about three/four hours.  You'll definitely feel incentive to be careful once you make progress, but every death will make you feel like you're one more corpse in the pile you can climb to victory rather than feeling like you've just graduated college only to light yourself on fire.\n\nAnd that's just the main game.  Eldritch also includes two complete scenarios that lesser games would call DLC and charge you for.  One simulates a cocaine and dynamite fueled rampage through an asylum to bust souls out of the walls and escape to safety before a cosmic horror chases you down and eats you.  This mode will teach you that berserker raging your way through your problems is a perfectly valid solution in Eldritch, even if the stealth is so strong you just want to smear tanning butter on its pecs.  Also included is a long endurance dungeon to test your stealth skills with tough foes, few resources, and no trips back to safety for a breather like are found periodically in the main game.\n\nAs for the overall aesthetic and treatment of HP Lovecraft's work?  This game was made with love.  Love for unfathomable abominations from beyond the stars that just want to dissect your brain and stick it in a jar.  As Lovecraft fans know, old Howard P. spent a lot of time dealing with the intangibles of cosmic horror where terror comes from not being able to percieve or understand vast entities to which you are little more than the dirt beneath their heels.  He also wrote schlocky adventure stories about explorers fighting monsters and zombies and ♥♥♥♥.  Eldritch pulls off the balance nicely.\n\nMost of the enemies you face will be out of Lovecraft's more tangible gallery, but even with the Minecrafty graphics and squishy fish-men, the indestructible monsters like the Shoggoth and Yog Sothoth feel amorphous and dangerous.  You won't spend too long looking at them because you'll be running the ♥♥♥♥ away.  The bigger "cosmic" side is represented in the minimal story told only at the beginning and end with text boxes.  You can't represent that sort of thing visually and Eldritch knows well enough not to try, but rest assured it's there and you will confront it along with your seeming immortality.  And on the note of knowing what you can't do visually, Eldritch makes up for it with it's awesome sound design.  The Minecraft look might be a little too goofy to be horrifying, but damn if the sounds don't manage to freak my ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nThere are few indie games that I think are worth their normal asking price.  I'll admit, I got this game on sale for five bucks and won't blame you if you do the same.  But after having played it thoroughly, fifteen may well have been fair.  Though as a fan of Thief and HP Lovecraft, it's almost like this was tailor-made for me.  Bottom line: if you like stealth games, get Eldritch; if you like HP Lovecraft, get Eldritch; if you're really into roguelikes, I have no idea.  Maybe this is too soft for a dedicated fan of roguelikes, but if nothing else it might be the gateway drug for somebody (me) who is put off by them.","February 10, 2015","true","24.6"," 134 of 138 people (97%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","97","134","138","77","0"

I hoarded coins, I explored every nook, and I took in every giant texel of the environment. I dealt with the enemies carefully, and triumphantly beat the first stage. I was in love.\n\nThen I died and respawned. At that point, I realized that the elements I'd loved so much were not appealing upon replay. I understood how the monsters operated, I knew what the sound cues meant, I had figured out how many bullets I needed, and how far away from monsters I could be before they noticed me. I'd "gotten" the game in under half an hour of gameplay, and afterwards the whole veneer of tension and horror fell away, revealing a game that's still tough and can be fun, but has none of the thrill that I experienced before I could predict its every move.\n\nWorse, the enemies have no apparent otherworldliness other than their appearance. When I think of horrifying things, I imagine creatures or forces which aren't predictable. These threats are very predictable - they don't vanish around corners, they don't change the environment without your consent, they don't even do much with their wandering/patrolling routes. To make this game effective, it needs to keep you from fully understanding the enemy - but it doesn't. It's  the same one-track-minded stateful AI that's plagued games for 20+ years. Even the more interesting enemies (like the statue) follow very strict rules. The game falls into the tedium being too predictable, and offering punishments to the player for not predicting it - when this could have been a game that broke the mold.\n\nThe game is also not well served by being permadeath. Permadeath only works when you give the player some reason to replay. Maybe you let them play different classes, or pick different abilities, or try out new unlocks they got last playthrough, give them a new goal to chase, or even just give them a persistent gold storage that they can buy useful items from. This game doesn't do any of that. The store is limp and useless, and a replay just feels like rehashing what you've already accomplished - rather than picking up again with determination.\n\nUltimately the game is competently made, it has good generation, some fun textures, a neat premise, and a good opening. It's technologically solid and ticks all the boxes for a good game. But the gameplay melts in your hands - the longer you examine it, the less solid the it feels.","September 28, 2014","false","3.9"," 366 of 457 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","366","457","10","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lauram/recommended/252630/","lauram","Facewizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lauram/","575 products in account","Eldritch is a lightweight but fun action-roguelike with a Lovecraftian theme.\n\nEldritch is a roguelike, but it's a surprisingly easy one-- I finished the game for the first time after only about 7 or 8 total hours of play. Certain strategies make completion much easier, and the most difficult level out of the four is the second one. Since you can take the levels on in whatever order you like, you can optimize your playthrough to make beating the second level easier. If you're used to recent commerical roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac, The Dungeons of Dredmor, and others, Eldritch may seem very lightweight, very easy, and kind of simplistic. The bizarre difficulty curve-- with the second level being so much harder than even the secret fourth level-- may also be a bit of a disappointment.\n\nNevertheless, it's fun, well-made, and a good way to entertain yourself for 8 hours or less. The simple art is charming in its own way, and exploring to find your favorite strategies and item synergies is certainly entertaining.","November 25, 2013","true","20.1"," 85 of 98 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","85","98","0","0"

Going into Eldritch, I lost hope almost immediately. A combination of mediocre voxel environments, cartoonish bad guys, goofy sound effects, and stab-happy gameplay just didn't really jive with the whole Lovecraftian aesthetic it claimed to be rocking. Thirty minutes in I'd realized I'd come across pretty much every item I was going to see. An hour in and I'd conquered the first world, having at no time felt threatened by anything I faced. I entered world 2 for a few minutes, finding more of the same. Apart from my grudging admiration for the simple-yet-effective 3D minimap the game uses, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing here worth playing any further for. Bored and angry, I set the game aside for a while, wondering why anyone would publish so straightforward and sloppy a first-person shooter and decide to slap a Lovecraft theme on it.\n\nComing back to it on a whim, I re-entered world 2 and dug a little deeper. Suddenly, things were different. The difficulty spiked up nicely, adding opponents that required actual strategy, that I couldn't just flail wildly at and never worry about again, that left me feeling more than a little nervous. And then I died, though I'm not exactly sure how. I rushed back in, suddenly stripped of all my magic armaments and life boosts, and last less than half as long. Eventually, I figured out what's going on, learned how to dodge the traps, realized that stealth and discretion are actually necessary to survive, and on I went to a fun, twitchy, jumpy run through the rest of this Eternal Darkness / Spelunky / Minecraft hybrid. It's not terribly deep; as I said earlier, you find the vast majority of the items you'll ever see in level 1, and while the monsters do evolve over time, there's not a huge amount of variety here. Oftentimes, new monsters will simply be beefier and shoot faster, but there's enough weirdness thrown in to keep the game fresh. Also, be aware that this is in fact a roguelike. Dying sets you back to the start with just short of all your progress erased, but thankfully this is a game which rewards knowledge every bit as much as it does lots of ammo and a pair of stealth boots.\n\nDon't go into this expecting any kind of dignified cosmic horror experience. It's sloppy, it's fun, and it's got some nice retro vibes to it hearkening back to the first person shooters of yore. If you're not sure if Eldritch is going to be for you, gauge your reaction to the phrase, "Cthulhu vs. the Ninja Assassin." If that mental image doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you off, well hey, here's your chance to see it in action.","December 3, 2013","true","8.3"," 76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","76","86","0","0"

But as I discovered that it was a rogue-like in a Lovecraftian setting, my interest was piqued.\n\nI've played and beaten the game--a few times. Aspects of it were frustrating for me, as it seems it has been for most people. But I enjoy the gameplay. You are rewarded for whatever actions you take. Rush through a level? You are rewarded with progression. Rely upon stealth? You are rewarded with safety. Spend a lot of time searching around? You are rewarded with tons of resources and powers that can aid you in a time of need. Manage your resources properly? You can save a little bit for your next run, and you can easily progress and bypass challenges. This game rewards your playing style, no matter what it is. There is more than one way to progress.\n\nThis game, in truth, doesn't have a lot to do with Lovecraft. It is more of a back-drop for the gameplay. If you are looking for a real Lovecraftian experience, it might be best to pass up on this game. But if you're looking for a fun experience with a spice of something familiar, it's always nice to run screaming from a shoggoth who seems to follow you everywhere.","October 5, 2014","true","28.6"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","63","71","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/252630/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","The last few years have seen a huge influx of Roguelikes, games that feature permadeath and heavily randomized elements. Roguelike FPSes are few and far between, so finding a good one is a rare treat. Eldritch is just that, inspired by the works of Lovecraft and pitting you against dungeons of lurking horrors. It started out solid and has only grown moreso over time, thanks to the continuing efforts of its single developer.\n\nEldritch plops you into a mysterious library full of books that spirit you away to unearthly dungeons. The main game is three books linking to dungeons holding the souls of elder gods. Once you find the soul in one dungeon, the book to the next opens up. Each dungeon is three areas with three floors each, split into randomized chunks and scattered with items and enemies. You'll find artifacts that work as both currency and spellcasting reagents, weapons like knives and guns and dynamite, equippable gear that gives you very useful abilities, and altars that teach you new spells. These tools will help you navigate the floors and deal with the host of unsavory types trying to stop you from claiming the souls.\n\nDespite the cosmic horror backdrop, Eldritch works best as an action game. The movement of your character is reminiscent of older games like Quake, letting you slide around at inhuman speeds. The enemies are a mixed bag, with some like the frogmen and cultists being little more than cannon fodder. You will encounter others like relentless, all-consuming shoggoths and tall creatures that cannot be killed that will complicate your travels and send shivers up your spine. Each book has a clever cross-section of foes that form a confounding package and demand stealth and caution. Some can be frustrating before you learn how to deal with them, but the challenge is well-balanced.\n\nThe enemies are the real source of fear and tension in the game, despite their cartoony appearance. A lot of games have tried to ape the look and feel of Minecraft, but Eldritch pulls it off well, imparting the same dread that skeletons and creepers do in tight spaces. The block grid nature of the levels can help you space your jumps and keep your bearings, and there are even tools for breaking through walls and creating new blocks. The sound design is minimal, and while a few of the ambient enemy noises don't work you will learn to dread those of the more troublesome foes.\n\nIn addition to the three main dungeons, there's an extended ice-themed dungeon based on At the Mountains of Madness, and a timed score-attack mode set in a hellish asylum. The developer added both of these post-launch, and continued to re-tune the game to great effect. I played Eldritch back when it launched and it is an even better game now, with more threatening enemies and better balance. As a Roguelike, an FPS, and even a horror game, I can earnestly recommend this one.","September 14, 2015","true","2.5"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","47","50","2","0"

I'm particularly fond of good gameplay and Eldritch definitely delivers. It has character. It has atmosphere. It has giant tentacle blobs that phase through openings and chase you down until you're crying for more bullets!\n\nOn the surface it may appear rather dullishly action packed repetitive nonsense, but the simplicity and attention to detail is what makes titles like Eldritch so awesome. There's a high degree of insanity to be had in a hundred different scenarios if you are willing to reach into your creative coffers and pull out a magic rabbit.\n\nThere are times when you've out-maneuvered and out-brained a few dozen baddies and start wondering where the challenge lies only to slip on a broken tile and be man handled by a couple of living statues that certainly have nothing but sinister intentions.\n\nYou ressurect and steel yourself for another run only to realize it's even MORE difficult in deprivation of your gadgets and fancy schwahza (Props if you get the reference). How to continue but change your playstyle to suit your capabilities?\n\nBy challenging you to use your smarts in one wickedly strange environment that increases in difficulty you get a definite "edge of your seat" feeling at almost every moment.\n\nHighly captivating in almost every way, I just can't help but feeling like I want more. Give it a larger and more persistent map, as well as multiplayer with even more scaled difficulty and a bunch of new mobs/items/spells and Eldritch would be one of the most amazing titles ever as far as I'm concerned.\n\nWithout a doubt, highly unique and worth every penny either way.","April 20, 2014","true","13.5"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","60","72","0","3"

Quite interesting for its simplicity with a good amount of replay value.  Difficulty provides a constant sense of tension, but I feel it's far from unfair or impossible.  Very easy to drop in and drop out, making it very accessible at all points of the game, and makes it available for short spurts of attention - not something you have to dedicate to.  Graphics might be simple, but I do think they're appropriate, and far from truly "minecrafty".  Length of the game itself is very highly dependant on your skill, tactics, luck, and level of exploration and curiosity, but it isn't very long, relatively speaking.\n\nYou get a lot of freedom over your tactics and approach, what with destructible blocks, a stealth system, and a small variety of tools that all serve their own unique purpose.

I like the way the game presents no clear-cut solution to the problems the Lovecraftian Theme Park makes you suffer through, but at the same time it's easy to collect a bunch of upgrades and turn the game into The Adventures of Catherine McGunhaver, Kicker of Cthulhu Faces. It's pretty easy to win (so I've been told, I can't quite grab all the orbs in one life which is pretty much grounds for invalidating my video game cred), so you may end up coasting through the game with your abilities, kicking Cthulhu Faces and listening to the ghost of H.P. Lovecraft scream in anguish as you put bullets through his life's work.\n\nBut at the same time, I can't help but feel this game's a bit insubstantial. The developers have been pretty good at releasing new content (see: The Mountains of Madness and the recent Asylum updates), but I've felt like I've seen everything three hours in. Worlds are limited to three levels with orbs to find at the end to unlock the final level or whatever, and I think you have to get them all without dying.

The way you get these keys are by reading three glowing books in the main part of the room, once you read one of these books (you have to start with one specific book then continue to harder books) it drops you streight into a dungeon, this is where the main part of the game begins. from here on you have to scavange  the place for weapons such as knifes, pistols, even trip wires. and with these you will be able to, obviously, kill the enemys. as you will find out, no-one will beat this on their first try its just way too hard, you will need to learn how to mix stealth AND combat to be able to beat it. this is all im going to say about its description as i do not want to spoil anything (else)\n\nNow i will say the pros and cons to the game as un-biasly as possible.\n\n-Pros-\n+The game is easy to run - this is a big one, who likes a game thats laggy? i dont, thats for sure. and this is especially good if you have a simple laptop like mine which cant handly the power savvy games of today.\n+The game is aesthetically pleasing -  the game looks nice, pixel games are pixel games but the way  this game puts them toghether with all of its shapes and colors just seems 'right'\n+The game is fairly unique - i havnt seen a game much like this before and definatly not one with the same mechanics.\n+The game has a sweet and sour feeling - when i first started the game, it scared me...alot just enough to make me lose out of not useing critical thinking. but before the game could lose its fun factor out of being 'scary' i had gotten used to it and was able to play it normally, allowing for a different type of play giving strategy a whole new meaning.\n+They are STILL adding more updates - name says it all\n\n-Cons-\n= It does eventually get Extreemly hard - this happens around the third and last book, enemys will kill you either one or two shot and it becomes very difficult to play. some will find this as a pro but to me, it could be just a tad easier.\n\n-END-\nThanks for reading and i really hope this helped your decision on wether to but the game or not, would i recommend it? YES this game is unique in many ways and is a must play. if i find any more necessessary pros or cons, i will add  them but for now the only bad thing i can say about it is listed.

Plays a little like a 3D version of Derek Yu's Spelunky, but that's a poor comparison. Involves a nice blend of action with stealth (required on the later levels). Roguelike elements - level generation, item placement etc. makes each run feel fresh. Graphics are really nice, particularly the enemy models, and the atmospheric music and sounds are perfect.\nWhilst the main levels are pretty short, it'll take you some time to actually finish them. The new game+ mode is challenging even for veterans. The two "bonus" levels offer a great amount of additional playtime: a super-long level and a challenge level, that you will be playing again and again to get that 500 souls achievement. The inspiration from lovecraft is a nice touch, especially since I'm a fan of his works (although the relationship to his original literature is pretty weak).\n\nOverall: Excellent game, fun with a lot of replayability.\n\nAlso contains achievements that are damn near impossible.

In case my brutish and direct vernacular has sullied the credibility of my review already, allow me to expand upon why this game "♥♥♥♥ing owns."\n\n(Disclaimer: I played most of this game offline. That's what my time played is so low for it. So don't you ♥♥♥♥ing knock me for that one. Okay? Okay. Good.)\n\nI can't even recall my first reaction to the game. It was like wonder mixed with possibility mixed with fear mixed with paranoia. I thanked my dear brother for getting me this game (I had no money at the time, Or now) and resumed playing after changing my ♥♥♥♥-soaked scrubs. The sensation made me realize that randomly-generated dungeons aren't always complete ♥♥♥♥. I found myself worshipping the entropy. And the controls are perfect and fluid. But I digress.\n\nYou evolve with the game.\n\nOkay, ♥♥♥♥ perspective or whatever, I'm gonna do this my way.\n\nI evolved with the game. I wasn't told I was better at exploring the dungeons or anything by arbitrary numbers that simultaneously define my character. In fact, I started out like a true adventurer; head held high, fists at the ready, I was ready for anything. Or I thought I was. And then I realized I was wrong. I had to carefully analyze my situation and determine the best course of action via my own wit.\n\nTHE FIRST TIME PLAYING THE GAME, I WALKED AROUND THE DUNGEONS LIKE A ♥♥♥♥ING COWARD, TRYING TO AVOID ANY AND ALL CONTACT WITH MALEVOLENT MASTERS OF MONSTROUS MENTIONINGS. I WOULD HEAR THEM MUTTERING NEARBY WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY KNOWING OF THERE EXISTANCE AND I WAS SCARED. I SUCKED.\n\nEventually, I died, but I managed to pick up a gun, a teleporty thing (Hey Dishonored, this game used your only good mechanic better than you. Take that! That's what you get for letting me down,) and a lump sum of those ♥♥♥♥ing blue coins or whatever. Tablets. Slabs. Coins. Whatever. I started at the hub level again and worked my way back into the first dungeon, once again randomized. And I had none of the previous spoils I had earned by my....brave adventuring? Yeah that. So instantly I was like\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIII ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME ACTUALLY HAS CONSEQUENCE TIED TO DEATH MORE THAN KICKING YOU IN THE SHIN AND SAYING GO GET EM AGAIN, JOHNNY!! (looking at you, Ni No Kuni) All right, so I will skip ahead in my adventures.\n\nI became a ♥♥♥♥ing legend in that first dungeon, marked by multiple deaths and the blood of my enemies. I typically used the teleportation thingy and always carried a knife with me, maybe a gun.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID MY WAY THROUGH THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.\n\nI would sprint through rooms, slide under low obstacles, climb to the high ones, use my velocity to drive my knife through the throat of some fishman or faceless Magic The Gathering player. I ♥♥♥♥ing ruled. I carved out my destiny through that first dungeon. I completed it and felt on the top of the world. Brought the artifact down to the hubworld and all. I was unstoppable. After all, the second dungeon would be a breeze with all this jam at my side.\n\nMy ♥♥♥ was handed to me. The enemies became scarier exponentially. There is this guy who is essentially the Dead Hand or whatever from Ocarina of Time except INVINCIBLE. And then there are those weeping angels in the form of crocodiles (never seen Dr. Who Gives a ♥♥♥♥) and I nearly ♥♥♥♥ myself. I had no idea what this dungeon had for me. I died. That was the fall from grace.\n\nI was about to enter the second dungeon again with the fresh start, but I felt the overwhelming urge to check the artifact thing that I had brought back from the first dungeon. It was no longer on the pedestal. I had to go back and get it again.\n\nLet me repeat that for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed emphasis.\n\nI had to go back and complete the first dungeon again.\n\nThe first death was a slap to the face. That death was the game yelling at me to grit my teeth before reeling back and punching me in the face with full might.\n\nThat game handed me my ♥♥♥. Now I have to go back and play it again. And you know what?\n\nI'm glad. I'm gonna beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game someday. As hard as it pushes me down, I will just keep pushing back. This game can set as many limits as it wants to for me, but I will just keep breaking them. I WILL KICK ♥♥♥ AND FIGHT BACK. I WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DESTROY THESE HORRIFYING ENEMIES. I WILL CONQUER AND CLEAR AND CRUSH.\n\nI WILL BEAT ELDRITCH\n\n♥♥♥♥ YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YOU ARE A JACKASS FOR NOT ALREADY OWNING IT.

It shows that permadeath is not the only issue for being a roguelike. In this game, there is a chance that you will suffer a horrible death while equipping a pickaxe and a revolver (best equipment combination in my opinion), while at the same time you can finish the game with a single piece of rock.\n\nWith the RNG factor, game gives you ultimate freedom for designing your build. You don't start with selecting a class, you choose your own class with your tactics. You can avoid enemies with being silent and invisible, you can kill everyone on your way with a load of bullets and weapons,  you can even be Sanic with proper boots and equipment and run to the exit while ignoring everything.\n\nAtmosphere is simply brilliant. Difficulty is well-balanced and sountrack just fits the dark atmosphere.\nLike the enemies weren't already tough, with their noises, you always feel their breath on your back. Better than any thriller. You will sh*t bricks with enemies jumping from corners, especially with a headphone. I also have to mention the invulnerable enemies. Especially Lizard Statues makes you believe in god and beg for mercy from him.\nFloors are really well-designed. Traps can possibly be anywhere on a floor and in some cases, you have to be really careful in order to dodge them. So you know, you can always run from scary enemies but you can't escape.\n\nIf saying those haven't made it obvious, replayability value is really high. If you somehow become able to steal multiple items from the shops without a scratch, congratulations, you have won the game.\n\nThe only flaw I could think of would be the limited item pool, but considering that current items provide you basically everything you could do within the game mechanics, it is not a big issue.\n\n\nOverall, this game is right in every possible way. A true gem. Can't recommend it enough.","March 14","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

There are three worlds, which are generated on each runthrough, and you have to make it through all three to unlock a final stage, and then survive that stage to win, all without dying once. This only takes an hour or so, but is tricky to pull off. (I've only done it twice, both times before Steam acheivements were added.) The first world is easy; the second one seems impossible at first. On each successful run, you deepen your knowledge of the game's systems, and gradually attain a pleasurable sense of mastery.\n\nThere is also a "New Game+" mode and some additional challenges if you are way more hardcore than I.\n\nDespite the cartoony art style, the game has many genuinely tense moments and I think the visual and level design is really quite effective in conveying a weird and spooky world, governed by unfathomable rules and forces. And as with any good randomized world, I've had lots of hilarious/awesome emergent encounters/stories with the various beasties and environments.\n\nOne of my only issues with the game is that certain combinations of abilities are really unbalanced. So much so that, once I find them in a given run, it's hard to give them up if I'm trying for a winning run. Withouth giving too much away, this is due to what I can only call game-breaking exploits that certain abilities enable.\n\nHowever, the issue of balance is certainly outweighed by the sheer joy I took when I first discovered the power of these degenerate strategies. I felt like a brilliant magical ninja. In any case, there are a modest number of abilities that are all really fun to play with even if they are not all equally powerful.\n\nAll in all, I have huge respect for this game's designer (a single guy!) Eldritch shows a lot of care, dedication, restraint, and clarity of vision. There are a lot of simple but brilliant ideas in here, executed beautifully. (for example, after playing Eldritch I can't imagine why anyone would make an FPS without a run+crouch "powerslide" move.) It makes me want to make games myself.\n\nTo top it off, the developer has released two *huge* free content updates since the game was released in 2013, and the game is pretty modestly priced to begin with. ($15, with frequent sales and bundles.) I highly recommend supporting him!","November 3, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This games simple appearance doesn't accurately express it's charm and atmosphere. This game is immersive beyond most modern titles, the sounds and the sound track for each level are diverse and unsettling in every sense.\nYou might feel that the game is easy off the bat, and in some ways, the game is easy - it's not the difficulty of the enemies that provides all of the challenge here.\nBut the game falls back on players making the errors, in some ways, klling themselves due to lax in mindset, or not paying attention and falling prey to the games many traps. The environment is what is deadly,  and when coupled with the certain abilities of the enemies.. even more so.\n\nRisk/Reward is built in to almost every aspect. As the currency in the game, Artifacts- is the same thing that you use to cast spells. Making every action when low on health and artifacts incredibly on edge, and can lead to a very intense playthrough where pressing escape to take a breath is a advocated practice.\n\nI've not managed to beat the game, but I've gotten pretty far.\nThe game offers 3 diverse, Lovecraftian based worlds, with enemies correlating to the particular demi-god of that world. A hub world, which is very cool- and 1 special world in which I've not managed to beat.\nAll of which are procedurally(randomlly??) generated, which makes the levels seem very maze like, yet fresh and exciting- with twist and turns, ups and downs that can leave you feeling lost and desperate.\nBe careful though, 1 mistake and death can cost you your entire run. Caution is of the upmost importance.\n\nThe lore of this game is sparse, but told in a simple straightforward way that works with your imagination, over blasting you with cinematics, or long explanations.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, that I've delved into lovecraftian fiction works almost exclusively because of this game, just to learn more of the names of these gods, and to try and figure out these odd creatures I'm encountering.\nI've left out a lot of things from my words here.. because they are worth finding out for yourself.\n\nDon't skip out on this unique experience, for it's current price, and even full price. It's worth it.","November 27, 2013","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Lovecraftian inspiration is turned a bit cute and comical, but the art and some scary opponents are surprisingly effective and feel a bit creepy and uneasy at times to times. Especially with the great sound design, reminding of Doom with the weird sounds of the monsters that are lurking around.\n\nFirst person view is very very suitable to this exploration of randomly generated dungeons. The fighting feels good despite being a bit easy, but some opponents (especially in the second world) are so dangerous that the player experiences a genuine fear to be trapped by them.\n\nDespite the very good variety in opponents, the gameplay feels a bit repetitive after a death when the player has to try again from the start. Replayability is kind of the biggest problem I have with the game. At least some items allow to resurrect (at a cost). I think I would have preferred if the Dungeons/Worlds did not have to be all completed in one life, but instead were independent and harder to complete.\n\n\nSo to sum up, I really liked the Lovecraftian theme, the exploration, and the dangerous and original opponents that sometimes made me feel as if I was in an Amnesia game. I didn't exactly like the way progress is registered. Overall, I was very surprised to actually have a very good time in this game despite its minimalistic looks.","January 2, 2014","true","15.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The result is a game that is both infintely enjoyable and completely understandable, which is a real rarity. When you couple that with the incredibly well-executed theme, and the sheer polished feel to the whole thing, Eldritch has earned itself a slot on my shelf of all-time-favorites.\n\nThe concept is simple: get to the bottom, stay alive, retrieve the thing. But along the way, so many things can go so horribly, horribly wrong that the sense of satisfaction when you finally put your hand on your goal(s) is profound. Each world playes by its own rules and demands different approaches, while everything is at the same time built upon a consistent, understandable basis. Amazing.

It's a rogue-like game with procedurally generated levels and fully destructible environments, and it pulls this combination off very well.  You can blast holes through walls, sneak around and explore, and defend yourself against enemies very well in the environments it produces.  I feel like I've mastered the base game, but the NewGame+ mode and Mountains of Madness expansion still beat me senseless, and I'm loving the challenge.\n\nI really enjoyed the stealth aspect, and combat is simple but very fluid.  You can sneak behind an enemy, peek around the corner, leap out and stab the unlucky fishman.  Now rush to the next place of safety while his buddy furiously attacks.  Fun times.  :D  This game avoids the regular trappings of holding a button to hug a wall or other gimmicky stealth methods -- it's very approachable, and remains effective as you master it.  I never felt like the controls were inhibiting my ability to sneak or fight effectively.\n\nThere's a variety of strategies, including sneaking, sprinting, keeping to high ground, and so on.  Your limited item set increases the challenge, yet still gives you a wide variety of tools and options.  Do I want a destruction amulet to burrow through walls, or a compass to find my way?  Which spell do I want most -- conjure blocks or cloaking?  Do I need the medkit, or tinning kit?\n\nThis is not so much an "ooga-booga-booga" scary game, but it can build to a very tense and even creepy atmosphere, particularly after you complete the first book.  It ranges from being funny, to tense, to action-packed, and even freaky.\n\nI recommend it to fans of stealth and rogue-likes in particular.","December 30, 2013","true","55.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The difference in difficulty actually works in the game's favour for me; I can use the first temple to go and stab a few fish men when I want to just refresh in the middle of the day and get an actual challenge from the later levels.\n\nIn addition to stabbing, shooting enemies you will get to make use of the powers of the Elder Gods, like hypnosis, and there will even be special weapons up ahead after the first temple. I won't spoil them for you, however. The strength of the game isn't in the gadgets though, but in the nicely polished gameplay that balances between sneaking, paying attention to your environment, looting and making a run for it when you find yourself in a sticky situation.\n\nIf you enjoy stealth and want a title you can pick-and-play whenever you wish Eldritch is well worth the full 12€ price, and if it's on sale it's an absolute steal!","August 21, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eldritchabominationhugs/recommended/252630/","eldritchabominationhugs","Almost Metal Kiki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eldritchabominationhugs/","359 products in account","In the year 2009, I had decided to purchase a game on Steam entitled "Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth", an atmospheric horror game grounded in the world of H.P. Lovecraft. It was an extremely buggy game on PC, and the graphics had aged terribly, but I played it and I loved it because there just wasn't anything quite like it. The sort of fear that it instilled in me as I played it built up over time - there were no jump scares, only an oppressive atmosphere that left me wishing I could hide behind the corner, maybe find a small room and barricade myself in... I didn't want to subject myself to the horror lurking around every dark corner. Sadly, a bug in playing the game on modern operating systems prevented me from completing the game, and I have not gone back since.\n\nI guess the reason I'm saying this is because Eldritch provides that same sense of dread and immersion. It's a rogue-like, yes, but above all it is a horror game that relies on creating an atmosphere that's driven completely by the player's own actions in the world. I'm writing this review mere moments after coming face to face with my mortality in the game and dying after multiple strokes that were too close for comfort. It was in the second area of the game, on the third level. I had finally found an exit after dodging past unkillable enemies only to discover that it was guarded by no less than ten statues. These statues, you see, behave much like the Weeping Angels in Doctor Who in the sense that if you take your eye off them for even a brief moment, they strike you down. With my mind too set on escape, unable to think straight, I made a wild dash through them all hoping that I could possibly outrun them... And, somehow, I did. But I'd made a mistake. The door to the exit was closed shut, and I had already spun around to face my foes, frozen only a few feet away. I was stuck in a waiting game that would only end in my death, and so... I dropped my knife, emptied my gun, and slowly turned around, bracing myself for my death.\n\nIf you enjoy games with a strong atmosphere and/or simply enjoy being the driving force behind every occurrence (as nothing is scripted), I highly recommend you try out this game.","August 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lovecraft, and this review will be somewhat biased because of that. Sorry.\n\nEldritch is a FPS Rouge like game. The term "rogue-like" is used quite liberally, so I consider this game to be more of a rouge-like-like, or my personal favorite, a rouge-lite. The game's aesthetics are quite simple but also very pleasing. A Minecraft-esque visual design is easy to look at, but the pixelated art is somewhat overdone. But, you shouldn't base a game off of it's graphics. The meat of this game is what matters. Lore is hidden around any corner. The dungeons that our hero, you, explores are honestly small, but many levels must be completed. Because each level is random, the player is forced to figure a way out of a situation. It's very fun and simple to get into. Many levels can be explored, although most are the same level-setup with different textures or enemies. Still, this helps the game from seeming repetitive. After only 11 hours, I started to get a little bored. This can be solved with a healthy dosage of Cthulhu reading, but I was a little disappointed that the game gets tiring. The atmosphere is where the game shines the most. It's eerie, creepy and fun. Each corner holds danger or reward.\n\nAll in all, I personally love this game. For a fan of Lovecraft, I recommend this. It's a 8.5/10 for us.\nFor a fan of rouge-likes and procedurally generated game, this game would be a 8/10.\nIf you don't fit that category, stay away. If you fill either, I think this game is a good pickup.","January 22, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It does not capture the feel of playing this game in the least.  Watch a video on youtube before making up your mind.  This game is generally slow-paced, a bit creepy, and involves a lot of meticulous exploration.\n\nDespite having roguelike elements and a more oldschool-gaming attitude, it's not terribly difficult if you're experienced at stealth games.  Hell of a lot of fun, creepy and unsettling, and each run will challenge you about the same as the last due to the random terrain/maze-like levels.  Do not be fooled by the ease of clearing the first world; the second world is by far the most hazardous!\n\nSimple gameplay with several ways to fight, a stealth system including the ability to "lose" a pursuer, and a "sneak attack" system for bonus damage.\n\nNo cumbersome inventory management; simplified equipment system with a few upgrade slots, and a slot for 1 power/spell that can be changed easily.  High jump boots, lockpicking kits, magical amulet/token, etc.\n\nVoxel-based procedural world with nice atmospheric sound, music, and lighting.\n\nGreat use of vertical space for levels overall and for each given floor, with lots of crawlspaces, hidey holes, ceilings, and cover to hide in. You can crawl, powerslide under low passages, sprint, or climb up ledges.\n\nYou won't get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of this, but it's a great little game and has great potential if modders or the developers design additional levels to explore and enemies to fight.

Brevity does not equal quality, especially when the majority of your original review becomes your final paragraph on re-edit.\n\nEldritch is a tense, dark, and interesting little game with a lot going for it. As one who grew up with Lovecraft's influences all around me, this seemed to be a dream come true. The added bonus of rogue elements cemented it as something I would love.\n\nAs a staunch lover of Isaac and Teleglitch, I'm used to losing everythng. That fear of a run gone sour is always fresh in the back of my head, but that's often the motivation to jump back in for one more go. At the death of my first character, and the loss of every single key item needed to advance the story, I lost interest almost immediately after jumping in again and stopped not long after. Where did Eldritch go wrong?\n\nOn a big scale, Eldritch couldn't be better for the gaming market. A voxelized rogue-like with horror elements and a semi-retro artstyle is basically a fusion of everything popular in the indie scene, and they still manage to make the look all their own.\n\nWhere the problems emerge is from the very hook; roguelike elements. The gameplay is simple and a bit charming and silly to boot, yet with no stats or leveling, there is nothing for you to improve over time. Of the two weapons in the base game outside of your fists are a knife and a revolver. No more, no less. No upgrades, nor perks. To counter this, there are about 6 magic spells to use with their advantages and disadvantages. Some are useless, while others completely broken in their power. There is some equipment that you can find or buy too, but only a few are worth picking up, but there being about 10 in total makes it easy to find what you want quickly. Money, bullets and keys are your collectables. You can throw rocks and bottles. That's it. Randomization can't change much when you're going to see the same things regardless.\n\nThis, sadly, also applies to areas as well. Everything looks the same, and always ends up more or less in the same spot. Different geometry, yes, but once you see it once, you've seen it all. The enemy A.I. is overall mindless as well. Save for the Weeping Angel-esque statues which may make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself first time through, everything follows a simple routine of chase you til you're either too far away or dead. The minecraft elements are fun but make it much easier to circumnavigate trap rooms and such. Once you understand the core game, the threat is minimal, and the game grows dull.\n\nThis would be easily forgivable if death didn't obliterate your progress, demanding you do the exact same things in nearly the exact same areas with nearly the exact same challenges, destroying any willpower I had to see it through. Apparently, the ending is a dissapointing text message, so I'm pretty sure I didn't miss much.\n\nEldritch suffers from an identity crisis. The areas are wonderfully fun the first time through, but there is very little to offer on multiple playthroughs. Whereas Isaac had a wealth of items and combinations to urge you on, and teleglitch entire world shifts with each run, Eldritch sits at a very indecisive middle, with too little of each to justify extended play, and the great parts spread so thin and far with padding, it highlights just how short a game this would be if it didn't wipe all your progress. Good for a weekend if you want something different and it's on the cheap, but ultimately not at all worth full price.","February 7, 2015","false","4.2"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","2"

The main game is complete within the first 2 hours or so, sooner if you get a good early run and find the item that saves you from death... an infinite number of times. The enemies are surprisingly well designed, and some in dumb, crawley, flying, ranged and far-too-powerful-but-can-be-sneaked. The game isnt really scary but oh man, being chased by several flavors of indestructible horrors that chase you to the ends of the earth sure puts you on edge after a while.\n\nThe enemies that can be killed can be looted for ammo or keys or money, but choosing not to loot them prevents them from respawning on the level and HOLY BALLS that is a fantastic idea! The mechanic allows a good risk-for-reward mentality to the later levels. The controls are nice and the physics feel good. There are a good range of spells to unlock and destructible terrain is always a pleasure to mess around with, though I never found a hidden room destroying walls even once so it feels like a missed opportinity unless I am incredibly dumb or unlucky to have not found one.\n\nIt does have it's problems though, besides it's brevity I mean. The game's graphics are ♥♥♥♥. This is not really a problem to me normally, but after having two friends catching me playing and asking when minecraft was updated to include lizard-people I had to concede that the game didn't even try to distinguish itself. The textures are legitimately indestinguishable from those in minecraft in some areas, which saddens me because drawing a good 25x25 pixel texture is not difficult. Only having two inventory slots is fine and prohibits hoarding of key items, but what I found myself doing at the end of the day is sticking with the gun and dagger for 99% of the game, dropping the dagger for some dynamite whenever I found some, throwing it against a wall, than backtracking for a few seconds to get my dagger back. This worked great for me, but really broke the flow of the experience for me. Powerful monsters can be avoided entirely through sneaking. The sneaking itself was implemented quite well, but if you find the "sneak shoes" it makes the game about as hard as Dora the Explorers Big Birthday Adventure. There are rocks and distraction powers in the game, but it's all rendered moot since you can just sprint past all threats, and any enemy with the slightest bit of perceptive ability can be knifed in the face twice and downed without alerting anyone else. Any level that doesnt include the indestructible shoggoth or weeping angel lizard statues can be sprinted through with no risk whatsoever. Maybe I'm just too good, who knows... but I felt unchallenged, so mlg pros stay away.\n\nLast point, you can purchase or steal from storekeepers, but as far as I could tell there was no risk involved in just knifing the shopkeep and taking his whole inventory. If you've ever played "Spelunky", the risk involved in agressing the storeowner was high and immediately obvious. There is no risk here.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that it was fun knifing cthulu-spawn in the face as Disney's Kim Possible. Assuming this game will get further updates to counter it's short lifespan, it's worth a purchase.","August 22, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoy the fact you can only have 2 weapons/items and spell + some other gear. The game also controls very nicely on KB+M (I may try on X360 controller at a later date, but I enjoy it too much on KB+M at the moment).\n\nAfter around 30min of playing I was thinking the game was perhaps a little easy with being able to kill all the enemies I'd encountered so far in 2-3 hits with a knife or gun, along with finding the enemies themselves a little sparse. But that certainly changed as I got to the 3rd level of the dungeon, with me dying quite quickly after becoming too overconfident in my abilities, this game will bite back in the later levels.\n\nShort review as I haven't played much but so far I'd certainly recommend this game! Perhaps I might hesitate more at the normal RRP, but as it's 80% off currently I highly recommend buying this game!","August 20, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Instead of trying to combat piracy with an iron fist, they flat-out tell you that they will never use any kind of DRM, but ask that you purchase the game instead of pirating it. The rest of the rules about how you can use it are incredibly lenient as well (for example, you can share it with as many family members and friends as you like)\nSo there's an cool-looking game made by some pretty damn awesome devs!

The gameplay is a simple FPS with blocky voxel base that puts more charm than effect into the game but does well creating the dungeons, target hieghts and so forth. The game to my latter attempts of knowledge heavily emphisizes stealth in slow creep and crawl survival, i.e. stealth kills, extra loot, unbeatable foe evasion, eh whatnot. The variety of tools your given is a little bland and only offers a simple and straight foward mechanic to your stealth, which isnt a bad thing but i do feel it needs a smidgeon more variety but the simplisity is fine as well and keep yours head straight. I love that the game indulges the player in a foreboding feeling through the game from the music to being able to hear the creatures in an adjacent floor to your own, really sets a good..er mildly terrifying dynamic to it. One thing i dont think they did well was inherrently teach you rules. The first dungeon clunkly drops you into your random gen rogue-like dungeon crawl, but offers simple easy to mow down foes and hardly teaches the player stealth is a practical option to running like a ninny and knifing everything in the face, because once you reach dungeon 2 you get a good healthy slap in the face that brute tactics and running are awful ideas.\nIn general i'll say its a fun game and if you appreciate rich story bits, Rogue-Likes, and horror/survival/stealth games this might be up your Lovecraftian alleyway.","May 19, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is pure, organic gameplay from start to finish, and that's why I love this game.\n\nEldritch randomly generates levels by compositing premade rooms in a 4x4x3 3d matrix. Most rooms have little nooks and crannies to explore, and the effect on gameplay by one environmental set piece is affected by adjacent rooms. What you end up with is a 3d labyrinth that forms an interesting level on every single playthrough. In my opinion, this method of level generation is superior to alternative methods used in Delver or Tower of Guns.\n\nStealth is simple yet effective and intuitive in Eldritch. You can lean around corners and crouch to lower your profile and avoid making noise. Attacks on unaware enemies deal more damage, and you can augment your stealth with silent boots, the cloack power, or even the teleport power. (A la Dishonored) In later levels and new game plus, you will need to have mastered stealth to survive.\n\nNot every enemy can be defeated in Eldritch. Shoggoths can not be fought; you must run away. (This can cause moments of terror that remind me of Amnesia.) Similarly, you will encounter wraiths which always revive after a couple of seconds and "weeping angel"-like lizard statues that can only be killed with dynamite. (Just don't wake the statues.) In addition to that, new game plus makes direct combat with many enemies a bad proposition, so you may want to stealth around even the killable enemies.\n\nBecause of the block based world, the environment is destructable. You can blow a hole through a wall or floor with dynamite or by use of the destruction amulet. In addition to that, there are tools that increase your vertical mobility and ways to circumvent locks. All of this leads to a Deus-Ex like system where every situation has multiple solutions.\n\nEldritch features permadeath, which I believe is necessary for this game to work. Every time you play the game, you get a new level. You can not memorize a level and go back and try again. The fact that you can't fall back on memory means you must always rely on your skill and wits.\n\nYou are limited to two weapon slots. This is a weakness in the game, since you will probably want to stick with the pistol and dagger for most situations. There are also very few weapons availabe, which limits gameplay variety.\n\nWhile I personally prefer equipment based systems over standard RPG progression, one should take note that you may get all the powerups you need in the first world.\n\nThere is an upcoming expansion coming, and information released by the developer suggests there will be more items and weapons when that comes. I will likely update my review at that time.\n\nIn short, Eldritch is an amazing and highly interactive gem of a game. This is a game that tests your ability to think as much as your ability to shoot, and fans of immersive sims will be satisfied with the variety of interesting and well designed interactions that Eldritch has to offer.","November 27, 2013","true","46.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are not a huge amount of enemy types and tilesets, nor are there very many items. However, the levels are very well-generated and interesting, the monsters are creepy, and sneaking around the levels is a LOT of fun. Reviews have said over and over that the game is too easy, and I do concur that the actual act of attacking and killing enemies is typically challengeless as long as you remain unseen or strike quickly. In particular, the first book (level) is very easy. This is not always the case however; sneaking around avoiding combat is very important in the 2nd and 3rd books, and is very tense. I died quite a few times trying to complete the second book, but the third book was fairly easy overall. The end was exceptionally anti-climactic. I haven't tried the New Game Plus mode (unlocked after finishing the game, much harder), but I'm definitely going to give it a play-through (I rarely play a game again after finishing it, but I will with Eldritch, which says a lot).\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to fans of stealth games, those that like the retro blocky look, and Lovecraft fans (the Flying Polyps were particularly disturbing). Also, there's a free expansion coming out in a few weeks, we'll see what it adds.","December 4, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, the main game in normal mode is beat quite fast. That being said, 'New Game+' mode is for those who won't be satisfied after their first playthrough.\n\nThe main game consists of an usual playthrough and a more story-driven, a tad more difficult one ingrained within the game world. I won't go any further on that, since one will come across it and eventually decide the way they will continue on: rest assured you will find this to be an enjoyable aspect. MoM's progression is more straight-forward on the other hand, it's flavour coming from challenges thrown at the player as ventured forwards.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the soundtrack. Not many other games have so brilliant ambient sounds, consisting of droning electric guitar walls, to create such a gloomy atmosphere.

But this one intrigued me, being the fan of Lovecraftian works as I am. The randomly generated dungeons offer a huge replay factor, as does the New Game Plus feature once you complete the man story. (Which depending on skill level can be done within a half-hour of running and gunning.). Even so, there is a decent amount of additional content beyond that. Including three other worlds to crawl and chant in tongues through. A worthy buy for any dungeon crawler or Lovecraft fan.","March 14, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just glorious.\n\n-Decently difficult, it will take you a few tries to beat the game, and even I have not beat the game to get the special ending.\n\n-Challenge for speedrunner\n\n-Spell system which functions similarly to the spell system from dishonored or whatever those things are called from Bioshock (Sorry, have not played Bioshock in a while).\n\n-Its a roguelike... What more do I have to say?\n\n-Good amount of rooms to expore in randomly generated levels.\n\n-2 campaigns, a special halloween level, a New Game+ mode, and the Arkham Asylum. No not that one.\n\nCONS\n\n-A few monsters are just reskinned.\n\n-All free sounds, so if that bugs you, I don't know, go into the files or something.\n\n-No co-op multiplayer.\n\nAlright, now time for the ratings!\n\nStory: 6/10 It is okay, but mostly just a backdrop for the gameplay, which is alright in this kind of game\n\nGameplay: 10/10 This is where the game really shines, and it shows that a lot of work was put into it. I mean you can slide around if you crouch while running. Its amazing.\n\nReplayability: 8/10 It can get somewhat repetitive, but is still amazing.\n\nAtmosphere: 6/10 I'm a little torn on this one. The sunken city of Ryleh was not exactly up to my standards of Lovecraftian horror, but some bits are quite nice. Not that great though.\n\nTotal: 75 This game is very good and I love it to pieces. I would honestly rate it as one of my all-time favorite games. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY IT.","May 7, 2014","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those two concepts are stealth and dungeon crawling. Somehow, Eldritch manages to pull this strange combo off excellently, creating a difficult, tense, edge-of-your-seat experience so chalk-full of the Cthulhu Mythos it's practically got a Hound of Tindalos emerging from one of the corners of your monitor. The campaign may be short, but it is challenging enough to stump you for a while and it makes up for the short length with excellent replay value. The only major shortcoming of the game is that death, while not permanent in any way, feels quite defeating after staying alive for a long time, which has caused me to stop playing on more than one occasion, even while streaming. This is not an issue unique to Eldritch: many drawn-out roguelikes also suffer from it, but it is still unfortunate where it pops up. That being sid, the game is extremely enjoyable, and certainly worth your money, especially if you know your lore.","June 2","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, the art style is interesting, the gameplay is fairly fun and the Lovecraftian source material is just tops. The maps are pretty interesting while changing just enough in their layout to feel different from one another. Weapons are fairly interesting, with the more powerful ax or pickax being much slower than the quicker knife. There's also a sort of tactical choice in the spells and items you can carry.\n\nDo you want to be sneaky? You'll want Stealth boots and melee weapons, as guns will alert enemies nearby to your presence. Want to avoid combat as much as possible and be able to make quick getaways? You'll want to probably be carrying either a bundle of TNT or a Grappling Hook with you so that you can either quickly climb to safety or make your own escape route by blowing a hole in the nearest surface. Maybe you'll want to equip the Teleport or Lift to get away fast over big ledges. There are quite a few options here.\n\nWhile this game is great fun as a dungeon crawl, I do have a serious problem with one of the mechanics, and that is the fact that you lose literally everything you have accrued save for any money you've put in your bank chest and any new level you opened. This poses a serious problem.\n\nThroughout the time you character remains alive, you gain more hit points by drinking from fountains, can stock up on ammunition for the revolvers, find spells at idol statues, and, most importantly, find the souls of the Old Ones needed to escape the library hub of the game.\n\nHowever, when your character lives, you lose literally everything they're carrying; any spell you may have, additional hit points are reduced back to the starting 3, all ammunition, any artifacts (money) you have on your person, all of your gear includeing weaponry, AND any Old One souls you may have found and placed on the three altars to escape the library? Yeah, they're back at the end of a now newly randomized zone. There is a way to revive yourself, if you're carrying a First Aid Kit, but that costs 50 artifacts to use. I suppose unless it disappears (I didn't notice if it was still in my inventory after the one time I was able to use it) that 50 Artifacts to not lose everything is a fairly good deal.\n\nI don't usually take issue with punishment via losing precious items. Games such as Minecraft have made me very familiar with this mechanic, but the issue is that in Minecraft you can store items and the enemies are at a constant level of difficulty, while in Eldritch, the enemies are stronger in each new zone.\n\nThere is a sneaking mechanic in Eldritch, and if you can find the Stealth Boots and snag them from a merchant (honestly, who would blow all those artifacts?) you can even sprint without enemies hearing a single footstep, but with the randomized terrain and the fact the enemies actually wander the map it's eventually going to be inevitable that you have to square off against something, and if you've just died and are trying to enter the Mountains of Madness, or are fighting a Snakeman with nothing but your bare fists and three hit points, it becomes more or less a necessity to have to slog all the way through the beginning area again, which is now completely re-randomized, and you are forced to re-collect Dagon's soul.","November 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lovecraft and as you might can guess such an idea very well sounds like a wet dream for many horror readers, myself included.\n\nLuckily it works out, Eldritch is a very well executed and fun Roguelike-like-lite-whatever that blends in elements from procedurally generated worlds to mix well with the horrific atmosphere one tends to expect when it comes to Lovecraft. You start in a library that you are stuck in and three mystic books that transport you to other worlds, Dagon, Nyarlathotep, and R'lyeh, your objective is to reach the end of each world to get the three souls needed to unlock the door and escape from the library.\n\nMuch like other Roguelikes you start with low hitpoints, little to no equipment, and when you die you lose everything except for any money you deposit into the bank, with your one life you must gather money, keys, ammo, and equipment, and find fountains to add more hitpoints or statues to give you magic powers, all the while dodging Fishmen, Cultist, Shoggoths, and other eldritch horrors.\n\nThe controls and gameplay are very well done, combat is done with relative ease, you can stealth past enemies or sneak attack them, knives for up close attack, rocks to throw, bottles to smash onto walls to lure enemies away, guns can be found though with scarce ammo and sometimes you can find dynamite that will let you blow open parts of the level, most of these items as well as keys to open locked doors can be found in the world, but some can also be bought for money by finding a shopkeeper, this also goes for equipment such as Jump Boots and Good Luck Charms.\n\nMost of the story is told through books you find laying around, and overall despite the great atmosphere, the plot lacks quite a bit and the endings are nothing to write home about, but in the grand scheme of things it is a minor complaint to an amazing game.\n\nOverall this game is well worth playing, though a bit lacking in content, for the price and fun you will have playing it and exploring the very Lovecraftian world it builds, I fully recommend buying this game.","May 24, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a great game with trading cards, and there is hardly anything WRONG with it, but charging 15 dollars?!?!? Binding of Isaac has way more value and is 5$ when its not even on sale.\n\nBut the gameplay of this game is very smooth, and sometimes nerve wracking. The environments are actually destructible, and you can build on them, considering you have dynamite or a spell. The enemies aren't "Lacking" anything, but they sort of just come at you and attack, if you want revolutionary AI, well, sorry.\n\nIt also performs great, and I KNOW, when i first played this it was on an old moldy potato. (I am upgrading)\n\nPros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Great performance  +1\n+Trading Cards (Which, are, btw, really cheap on the Market) +1\n+Full controller support (Believe it or not, it really is good) +1 1/2\n+Nice environments and a somewhat creepy atmosphere +1\n+Cool weapons and spell system +1\n+Random generation +1 1/2\nBonus +2 because it is a good game.\n\n\nCons:\n-Really expenive (Really, wait for a sale, at LEAST 50% off) -2\n1 Its a fine game, you just dont get 15$ worth\n-Atm, it seems you are paying for THIS game, which is fine and not buggy as far as I can see, but ya never really know -1/2\n\nI would say, 8/10. I DO recommend this game, but not at full price.

Interested because of the concept, and skeptical because it looked kinda meh. When it did have a Steam release, I decided to wait until it was on sale, and boy was it a mistake.\n\nLet me get the only good thing out of the way first. Eldritch has a wonderful concept. An FPS with rogue-like elements mixed in with some Lovecraftian lore sounds like a great idea. Scratch that, it IS a great idea. But sadly, as mentioned before, this is the only standout feature of the game, as the rest of the game is pure mediocrity. I would like to start off with the gameplay. You start off in a library, which is a base of operations of sorts. Here, you can take out or put in currency that you have obtained throughout the game, enter into levels (of which there are only three, plus that one level introduced in the free expansion pack), and cuztomize the look of your character (you can actually make yout character look like the god of rock and roll frontmen, Freddie Mercury, but this doesn't change the fact that the gameplay sucks). After you enter the level you wish to enter, you are put in a randomly made dungeon, and that is where the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. The game is so stupidly easy, and it feels like the game was designed for kiddies who have never played an FPS, as you can only wield two weapons at once, and you can only have one magic spell at a time. The AI isn't any better, as it is dumb as bricks. Currency in the game is used for two things, and that is to buy ♥♥♥♥ and to use magic spells, which is sadly the only other standout feature found in this game. The rogue elements are minimal. In fact, the only rogue part about the game are the randomized levels. Everything else is just look for the items and drink at wells to increase your HP. The FPS gameplay in the end feels generic and lame as ♥♥♥♥, and the rogue elements do not help to stir things up.\n\nGraphically, the game looks like ♥♥♥♥, as it wants to look like an NES game, following that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trend in indie games that needs to ♥♥♥♥ing die. Now, you would think that because its graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the framerate would be fine. Instead, you have some very noticable lag in windowed mode, and it is even more noticable in fullscreen mode. This shows that the game is poorly coded and has optimization issues. Overall, not worth your money. You would probably have more fun playing a full rogue-like game.","December 26, 2013","false","0.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","11"

Lovecraft's work, what's not to like?\n\nWell, a lot, unfortunately.\n\nOf course, I'm not talking about the graphics... voxel-based worlds kind of grew on me after being forced to play Minecraft and Pixel Gun for countless hours with my son ;-)\nThe problem is really about gameplay. I tried playing it like a stealth-based game, but it wasn't really that fun. Then I tried playing it Doom style, fully knowing that on a H.P. Lovecraft universe that can only end in tears... and so it did.\n\nSo I'm left with a game that feels like a first-person Pac Man game, in which I'm thrown at little mazes, and am constantly trying to eat/grab little rewards while either attacking or fleeing baddies.\n\nGuess what, I'd rather play a real Pac Man game.\n\nAnd you know what, I was thinking I don't really like humorous takes on H.P.

It's basically Minecraft Cthulhu, a first-person dungeon crawler with blocky cartoony environments and monsters. The creepy evil of the Lovecraft mythos does come through, and there is definitely a survival element to the game.\n\nYour investigator character is not a superman. He/she is a normal person, with fairly limited health and ammunition. The monsters are not too bright, but they are legion, immortal and relentless. Should you slowly progress through a level, risking injury, death and getting trapped in order to stock up on more items? Should you race past the dangerous elite monsters, and risk facing a major baddie or trap later, under-leveled and empty-handed?\n\nThe audio design, while initially cheesy (most of the monsters sound like the developer's buddy growling into a microphone), is quite effective at instilling a sense of danger. You will find yourself using your ears to judge where a monster is, how far away it is, and what it is. And you will have to make tough choices with that knowledge.\n\nAs a newbie to the genre, I recommend this as a fun horror-lite first-person dungeon crawler. I suppose if you like concentrated terror and wearing brown pants, you could go play Amnesia or Alien: Isolation. But this is about as much creepiness as my britches can handle for now.\n\nOne paranoid investigator's thumb up!","November 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Lovecraft, Eldritch is fun. It can be creepy, difficult, fast and furious - but overall, it's fun. The Minecraft-esque graphics are in no way an indication of gameplay, which can get quite intense, down in the dungeons with all those eldritch horrors (don't get me started on the stone lizards ...). The soundtrack's a little sparse (unlike the trailer), but it all adds up to a wonderful creepy feeling, where you're not sure if you should giggle or shriek. Definitely worth your time, especially if you're a fan or rogue-likes and/or Cthulhu.","February 22, 2014","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It didn't add anything to the game, but it didn't detract as much as I was worried it might.  The enemy models were still entertaining (I loved the fish people and the cthonians).  The sound design was well done, keeping things extremely tense, but still being necessary to know when someone was walking up behind you.\n\nGameplay-wise, it was somewhere in between true rogue-like and the kind of game I prefer where most of your advancement carries over between attempts.  Unlocked levels and artifacts carry over (or CAN carry over, in the case of artifacts, provided you found a chest to store them in before you die), though trying to jump into the later unlocked levels without the advancement from the earlier levels is foolish at best, so I found it better to just restart at the beginning anyway.\n\nOne thing I found interesting was that the strategy that ended up working for me was finding a shop in the first area that had a health pack (the only way in the game to get "continues") and, instead of trying to save up your artifacts to purchase it (since you'll need them to buy continues) just save up bullets until you have a dozen or so and kill the shopkeeper.  Then you can loot the health pack, maybe a luck amulet, and a pair of boots which will keep you going for the rest of the game.\n\nThe game isn't long, though I haven't played through the Mountains of Madness DLC.   There is a spell system in the game that I never even bothered with, since that spends artifacts and I was hoarding them for continues, though I do like that you get spells by praying to different elder gods.\n\nAll in all it was an entertaining, tense, dungeon-crawly rogue-like with just a sprinkle of Lovecraft mythos on top.  No buyers remorse here.","January 2, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These developers seem super awesome. Seriously, read the EULA.\n\nPart 2: Initial Impressions-\n*I will finish this review when I feel like I have played this game for a reasonable amount of time.*\nSo far the game has been fun. I was playing it while listening to loud music, so whenever I turned a corner into a baddie, I almost had a heart attack. I only saw three types of monsters in the first dungeon (stage, level?), so I can't really say much about the variety. There could be more later on. Like I said, I have only played it for a short while so far.\n\nControls are great, there are keybindings, and enough menus for maybe even TB to be happy with. AND THEY LET YOU TURN THE FOV UP TO 120. If only more devs understood that it's that easy to please the customer.\n\nI apologise for my sub-par writing skills.

It's basically Minecraft Cthulhu, a first-person dungeon crawler with blocky cartoony environments and monsters. The creepy evil of the Lovecraft mythos does come through, and there is definitely a survival element to the game.\n\nYour investigator character is not a superman. He/she is a normal person, with fairly limited health and ammunition. The monsters are not too bright, but they are legion, immortal and relentless. Should you slowly progress through a level, risking injury, death and getting trapped in order to stock up on more items? Should you race past the dangerous elite monsters, and risk facing a major baddie or trap later, under-leveled and empty-handed?\n\nThe audio design, while initially cheesy (most of the monsters sound like the developer's buddy growling into a microphone), is quite effective at instilling a sense of danger. You will find yourself using your ears to judge where a monster is, how far away it is, and what it is. And you will have to make tough choices with that knowledge.\n\nAs a newbie to the genre, I recommend this as a fun horror-lite first-person dungeon crawler. I suppose if you like concentrated terror and wearing brown pants, you could go play Amnesia or Alien: Isolation. But this is about as much creepiness as my britches can handle for now.\n\nOne paranoid investigator's thumb up!","November 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The fun comes from the fact that, if you die, you lose all your orbs, your equipment, and your status is completely reset, meaning that in order for you to escape, you need to beat the entire game in one life.\n\nIt's quite an interesting catch, and it truly embodies the gameplay aspect of learning and mastering the game's mechanics. Games like Assassin's Creed and other mainstream triple-A games treat their players like idiots, constantly reminding them of how to play the game and perform basic techniques at every stage of the game. Not Eldritch. Eldritch barely gives you a tutorial, and by the end, you feel like you've truly mastered the game. There are a lot of unique enemies, such as enemies that can't die, that come back to life after a few seconds, and even a not-ripoff of the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who, that, if you stop looking at them, attack you. It keeps you on your toes and makes it so that every enemy type is a learning experience. How many hits do these enemies take? Can they hear my footsteps from far away? Do they have any projectile attacks? Is it worth fighting them or running?\n\nThe game isn't that long. It takes about twenty to thirty minutes to beat a dungeon, and there are optional bonus dungeons that can break up the monotony, and offer special equipment to better tackle the big three dungeons (such as grappling hooks and pickaxes). My final 'life' that I beat the game with only lasted 77 minutes, meaning that, if you're a master from the get-go, you can beat it in an hour. But it took me four hours to beat the game, so it took three hours of failed attempts, learning enemy behaviour, and trying new equipment and tactics, to finally master the game and beat it.\n\nUnlike Rogue Legacy, another one of my favourite perma-death games, nothing transfers over from one life to the next: not health, not equipment, not even the boots you're wearing. Although Rogue Legacy was satisfying to beat, this felt even better, because dying in this game felt punishing, but you constantly felt like you were getting better.\n\nIt feels like those old NES games that were only an hour long, but because they're so challenging, it took months or years to beat as a kid. But you took the time (because games were expensive and you wanted to beat the ones you had), mastered the game, and by the end, you could recite every level's floor-plan off by heart. Eldritch is very much in the same vein: a short game that takes a long time to beat. It rewards patience, skill, and willingness to approach a situation from new angles.\n\nFor stealth fans, this is a fun game, but for people who enjoy a challenge, there is nothing more rewarding than beating this game.","January 8, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I like a challenge. But games like Eldritch are damned annoying. If you die, you lose all progress except for any levels that you unlock and money that you've stored in the bank. Any cool items, spells, weapons or "experience" upgrades are lost. So you might as well start over each time that you die. Oh and good luck finding that sweet combination of items, weapons and spells again: everything is re-randomized upon death. I died a couple of times not because of the difficulty of the monsters, but because of typical accidents that occur in FPS games: one step too far and falling off a ledge, dying instantly, for example. Or mis-judging the range of a monster's hit-box. This game is brutally unforgiving and falls into the same old mis-placed nostalgic hard-on for "old school brutality" which was nothing but a shallow, cynical design by the developpers to get kids to spend more quarters. Not because of some mythical love of the gaming "craft". Pass on this if you have precious little time to waste.

You could hit lava, water or sand. The enemies aren't made to be killable/survivable with the most basic of equipment.\n\nIf you take this out of the sandbox and make it a game on it's own, there's this implicit contract between game developer and player that says: "this is doable".

This game has something about it, but I guess that "something" is not my cup of tea. You learn this game by trial and error and exploration+memorisation is a large part of the game. There are few multi-level maps in this game. Your objective is to enter them, survive and find the exit. You accomplish this with 3 lives, keys, weapons or praying statues that you find throughout the map, while sneaking past the enemies or killing them (not all enemies can be killed, though). If you fail, you loose all your items and artefacts, resurrect and start again...and again...and again...and again. Get the idea?\n\nAs I've said, not my cup of tea. No story either.\n\n7/10 for the concept. Thumb down for the difficulty.\n\np.s. Although, if you're patient enough and learn the maps and tricks, the game becomes managable.

(You can see that I've only played for 3.1 hours, more than enough time to beat the main campaign with absolutely no previous experience)\n-Enemies are all very, very similar. There seems to be about two different AI types, excluding the rock lizards and the slug thing. They pretty much either fly around or walk at you, and sometimes they shoot energy blasts.\n\n\nI got this game during a Humble Bundle, and was glad I didn't pay full price for it.  While I've oftentimes seen this game compared to spelunky, making that comparison is similar to comparing Minecraft and Terraria. Yes, there's mining and building and exploring, but that's about as far as you can draw the comparison. The biggest, most notable difference between Eldritch and Spelunky is the fact that this game is a roguelite, not a roguelike, like this game seems to advertise. Once you complete a world, the next area is permanently unlocked, with zero reason to visit earlier levels. You can also store the games currency at different parts of the level, to be withdrawn at a later time, or a later life.\n\nAnother big complaint I have about this game is the fact that the graphics do not play to their strengths, much like many other indie games do. These graphics feel lazy, and oftentimes just make the game feel less professional. Yes, it's an indie game, but must indie games when confronted with graphic issues take a simple, more retro style and play to the strengths of that particular style.\n\nWhile the gameplay is solid, I don't feel like replaying the game. I don't feel like it has anything more to offer me than what I had experienced on my first playthrough. The game offers a New Game+ feature for those who beat it, but it feels slapped on, as if they just altered a few numbers in the code and called it good.\n\nThis game is alright, but I don't reccomend it. If I still haven't swayed you, the only advice I can give to you is don't buy this game for anything over 50% of the full cost.","December 7, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Based off the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, this game combines cute and creepy in the perfect manner. You have a variety of worlds to unlock and explore, with a very simplistic HUD and inventory system. That makes it easy to get into the game and start exploring. From throwing rocks to blasting with dynamite to a variety of magic spells to choose from, the player's bound to develop their own unique method of getting through the game. The library is where you start, and from there you can go to the Mountains of Madness, or explore the book-worlds of Dagon, Nyarlthotep, and R'lyeh. Each book-world has shops, traps, evil denizens, and quirks, all procedurally generated so no two journies are alike. If you wanna see a Cthulhi wearing a monocle or if you wanna punch a penguin to death, I would suggest this game before all others.","November 19, 2014","true","28.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'll post it as an upvote for now, but I'm teetering on the edge, simply because of a few factors that are pretty noticable once you start playing for a while.\n\nThe biggest factor being that it's too easy. Yes, sure, there's a new game plus, but the base game was so easy that I'm pretty sure that a new game plus wouldn't be too much harder to be honest.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the length of the game. Had I not experimented with different features of this game and always played stealthily taking no chances, it's probably a three hour game at the very least.\n\nNow the good things about this game are that it has a stealth system, strikingly similar to that of Dishonored's. Dishonored was a great game to me; I replayed it many many times. So to have stealth similar to Dishonored's really made me ecstatic.\n\nI also like roguelikes, and this is definitely a roguelike. Although like I said before, it's a pretty easy roguelike, so it's not a "true" roguelike, if that makes sense.\n\nAll in all, Eldritch IS a good game, but again, as I have said before, this game's VERY short and a little on the easy side. Definitely pick it up when it's on a sale.","January 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In most games when you die you go "oh no, I have to do that all over again" and eventually "OH PLEASE GOD! NO MORE!"\nBut this is not an issue in this game because the levels are different each time.\n\n2. The issue in a lot of AAA games these days is that they have these long fancy animations for each action you do in the game. So you can run at an enemy and attack then say "this was a bad idea," and try to run, only the person you are controlling is still doing the animation so you can't run and end up getting killed. In this game that is not an issue, as soon as you press the button the action happens, finishes, and is ready for the next action.\n\nThe issue I have with the game is that even though the QUALITY is very good the QUANTITY is not. This is because the game was made by only one person… I think (no, I can't be bothered to check). I hope that AAA games can learn something from this game.\n","June 28, 2014","true","11.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Eldritch has some interesting ideas going for it, combining a Spleunky type (descend, collect treasure, dodge traps) premise and fast paced movement with FPS combat and view. It also has an almost useless sneaking system along with various ways to play the game, but very few penalties to "run as fast as you can" as long as you're paying attention. In fact if you can beat Eldritch in ten minutes (which is easier than you may think). As you progress you start seeing more invincible/immortal enemies, difficult traps, and other fun Rogue-like elements, but more often then not you feel like the game's short and bloated with tons of options, but little reason to pursue them. For example the sneaking system (running makes a lot of noise, crouching almost eliminates the noise you make) is best used in the third world against enemies who are sleeping. But if you have the dagger - the first weapon you can find in the game - you can beat any enemy just by running around them and slashing at them. By the end of the game I had over 100 shots for the revolver which I used to eliminate all challenge. Plot's as basic as it gets, but after you're finished there's a harder NG+ option which I'm not too motivated to pursue. There's also three additional areas they've added with the game since its release: a gauntlet in the form of the Mountains of Madness, an arcadey time trial in the Asylum (my personal favorite, died there a lot more then I did anywhere else), and a quick run starter in a Halloween level. The variation they give is nice, but more like after dinner desserts that give the game just enough flavor from being a bit dull.\n\nIf the premise interests you (it sure did me) I'd wait for a sale. Sadly it barely surpasses being average but that's enough for a recommendation.","January 30, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Or you could buy things to do so. Or you could steal things to do so. It's really up to you. And that's awesome. You can hop down into the dungeon, and do whatever you want! Really! There's no tight paths, or railed exploration, you walk around, explore fight, sneak, eat, non-eat, you decide. It's really cool. I have so much fun with it every time I play it. The varied levels and environments are really wowing. Sometimes you're in a library, sometimes you're in a sewer. I once found myself in a bank with several locked doors.

This game has, at first glance, mucky graphics, but do fit well with everything that happens within the actual game. It has dungeon crawler written all over it, and the HP Lovecraft feel/inspiration is enough to grasp fans and unfamiliars alike. The game has solid gameplay, basic controls with very little to learn. It's forgiving at times, and unforgiving the next. It has a very nice simplistic feel to it with a bit of story tacked on, but not in a bad way. If you want it solely because you want a decent roguelike, pick it up. If you like HP Lovecraft, pick it up. If you want a decent mystery/horror game, pick it up.\n\nOverall?: 8/10.\n\nIt will keep you gripped for a long while to come, and it's easily addictive. Being the roguelike it cherishes itself to be, it will be able to have some high replayability.

I can hear it shuffling and dripping some kind of unspeakable ichor as it slides over the ruined stonework. I have only my knife and a rock to keep me safe in this cyclopean hell and I must make it back to the relative safety of the labyrinthine library. A giggle rises from my lips, but I quickly silence myself. I cannot afford to lose my sanity in these deep corridors. I creep forward, darting my view in all directions. Suddenly, there is a dreadful noise behind me! I turn whilst steeling myself against this fresh horror… Awwww! It’s just the sweetest looking Deep One I’ve ever laid my eyes on! Come here, li’l guy! Come – OH GOD, WHY IS IT KILLING ME?\n\nEldritch, by Minor Key Games, is a first-person roguelike set in a blocky Lovecraftian fantasy. It’s unforgiving of mistakes, and it’s so dang adorable, you’ll want to hug every deadly enemy you see. Next thing you know, you’re looking at the death screen, getting ready to resurrect back in the mysterious library.\n\nLike any good Lovecraftian horror, Eldritch begins with forbidden knowledge. You awaken in a library. Endless shelves of books, tables, and reading lamps surround you. The only exit requires the acquisition of three magical orbs to unlock. Reading one of three glowing books in the middle of the library will transport you to a deadly realm filled with traps and monsters. Your exploration of these three randomly generated dungeons will net you loot, weapons, and the orbs that will free you from imprisonment. Dying puts you back in the library. The catch? You have to gather the orbs in one life. If you die before you unlock the exit, you’ll lose any orbs you have returned to the library, forcing you to gather them again.\n\nThe first dungeon you go into is easy. It’s baby’s first roguelike. You’ll be punching cultists, Deep Ones, and beetles to death. You’ll run through the halls with abandon. You’ll be given a magic spell by praying at a statue of Dagon and the artifacts that power your spell will litter the ground. You’ll find a revolver and you’ll never run out of bullets because looting the dead gives more ammo than you spent. The knife is god-tier. You’ll grab the first orb and you’ll teleport back to the library thinking, “This is it?” It’s a trap. In the second dungeon, you’ll run into deadlier monsters that will laugh at your ineffectual flailing. Your gun will never have enough bullets. The hissing Serpent Men will chase you. You’ll begin hoarding the increasingly scarce spell-powering artifacts. You’ll realize that the gameplay resembles Dishonored with its sneaking, spells, and assassinations. Just as you’re getting your groove again, a Shoggoth will crush you with it’s cuddly black tentacles. Awwww. You’ll wake up back in the library.\n\nThat’s when the deeper mechanics of Eldritch start to make sense. There’s a lean button for a reason. Crouching makes you stealthier. Looting the enemies you kill makes them respawn somewhere else in the level. A rock can be the best ranged weapon because it’s quiet and you can recover the missile after you’ve thrown it. The knife is best used in sneak attacks from behind or above. Bottles can be thrown as a distraction. The Shoggoth will kill other denizens of the dungeon for you if you lead him into them. Spell-powering artifacts can be banked in a treasure chest so you don’t lose everything when you die. You’ll discover that you can purchase weapons and power-ups from oddball merchants. Do you want to keep your artifacts for spells, or spend them on boots that let you leap higher? You can unlock shortcuts to deeper dungeons, but zipping right to harder levels without getting some better equipment is a mistake. Finally, a Chthonian Worm will bite you to death with its lovable lamprey mouth. Awwww. You’ll wake up in the library again.\n\nThe screen that informs you that you’ve died again has a button that lets you tweet the manner of your death to the world. It’s a painful reminder that Eldritch could really benefit from leaderboards or at least achievements to chronicle your struggles against the forces of cosmic terror. It’s hard to play any roguelike without a scoreboard after Spelunky’s wonderful daily challenges. No matter. Unlike Spelunky, most players will see the end before their hundredth death. Onwards! There are cute monsters to kill.\n\nThis time, you’ll use the run-and-crouch move to slide through a hole as a Spawn of Chthulhu chases after you. This spell lets you teleport behind that Deep One and stick him in the back before the nearby cultist knows what happened. There’s the orb! If you can only reach it before the moaning horror catches up to you! Nope. You weren’t watching your step and the collapsing floor dropped you right next to your Shoggoth friend. Awwww. Back to the library with you.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","24.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","9","21","3","0"

That levels design would be enough to justify the use of sample graphics, to allow such large and complex levels inside descent production cost.\n- The levels have a fair randomization, but they have also an accurate tuned design for the exploration and progression point of view.\n- It offers a good range of tools to manage the levels in different ways.\n- Some monsters are quite unique, without to spoil anything, one really worth the quote, some statues you really need experiment in the game.\n\nOverall it's a game aimed to be relatively short but quite intense. The rogue-like aspect uses the fair randomization and helps increase the duration. It's a light fps stealth game with unique large levels exploiting intensively the heights, some parts succeed generate a rather good mood despite the low budget on graphics and sounds.","January 12, 2014","true","33.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Here's a list why.\n\nBad\n-Only two usefull weapons: the knife and the gun. Everything else is useless, weak or only lasts once.\n-Grappling hook does not even work like a grapple. It creates a ladder which is very glitchy.\n-Graphics get really annoying\n-More boring and extrmely repetitive (more than minecraft story mode)\n-Stupid. If you dont know what to do, find dynomite and blow up the dungeon.\n-The saggoth is incredibly hard to kill. I used 20 shots from my pistol and it didnt die. Most creatures die from one shot.\n-You dont have a body. You can barely see your arms if at all, and you cant see your feet.\n-Most monsters are super easy to kill and are really boring.\n-You will die everytime from the stupidest thing and get annoyed and bored very quickly.\nGood\nN/A","November 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","6"

Then a trio of fish men try to ♥♥♥♥ you. This was a women hating theme in the cancer of a game named dota 2 where you're and inocent woman trying to blink away from another fish man as he destroys you in 2 hits.\n\nThis horrible game also hates on various poor minorites as you are given the option to steal stuff from shops.

It is a well-crafted stealth/action game that introduces new elements at a measured pace. It forces you to make important decisions with your weapons and tools and to improvise  based on what you have on hand.\nFor example, there's a corridor that's lousy with statues that teleport behind you and beat you up when you look away from them. But they have to notice you first. It would've been nice to have the invisibilty spell, but I did have the block-creation spell and something that let me dig.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/252630/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","The first time I played Eldritch, I was significantly turned off by the Minecraft-esque graphics. I didn’t play it again for a good long while, but I did eventually give it a second chance. The graphics, as it turned out, worked with the game and playing through it turned out to be a very good time.\n\nI – Story [5/10]\n\nEldritch is a roguelike FPS with a kick ♥♥♥ Lovecraft theme and perma-death from the brilliant minds behind Minor Key Games. Story-wise, there’s not a whole lot to it though. You (the character) are trapped in a seemingly endless library filled with strange books that transport you to alien realms. In each realm, you must collect a spherical treasure to unlock the next and, ultimately, escape the library.\n\nII – UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface was as simple as they come. The mini-map in the corner (while a bit confusing initially) becomes vital to navigating the dungeons. It was easy to see what items you currently had in your inventory, stats were clearly displayed, and (after several runs) it wasn’t hard to decipher what spell you were currently wielding.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nGameplay is where Eldritch truly shines. Anytime a game has sprinting, it’s a good thing. Anytime a game has sliding, it’s a great thing. Anytime a game let’s me punch a shoggoth in the face before promptly being devoured for my foolish mortal bravery, it’s just fantastic.\n\nEldritch has that “one more run and then I’ll quit” quality that keeps you coming back for more. Every death down in the dungeons (be it from my own carelessness or at the tentacles of horrific monsters) got me just a little bit more hooked. It’s like a slot machine; ultimately frustrating, but impossible to walk away from.\n\nThe game itself looks simple, but it’s surprisingly deep. The replay value is very high, not to mention the addictive quality of it. I had no complaints about it as a whole.\n\nIV – Content [5/10]\n\nMuch to my chagrin, there was not enough content in Eldritch. Seeing H.P. Lovecraft’s creations brought to life is always a good thing, no matter what kind of graphics you’re dealing with. While there was a good amount of enemies to banish from the mortal realm, there weren’t nearly enough.\n\nAlso on this topic, there was a definite lack of items. One solid run in the dungeons can show you practically all the items you’ll be dealing with for the entire game.\n\nV – Visual [7/10]\n\nAs much as a appreciate the 8-bit like medium, I deeply wished it had not been so for Eldritch. A graphical re-work of this game could turn it in to a certifiable masterpiece, and, while the graphics do work with the overall feel of the game, it left me very wanting.\n\nVI – Audio [6/10]\n\nThere wasn’t much music in Eldritch, but what little music there was was pretty good. I enjoyed and it didn’t detract from the atmosphere in anyway.\n\nThe sound effects could have used some more variety however. You can quickly learn what sounds are coming from what monsters and, while this is a great thing to know as far as your survival is concerned, it gradually reduces the overarching tone of danger the longer you play and become more familiar with the game.\n\nVII – Overall [7.2/10]\n\nOn the whole, Eldritch is a great game and absolutely worth the price tag. If you can get it on sale, great, even better. If you’re looking for something new or your a fan of Lovecraft, this just may be the game for you.","January 15, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uhm... those damned statues.\n-Magic is very rewarding, but not cheap!\n-You can hurt yourself if you throw a stone in the air and catch it with your face.\n-You can make your own character, though this is very limited and doesn't really matter ingame.\n-You can share your deaths on Twitter, etc: "|R.I.P| I underestimated a shopkeeper in Temple of Nyarlathotep."\n-It really is a fun game if you like Dungeon crawlers.\n-Flickering with the lights in the Library is great for calming your nerves.\n-Beautiful Controller support.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-The Horrors are more Cute than they are Horrible, this disturbs me personally (you may have a different opinion).\n-It's kind of short, even though you can replay the game with an almost new experience every time.\n-About 5 maps (though generated, so it really isn't that much of a problem).\n-It needs to be more obvious that you have to place the Souls on the pedistals to get out of the Library.\n-More Objectives would be nice, rather then "Get out of the dungeon".\nI really like what they did with the Candles in the last map, it put some pressure on me while I was scratching for my last pieces of sanity.\n-I don't want to sound like a fanboy, but if I woke Nyarlathotep from his/her/its sleep, I'd be dead. The concept of "Me" would be unspeakable off and I'd disappear into a puff of unlogical inexplainations.\n-No boss fights!\nI know that'd be impossible due to the nature of some of these horrors, but I could see past that... iiiiif they were really hard bosses. I don't know why, but Boss fights would be awesome in this game.\n-The Knife is Overpowered. There, I said it.\nThe Knife is your drill that will pierce the heavens, the Knife is your light in the darkness, the Knife is the destroyer of Horrors.\nThe gun? Use that with the amulet of Destruction to gain access to everything everywhere.\nThe gun, is illogically enough, your actual Drill.\n-The Temple of Nyarlathotep should've been the last map in the Dungeon Book triangle.\nCall me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for claiming that Nyarlathotep is way more dangerous on the scale of planetary devouring than Cthulhu.\nBut besides "Uh! Muh Lore!" the Temple of Nyarlathotep was the most dangerous Book in the Library.\n-Unsatisfying ending. I know that most of H.P Lovecrafts and Friends books ends with "AND THEN THEY WENT INSANE." but it feels like it could've been more to that ending then we got.\n-You get the feeling that the game "COULD DO WHATEVER THE *Unspeakable* IT WANTS, HELL, THE WALL CAN EAT YOU. RIGHT. NOW. IF IT FELT LIKE IT." but the game doesn't surprise in such a way.\nI once ran into a book that took me to a dark pocket dimension-ish filled with Artifacts (Money) with this "DARE YOU ENTER MY *BLARGBLARG* REALM MOTHER*HORROR*!?"-feeling all over it.\nWhen I took all the cash I also found a pair of Sandals, a normal pair of Sandals.\nLogically, my brain went from "Something is wrong" to "I'm so dead." in 0.3 seconds, but nothing happened and I safely returned to the Library unharmed.\nAt this point it felt like something horrible could've happened, but didn't.\n-More Boomsticks! For variation! (It needs more guns, for variation!).\n-The game could've played more with insanity.\nI've played other Lovecraftian games where the developers loved to play with the players sanity.\nI for one have acted as a Game Master for a Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game and there was nothing more hillarious/rewarding then to play with peoples sanity.\nWould've been sweet with an sanity meter in Eldritch which (when low) caused hallucinations or noises that wasn't there.\n\nSummary:\nAs a Lovecraft fan, I'd say it was a bit off. A few things that wasn't true to the lore and stuff, nothing I couldn't ignore though.\nAs a Gamer, I'd say it was enjoyable. It was fun most of the time. Hard, challenging. Graphics isn't a big problem, doesn't make your eyes bleed, the game isn't harder because of it.\nEven if my Cons outwages the Pros, I still like it and I can't say I regret buying it.\n\nIf you like Medium/Fast paced Dungeon Crawlers with little story and soft pixelated graphics with Mythos running about, then this is the game for you.","April 24, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/252630/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","The first time I played Eldritch, I was significantly turned off by the Minecraft-esque graphics. I didn’t play it again for a good long while, but I did eventually give it a second chance. The graphics, as it turned out, worked with the game and playing through it turned out to be a very good time.\n\nI – Story [5/10]\n\nEldritch is a roguelike FPS with a kick ♥♥♥ Lovecraft theme and perma-death from the brilliant minds behind Minor Key Games. Story-wise, there’s not a whole lot to it though. You (the character) are trapped in a seemingly endless library filled with strange books that transport you to alien realms. In each realm, you must collect a spherical treasure to unlock the next and, ultimately, escape the library.\n\nII – UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface was as simple as they come. The mini-map in the corner (while a bit confusing initially) becomes vital to navigating the dungeons. It was easy to see what items you currently had in your inventory, stats were clearly displayed, and (after several runs) it wasn’t hard to decipher what spell you were currently wielding.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nGameplay is where Eldritch truly shines. Anytime a game has sprinting, it’s a good thing. Anytime a game has sliding, it’s a great thing. Anytime a game let’s me punch a shoggoth in the face before promptly being devoured for my foolish mortal bravery, it’s just fantastic.\n\nEldritch has that “one more run and then I’ll quit” quality that keeps you coming back for more. Every death down in the dungeons (be it from my own carelessness or at the tentacles of horrific monsters) got me just a little bit more hooked. It’s like a slot machine; ultimately frustrating, but impossible to walk away from.\n\nThe game itself looks simple, but it’s surprisingly deep. The replay value is very high, not to mention the addictive quality of it. I had no complaints about it as a whole.\n\nIV – Content [5/10]\n\nMuch to my chagrin, there was not enough content in Eldritch. Seeing H.P. Lovecraft’s creations brought to life is always a good thing, no matter what kind of graphics you’re dealing with. While there was a good amount of enemies to banish from the mortal realm, there weren’t nearly enough.\n\nAlso on this topic, there was a definite lack of items. One solid run in the dungeons can show you practically all the items you’ll be dealing with for the entire game.\n\nV – Visual [7/10]\n\nAs much as a appreciate the 8-bit like medium, I deeply wished it had not been so for Eldritch. A graphical re-work of this game could turn it in to a certifiable masterpiece, and, while the graphics do work with the overall feel of the game, it left me very wanting.\n\nVI – Audio [6/10]\n\nThere wasn’t much music in Eldritch, but what little music there was was pretty good. I enjoyed and it didn’t detract from the atmosphere in anyway.\n\nThe sound effects could have used some more variety however. You can quickly learn what sounds are coming from what monsters and, while this is a great thing to know as far as your survival is concerned, it gradually reduces the overarching tone of danger the longer you play and become more familiar with the game.\n\nVII – Overall [7.2/10]\n\nOn the whole, Eldritch is a great game and absolutely worth the price tag. If you can get it on sale, great, even better. If you’re looking for something new or your a fan of Lovecraft, this just may be the game for you.","January 15, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/252630/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","Based somewhat loosely on the writing of H.P. Lovecraft, Eldritch is a fairly easy "roguelite" with emphasis squarely on the "lite". The story, like much of Lovecraft's pulpy output, is paper thin (I'm a fan, but he was very inconsistent). You're trapped in some kind of magical library and you have to collect certain artifacts to close a portal and save the world from monsters. Elder-gods, I suppose. It doesn't really matter, to be honest. Apart from the occasional paragraph or two of flavour text, there's no real narrative.\n\nThe game has you descend through three seperate dungeons to collect the "Souls" of various powerful creatures, though they aren't bosses and you won't see them represented in the game. These dungeons are loosely themed as a cave, a sandy temple, and a poisonous jungle. Whenever you collect a soul you can return to the library and open a new book; a new dungeon to explore. These stay open even if you die, so once you've unlocked them all you can attempt them in any order you like, though as the first dungeon is so easy it's a great place to stock up on useful items and is the sensible one to do first. You can, if you like, dash through the mazelike levels and just head for the stairs down ignoring any items and enemies along the way, but sometimes you'll have to take a circuitous route. That is, unless you make your own path. Yep, levels are destructible, meaning you can use dynamite to simply explode a path to your goal. Great fun.\n\nWith its vivid colour palette and chunky voxel graphics, evocative of minecraft, Eldritch looks fairly cutesy and gentle, but this belies a genuine creepyness. Admittedly, this is barely apparent in the first dungeon, which is so easy that you can simply sprint around it, running circles around the enemies and laughing in their silly, fishy faces. There is one enemy here, a shoggoth, whose thick gurgling and grotesque alien appearance should give you cause for concern. Now, stealth seems a better option, and as you're crouched in a corner peering into the murk as the heaving blob hunts for you, vulnerability and fear creep up on you.\n\nThe shoggoth will have softened you up, but it's the game's second dungeon that really shakes things up and definitely stands out as the one most deserving of respect. You might want to tread carefully around those curious, croc faced statues; they aren't so innocuous as they appear. And watch out for the softly moving wraith, which can't be dispatched by mortal means. There are enemies that are common to all dungeons, like the shuffling, sighing cultits (sounding not unlike Grandad pottering about the house in his slippers) or bad-tempered bugs which seem to fight with anything they encounter. They'll seem like old friends, now. Eldritch has finally got its claws out, and they're sharper than they look.\n\nIn truth, the lack of variety in Eldritch means that it will be only a few hours before you're used to the tricks and tracks laid out in the various dungeons, and you'll be back to sprinting confidently from room to room. In four hours, I've beaten the game and a longer optional dungeon, and it's fairly telling that there's an achievement for speedrunning the game in under ten minutes. It isn't a long game, but it is quite charming and easy to get into. It's a shame that often, the fear comes less from the atmosphere than from a run ending prematurely, meaning having to start over. If there were a bit more variety, it would soften the blow, but if you can get Eldritch for a few quid, you'll not feel hard done.","December 18, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022966490/recommended/252630/","76561198022966490","GentlemanRedneckGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022966490/","56 products in account","Quick review: Well worth the purchase, spend your money on this product.\n\nLonger review: Eldritch is the kind of game a lot of us roguelike fans look for. Each world you enter has 3 levels, each level having 3 layers, which at first doesn't sound like a lot. However each level is made by several randomly generated 'squares' holding random items, enemies and secrets to hunt out. Sometimes the generated parts don't seem to fit in with the squares next to it but considering the lovecraftian theme of the game this really only adds to the bizarre non-euclidean feel to the worlds with each world feeling increasingly dangerous and bizarre.\n\nNow a bad part of this game is that if you push through with a speed run it's not hard to finish, however the real charm to this game is taking your time to explore every nook and cranny of the levels you're in. Finding the little secrets and involving yourself in the survival aspect of the game is really what brings out the charm and tension the game has in spades.\n\nLovecraft fans  will get a huge kick out of identifying the various monsters you can slay (or more likely run away from) and even get a laugh out of the shopkeepers that are unique to each world (The veiled lady Shoggoth was my personal favourite). Speaking of shopkeepers the game really has a great mechanic in the form of artifacts, which act as both your source of magic and currency. Do you spend the artifacts you have to get some vital upgrades in the shop, or save them for the unholy powers granted by the Cthulhu statues? Or even put them into your bank, to save in case you die later on? Bullets are also somewhat scarce to come by and sooner or later you WILL find yourself falling back on to stealth to sneak past enemies or risk going up behind them and taking them by surprise. Another great mechanic lies in if you want to loot the fallen foes for possible ammo, keys or artifacts but be warned, looted foes WILL rise again to continue hunting you through the levels. More than once you'll find yourself making the tough choices to risk another battle with a monster just to gamble on getting an extra key or much needed revolver ammo.\n\nYou could maybe point out the blocky graphics count as a negative but for us born before the year 2000 the graphics only add an old school FPS look to everything, when games would punish you for making mistakes and, trust me, this game will PUNISH YOU for acting cocky or not thinking an action through. Think you're tough because you've got full health and a strong weapon? You'll be cursing blind when something leaps out at you from the shadows and mauls you to death because you weren't checking every corner for fishmen, star-spawn or cultists.\n\nIf I was to think of anything truly negative I would say the repetitive enemies and the occasionally simplistic AI can take you out the game, especially when you find the block power or find yourself knifing a Elder Spawn to death by strafing around it. It can be very easy to MAKE the game easy if you know what you're doing and finding the high ground early on is a good way to make things easier (until the flying eyes come at you...).\n\nIn all this game is a fantastic buy and very involving, especially from what I understand is a small two-man stuido. I hope they produce more content for Eldritch in the future. Absolutely recommended!","August 27, 2014","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player must simply navigat from one end of each stage to the other, fighting off various tentacled, disgusting, gibbering flavors of "Oh god, kill it, kill it, kill it!". Along the way, you find weapons and equipment and meat to aid your trek. The game strikes a good balance of risk versus reward through the gameplay. You can't take many hits without dying and healing gets a bit sparse later on, so caution is a necessity at all times, but without a good amount of excess exploration, you'll quickly run out of supplies. Monsters also drop items and respawn indefinitely, but charging out to kill things is always a bit risky. It helps to set a nice atmosphere that, while you have a lot of power over the obstacles you'll face, it doesn't take many mistakes to see you fail. It's a game that greatly rewards patience and caution, while swiftly punishes recklessness. This balance is highly reminiscent of Spelunky in the best ways. While the difficulty starts out a bit insultingly easy, it quickly ramps up into a perfect sweet spot of hectic tension. The selection of items and spells, however, could use a little work. I never really found myself deviating from the set of items I was using and quickly equipping myself with them each new playthrough. For this type of game, always having access to one's preferred loadout, seems a bit off. As a suggestion, perhaps equipment should wear out over time, forcing the player to make do with what they can scrounge up, which seems more suited to this type of game. As for the spells, I think there just need to be more that can compete with the utility of Materialize. I mean, come on. The musis is good, and doesn't interfere with the profoundly important cocktails of squaks and hisses emanating from potential nearby threats. The graphics are, well, modest. It's not exactly going to push the limits of anyone's system , but you can tell right away what everything is supposed to be. Well, not the monsters, but that's  not really because of the graphics. One complaint I have to make is that the particle effects have an annoying linger about them, especially the one coming from the player's left hand at all times. I frequently found myself jumping, thinking I had seen something out of the corner of my eye, only to realize it was an errant particle from the trail I was leaving, which was a tad irritating. On the whole, there isn't really much content here, but what there is is very well made and fun to play. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy Spelunky and other similar games.","August 21, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/252630/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","Based somewhat loosely on the writing of H.P. Lovecraft, Eldritch is a fairly easy "roguelite" with emphasis squarely on the "lite". The story, like much of Lovecraft's pulpy output, is paper thin (I'm a fan, but he was very inconsistent). You're trapped in some kind of magical library and you have to collect certain artifacts to close a portal and save the world from monsters. Elder-gods, I suppose. It doesn't really matter, to be honest. Apart from the occasional paragraph or two of flavour text, there's no real narrative.\n\nThe game has you descend through three seperate dungeons to collect the "Souls" of various powerful creatures, though they aren't bosses and you won't see them represented in the game. These dungeons are loosely themed as a cave, a sandy temple, and a poisonous jungle. Whenever you collect a soul you can return to the library and open a new book; a new dungeon to explore. These stay open even if you die, so once you've unlocked them all you can attempt them in any order you like, though as the first dungeon is so easy it's a great place to stock up on useful items and is the sensible one to do first. You can, if you like, dash through the mazelike levels and just head for the stairs down ignoring any items and enemies along the way, but sometimes you'll have to take a circuitous route. That is, unless you make your own path. Yep, levels are destructible, meaning you can use dynamite to simply explode a path to your goal. Great fun.\n\nWith its vivid colour palette and chunky voxel graphics, evocative of minecraft, Eldritch looks fairly cutesy and gentle, but this belies a genuine creepyness. Admittedly, this is barely apparent in the first dungeon, which is so easy that you can simply sprint around it, running circles around the enemies and laughing in their silly, fishy faces. There is one enemy here, a shoggoth, whose thick gurgling and grotesque alien appearance should give you cause for concern. Now, stealth seems a better option, and as you're crouched in a corner peering into the murk as the heaving blob hunts for you, vulnerability and fear creep up on you.\n\nThe shoggoth will have softened you up, but it's the game's second dungeon that really shakes things up and definitely stands out as the one most deserving of respect. You might want to tread carefully around those curious, croc faced statues; they aren't so innocuous as they appear. And watch out for the softly moving wraith, which can't be dispatched by mortal means. There are enemies that are common to all dungeons, like the shuffling, sighing cultits (sounding not unlike Grandad pottering about the house in his slippers) or bad-tempered bugs which seem to fight with anything they encounter. They'll seem like old friends, now. Eldritch has finally got its claws out, and they're sharper than they look.\n\nIn truth, the lack of variety in Eldritch means that it will be only a few hours before you're used to the tricks and tracks laid out in the various dungeons, and you'll be back to sprinting confidently from room to room. In four hours, I've beaten the game and a longer optional dungeon, and it's fairly telling that there's an achievement for speedrunning the game in under ten minutes. It isn't a long game, but it is quite charming and easy to get into. It's a shame that often, the fear comes less from the atmosphere than from a run ending prematurely, meaning having to start over. If there were a bit more variety, it would soften the blow, but if you can get Eldritch for a few quid, you'll not feel hard done.","December 18, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072459641/recommended/252630/","76561198072459641","Obscuritan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072459641/","181 products in account","TL;DR - This game's definitely worth playing, but not necessarily beating, depending on how much time you can put into it. How-Rogue-like-you-like-it?\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd say this is more of a horror game that uses elements like procedural generation, permadeath and the inability to save to enhance the experience rather than a true Rogue-like (or Rogue-lite) game. Elements such as the changes to the level layout and item locations each time you play it, as well as excellent sound design on the echoing cries of enemies and some nice touches in the art style (specifically how the subtle bulges on the walls warp the straight lines on them as the camera moves, making them seem to 'writhe') help build a sense of unease and dread as you creep around. As a Lovecraft fan I was delighted by recognizing the different creatures as enemies and appreciated the theming of the level around its elder being (the dry colours of Nyarlathotep, the 'wetness' of Dagon etc), though they're interesting enough that they wouldn't be lost on someone more casually aware of the mythos.\n\nThis all makes the game worth playing (at least, I think so), but is it worth beating? I mentioned the permadeath, and that will be the big 'make or break' for many players. In order to beat this game you have to finish all three of the 'main' stages (more have been added in patches since release, but I don't believe they count) AND the final level, all on one life. You can save and quit to pick up on where you left off, and deposit money you find in certain places for later that carries over, but you start from the beginning with nothing upon death. For example the furthest I got was beating the Dagon stage and half of Nyarlathotep before I died, and upon respawning my having won Dagon was undone. For those unfamiliar with Rogue-likes this may be a table-flipping moment; for those who know the score, that's part of the thrill. This means however that in order to beat the game you'll have to keep playing over and over until the circumstances to achieve it are just right (or "the stars are correctly alligned", if you will) or to have played so much of the game that you've memorized all the enemy and boss behaviours and all the possible hazards AND don't get screwed by the RNG. This is further reinforced with the Steam Achievements the game offers - beat the game in under 10 minutes, beat it without taking any damage, collect 9,999 coins etc. One can hardly blame a developer for wanting players to play a lot of their game, but for some this may be more time than they can put in.\n\nFor the Lovecraft fan who's less inclined towards this genre it's still worth giving a go if it's on sale for the ambience and tension of the first few attempts, but if you're seriously inclined towards Roguelikes, or are a Completionist, take a look at some of the other reviews on here to see what the game's long-term prospects are. I liked it, I'll keep playing it, but I doubt I'll beat the entire thing.","December 9, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound is expertly used in this game, where you can hear heavy breathing of a monster lurking nearby as you try to crouch just around the corner. Sends chills down my spine each time.\n\nFor a rouge-like, this game is more about stealth and trying to get the most out of the few resources you can cobble together. It provides a fresh challenge while refraining from feeling too difficult to impede on your fun. While playing, the hours will melt away faster than the flesh off of your smiling face.\n\nA definite must-play for any lover of Lovecraft.","November 17, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do agree that originally, it was really short. I was SUPER excited when I found out that they included the mountains of madness... Which I haven't beaten, of course.\n\nWhat scares me about this most of all is the sounds. The constant sound of them and the feel that I don't really know what's going on is awful. There is nothing worst than the sound of a shoggoth somewhere in the level, and you've got no idea where or how many there are. Even worst is when its wife is the shop owne, and you decide to steal. *shudders*\n\nThe game can be short, sweet, and to the point. This can mean that you've won by being one smart little sh**, or that you died. Repeatedly. It's definitely a roguelike in that when you die... You start all over. So don't die.\n\nI question myself whether it's worth its listed price. Right now, with the MOuntains of Madness, I think it is. I wouldn't mind more updates in the future, say, adding more notes and minor references to Lovecraft's works. This could be in secrets, too, and in maybe a couple new weaons. Doesn't have to be fancy; like, a special type of bladed weapon in the sandy level, and so on and so forth.\n\nThat said, above all else, I do recommend this game- IF you like Lovecraft's works. Otherwise, you may not get it, and it may not be your taste. Lovecraft isn't nearly as dry as Poe was, but he can definitely be dry.

The story is pretty simple, wake up in library  with no memories and the only door locked with the keys in books that you must get through. While the gameplay is also simple the difficulty quickly works it's way up as you go through the the 3 books, with various challengs unique to each one. Once you get the keys you can leave, and you unock the new game plus mode which make the game much harder. The enmeies are quite varied and take plenty of unfluence from the love craftian side of horor. With basic cultists at the start, working you way all the way to unkown horrors that I really can't explain besides godzilla.\n\nThis is a very caual rouge like. Death actaully means something, and dying means getting sent all the way to the start since there is no way to save besides starting at the point you left the game. If your looking for a nice game to play for a good 30 minutes or so, should definatley pick this up.","November 30, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uhm... those damned statues.\n-Magic is very rewarding, but not cheap!\n-You can hurt yourself if you throw a stone in the air and catch it with your face.\n-You can make your own character, though this is very limited and doesn't really matter ingame.\n-You can share your deaths on Twitter, etc: "|R.I.P| I underestimated a shopkeeper in Temple of Nyarlathotep."\n-It really is a fun game if you like Dungeon crawlers.\n-Flickering with the lights in the Library is great for calming your nerves.\n-Beautiful Controller support.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-The Horrors are more Cute than they are Horrible, this disturbs me personally (you may have a different opinion).\n-It's kind of short, even though you can replay the game with an almost new experience every time.\n-About 5 maps (though generated, so it really isn't that much of a problem).\n-It needs to be more obvious that you have to place the Souls on the pedistals to get out of the Library.\n-More Objectives would be nice, rather then "Get out of the dungeon".\nI really like what they did with the Candles in the last map, it put some pressure on me while I was scratching for my last pieces of sanity.\n-I don't want to sound like a fanboy, but if I woke Nyarlathotep from his/her/its sleep, I'd be dead. The concept of "Me" would be unspeakable off and I'd disappear into a puff of unlogical inexplainations.\n-No boss fights!\nI know that'd be impossible due to the nature of some of these horrors, but I could see past that... iiiiif they were really hard bosses. I don't know why, but Boss fights would be awesome in this game.\n-The Knife is Overpowered. There, I said it.\nThe Knife is your drill that will pierce the heavens, the Knife is your light in the darkness, the Knife is the destroyer of Horrors.\nThe gun? Use that with the amulet of Destruction to gain access to everything everywhere.\nThe gun, is illogically enough, your actual Drill.\n-The Temple of Nyarlathotep should've been the last map in the Dungeon Book triangle.\nCall me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for claiming that Nyarlathotep is way more dangerous on the scale of planetary devouring than Cthulhu.\nBut besides "Uh! Muh Lore!" the Temple of Nyarlathotep was the most dangerous Book in the Library.\n-Unsatisfying ending. I know that most of H.P Lovecrafts and Friends books ends with "AND THEN THEY WENT INSANE." but it feels like it could've been more to that ending then we got.\n-You get the feeling that the game "COULD DO WHATEVER THE *Unspeakable* IT WANTS, HELL, THE WALL CAN EAT YOU. RIGHT. NOW. IF IT FELT LIKE IT." but the game doesn't surprise in such a way.\nI once ran into a book that took me to a dark pocket dimension-ish filled with Artifacts (Money) with this "DARE YOU ENTER MY *BLARGBLARG* REALM MOTHER*HORROR*!?"-feeling all over it.\nWhen I took all the cash I also found a pair of Sandals, a normal pair of Sandals.\nLogically, my brain went from "Something is wrong" to "I'm so dead." in 0.3 seconds, but nothing happened and I safely returned to the Library unharmed.\nAt this point it felt like something horrible could've happened, but didn't.\n-More Boomsticks! For variation! (It needs more guns, for variation!).\n-The game could've played more with insanity.\nI've played other Lovecraftian games where the developers loved to play with the players sanity.\nI for one have acted as a Game Master for a Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game and there was nothing more hillarious/rewarding then to play with peoples sanity.\nWould've been sweet with an sanity meter in Eldritch which (when low) caused hallucinations or noises that wasn't there.\n\nSummary:\nAs a Lovecraft fan, I'd say it was a bit off. A few things that wasn't true to the lore and stuff, nothing I couldn't ignore though.\nAs a Gamer, I'd say it was enjoyable. It was fun most of the time. Hard, challenging. Graphics isn't a big problem, doesn't make your eyes bleed, the game isn't harder because of it.\nEven if my Cons outwages the Pros, I still like it and I can't say I regret buying it.\n\nIf you like Medium/Fast paced Dungeon Crawlers with little story and soft pixelated graphics with Mythos running about, then this is the game for you.","April 24, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, well-designed, surprisingly atmospheric, and even a bit terrifying at times (there's at least one enemy that will keep you extremely paranoid).\n\nMy favorite part about the game is the 3D design of the levels. Each floor has multiple "sub-floors" and there are a lot of ways to move between sub-floors. Finding the exit is usually not too difficult, but finding your way to a shop or other area of interest can be surprisingly involved. There are also ways to get around this such as dynamite and pickaxes, which really take advantage of the 3D maze design.\n\nWhile the game itself is a bit short, it can take a good number of attempts to complete it, not counting the extra campaign that can be accessed right from the start. Survival means learning the hazards of each area and how each enemy behaves. There's a lot of challenge to this game, but it ultimately feels fair.\n\nThere's also a decent amount of extra stuff to go for when you beat the game, such as a harder new game+ mode, a super-tough extra area with a leaderboard, some challenging achievements, and more.\n\nAs someone who was just getting tired of roguelikes, this game was refreshing and fun.","June 20, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nyarlathotep?  *dueling banjos plays*\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a serious note this is a First Person Shooter based off of the writings of Howard Phillip Lovecraft. You start as a Librarian of sorts, in a mysterious library with books littered about teeming with information. You find out that you are bound to this place an act as a gaurdian agaisnt the terrors of the Old Ones. There are some books that give off a shimmer and act as a portal to another dimension inhabited by Cultists, Dæmons and other Horrors that could plague the mind and soul. You have a chest that can store Artifacts which act as currency, the Deep Ones seem to cherish them and some will act neutral to even barter for them. Exploring these non-Euclidean realms takes a toll on ones perspective, they are never the same and have no definite structure. If you perish you simply re-awaken in the library, any Artifacts stored and items left here will stay, yet anything collected will be gone. Entering once again into these worlds that seem wrong, a strange tingle or sense just behind the nose, a scent of sorts. In the many works and studies these scholars or gaurdians what have you, a theory of pineal gland enlargement and extra-sensory perception is documented. Another book, going through them its never the same and there are so many! I went down through at least three gateways, faced what seemed to be, as best as I can describe it through my recent studies is a Shoggoth. I was terrified! At first it didn't make much sense, those Deep Ones could just be mutants or an actual bipedal, semi-intelligent race that evolved along with Humankind. That could be possible, right? But this, this was different. At first I struck out wildly with my dagger, nothing  but violent screams and lashing tentacle like appendages. I could see its gnashing maw and those unearthly eyes that seemed to see infinitly deep into my very being. My mind broke, I could somehow understand but to only comprehend I must let go of my sanity. I pushed away, firing my pistol wildly into its oozing form and managed to safely get away...or so I thought. Tekeli-li Shoggoth, Tekeli-li Shoggoth. I tossed a bundle of dynamite I found towards its protoplasmic form and missed my mark, it detonating meters behind the creature. Stell'bsna wgah'n shagg tharanak shugg syha'h. Things are different now, I haven't been here before but was there anyways. How pages have I read so far? Am I reading or am I acutally inside them? Honestly I can't remember if I dreamt that after reading some of these books or it acutally happened. But there is a dagger and pistol on the counter that I don't recall having earlier. Was I asleep? Where would I sleep? Geb agl ehye'bthnk c fhtagn ee. They can't reach me through these books can they? I have all the lights on in the library that I could find, I remember reading something about right angles, the way perceived space effected time, and how time could catch up to you....hunt you down itself. ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.

The game has its flaws, but they are overshadowed by its successes.\n\nBefore I begin, you should know that I do not play many first-person shooters, and almost no horror games to speak of. Eldritch is not a "horrror" game per se, but seeks to encourage a similar atmosphere and as such was a newer experience to me than it might be for many others.\n\nEldritch is a strange combination of Lovecraftian horror and first-person-shooter that somehow managed to blend its disparate elements together very well.\nAnything with a Lovecraftian atmosphere should attempt to mimic the tone and atmosphere of its inspiration - the entire point of which was to make the reader feel not only helpless and hopeless, but utterly insignificant. First-person-shooters, on the far end of the spectrum, are most often about empowering the player to often absurd levels, though recently the trend has been to take a more 'realistic' disempowering approach.\n\nIf you're willing to jump into the game with your eyes closed - which is easy, as the trailer gives off the entirely wrong atmosphere - the game can begin as very disempowering, and even very unsettling. The use of FOV, lighting, background noise and uncanny help to establish a horror setting early, but still leave the player plenty of room to maneuver.\nThe feeling of uneasiness is sadly fleeting for most of the game, however. Once you learn how the stealth system works and how the enemy AI reacts, most of the game is actually fairly easy. The "eldritch abominations" usually die with a few whacks from a knife or shots from a pistol, and an easily-locatable backpack item lets you revive as many times as you have enough artifacts (in-game currency) to afford.\nTowards the end of the game, presuming you have the presence of mind to find the three special (useless) equipment items, the tone shifts toward disempowerment again. Some enemies will either be very strong or downright invincible, and once you're no longer able to slip past them like a whisper or revive yourself after death, the feeling of uneasiness returns as you realize that it will only take a few mistakes to end the game. Usually, that is not a terrible consequence, but because dying in Eldritch results in having to start over from the beginning, it (often) means losing hours of progress. This was a good design choice, I think, because it makes the closing of the game difficult and forces the player to adopt extra caution in their movements.\n\nThis game is not the strongest example of first-person-shooting, exploration, Lovecraftian horror or even unease-inducing atmosphere on Steam. But it does each job well enough to blend into something interesting and, to my eyes at least, unique.","December 1, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It for me was really quite fun, it has a creepy atmosphere as you get deeper into the game and some enemies are really quie scary.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/future-derpy/recommended/252630/","future-derpy","Future Derpy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/future-derpy/","80 products in account","A fantastic rouge-like styled after the classic horror novels by H.P. Lovecraft with difficulty only matched by its tense atmosphere and wonderful diversity in each play. It's by no means simple and you most certainly won't complete it in your first ten, twenty, fifty attempts! Heck, even with a huge statement like that I've only put a hearty 12+ hours into it so it's most certainly "learnable." It all relies on how quickly you can gracefully adapt to the game's changing environments... And I do mean gracefully. After mastering the game's controls (running, jumping, sliding, leaping and all that will be used quite frequently) you almost feel like you're being thrown around the map! On top of that you have a simple but hardly repetitive group of enemies to deal with ranging from fish-men to flying... organs? It's easy to conclude "well this is just impossible" but the game actually does have quite a few ways to completing it! Throwing yourself into the storm over and over won't do you much good so it's always good to take on a strategy. I've recently found stealthiness to be the ultimate path but you do have to be ready to lose some 35-50 minutes instantly from simple mistakes. If you don't feel like taking on all "three" worlds at once (it's difficult beyond comprehension but I've done it multiple times!) you can also try the Mountains of Madness: 10 levels of pure hell to retrieve your plane keys (keeping close to the books as always) and then heading all 10 levels back up to the surface! Fun alternative, right? Except.... Well, It's super tense and you'll get lost more than once as it begins to feel more like a labyrinth.\n\nSPOILERS/TIPS\n\nA great way to start any campaign is by grabbing the compass from Dagon [The first world ] and returning to The Library. Next you'll probably want to do the Trick or Treat world [ the pumpkin in the bar area ] be prepared to spend about 2-5 minutes here gathering materials for your next run! After you've grabbed a grappling hook and a gun with over 15+ ammo, return to The Library and re-enter Dagon. Complete the first world as so:\n[for beginners]:\n-Always look for a way down and try not to re-enter previously entered rooms\n-Avoid looting dead bodies... and don't waste ammo on those that don't need to be killed!\n-Press Z to throw items (great if you need to drop your gun/grappling hook for a takeout punch)\n-Hold spacebar to lift yourself over ledges! It took me almost 8 hours to realize this... it'll save you keys and such, allow you into new rooms, and save you from getting stuck in holes\n-run and press C (the crouch button for sneaking) to do a power-slide! You'll look cool AND it'll make your jumps longer!\n\n[For returning players]\n-Approach levels slowly! Pay attention to the map! Knowing your surroundings is almost necessary to escaping any level\n-If the opportunity to rush through a floor is available then you should most certainly take it; especially in later levels where there are tons of baddies chasing you down\n-don't hug walls unless you're sneaking; enemies can easily get the jump on you\n-try not to forget to peek around corners if you're uncertain how safe a room is (C+E/Q). You can shoot and cast spells when you're in this position\n-It took me nearly 70 attempts to complete the game and I have no doubt it'll take plenty less for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/recommended/252630/","mistersneak","mistersneak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/","667 products in account","I have a particular interest in first-person realtime roguelike dungeon crawlers. If you've stuck around for that 8-word (or 5 combo-word) genre description, stick around for more because I'm gonna tell you what I think Eldritch does right and wrong by that genre.\n\nI want to sing some praises of the game.\nCharacter Control - Lean (left and right), crouch, slide (run/crouch), mantle (ledge climb).\nAs simple as these four mechanics are, I feel they are essential for making a player feel like they are actually interacting with the environment instead of just... sliding through it with WSAD and jump alone. Third person action games are practically all Prince of Persia with the amount of climbing you do, but first-person games rarely attempt much. I appreciate Eldritch's effort here.\n\nInteresting Enemies - There are a couple that really force you to play differently, and one in a way that I had never seen in a game before. Others provide some fun flavor that's just enjoyable to interact with.\n\nStealth - Most roguelikes don't feature any meaningful stealth mechanic. Thanks to the character control, Eldritch is very rewarding of careful, thoughtful advancement through its mazes. Since your character has little HP and healing is not terribly common, remaining in control of how you advance is essential to a sense of agency in a game that is otherwise random.\n\nHere are some Meh issues -\n\nUninteresting Enemies - Most of the enemies have a boring fireball attack as their only offense. They are also highly predictable when pursuing you.\n\nShops - Too sparse and expensive. The "bank" system which allows you store the game's currency from life to life isn't easy enough to access to make spending money worthwhile, which is a shame because some of the items really improve the experience.\n\nLength and Difficulty - After 5 hours and only 8 deaths, I beat Eldritch.  After you learn the enemy behavior, deaths only result from stupid mistakes or unlucky coincidences, so it doesn't give that broad sense of growth and education that good roguelikes have. The game also allows you to collect orbs to unlock "shortcuts" to the later dungeons (there are 3 to unlock), but to actually beat the game you have to collect all the orbs in a single life anyway. So the shortcuts are only practical for practice, not for actual progress. The result is that the length of the game feels artificial and tedious, rather than hard-earned and rewarding.\n\nThe Ending - Getting to the end of a roguelike typically takes a lot of effort and it's nice to feel like your effort is tracked somewhere or you have some incentive to... do better or something. Eldritch says "you won and it's anticlimactic," in not so many words.\n\nFeature Light - The game feels a little hollow, probably as a result of lacking variety in the game mechanics, enemy, and level event variety. This makes me appreciate the control mechanics even more.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad I played Eldritch. It's made me aware of problems I'd have never considered for my own interest in the genre and it had its moments of excitement and inspiration.  I'll definitely continue to play Eldritch as they release more updates.","May 27, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard to describe, but my best approximation would be a first-person, Lovecraft-flavored Binding of Isaac. If you haven't played Isaac, just know that it's a 'roguelike', which is to say every playthrough is randomly generated.\nThe Good- It's a roguelike, so it has a lot of replay value.\nThere are a lot of items and pieces of equipment you can use, so there's some fun to be had customizing your loadout.\nThe atmosphere is pretty effective (relatively speaking), and I appreciated the lack of music (which enhanced the survival horror vibe.)\nInteresting setup, concept, and general excecution.\n\nThe Bad- It's a roguelike, so you're trapped at the mercy of the Random Number God. He is not a benevolent diety.\nIt's pretty limited graphically - it's stylized, and everything looks like it's supposed to, but the polygons and weird animation (especially on the arms) means it's pretty unlikely to scare you.\nThere are a few absolutely game-breaking loadouts that are pretty easy to get in any given run, making it a cakewalk once they've been discovered.\nThe game is, barring RNG-induced errors, very easy overall. The maker of the game did say he intended it to be that way, but the execution is rather jarring - once you learn the basic rules and patterns of the game, all conflicts boil down to either speedbumps on the road to victory (walk at monster, slash with knife) or nightmarish, luck-based impossibility (*******ING LIZARD STATUES).\nThe story has a bit of potential, but the delivery (text screens that pop up narrating the action) is completely uninvolving.\n\nOn the whole, this is a fun game. It's not a deep parable about the meaning of existence or a titan of gameplay innovation, but it's an interesting use of time, if nothing else.","May 17, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is actually challenging with an entertaining mysterious storyline that you can find if you're so inclined. It's not required to complete the game, but it helps. What I thought was a shooting Lovecraftian game turned out to require a lot more stealth than I expected, as well as strategy.\n\nDying starts the entire game over completely, and since every 'dungeon' is randomly generated I suppose you could call it 'rogue-like' but only in a very broad sense since it's so short. You'll get maybe a day or two of good play out of this, depending on your skill level.\n\nThe enemies are entertaining and some require strategy to defeat. I say defeat, because quite a few of them are un-killable. This doesn't hinder the game, it actually helps the challenge.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun Lovecraftian horror however, this is not it. It borrows from the Mythos, but only in a very loose way. The names of all involved have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\nStoryline: 4/10 - Not necessary, but good none the less.\nGraphics: 4/10 - You do not play a game like this for what they loosely refer to as 'graphics'.\nSound: 6/10 - I don't actually remember any music, but hte sounds and ambiance are fantastic.\nGameplay: 8/10 - Frustrating, challenging, thoughtful.

It's fun, well-designed, surprisingly atmospheric, and even a bit terrifying at times (there's at least one enemy that will keep you extremely paranoid).\n\nMy favorite part about the game is the 3D design of the levels. Each floor has multiple "sub-floors" and there are a lot of ways to move between sub-floors. Finding the exit is usually not too difficult, but finding your way to a shop or other area of interest can be surprisingly involved. There are also ways to get around this such as dynamite and pickaxes, which really take advantage of the 3D maze design.\n\nWhile the game itself is a bit short, it can take a good number of attempts to complete it, not counting the extra campaign that can be accessed right from the start. Survival means learning the hazards of each area and how each enemy behaves. There's a lot of challenge to this game, but it ultimately feels fair.\n\nThere's also a decent amount of extra stuff to go for when you beat the game, such as a harder new game+ mode, a super-tough extra area with a leaderboard, some challenging achievements, and more.\n\nAs someone who was just getting tired of roguelikes, this game was refreshing and fun.","June 20, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first time invokes terror, a terror that, like many games, you eventually dispel as you finally make your way to your first victory, only to return when you're low on health, and hear something around the corner. The moments of fear are gripping, the moments of action thrilling. There is a true lucidity of design here, it feels as though everything is in its place for a reason. I felt satisfaction and anguish in equal measure, stabbing many a cultist in the back only to duck into a narrow crevasse a moment later, waiting for the sounds of a Shoggoth to recede into the distance. My blood has chilled as a monster of stone has spotted me, and I have stalked through R'lyeh, fearful of waking its denizens. Immersive and well worth the price, this game comes highly recommended.

P. Lovecraft. I was sucked in almost immediately, and have been playing it non-stop since I installed it a week or so ago. The randomly-generated nature of the game lends replayability, and the enemy design is awesome. Hands down the best thing about this game is its music - ambient guitar tracks lend a strange, spooky, warped atmosphere that really makes you feel like you're in the Lost Tomb of Nyarlathotep or warndering around R'lyeh, exploring worlds that should not be and that humans were not meant to walk in. The atmosphere of the game's worlds is genuinely unnerving in some levels, particularly the Cthulhu and Mountains of Madness levels - the first time you hear a Star Spawn wheeze or see an Elder Thing or Mi-go come wobbling after you out of the fog is the last time you're going to want to.\n\nIf I do have one gripe about the game itself, it's that it may be an unforgiving challenge for newcomers to the idea of rogue and rogue-lite gameplay, and can be tough with its enemies often doing more damage than your overall health. However, there are plenty of ways to boost your health or give yourself an edge, provided you have the artifacts - in-game money you get by looting corpses and exploring around - meaning that the game's not too tough given enough practice.\n\nOne more thing - this Lovecraft fan is a little disappointed in the character model for the Mi-go in the Mountains of Madness chapter (they don't look very Mi-go-ish...), and is utterly confused as to why there are Lizardmen in Nyarlathotep's book (Yig is the snake/reptile Great Old One, Nyarly's actually an Outer God and much more powerful). I'm also confused about why there are two lower-level Lovecraftian deities (Cthulhu and Dagon) mixed in with Nyarlathotep, a much more powerful deity. Why not use Hastur or something, or use Cthulhu, Nyarly, and Yog-Sothoth or something? That's just the Lovecraft purist in me though, and definitely doesn't detract from the overall game in a way most people would notice.\n\nBottom line is this: This game is a great little rogue-lite for Lovecraft fans and those new to his works alike, or for anyone who likes a little Survival in their Cosmic Horror Story. It hits a good chunk of Lovecraftian themes right on the head, and it's definitely addicting for those who like a bit of challenge. I would recommend it, but not if you're not into rogue-lites/rogues or Lovecraftian Horror.","January 10, 2015","true","165.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, well-designed, surprisingly atmospheric, and even a bit terrifying at times (there's at least one enemy that will keep you extremely paranoid).\n\nMy favorite part about the game is the 3D design of the levels. Each floor has multiple "sub-floors" and there are a lot of ways to move between sub-floors. Finding the exit is usually not too difficult, but finding your way to a shop or other area of interest can be surprisingly involved. There are also ways to get around this such as dynamite and pickaxes, which really take advantage of the 3D maze design.\n\nWhile the game itself is a bit short, it can take a good number of attempts to complete it, not counting the extra campaign that can be accessed right from the start. Survival means learning the hazards of each area and how each enemy behaves. There's a lot of challenge to this game, but it ultimately feels fair.\n\nThere's also a decent amount of extra stuff to go for when you beat the game, such as a harder new game+ mode, a super-tough extra area with a leaderboard, some challenging achievements, and more.\n\nAs someone who was just getting tired of roguelikes, this game was refreshing and fun.","June 20, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nyarlathotep?  *dueling banjos plays*\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a serious note this is a First Person Shooter based off of the writings of Howard Phillip Lovecraft. You start as a Librarian of sorts, in a mysterious library with books littered about teeming with information. You find out that you are bound to this place an act as a gaurdian agaisnt the terrors of the Old Ones. There are some books that give off a shimmer and act as a portal to another dimension inhabited by Cultists, Dæmons and other Horrors that could plague the mind and soul. You have a chest that can store Artifacts which act as currency, the Deep Ones seem to cherish them and some will act neutral to even barter for them. Exploring these non-Euclidean realms takes a toll on ones perspective, they are never the same and have no definite structure. If you perish you simply re-awaken in the library, any Artifacts stored and items left here will stay, yet anything collected will be gone. Entering once again into these worlds that seem wrong, a strange tingle or sense just behind the nose, a scent of sorts. In the many works and studies these scholars or gaurdians what have you, a theory of pineal gland enlargement and extra-sensory perception is documented. Another book, going through them its never the same and there are so many! I went down through at least three gateways, faced what seemed to be, as best as I can describe it through my recent studies is a Shoggoth. I was terrified! At first it didn't make much sense, those Deep Ones could just be mutants or an actual bipedal, semi-intelligent race that evolved along with Humankind. That could be possible, right? But this, this was different. At first I struck out wildly with my dagger, nothing  but violent screams and lashing tentacle like appendages. I could see its gnashing maw and those unearthly eyes that seemed to see infinitly deep into my very being. My mind broke, I could somehow understand but to only comprehend I must let go of my sanity. I pushed away, firing my pistol wildly into its oozing form and managed to safely get away...or so I thought. Tekeli-li Shoggoth, Tekeli-li Shoggoth. I tossed a bundle of dynamite I found towards its protoplasmic form and missed my mark, it detonating meters behind the creature. Stell'bsna wgah'n shagg tharanak shugg syha'h.

The game has its flaws, but they are overshadowed by its successes.\n\nBefore I begin, you should know that I do not play many first-person shooters, and almost no horror games to speak of. Eldritch is not a "horrror" game per se, but seeks to encourage a similar atmosphere and as such was a newer experience to me than it might be for many others.\n\nEldritch is a strange combination of Lovecraftian horror and first-person-shooter that somehow managed to blend its disparate elements together very well.\nAnything with a Lovecraftian atmosphere should attempt to mimic the tone and atmosphere of its inspiration - the entire point of which was to make the reader feel not only helpless and hopeless, but utterly insignificant. First-person-shooters, on the far end of the spectrum, are most often about empowering the player to often absurd levels, though recently the trend has been to take a more 'realistic' disempowering approach.\n\nIf you're willing to jump into the game with your eyes closed - which is easy, as the trailer gives off the entirely wrong atmosphere - the game can begin as very disempowering, and even very unsettling. The use of FOV, lighting, background noise and uncanny help to establish a horror setting early, but still leave the player plenty of room to maneuver.\nThe feeling of uneasiness is sadly fleeting for most of the game, however. Once you learn how the stealth system works and how the enemy AI reacts, most of the game is actually fairly easy. The "eldritch abominations" usually die with a few whacks from a knife or shots from a pistol, and an easily-locatable backpack item lets you revive as many times as you have enough artifacts (in-game currency) to afford.\nTowards the end of the game, presuming you have the presence of mind to find the three special (useless) equipment items, the tone shifts toward disempowerment again. Some enemies will either be very strong or downright invincible, and once you're no longer able to slip past them like a whisper or revive yourself after death, the feeling of uneasiness returns as you realize that it will only take a few mistakes to end the game. Usually, that is not a terrible consequence, but because dying in Eldritch results in having to start over from the beginning, it (often) means losing hours of progress. This was a good design choice, I think, because it makes the closing of the game difficult and forces the player to adopt extra caution in their movements.\n\nThis game is not the strongest example of first-person-shooting, exploration, Lovecraftian horror or even unease-inducing atmosphere on Steam. But it does each job well enough to blend into something interesting and, to my eyes at least, unique.","December 1, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This results in a game where your experience can be highly personalized, which is far from a bad thing.\n\nEldritch has you taking on the role of a lone Librarian who must delve into sinister realms in their search of escape, dealing with Lovecraftian horrors while salvaging resources and managing whatever hand they're dealt.  The monster variety and what they bring to the table is impressive for the game's scope - one achievement tasks you with finishing the game in under ten minutes, so this is hardly the lengthiest of affairs, though there's a fair degree of difficulty in the obstacles one must overcome here, and that's ignoring the increased challenge of new game+ and newer areas released over time after the game's initial release.\n\nAnd those extended additions are well worth mentioning: the main game sports three worlds and a final challenge to fight your way through, each with its own distinct flavor with regards to traps, archetecture and monster variety.  It's a solid package in and of itself, but the addition of a score-chasing, fast-paced scavenger hunt through the Asylum, the lengthy and absurdly challenging mountain expedition, and a fairly friendly bonus feast of a Halloween realm are all welcome additions, adding to the game's replayability and depth.\n\nEldritch isn't the prettiest thing you'll see by any stretch, but the audio atmosphere is strong, and the player's vulnerability only adds to the tension.  Your decisions as you progress greatly impact your odds of survival, and the obstacles you face are overwhelming in number.  Whether you choose to take your time and soak it all in carefully or run in screaming like a banshee, there's a lot here worth your attention.","September 9, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had only known I would enjoy it more than any of the big budget games I had been looking forward to I would have saved my money and bought a bunch of copies of Eldritch instead! If you're looking for a stealth-based, rogue-like with a heavy emphasis on 3D platforming and atmosphere, it doesn't get better than this. Most people look at a few screenshots, write it off as a Minecraft cash-in, and move on. The poor fools! They don't even know what they're missing!\n\nOne thing is true: the graphics are nothing special. They capture the very minimum of their subject and the surroundings. There are some nice color palettes though, and the blocky nature light is cast makes it very obvious if you can be seen or not. And although the textures are unimpressive, the random level design is just as fun to look at as it is to traverse. Thankfully the audio is spectacular. Echoed moans, gurgles, gasps follow you wherever you go and always make you wonder what's just below your feet. The minimalist soundtrack is just as compelling. Obviously it's not a toe-tapping good time, but it certainly puts you on edge and makes you feel... Well, weird.\n\n'Weird' is really the name of the game here. This isn't meant to be made into a reaction compilation on your Let's Play channel. It focuses on the 'Weird Tales' aspect in favor of a more frightening experience. For those of you who have been waiting patiently for a Lovecraftian game to mean more than fishmen and tentacle monsters yelling "Boo!", this won't impress you. Also I'm really sorry and you must be REALLY used to disappointment by now.\n\nThis kind of highlights the weakest part of Eldritch: Lovecraft's world is alien and incomprehensible, but rogue-likes are inherently games about monotony and understanding. To beat a rogue-like means minimizing risks, self-mastery, and knowledge, but Lovecraft is about inescapable, cosmic realities, where knowledge comes at a VERY high cost and these horrors can never be beat, only kept at bay.\n\nEldritch's greatest strength, the genuinly alien nature of the random levels, the strange monsters that can't always be killed, and the crushing atmosphere instantly undo the game the moment you know how to avoid all the traps and deal with all the monsters. The first playthrough is magical: learning all of the powers, items, weapons, traps, monsters, seeing all of these non-sensical worlds realized... It's all so daunting in a very Lovecraftian way. But when you start farming world 1 for artifacts, or you start gearing up for the harder worlds, it's already too late.\n\nIf you're someone who knows Lovecraft as that guy with the strange tenticle fetish, or you're someone who can put the Lovecraftian label aside and just take in the very dreary tone and solid rogue-like mechanics, then I'd pick this game up without hesitation. If you've been patiently waiting for the Mythos to finally be realized in a computer game, than you'll have to keep waiting.","January 14, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nyarlathotep?  *dueling banjos plays*\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a serious note this is a First Person Shooter based off of the writings of Howard Phillip Lovecraft. You start as a Librarian of sorts, in a mysterious library with books littered about teeming with information. You find out that you are bound to this place an act as a gaurdian agaisnt the terrors of the Old Ones. There are some books that give off a shimmer and act as a portal to another dimension inhabited by Cultists, Dæmons and other Horrors that could plague the mind and soul. You have a chest that can store Artifacts which act as currency, the Deep Ones seem to cherish them and some will act neutral to even barter for them. Exploring these non-Euclidean realms takes a toll on ones perspective, they are never the same and have no definite structure. If you perish you simply re-awaken in the library, any Artifacts stored and items left here will stay, yet anything collected will be gone. Entering once again into these worlds that seem wrong, a strange tingle or sense just behind the nose, a scent of sorts. In the many works and studies these scholars or gaurdians what have you, a theory of pineal gland enlargement and extra-sensory perception is documented. Another book, going through them its never the same and there are so many! I went down through at least three gateways, faced what seemed to be, as best as I can describe it through my recent studies is a Shoggoth. I was terrified! At first it didn't make much sense, those Deep Ones could just be mutants or an actual bipedal, semi-intelligent race that evolved along with Humankind. That could be possible, right? But this, this was different. At first I struck out wildly with my dagger, nothing  but violent screams and lashing tentacle like appendages. I could see its gnashing maw and those unearthly eyes that seemed to see infinitly deep into my very being. My mind broke, I could somehow understand but to only comprehend I must let go of my sanity. I pushed away, firing my pistol wildly into its oozing form and managed to safely get away...or so I thought. Tekeli-li Shoggoth, Tekeli-li Shoggoth. I tossed a bundle of dynamite I found towards its protoplasmic form and missed my mark, it detonating meters behind the creature. Stell'bsna wgah'n shagg tharanak shugg syha'h. Things are different now, I haven't been here before but was there anyways. How pages have I read so far? Am I reading or am I acutally inside them? Honestly I can't remember if I dreamt that after reading some of these books or it acutally happened. But there is a dagger and pistol on the counter that I don't recall having earlier. Was I asleep? Where would I sleep? Geb agl ehye'bthnk c fhtagn ee. They can't reach me through these books can they? I have all the lights on in the library that I could find, I remember reading something about right angles, the way perceived space effected time, and how time could catch up to you....hunt you down itself. ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.

The game has its flaws, but they are overshadowed by its successes.\n\nBefore I begin, you should know that I do not play many first-person shooters, and almost no horror games to speak of. Eldritch is not a "horrror" game per se, but seeks to encourage a similar atmosphere and as such was a newer experience to me than it might be for many others.\n\nEldritch is a strange combination of Lovecraftian horror and first-person-shooter that somehow managed to blend its disparate elements together very well.\nAnything with a Lovecraftian atmosphere should attempt to mimic the tone and atmosphere of its inspiration - the entire point of which was to make the reader feel not only helpless and hopeless, but utterly insignificant. First-person-shooters, on the far end of the spectrum, are most often about empowering the player to often absurd levels, though recently the trend has been to take a more 'realistic' disempowering approach.\n\nIf you're willing to jump into the game with your eyes closed - which is easy, as the trailer gives off the entirely wrong atmosphere - the game can begin as very disempowering, and even very unsettling. The use of FOV, lighting, background noise and uncanny help to establish a horror setting early, but still leave the player plenty of room to maneuver.\nThe feeling of uneasiness is sadly fleeting for most of the game, however. Once you learn how the stealth system works and how the enemy AI reacts, most of the game is actually fairly easy. The "eldritch abominations" usually die with a few whacks from a knife or shots from a pistol, and an easily-locatable backpack item lets you revive as many times as you have enough artifacts (in-game currency) to afford.\nTowards the end of the game, presuming you have the presence of mind to find the three special (useless) equipment items, the tone shifts toward disempowerment again. Some enemies will either be very strong or downright invincible, and once you're no longer able to slip past them like a whisper or revive yourself after death, the feeling of uneasiness returns as you realize that it will only take a few mistakes to end the game. Usually, that is not a terrible consequence, but because dying in Eldritch results in having to start over from the beginning, it (often) means losing hours of progress. This was a good design choice, I think, because it makes the closing of the game difficult and forces the player to adopt extra caution in their movements.\n\nThis game is not the strongest example of first-person-shooting, exploration, Lovecraftian horror or even unease-inducing atmosphere on Steam. But it does each job well enough to blend into something interesting and, to my eyes at least, unique.","December 1, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think sillent hill if it was done in the minecraft engine.\n\nYou search several worlds inspired by the works of Lovecraft trying to decend or acend further into the level until you find the exit. along the way you'll encounter a number of monsters like, deep ones, mummies, shogotohs, flying polyops ect.\n\nThe game is okay. they did a decent job of depicting a Lovecrafting atmosphere and your character is very weak leading to a real sense of danger. you feel small and helpless which is exactly how you should feel in a lovecraft game.\n\nsaddly the voxel graphics take somthing away from the experince and theres only a handful of enemy types and only a couple are particularly intresting.  There a number of items and weapons you can get but these too are limited and most of them you'll ignore in faovor of more pratical things like the gun and dagger.  The rouge like nature of the game does add replayablity but greatly limits what can be done with the narrative which is somthing you don't want to skimp out on in a lovecraft game.\n\nIf your a fan of Lovecraft this might be an intresting distraction for a bit but you'll likely grow bored of it quickly.  If your just looking for a strange indy horror game, there are worse games then this.  If your looking for a great story or a more dynamic game...i'd say get sillent hill or fatal frame.\n\nIt was fun for awhile but i don't see myself replaying it anytime soon.","November 23, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lovecraft with difficulty only matched by its tense atmosphere and wonderful diversity in each play. It's by no means simple and you most certainly won't complete it in your first ten, twenty, fifty attempts! Heck, even with a huge statement like that I've only put a hearty 12+ hours into it so it's most certainly "learnable." It all relies on how quickly you can gracefully adapt to the game's changing environments... And I do mean gracefully. After mastering the game's controls (running, jumping, sliding, leaping and all that will be used quite frequently) you almost feel like you're being thrown around the map! On top of that you have a simple but hardly repetitive group of enemies to deal with ranging from fish-men to flying... organs? It's easy to conclude "well this is just impossible" but the game actually does have quite a few ways to completing it! Throwing yourself into the storm over and over won't do you much good so it's always good to take on a strategy. I've recently found stealthiness to be the ultimate path but you do have to be ready to lose some 35-50 minutes instantly from simple mistakes. If you don't feel like taking on all "three" worlds at once (it's difficult beyond comprehension but I've done it multiple times!) you can also try the Mountains of Madness: 10 levels of pure hell to retrieve your plane keys (keeping close to the books as always) and then heading all 10 levels back up to the surface! Fun alternative, right? Except.... Well, It's super tense and you'll get lost more than once as it begins to feel more like a labyrinth.\n\nSPOILERS/TIPS\n\nA great way to start any campaign is by grabbing the compass from Dagon [The first world ] and returning to The Library. Next you'll probably want to do the Trick or Treat world [ the pumpkin in the bar area ] be prepared to spend about 2-5 minutes here gathering materials for your next run! After you've grabbed a grappling hook and a gun with over 15+ ammo, return to The Library and re-enter Dagon. Complete the first world as so:\n[for beginners]:\n-Always look for a way down and try not to re-enter previously entered rooms\n-Avoid looting dead bodies... and don't waste ammo on those that don't need to be killed!\n-Press Z to throw items (great if you need to drop your gun/grappling hook for a takeout punch)\n-Hold spacebar to lift yourself over ledges! It took me almost 8 hours to realize this... it'll save you keys and such, allow you into new rooms, and save you from getting stuck in holes\n-run and press C (the crouch button for sneaking) to do a power-slide! You'll look cool AND it'll make your jumps longer!\n\n[For returning players]\n-Approach levels slowly! Pay attention to the map! Knowing your surroundings is almost necessary to escaping any level\n-If the opportunity to rush through a floor is available then you should most certainly take it; especially in later levels where there are tons of baddies chasing you down\n-don't hug walls unless you're sneaking; enemies can easily get the jump on you\n-try not to forget to peek around corners if you're uncertain how safe a room is (C+E/Q). You can shoot and cast spells when you're in this position\n-It took me nearly 70 attempts to complete the game and I have no doubt it'll take plenty less for you.

After putting several hours in to it, I have to say, it feels somehow incomplete. It's also fairly difficult. The combination of these two things make for diminishing returns. I read a review of this game that described it as a 3D roguelike based on cthulu mythos. It also resembles Minecraft visually but doesn't have the same level of depth or complexity. I like the art style and was thrilled to see lovecraft monsters in chunky 3D. Initially there were some moments where there was a lot of tension in trying to creep around and find items... after a while though, it feels like the possibilities are exhausted. What I like about rogulikes are the randomness and the variety. There are always surprises and you might die in horrible ways but there is also a sense of progression. You 'level up' or find something unusual or rare and it makes the difficulty a little more bearable... you want to jump in and try again. After clearing a couple of maps in eldritch it didn't feel like things were progressing in a way that was engaging for me. I like the idea that you're a lone person and you're scrambling for a few scarce rescources against cthulus minions in strange alien environments, I like the visual style and a lot of the gameplay... it just feels like there's something missing (maybe a few things), that would make me want to keep coming back to the game. I would really like to see some mod support.","July 4, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, I'm a big lovecraft fan and a Call of Cthulhu writer, so I really appreciated the journals left around and I was very interested in the asylum portion of the game, just from a creative standpoint.\n\nHowever, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired and a lot of that comes from the format of the levels. You go through 3 maps to get souls of various gods. The problem is that every map is basically the same. Sure,  there's an underwater theme, a desert theme, and a davy jones/nautical theme, but in every map, you have one goal, find your way to the exit at the bottom. You have to race to the bottom 3 times per themed area, which means you have to successfully pass 12 maze maps before you can even attempt the finale. With that, its no wonder that only 4.5% of all players who bought this game have actually finished it. Not to mention that to get the best ending, you need to find 3 sacred items that are hidden somewhere within the 12 levels before the finale. Because of the level design, I barely find myself sneaking and instead just race to the bottom as fast as possible it works 66% of the time.\n\nAdditionally, I found the combat to be too easy 66% of the time, negating the purpose of sneaking all together. Why so specific? The Cthulhu and Dagon themed areas have really easy enemies. Deep Ones, Cultists, and Star-spawn will usually either kill themselves by accident or a knife is enough to kill all the enemies in a level without taking any damage. However, the Nytharlotep area is by far the hardest and can take hours just to get a single good run in. This is because the enemies are really non-standard. One enemy (of which there are many in a single level) is a mummy that can't be killed, only stunned. Another is a lizard statue that teleports to attack you if you stop looking at it. The problem then is that to finish the Nytharlotep area, you have to pass by a hall of lizard statues lined up like terra-cotta warriors. You can't look at them the whole time because the door they're guarding is locked most (if not all) the time and so your only hope is to find enough dynamite in the stage to get rid of them or have enough health points to take the hits. Its really frustrating to reach the bottom and then to die because of this one enemy type that will alwasy be at the end point.\n\nLast note: I wish they had put in a different god than Dagon, because we've already seen Deep Ones in a Call of Cthulhu game before. I wish they had done something like Yog-Sothoth or some-such.\n\nAnyway, again this isn't a bad review, its just... meh.","October 17, 2015","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think sillent hill if it was done in the minecraft engine.\n\nYou search several worlds inspired by the works of Lovecraft trying to decend or acend further into the level until you find the exit. along the way you'll encounter a number of monsters like, deep ones, mummies, shogotohs, flying polyops ect.\n\nThe game is okay. they did a decent job of depicting a Lovecrafting atmosphere and your character is very weak leading to a real sense of danger. you feel small and helpless which is exactly how you should feel in a lovecraft game.\n\nsaddly the voxel graphics take somthing away from the experince and theres only a handful of enemy types and only a couple are particularly intresting.  There a number of items and weapons you can get but these too are limited and most of them you'll ignore in faovor of more pratical things like the gun and dagger.  The rouge like nature of the game does add replayablity but greatly limits what can be done with the narrative which is somthing you don't want to skimp out on in a lovecraft game.\n\nIf your a fan of Lovecraft this might be an intresting distraction for a bit but you'll likely grow bored of it quickly.  If your just looking for a strange indy horror game, there are worse games then this.  If your looking for a great story or a more dynamic game...i'd say get sillent hill or fatal frame.\n\nIt was fun for awhile but i don't see myself replaying it anytime soon.","November 23, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though this game never explains the origins of its name, it might be linked to the definition of the word: “weird / spooky”. This game certainly is spooky, and unique. The worlds you explore are randomly generated in this 1st person roguelike. The tactics you can employ can be as diverse or simple as you need. You can sneak up on people and stab them from behind for a critical hit, you can shoot from afar, or you can distract your enemies and never face them at all. Personally, I would summon Shaggoths (what look like giant furry heaps of hay painted green with bloody teeth and creepy eyes) and have them lash out at all of my enemies, whether it attacked baby cthulus, wizards, or lizardmen. I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I took a savage pleasure in strolling into a shop, talking to the clerk, and then summoning a mighty shaggoth to murder the clerk while I looted the store. But that is the beauty of the game. You can choose what you do, how you play, and risk your safety. The game is permadeath, so the penalty of getting hurt can be brutal. I played 36 hours before I beat the game, so my Dollar to Hour Ratio was 41 cents for every hour I played the game, which is great. The enemies you face are unique. Different species sometimes fight each other, wizards hate you, and Shaggoths want to kill everyone. Shaggoths are invincible, so I ended up adapting my strategy to locking them up in little huts I encountered. The difficulty can be, at times, brutal. I remember at one point being halfway through the game, and falling into a hole in which I could not get out of, and I was forced to restart my game. Once you play the game a lot, exploring can become repetitive. The end was very much a surprise, and not a good one. I liked where the story was going, but as it reached the climax, you click ‘f’ and the game is done, just like that!\n\nOverall, I would give this game a thumbs up.","September 12, 2015","true","45.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first four (three + one) are for the normal game, the fifth is the 'Mountains of Madness' mentioned in the store page video, and the sixth is a place called the 'Asylum' [There is also a Halloween-themed bonus stage, wonder if you can find it. Great for farming artifacts]\n\nYou have four things on the upper left: Hearts represents health, Blue oval-shapes represent 'artifacts,' or the in-game currency, Green Keys are for unlocking doors, and Yellow Bullets are ammo for your revolver (no reload system, simply M1 until you run out)\n\nThere is a lot of holding 'shift' in this game (to run), especially for some of the achivements. Unfortunately, there is no toggle to run, unlike for crouching, but not really a big deal.\n\nIt is not a terribly difficult game. Enemies' projectiles miss often, especially when you are running, and circle strafing enemies while punching/knifing them will dispatch them quickly. For first-time players I would suggest a more cautious approach; my first complete run took about 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nAfter the inital novelty wears off, there is not much left except the same repeat of: evade/kill enemies, pick up items, move on to the next chapter. For that reason alone, I would not recommend at full price unless you enjoy this genre and/or the Lovecraftian theme. I am not familiar with the universe of H.P. Lovecraft, so I cannot comment on this game's accuracy to its source of inspiration\n\nThe redeeming factors that gives life and replayability to this game are the online leaderboards and steam achivements.

The gameplay is fluent and there are some creepylooking monsters to kill. But I have two little complaints for the game. Firstly I wish there are more weapons, I get it that you only have one arm to use them, so shotguns and machine guns are out, but I would have at least liked a flare gun or another pistol. Secondly the enemey respawns can get annoying sometimes. But I definiteley recommend this game (I later found out that you can stop them from respawning by simply not looting their corpses)\n\nThe graphic may scare possible players off but because of the game´s pixelated look runs smooth like butter. Also worth a mention is the game´s soundtrack, it´s just great, really atmospheric and it sets the mood perfectly. The randomly generated levels are a blast to play, I personally really liked the second book and the mountains of madness free DLC area. These levels often include a nice gimmick, for example tiles that crumble when you step on them or invicible enemies. The levels often end with a special building, that really looks quite impressing and stands out from all the randomly generated stuff you have seen throughout the level.\n\nSpeaking of randomly generated, this feature works surprisingly well. I have never seen any weird constructions during my playthrough and the game still has a feel of leveldesign even though it actually shouldn´t be there.\n\nTo sum it up I would definiteley recommend this game. It took me about 20 hours to get through the whole game (visiting every area and dying sometimes) and nearly every minute was great and tense fun!\n\nAlso the game includes one of the best snow levels I have played in a long while ;)\n\n(for a more serious take on the Lovecraftian mythos you should check out the long forgotten "Shadow of the comet" and "Prisoner of ice" and the more popular "Dark corners of the earth")","February 22, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
