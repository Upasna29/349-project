Giving this game a try, you will learn why, and come to appreciate the fact these good old times have past.\n\nThis game used to amaze back in the day, it was the first time gamers were given a try to play an RPG that doesn't blindly follow the "knight in shiny armour killing the archdemon" cliche. The graphics rocked (in 2002), the feeling of flight on your own set of wings, and the ability to dive down and catch your rival to have a bloody snack up in the air were amusing. BUT back in the day we were used to having to relearn and remaster the controls for every new game that we played, we were used to having to deal with clunky controls and some minor inconveniences in the overall gameplay. The tradition of implementing high quality, touching stories with complex characters had not yet been settled in the industry. We loved games mainly for their gameplay and the fresh experiences they brought us.\nToday most games deliver several genres in one pack, like shooters where you can fly a plane or ride a car e.t.c. The things that made this game look cool more than a decade ago are fairly trivial for the modern gamer, while the flaws look outrageous. The game has an unappealing story, the quests are boring and repetitive (go to an area kill all the monster, then go to another locations and do "the exact same thing over and over again"), the controls are oldschool (clunky + underworked = inconvenient). This game is bad by all modern game standards, but this game was developed in the times when those standards were only a work in progress.\n\nSummary:  If you are a player from back in the day, taking the low price of the game to notice, you might want to take a glance to the past with this one, it might be a useful experience. Or if you are new to gaming and want to feel how it realy was to play them "good old games" you might want to get it while on sale. In other cases take a second thought before you press the "buy" button.","September 15, 2015","true","7.2"," 86 of 96 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","86","96","8","0"

What you have now is a wonderful RPG where you get to play as a mighty dragon. I played this game quite a bit over the years and was very surprised to see it pop up on steam.\n\nThe I of the dragon is quite relentless in its default difficulty (5) but can be adjusted to either 1 or 10. I do not recommend putting it higher as the game was clearly not properly designed for it. The game is rather slow paced by default and turning all enemies into tanks that just take way too long to kill is not fun, only tedious.\n\nThere's 3 different Dragon classes; Necromancer, Mage and Warrior, the latter focussing on its fire breath over magic use. Each class has unique skills and specializes in different stats (which are cheaper to level up). The necromancer ends up being the middle ground class with some summoning options.\n\nAs you level up you can spend points on stats and purchase spells (for said points). Its up to the player to balance it out.\n\nSpells in this game are quite awesome and deserve to be mentioned seperatly. There is a wide range of spells and with the ability to litterally summon mountains and giant craters you can terraform the land around you quite dramatically impacting enemy movement as well. Yes after some time the land will turn back to its original state but it takes quite a while and it looks impressive. Really makes the player feel powerful.\n\nHowever, as for downsides; There are a couple of segments in the game where you are forced to play as other characters and these segments are just plain terrible. There's no way around it, they should never have made it in the game. However they happen relatively late and can be finished somewhat quick with some practice.\n\nOverall,  if you like the idea of controlling a mighty dragon that grows incredibly strong over time, get this game. Yes it's a bit dated but the game is unique enough that there really isn't a better modern alternative. This IS the best dragon RPG out there.","March 10, 2015","true","33.5"," 71 of 77 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","71","77","3","1"

Big fan of GOG.com.\nI bought this game back in 2004 and played it then. It was alright, especially since games that let you play as a dragon are few and far between. Yeah, it got fairly repetitive since the majority of the game is hunting down monster spawners and killing then, usually via fly-by attacks. (Would've been better if they used mouse-based flight a-la Freelancer since you use said mouse for some controls. And yes, Freelancer came out before this.)\nHowever, this is no longer that game, and even at $2, I can't recommend it. The controls are still awkward, but now they're worse since you can't remap the keys unless you use a fan-made patch. Also, the game has a CTD problem trying to play the opening movie unless you delete it, and trying to rotate the camera is especially painful as sometimes it starts moving right away, and sometimes it takes up to a full second before it even starts moving. If this was turn-based, it'd only be annoying, but this game is very much action-based. (This is also fixed with a fan-made patch.)\nThe devs have already gone on record saying that there won't be any patches or improvements to the game as they have lost the source code. Look guys, if you don't have the source code and/or can't fix any problems that arise with the game, DON'T RELEASE THE GAME. The gameplay has gone from "not bad" to "broken mess" simply because these issues can't be fixed due to being unable to update the game for modern systems. The saddest thing is, GOG.com has set a standard for updating old games, and this falls well below it.\nFix the controls so somebody doesn't need three hands to play the game/restore the ability to remap keys, fix the CTD issues, and the lag when trying to rotate the camera, and this game might be worth the asking price. As it is, this game is a broken mess and despite the graphics not aging well, it might be worth playing again.\nEDIT: BTW, those review scores up there at the top of the page from Actiontrip and Gameshark? Those are from the '04 edition. The Gameshark site isn't even around anymore.","October 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","61","74","5","4"

Really don't expect this to be anything like super fancy and spyro like, don't expect graphics to which you can actually see teeth on the model. But, this is not for people who want things that have more options to being a dragon such as landing or interacting. This is more of I am going to burn and destroy every living thing I see.\n\nSecond Question: What is Gameplay like?\n-You fly around.\n-You make human towns because apparently women aren't pooping babies fast enough or the babies are getting eatten by Diablo...\n-You never land because you are magically suspended into the air.\n-You get hit by the most annoying enemies and have to use your manuverbility to actually fly around and avoid being hit. Hint: just fly up and down :)\n-Somehow I get shot out of the air by a blast of fire that I have no clue where it came from O.o\n-It is still challenging dispite you fly around and burn stuff. P.S: You have spells because you a bloody magical dragon.\n-You have 3 classes of dragons only.\n-The graphics are that of N64 and PS1.\n-Also I get to eat food on the go!\n\nThird Question: Why write this review?\nI am a friggin dragon.\nAlso I think it deserves a review that just because it's not like modern day games doesn't mean it isn't good. For it's time it was pretty cool, but just remember that older games had a weirdness of being simpler yet fun and straightforward such as Fate, Bejeweled, Diablo 1, Warcraft 1... and so on.\n\nOnce again....\nAs I said I wouldnt recommend this to people who want to interact with other things or do more complex actions than casting spells, burning monsters/spawners, and flying around. This is not a complex nor intense game. It's pretty straight forward but the balance of the game is slightly off and requires you to actually think and react to overpowered mobs shooting at you. Not a perfect game but like I said it's a cheap timewaster.","June 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","37","45","6","1"

(Good Dragon)\nThe game is nice. Neither awesome nor bad. = Nice. I enjoyed to play with it.\nThe control was uncomfortable for me at first because I hadn’t flown before. I managed to used to it.\n\nRecommendation:I think that those who like (or don’t care) play as a Dragon, and flying, and help to save the world could enjoy this game.\n\nTo the Achievement-Hunters:There are no achievements.

I never even knew this game existed till I stumbled upon it on the store for 90% off ($0.93 CAN.) Frankly any game out there that lets me play as a mother f***ing Dragon is usually always an instant purchase, as games like that are far and few between, and sadly most of them are not that good either. This one happens to be a mixed bag. This game does suffer from problems, and I will explain.\n\nThis game is old, 2004. There hasn't been any work on updating this by the Devs, as according to the forums, the Devs don't have the source files. Thankfully though some loyal fans have made some patches to fix problems, like the music not playing, the intro movie not playing, not being able to change controls, slightly improving the graphics, etc. I've played both the normal and patched versions. I never experienced any crashes as stated by other people.\n\nMy main gripe with it was the controls. This was the main reason why I never actually finished the game. I got tired trying to fight with the controls. The fan patch does help improve them, but I still found myself fighting with them when fighting harder enemies in the later stages of the game.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, you are a dragon. You fly around, using your attacks and spells to kill monsters and spawners, gain XP to level up to upgrade your stats and learn new attacks/spells, collect gems to gain more power to learn more spells, grab enemies and devour them, and f*** s*** up! There really isn't much for variety in anything though. You go to an area, kill everything, move onto the next, repeat. Some people may not like that at all.\n\nYou have a selection of 3 types of dragons. Fire, Ice, and Acid. Each one has different starting stats, and a variety of different kinds of attacks/spells. Everything from Fireball, Ice storm, to summoning zombie minions, and even opening a giant fissure in the ground to kill your enemies! Each Dragon class also plays slightly differently as well. The Fire Dragon being the big Tank/Damage dealer, getting up close and smashing enemies with Fire based attacks. The Ice Dragon being more like a Sniper/Mage class with Ice/slowing attacks to freeze or take them out from a distance. The Acid Dragon being a Necromancer with Acid based attacks causing DOTS and summoning zombies to take the focus off of you.\n\nNow in terms of actually flying and battling, is very awkward. You move around by clicking where you want to fly, and your dragon to fly to the beacon you placed. Then attacking enemies you have to select a spell, and either click or click and hold to power up the spell. Most spells though will cause you to stop before actually attacking, causing you to attack then trying to move to avoid being hit. This tend to make the game feel very awkward for me, and kind of why I never completely finished the game.\n\nI played the game for about 8 hours before I added in the Fan-made patches. I highly recommend adding the patches.\n\nPros:\n- You are a god damn mother f***ing Dragon!\n- Lots of good attacks/spells to use, that feel powerful to use.\n- Leveling system is simple to use.\n- Audio/Music sound great.\n- Has a much needed Tutorial.\n- Steam Trading Cards.\n\nCons:\n- Very outdated graphics.\n- Controls are bad.\n- Audio/Video problems.\n- Extremely repetitive.\n- **Requires Fan-made Patches to make the game better.**\n- No achievements.\n\nIf you can look past the problems, it can be a good game. Not perfect, but GOOD. When in doubt, get it on sale!\n\n6/10\n\nI will say though, because of this game it made me realize something. We NEED a new Dragon game!","April 17","true","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It doesn't blaze trails into new domains, but it does stick with what it has, which is more than some games can say. I used to play it a lot when I was younger, and I'm glad Steam got their hands on it so hopefully it'll be fixed of it's problems. The dragon mechanics are some of the better ones I've seen in gaming, not the greatest, but it has good things going for it. The options aren't the greatest, and there are some glaring problems, but thankfully the main game can still be played pretty well now that it's been updated to the recent OS's.\n\nThe game play itself is pretty simple, mass monster genocide and kill the evil baddie at the end while making sure humans don't blow themselves up or stab you in the back. The story isn't revolutionary, and has some... glaring issues, like a lack of a real moral choice. *Spoilers* Even after the king turns and tries to kill you, and you find a level 4 city that is turned evil, in which the gypsy even says 'no wonder dragons hate humans', you still fight along side them. Why? Because GAME LOGIC! The game itself is still good, and one of it's greatest points is it's spells. It brings an interesting choice for skill points, spend some to get a new spell, or level up stats. And unlike some games, the cost remains the same for all spells, with only a level limit for the spells. Meaning you don't have to get a bunch of level 1 spells just to get that huge level 15 spells. Most of the time I ignore the spells until around level 20 because that's when things start getting good.\n\nIf you want to play as a dragon, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, and feel like a true bad ♥♥♥ of the sky by tearing up a bunch of monsters, then I recommend you play this. It has problems, but I think the game itself is very good once you get things situated. It's a shame that the makers of this game didn't put in more work, but then again, budget and time are harsh and merciless towards game creators.","May 14, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some abilities are overpowered, others are bad, and the in-game descriptions of abilities and attributes aren't descriptive enough. There's no way to roll back or refund attribute points.\n-There's no way to rebind the keys, and it looks like there's never going to be an official patch to fix this.\n\nThe unacceptable:\n-The UI is bad enough to sink the entire game. The camera swings around wildly and there's no way to bind it to mouse movement. UI buttons aren't scaled with resolution, giving you a choice between bad resolution or small buttons. But wait, it gets even worse. The left/right steering randomly stops working (and this happens often). Obviously in any game that requires dodging projectiles, being able to steer or strafe is required, and this problem ruins the game so badly I can't recommend it.\n\nThe verdict:\nAn otherwise great game completely ruined with severe UI/control issues bordering on unplayable. If you're going to buy this, wait for at least an 80% discount - and only if you like role-playing games, flight games, and/or dragons.","February 9","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It has controls that are simply unable to master because you need 4 hands. Camera is broken. The story is ultra boring. The quests is actually one quest that you can repeat until the end of days. Besides this is a re-release of a company that lost the source code (their own explanation) and they can't patch anything but made it worse.

I really liked the look of it and borrowed it from him, most probably without asking first, I don't remember anymore. What I do remember however, is the fact that I absolutely loved this game.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe I was stupid and not able to recognize faults in games (which this game has plenty of in gameplay, vioce-acting and many other aspects), but I would have recommended it for the sake of nostalgia alone except...it doesn't work.

Play it. When I did get it working, it was withut the BGM, though I usually turn it off anyway, it was disappointing I had no option for or against it. ¬_¬\n\nIf its possible to get the game working as well as it did back in the day, you'll find it an enjoyable gameplay, and at times I often forgot I was meant to complete objectives and just went around you know, being a dragon. I'd swoop in and pick off monsters one by one.  The game was challenging but fun and you could get lost in what you were doing in other words. The background story was fun I guess, and the only disappointment was that blasted mission where you play as the King or something and lost the ability to play as the dragon for a brief.\n\nBut the bugs spoil any hance of recreating that fun I had the first time around for me.","February 12","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember when I first played the demo, instantly falling in love with the story (I mean you're a dragon?  What's more to ask).  Some of my fondest memories are playing this game, fun to play, though the controls are very unothrodox but with two forms of movements (You can solely play via keyboard, or with just a mouse) and camera settings you can definitely find a compromise.  If you've been looking for a videogame that you can play as a Dragon, but dismayed that most of them make you either a Dragon rider or a morphing human-dragon-thing, look no further.","May 8","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I was either going to trade or sell the voucher, since it was indeed tradable, but my interest was peaked and I took a look at it. Not caring much for Action-RPGs, I was still inclined to sell it, but I decided adding a new game to my collection would be nice and it was a steal at only 70 cents with the coupon. Little did I know I'd find an obscure gem.\n\nThis game has become one of my favourite old-school story-based games within the first hours of playing. It was a little repetative, yes; and the controls did irritate at times, always going backwards because a tree or hill was in the way and such, but it was really fun. There were a few sections in which I had the down the difficulty because it got quite extreme; being killed in one hit as the Warlord and Cultist, but overall the difficulty curb was nice and smooth.\n\nThe voice acting was complete garbage, no sugar coating that. This was 2004, however, and I can give it a pass for that, especially since the low quality voice acting in this game actually is far better than a few select games I've seen from 2014-15.\n\nI played the Fire Dragon, as I always play a tank character in RPG games. It was a fun experiance, burning things and getting close combat in with the many monsters. The gorillas with homing shots did irritate me, but after level grinding a bit through invasions I could take them. By far my favourite part was the final battle against Skarborr because with the column spell I managed to launch him all the way across the map, which I found highly amusing as he'd fall back down floating and changing direction incredibly quickly, obviously annoyed.\n\nCan't really think of much else to say. I didn't find the low quality graphics annoying, since I'm used to early 2000's games like Age Of Empires. I just found it fun and I'll probably do a run as the other two dragon classes once I get some more free time. If you have a few extra dollars, I'd suggest this game.","May 20","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
