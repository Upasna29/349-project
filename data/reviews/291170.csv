What?\nTranslations aren't even checked, and it's just like they took the mobile version and deleted the prices, for example, to unlock some stage it says something like "gather xxx stars or buy it for . " Not sure how the mobile version was, I mean if you could buy currency or something like that, but having to gather gems grinding stages shouldn't be a thing on TDs.\nVery basic, feels like a weird copy of a great tower defense like Kingdom Rush.

Sadly, while it copies almost everything else they do rather accurately (and unimaginatively), it doesn't manage to copy the "entertainment" part of any of those other TDs.\n\nb) It is a lazy port from a mobile FreeToPlay game. So no shortcuts, no tower or enemy info anywhere (because who reads on mobile, right?), plus there are all those funfunfun FTP mechanics left over in it. They're responsible for those funfunfun difficulty spikes and the funfunfun grinding they expect you to do, to make up for the fact that you're not paying any more money.\n\nThat said, the price is fair and the game is playable and bugfree (for me). But if you really feel like playing a new TD, try the latest few browser ones, they will be of comparable quality and probably more original.","June 14, 2015","false","2.2"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

However, I was quickly disapointed and I'll tell you why in my Pros and Cons below:\n\nPros:\n‚ô¶ Price probably seems reasonable (If you are into Generic Tower Defenses)\n‚ô¶ Decent Number of Levels and Campaigns (This is good as no level is 100% the same as another)\n‚ô¶ Great Campaign graphics (Each campaign has amazing level graphics for a TD)\n‚ô¶ Selecting which enemy to attack is great (This is great to when it comes to nonmulti-lane levels)\n‚ô¶ Good Number of Upgrades\n‚ô¶ Good Number of Easy Achievements Just for playing the game (Minus the DLC Achievements)\n‚ô¶ Steam Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n‚ô¶ Same old towers throughout the whole game (You quickly unlock all the towers in the first campaign and never unlock any others which using the same towers over and over again can get quite boring after a while)\n‚ô¶ Very Grindy (You have to play levels over and over again in hope of getting lucky to get enough purple gems to buy upgrades to be able to even stand a chance in the next level you have unlocked)\n‚ô¶ False description as the description says it has a Story when there is No Story whatsoever (Could have easily added a background story to each Campaign to give the game that bit more of an edge)\n‚ô¶ Wave start timers are pointless as you can just pause the game everytime to set up for the next wave (This makes the game way too easy)\n‚ô¶ Need to buy dlc to get 100% Achievements from get go (Should have to buy DLC to see the DLC Achievements)\n‚ô¶ Repetitive (Have to replay levels over and over to get purple gems to even be able to progress even if you three stared the level before)\n‚ô¶ Gets real repetitive by the third Campaign (This is because there is hardly anything that changes per Campaign)\n‚ô¶ Generic Tower Defense + Doesn't add anything new to the Genre (This is annoying as it's a basic place a tower, kill a wave, upgrade a tower, next level type TD which get's really boring after a while)\n‚ô¶ Sound Crackly in Second and Third Campaign (Really, Really annoying that I had to mute the game)\n‚ô¶ Each Campaign is just a new level skin (No new towers, upgrades and hardly any new enemies).\n‚ô¶ Once you upgrade lives you have too many (Litterally 99% of the time you'll never die)\n‚ô¶ No way to tell what type of enemy is coming in the next wave (This makes it really hard to judge what towers to buy)\n‚ô¶ No way to tell what enemies are immune to or weak against (This is annoying as you have to figure it out yourself after you've already placed the towers making you more likely to sacrifice that wave)\n‚ô¶ No way to see how many spells you've cast for the 200 spells Achievement (This is annoying if you want to get all achievements quickly)\n‚ô¶ Once you select a spell you can't quickly cancel it (Right Clicking and or Left Clicking casts it)\n‚ô¶ Can't individually tell a tower which enemy to attack (This is annoying when it comes to multi-lane levels)\n‚ô¶ Number of Stars are incorrect on Campaign Select (I have 198/189 as it only factors in stars for beating the game on one difficulty and not multiple)\n‚ô¶ No incentive to play the game on Medium or Hard difficulty as there is no achievements or anything to draw you in.\n‚ô¶ Level Highscores is pointless (Why does it tell you your highscore if you can't see it anywhere after the level?)\n\nOverall it's a good generic Tower Defends with minimal bugs and glitches that at most you'll get one playthrough out of. However it quickly becomes grindy, repetitive and has nothing to draw you back into the game once you beat it once. Therefore, as there are way more cons than pros I have decided to vote no on it. Although, if you like grindy, generic Tower Defense type games by all means buy this.","October 24, 2015","false","4.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","4"

As in the description of the game,\n\nFollow the exciting story of the dwarven kingdom's eternal struggle against the troll hordes, who want only to crush the dwarves and claim their territory.\n^ After having played this game for seven hours, I have never been introduced to any shape or form of story.\n\n\nUnique units, a wide range of structures, spells, gold and various resources make this game that you will return to again and again.\n^ Nope, nothing unique. It's your typical TowerDefence game with the typical towers. Nothing new implemented.\n\n\nTap anywhere you like for a handy pop-up menu listing all the units and structures you can build in that location. Tap existing structures to see how you can upgrade your forces with ever-more powerful improvements!\n^ This hints towards that the game description is the same as for the mobile version.\n\n\nEach level also brings new units and structures to help you fight the troll menace. You‚Äôll never be lacking for new and exciting ways of decimating those nasty trolls!\n^ Sure, it does vary this, but not nearly every level as this description claims.\n\n- 60 different progressively challenging levels\n^ True\n\n- 3 unique game settings\n^ If they mean the difficulty settings? Then sure, but I'd hardly call having Easy - Medium and Hard options unique.\nEDIT: ^ There are three different biomes. Forrest, snow and desert.\n\n- 17 kinds of creatures\n^ As with every other game, lots of reskins.\n\n- 12 kinds of towers and structures\n^ True. Also very basic for most TowerDefence games.\n\n- Extensive magic system\n^ Can't think of a more basic system ever implemented. Nothing extensive about this.\n\n- Various upgrades\n^ Pretty fun to upgrade towers and such. Pretty typical to TowerDefence games.\n\n- Fascinating gameplay\n^ Facinating gameplay, what does that even mean?\n\nThe game lacks keyboard support, which is a huge nuisance to me as a PC gamer. Obviously this is due to the game being ported over from the mobile version.\n\nLacks a options menu. Two volume sliders isn't an options menu, however the ability to toggle between fullscreen and windowed is a good addition.\n\nThe game only has three soundtracks that loops. Hope you have a playlist on Youtube or Spotify ready.\n\nSo with all of this, why am I recommending this somewhat discount Kingdom Rush clone? Well, as far as a Tower Defence game goes, it handles more or less as you'd expect and it's not bad at what it does. It doesn't do anything unique or great, but it's still solid for killing a few hours of boredom.","November 14, 2014","true","7.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

Completing a map without a perfect score will still yield gems, so they're relatively easy to come buy. In addition, gems can be spent to unlock strategic tower positions. Gems spent in this way are non-refundable, as such I tended to avoid buying these unlocks. Tip: after completing the final level on Hard, refund all gems before entering Heroic Mode and spend freely on tower unlocks in the three Heroic levels, as the store bonuses will no longer apply.\n\nMaps can be completed on Hard before playing on Easy or Normal, however this does not count towards having completed the lower-difficulty missions. I chose to play each map at least three times: Easy -> Normal -> Hard and found that some missions were balanced perfectly to reflect their difficulty levels, with most being relatively straight-forward, while the most challenging required some lateral thinking. The ability to pause at any point and buy/sell towers provides an additional strategic layer for more difficult maps. Heroic Mode is best left until after completing all Standard Mode maps.\n\n- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link)","January 14, 2015","true","30.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

"it's actually a puzzle game where you have to figure out the ONLY way to get past this level" -- which I don't like.\nI prefer TD games where you can strategize many different ways to beat a level, which all work, as long as you're good enough - using concentration of forces, min maxing, etc.\n\nIt starts with the annoying yet all too familiar "this is how you play the game. Place THIS tower HERE" early levels instead of letting you figure it out on your own. Do we really need a tutorial telling us to place the only available tower type ?Normally you have a few of these levels and you just move on but for me the levels were so annoying, I am still dealing with it as I'm more or less giving up on the game.\n\nThe game also feels cheaply done, cheaply ported.\nThere is no zoom, for example. you have the one view of the field and that's it.\nYou can select an enemy for selective firing, but there is no way to de-select it (lol).\nThe icons surrounding the towers are so tiny, I can't read any of them, and they just make clicking a tower look sloppy. The towers also don't look different enough when you are getting used to the game.\n...and other small but noticable things that could have been so easily corrected if the devs cared.\n\nWhoever thought "let's give them 0 resources for a level"  and "hey here's a great idea, a unit that both puts towers to sleep and portals in waves of mobs" is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing idiot. Because despite everything else, these 2 things are what ultimately make the game not worth my time.\nOr your time.\nAnd this is on EASY. Yes, I am giving up on a TD game on easy, before level 10. Hard to fathom. But it's not worth the frustration to grind through. It's a shame too bc you can see that later on you can overspend to have an easier time to 3star levels, but it's not worth it getting that far, due to trying to get past levels with 0 resources etc. It's just a stupid and very limiting way to make tower defense. I have better choices to play.\n\nIf you are looking for a TD game similar to this, go Kingdom Rush or even better, OTT TD. OTTTD looks like a masterpiece compared to this. Yea get that instead. That's a great game.\n\nThis game is so close, yet so far from being great. As it is, I strongly do not recommend.","January 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

One thing this games succeeds in was eliminating the microtransactions,\nand transferring those gems into rewards to use towards upgrades.  While there\ncould have been more balancing done when it comes to cost of upgrades versus\nnumber of gems dropped, overall this added to the quality of the game, rather\nthan take away.\n\nThere is an abundance of content in the game.  I especially enjoyed the\nheroic mode, as you had to complete it without upgrades, and relying on your\nskill solely.  Unfortunatelly, the heroic mode was only on tier one, and I felt\nit could have benefitted from having it on the other tiers, as well.\n\nThere is enough variety in the different levels you see that keeps the\nplayer from becoming bored from repetition.  The pathways of the levels as well\nas how the enemies react to the players towers was done very well.   The core\ndesign of the game is solid, and while I felt that the graphics could have been\nupdated a bit to compensate for being on a computer screen, the music and variety\ncombine to make a challenging and interesting atmosphere.\n\nThe locations of the towers that can be built are marked clearly on the\nmap, as well as extra plots available throuh spending your gems.  These extra\nspots aren't required to purchase, but they offer variety for those looking for\nan extra challenge, as well as an option for those who are struggling.   The\ncombat is fluid and the AI is done well, so you never feel as though you are\nfighting an uphill, neverending battle.\n\nI didn't expect to have as much fun as I did playing this game, and I\nfound myself playing this for longer than I anticipated.  It has a few small\niussues, but I never felt disrespected or unappreciated.  I can easily\nrecommend this game for those that enjoy a good tower defense game.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to\nwatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 17, 2014","true","8.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

I love tower defense games and I own few of them here on steam, but this one... it's just pointless. You actually can't build "tower defense", because you already have pre build spots on map on which you can build your towers, there is like 10 spots and that's all, so you can't build like maze etc. It's just boring and bad. Sound is distaster too (like you are listeting to PC speaker from '90s). Graphic is like on some older cellphone... not worth it. I played it for 10 minutes and deleted.","January 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iggi00/recommended/291170/","iggi00","Iggi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iggi00/","276 products in account","This a mobile port, so keep that in mind.  The levels can be quite challenging, and you unlock more and more towers as well as the ability to upgrade them as you play.  You will also receive a separate shop, where you can purchase passive abilities that will help out the damage, range, etc. of your towers/spells (this shop requires a separate currency).  Typical kind of tower defense, quite fun.\n\nHowever my main gripe would be the upgrade system that involves a separate currency, which appears randomly in each level.  Sometimes you'll get 5 of the currency in a single level, other times 0 (zero).  The upgrades that require this currency also increase in cost every time you purchase them.  This will require you to replay previous levels constantly to grind out enough of the resource to pay for the upgrades.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty settings though: Easy, Medium, and Hard.  The only problem is that defeating the level on "Hard" does not give you credit for the previous 2 difficulties.  I guess it gives more incentive to farm the currency required for the shop upgrades.\n\nNot bad for its price, but I also bought it on sale for even cheaper.  Was worth the 2 or 3 bucks I spent.","December 8, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Constantly you run into scenerios where you can't progress far and certainly have next to no chance of getting a perfect run (which is something I always try to do on every level of every Tower Defense game I play (I really do enjoy TD games for the most part)) without buying things or clearing significant upgrades all of which require GEMS. Now, these Gems were clearly micro-transactions in the mobile version of the game, and I do GREATLY appreciate that they took them (micro-transations) out of the PC port, but now to get these gems you just have to play levels over and over again grinding the game in hopes that mobs will drop some Gems. It just gets tiresome.\n\nAnother point of note, that I can fully understand many players may actually love, is that there are LOTS of mobs and towers/tower-upgrades. Like, there are SO MANY different towers and mobs! Like, they litterally introduce at least one new one EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, save for the final level, of the first of the 3 areas (NOTE: I have NOT yet played the other 2 areas and can not comment on their content and quality at this time). With so many new things constantly being thrown at you, and the game FREQUENTLY limiting your options and forcing you to use the new towers and fight the new mobs, you never get a decent oppertunity to just PLAY the game, having learned what options you have and what challenges await, and having free reign to build the towers you want and make your own strategies. It all just get so tiresome.\n\nAs I play this, that is what I keep thinking, it's tiresome. It's grinding. It's just not as fun as a large number of other tower defence games I own on steam.\n\nIs it aweful? Not at all. There are also many worse TD games on steam. This is, objectivly speaking and from my perspective, an overall decent TD game, it just didn't entertain me as well as I had hoped and from my personal experience I just can't recommend it. There are better Tower-Defense games out there on steam that are just the opposit of tiresome.","January 15, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are nice. All the standard towers are there, there are upgrades and it's not pushing the rock-papers-scissors mechnics too far.  Still, it's just not a lot of fun too play although I can't really put my finger on why this is the case. Maybe it's because many levels look very similar or are even re-used. Standard towers are there, but that's pretty much it. Some towers are badly executed like the sniper tower (lacks the huge range you'd expect) or tend to bug a bit like the incorrect range of the buff tower in some levels. There are only a few spots where you can place your towers and some of them you will have to buy with your crystals (which are also used for upgrades). The upgrades are also very basic and unimaginative (and quite expensive). The difficulty curve is very inconsistent (assuming a curve can be inconsistent). As a matter of principle I try not to use powers other than towers in TDs. Hence I did not upgrade them at all, making the levels where you start out with 0 gold quite difficult. You can reset upgrades but if that is actually necesary that would mean forcing a certain playstyle (which is a very bad thing imho).\n\nMaybe the most annoying thing about this game is that it is not necesarily a bad or broken game. It's just not very good. Still I would recommend replaying defense grid, kingdom rush or PvZ over buying this game even at a discount.\n\nElmo, the grumpy lootmaster, signing out","July 5, 2015","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
