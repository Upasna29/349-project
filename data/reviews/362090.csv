If I received this game as a child back in 2001 it easily would've been one of my favourite games, competing with pokemon for my gametime on those long car-rides we used to love or hate.\n\nAs it stands today, though, the game APPEARS to be too simple. But then you dig deeper, you unlock some more creature tiers, you upgrade the blacksmith a bit more, you find your first nether orb. It then becomes apparent that this game is much deeper than you initially thought, and before you know it you've clocked up over a day of gametime.\n\n\nSo what do you actually do in the game?\n\nYou spend your time running through simple, randomly generated levels, to defeat enemies, gather loot, and get resources. The combat itself is simple, you use your creatures attack, defend, and taunt your enemy's creatures, all the while deciding whether you should extract a creature (think of it like throwing a pokeball, kinda), or if the fight goes south, flee.\n\nThe levels can be completed in between 5-15 minutes. Where you are then challenged by the choice of whether you should go down to the next level, or head back to your Castle.\n\nWhat is the point of the game?\n\nThe game has a progression system similar to a roguelite. After you head back to your castle you spend the resources you've gathered on new creatures, gear, and castle upgrades. All of this to improve your ability to take on greater challenges. Don't confuse this game with a true roguelite, however! Permadeath is not a core mechanic to the game, though it is available in the options if you're inclined.\n\nIn conclusion this game is an iceberg. Deceptively simple and small on the surface but a behemoth once you dive deeper. Well worth the 10 dollars, but if you're still not sure there is a demo available on their website.","April 24, 2015","true","87.3"," 77 of 81 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","77","81","4","1"

I was just curious as to what Steam had to offer in the monster taming genre. What I found left me wanting more. You see, during the pokemon craze there were several games that came out looking to capitolize on Pokemon's formula. This game seems to take elements from quitee a few of them. But what I see it mostly inspired by is one of my favorite roguelikes growing up, well before I knew what a roguelike was. Dragon Warrior Monsters.\n\nThis game is like a love letter to that style of game, beautiful retro graphics that would not be out of place on the Gameboy Color, wonderfuly aranged midi's that invoke a feeling of adventure, the randomly generated dungeons, which I might add are superior to DWM in that they are not just empty spaces but filled with things to interact with, from resources to gather, to npcs to help and merchents to buy from. Every dungeon has a duty associated with it, generated randomly when you enter, finish the duty and you get a large reward such as a nice haul of resources for building your kingdom, or artifacts or cores to help you summon more monsters and a nice fat wad of experience. I find this helpful for leveling up low level monsters to help them catch up with the rest of the party as you start the game off only able to have one monster in your party (Two after a tutorial battle which comes quickly in the begining) as you level up you can add more monsters to your party up to six.\n\nThe method of attaining your monsters has it's own unique spin this time around, instead of befirending wild monsters you use your magic on weakened monsters in the wild to extract their core. I think of this as something like essential salts from some of H.P. Lovecrafts works. Once you have three of the same type of core you can take it to the summoning brazier and along with some resources, (reagents for a evil summoning spell) you burn them there by calling your monster into your realm of existance from whatever dastardly plain they call home.\n\nThe thing I really love about this game though is the sheer bredth of it. You can play forever and still get stronger. There is no level cap. So you can level as long as you like. Crazy right? Yeah and things actually scale to your party's level. So if your character is super high level but you are working with a party of level 1 newbie monsters you can still have a decent shot in battle.\n\nAnyway I love this game and I'm only four hours in. If you think this game is something you would enjoy I can tell you that ten dollars is deffinatly worth the price of admition.\n\n","October 28, 2015","true","73.6"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","39","40","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/362090/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4901 products in account","A few years ago, roguelikes were so niche that their existence had to be shared through posts on obscure community forums. The same is largely true, though on a lesser scale, of actively seeking an 8-bit visual style, with re-releases of classics like DuckTales and Castle of Illusion shedding the graphical ties of their predecessors. Now though, roguelike is a buzzword and the older you can make a new game look, the wider the audience that stops to admire it. Regardless of how you feel about this sudden change, it's rarely true that these games capture the feel of the genre or present an authentic retro experience; they all too often come across as cynical, hollow and, at times, completely misleading.\n\nThis is exactly why I fell in love with Siralim; it accomplished a large number of things I'd started to believe were impossible.\n\nIf you've played the Dragon Warrior Monsters series, then you'll have a good idea of Siralim's basic gameplay. Instead of being a simple hunter, here you are the king of your realm, newly appointed after the death of your father with a general aim to improve the lives of your people by undertaking quests and expanding the castle grounds. Most of this is achieved through exploring the realms beyond your own that are navigated in a very traditional Rogue-style. The lands are teeming with unfriendly species though so to defend yourself, you need to build a party of those very same monsters. The beauty of the game may not stem from the core concept's originality (after all, each iteration of Pokemon sells well despite the generally minor mechanical differences). Instead, Siralim is a joy based on the very clear love and thought that went into each aspect.\n\nThe dungeons you explore aren't the lifeless grey labyrinths of many roguelikes, where the paths are unnecessarily elongated to provide a false sense of grand adventure. Instead, they're lush green pastures dotted with totems, camps and hay bales or they're chaotic wastes carved by lava pools and filled with the remains of the unfortunate. There are many variations to the environments and with that come different species to fight and recruit, which adds days of gameplay even if you're only interested in catching one of each type. Additionally, each realm has their own unique encounters that provide chances for loot, experience or danger and every one makes exploring the nooks a pleasure given how likely it is you'll be rewarded.\n\nCombat falls somewhere between a traditional roguelike and Dragon Warrior Monsters. Each creature has their own strengths, weaknesses, element and a core ability which alter the proceedings quite significantly at times. Battles can be slightly hands-off affairs, with your actions mostly amounting to confirming which target to attack but there will be moments that you step in to heal, cast offensive spells or order a retreat. Those expecting combat along the lines of Pokemon might be a little disappointed but Siralim is a roguelike first and foremost and while it's a streamlined system, there's more than enough room to feel like you're at the centre of the fray. The most important decision in your hands is the make-up of your team and so choosing from over 300 monsters and their respective perks will be enough work for many.\n\nIt's no understatement to say that Siralim is in desperate need of a wiki, and those that like their RPGs to be stuffed with secrets will be in their element. Optional items such as sigils can summon powerful foes for huge rewards and rare coins can be collected for great returns later. Your castle is dotted with hidden switches that hint at treasure and unusual cores can be combined to collect special monsters. This is ultimately just scraping the surface though, and with the game being designed to be playable until the end of days, there's little question over whether you're receiving value for money. Even the 249 achievements shows clearly how much work has gone into making sure you're entertained at all times.\n\nThere's been a massive overhaul of the graphics before the PC release and the improvements are clear to someone that has played both versions. Given the large number of creatures, it's impressive to see the range of creature designs and how much character they possess given they consist of simple pixels. Each explorable dimension is striking and unique, unusually so for the genre, and the sprites that follow behind you to represent each party member are clear and charming. The music is a typical fantasy midi-affair and whilst not quite award-winning, it gives enough background music to those that want to hear the great sound effects. The snarls, chomps and cries that accompany each creature's attacks add a simple but appreciated layer to a typically ignored facet of the genre.\n\nNo game is perfect and Siralim suffers from a few pacing issues; with the combat being largely automated, it would be great to fast-forward it slightly during the more assured victories. Exploration of the home castle can also feel a little sluggish, with the various services being spaced just far apart enough that the leisurely pace of your avatar feels like an unnecessary delay. The difficulty curve can hit a few inconsistencies where the opening of the game appears all too basic only to come up against certain duty quests or pandemonium events that wipe you out but you quickly learn to assess each encounter and make use of the ability to save at any point. The map is not quite as clear as I might like and the perk system for your character is hidden away slightly but they're minor complaints, lost in a sea of compliments.\n\nI could write an essay on what I loved about Siralim and I haven't even covered the craft system, artifact leveling, city-building elements or the spell system. There comes a point where if you're not interested in picking the game up after singing its praises this much then there's not much more I can say to change your mind. If you're in the camp of people that enjoy a good roguelike or RPG but worry that it will be finished before you've truly settled in then I have no trouble recommending this. I generally advocate waiting for a sale with most games, but for once, I feel like we have a game that is actually worth more than its asking price.","April 29, 2015","true","11.3"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","46","54","3","7"

In terms of sheer customization there is no limit to what you can do in this game. I start to get anxious when I realize I may never be able to try out every possible team/legendary artifact combination, because I simply do not have the time! It's a malicious time sucking game that is hard to pull yourself away from. Endlessly playable, and continually rewarding, based around systems that eternally feed into one another. Someone very evil devised this game.\n\nIf you like Dragon Quest Monsters or that sort of thing, obviously you'll like this. But beyond that, if you really enjoyed Disgaea's absurd level of customization and power leveling, then you'll also get a kick out of this game.\n\nI would say that the game does a respectable job of creating some interesting combat situations for you to consider, however, unless you're pushing your team to it's limits, the combat can devolve into a button mashing grind, which I would consider it's one failing. However, once you let yourself get deep enough, you simply don't care anymore, you just have to get the next artifact, legendary material, monster, nether monster, demonic nether monster, finish off that power spell, build that team you dreamed up, level these gems, clear this level, whew!\n\nYou know what?

Possibility of endless fun for once. It's classic, very deep RPG, with many functions and things to keep track of, great amount of creatures, realms, artifacts, useful items, rituals and so on, and so forth.

I'm usually the person who either enjoy the graphic or simply doesn't care since there are far more important things in games for me. But here graphic really bothered me. It's even more weird since I enjoy simplistic art style and retro games, so I started thinking about it and... Creatures - fighting with them, collecting them, creating your own team - this is the core of this game. And creatures are awfully ugly. And not in: "I'm a monster so duh I'm ugly" type of way, but: "I'm badly drawn, so I'm ugly". And it takes so much fun and pleasure from game that it's almost unbelievable. I can imagine much more people being interested in it, if the creatures was drawn in a better style.

I've played the game since beta and seen how far it has come- everything from the gameplay to the music has been overhauled and improved. The result is an extremely fun experience that you'll enjoy on many levels.\n\nThe game has just the right balance of difficulty- you'll find yourself getting a lot of rewards, but they won't feel like handouts. As you get deeper into the game, its complex systems will be revealed. You have a multitude of options from creatures, spells, artifacts, and more from which to customize your own playstyle.\n\nThe art and music in Siralim are extremely impressive for a very indie game like this. The game wasn't kickstarted- you can appreciate the effort the developer put in! The art is diverse and interesting, pulling influence from all the great pixelart RPGs from years past. The music is catchy and perfectly sets the mood for each area. If you like the boss music from Final Fantasy games, you'll also like it in Siralim.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough- try it! You've probably spent much more on "AAA" titles that you enjoyed much less than you will enjoy Siralim!","April 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

It looks simple, but is more sophisticated than most of all the games I have ever played. As a young king, you crawl through dundeons to provide yourself and your kingdom with valuables of any possible kinds. Let it be monsters for your army, riches, powerful artifacts, crafting materials, new citizens, you name it.\n\nYour party is made of creatures you catch in the dungeons and there are several hunderd of kinds to encounter. This makes infinite possibilities how to assemble your squad. Be aware that every creature has unique abilities and just their right combination can be crucial for success. And this is just the tip of an iceberg. You can also equip your crew with artifacts (levelable and enchantable with many possible features), support it with magic (like in HoMaM), or by levelling up your leadership abilities. Still I´m just writing about basics of the game, there is a lot more to discover.\n\nThe best thing is - you will never have enough resources for everything. In fact, you will always be pretty far from it. Therefore you always have to choose where to invest and how to play. Will you patiantly work on buffing your castle, or summon newest aquisitions of your bestiary and go berserk with them? From this point of view, Siralim is satisfying as a strategy/management game as well as rpg.\n\nEven with all this stuff, the learning curve is fluent and supported with well made guiding. Player doesn´t get lost, but naturally continue to explore new and new features and options he has. And after all, exploring is what makes Siralim the bottomless well of fun. Almost every visit of dungeon brings something new (I got currently about 30h played and still feel like on the startline). One of things that surprises me continually is AI, which seems to always be able to find a way to exploit my week spots and send my tuned up badass army to void:-P But don´t fear, there is no permadeath - there is no need for it for Siralim to be tough enough to crack.\n\nOriginally I thought absence of storyline will bother me, but rich life of Siralim kingdom is awesome story for itself. Elegant slap in the face of genre rivals.","July 12, 2015","true","240.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

You take control of a wizard, select one of the five magic schools to specialize in, and summon an ever-expanding team of creatures to traverse a rogue-like RPG full of retro pleasures, but also rife with rage-worthy pitfalls. Your team caps out at 6 creatures, and you lower the health of enemies to capture their cores and resummon your own creature in the comfort of your castle. Despite the obvious allusion that almost everyone will draw to Pokemon, Siralim truly is a game entirely of its own. Will it work its magic on you? Or is it completely unholy? Let’s find out as we take a deeper look at Siralim.\n\nThe controls are extremely dialed back, WASD to navigate the world and menus, E to confirm, Q to cancel. This can lead to some wonky moments when trying to sift through multiple screens to get the right piece of equipment onto the right monster, but overall it works well enough. This extremely simple control scheme allows the entire game to be played with the left hand, which is great because my right hand deserves a break. You are able to construct your own equipment to power up your monsters in battle, as well as building construction projects. These construction projects consume the same resources used to summon monsters, however they will let you travel to new realms and meet more powerful creatures to tame as your own.\n\nFinding the correct synergy between hundreds of different creatures is hard, but necessary. Once you reach the 5th level of this infinite dungeon you’re travelling into, enemies will begin to outlevel you in a big way. Creatures need to maximize the usage of their abilities if you hope to see it through. There is an option for permadeath for the extreme masochists out there, or for the maso-curious there is an option to reincarnate a dead creature with a fraction of its former experience. I find this option extremely intrigued by this option, and for most games I end up leaving it on. Dungeons contain plenty of buffs and loot, but you also might find yourself trapped in an event fight before you’re ready. Hence why I usually leave “real” permadeath off.\n\nSiralim is a game with a lot to love, but it also has its fair share of troubles. The sound is troubling, and replayability is hurt by the lack of differences between the magic schools. It is always nice to see how a new combination of creatures will fare in battle, but wizards should get a unique spell or something, not just a power-up to spells from their chosen school. Still, for the low price of $10, lovers of dungeon-crawlers are sure to get their money’s worth. Just restrain yourself from picking the permadeath option, and enjoy collecting them all. Siralim is a quality game, but in my opinion it needs a spot more polish to be truly great. Big thanks to Thylacine Studios for allowing IndieGameBundles to but this game through its paces. We hope to see more extremely soon!\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 7/10\nFun Factor- 7/10\nDifficulty- 10/10\nReplayability- 6/10\nInnovation- 8/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nMusic- 4/10\nSound FX- 5/10\nStory/Lore- 7/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 68/100 for innovation, fun factor, and graphics.\nSummary: A team-based RPG about collecting and summoning the ultimate team of monsters.\nVerdict: If you have an eye for RPGs or monster-taming, you’ve found your match.\n\nFull video breakdown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pknX5zkDkGk\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-siralim/","May 23, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","12","15","5","0"

Siralim is more Dragon Quest Monsters than Pokemon with a simplified yet very deep and challenging turn-based system. The aesthetic is great, the monsters are fantastically designed, and what little dialogue there is is very well written.\n\nMy major complaint is that since it doesn't have anything resembling a story really, after a while everything starts to get a bit samey, it's ultimately only a turn-based RPG after all, and in my opinion what held together the retro games Siralim models itself after was the challenge of the game system wrapped around a feeling of exploration and epic narrative. I wish at least there were more kinds of realms to explore or even arbitrary challenges to overcome that give you a sense of progress (something like a puzzle boss fight requiring specific tactics every ten floors or something, though the level scaling system is so well done that I know it's redundant). I've read the dev's opinions on the matter though, and he has good reasons for why that's the case, so I can't blame him. It just means that this game isn't everything I wanted out of a game like this, but it's pretty damn good.","June 24, 2015","true","75.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Add in the fact that the attacks are visually unappealing and the battles become boring soon. But make sure not to lose your attention, because there is no battle log, so any battle message you click away is forever lost!\n\n- the enemy progression is incredibly slow.\n\nI've played for almost two hours and the number of different enemies I've encountered can probably be counted on two hands.

It brings back memories of the older games i played like pokemon, digimon and dragon warrior monsters- to say the least. Yet, this game does more to stand out. While the story is nothing special, it sets up the reason for your character to do all this in the first place. The game starts with your father, the king, having died recently. With the responsibility of king/queen (Yes, you can choose your gender) placed upon you, it is your duty to help Siralim prosper while everyone at the castle holds the fort. The tutorial itself is hardly a tutorial, more of a guide of what you would likely want to do, since there is actually a lot to do in this game. If everything was unlocked, i feel that it would have been overwhelming and even downright confusing, so i would not recommend removing castle quests. Even when you complete it all and get your first nether creature (max out gems levels, you will need them,) the game does not stop there, it goes on forever! And there is some nice music too. Nothing spectacular, but it is nice to listen at times.\n\nThe game is anything but casual. No matter how good your team setup is, there will always be a counter setup- or even spells to smash you back down to reality. Yes, the first couple realms are easy, but the difficulty spikes as you go deeper. I still have yet to pass realm 5, and yet there are people have that gone MUCH deeper. Thankfully, the enemies tend to stay a general level with your group, to keep things fair. So if you want to go for a new team completely- you can do that without worry... Just be sure to open up a new realm when that happens. Otherwise you may wind up in a battle that is meant for your previous team.\n\nThere's a lot to do, losts to customize from how you distribute points to your own character to being able to reroll stats on artifacts (weapons for your creatures in this game.) You can even potentially use a creature's turn to cast a spell, which takes up a charge and some mana. Some spells are pretty disasterous for the one having to take it, while others are not quite as bothersome. Heck, there is a realm that is devoted to having spells as items you find all around the place- among other things. And that's another thing i like about this game, each realm offers different drops, making some a priority over others, depending on what you need. Need more cores? (Ways to summon more monsters,) go to a dungeon realm where you can get cores of creatures you unlocked (Yes, you unlock creatures by tiers... 30 tiers in total, no evolution.) Need more of a certain resource? There are realms that tend to have drops of those resources. Not much mind you, but it gives the necessary boost.\n\nThen there are the creatures. I can go on about them, but i will only say this... Each one is unique and offers an ability that can very well work with others to make an awesome combo. And as the ruler of the kingdom, it's up to you to decide how to mix and match those creatures and abilities. As if that's not enough, you can even get legendary crafting materials that allow you to put a creature ability on an artifact, giving even more customizable options for your team with 6 abilities. Then there is the fact that you will eventually be able to build daily stuff. So far, i have two. One is daily realms, where you can go into a daily dungeon and try to clear it days in a row for increased risk and reward. The other is daily power, where you can use the goblet for free once every day- no matter what. It tends to yield some pretty nice stuff that can help. Oh, and the goblet functions as a random reward generator. You put some power into it (amount you put in varies,) and you can get items, stuff and even exclusive creatures.\n\nThen there is a tiny metal bit like in dragon warrior monsters. Only you collect something called exalted emblems, which you eventually give to a guy that will gladly exchange them for some pretty nice stuff- including several unique monsters that can help with farming. One helps farm gems, one helps farm resources, etc. However, there is something called pandemonium tokens that is like taking a gamble. It can give you some pretty good different stuff, but it can also give you some pretty bad stuff- and then there's some that varies on personal opinion. You will have to find out yourself, because i doubt i've seen all it has to offer.\n\nNow, as for the negatives to this game... It can get rather grindy and repetitive at times. If you don't mind that, then there really is not much to complain about this game. If you are someone who wants a more modern graphics though, then i guess that counts as a flaw to this game. Otherwise, if you have a LOT of time to spare and don't mind going in for the long run, then this game is just up your alley!","June 27, 2015","true","93.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

So building the party of your 6 creatures is quite tactical. That being said during combat its absurdly simple. A creature can only attack, provoke or defend. The order of creatures are determined by stats and some RNGness. Actually fighting is not very tactical. That is more building the squad as I said. But it can get a wee bit deep after you get into it and start to see how you can set things up this way or that way and such. On top of this you can travel to realms and beat them to go to the next one which is harder. Eventually you will get to a level where monsters are so hard they overpower you. That's where spells and out of combat consumables come in!!! See, you are a mage. Your character is actually not in the party per say... its more like you're on the sidelines telling your creatures what to do. Instead of attacking, provoking or defending you can choose to cast a magical spell THROUGH your creature for its turn. Spells are cast off scrolls and all scrolls are consumable rare drops. You have to scribe them in your spellbook in order to use them in combat and they use mana.\n\nSo combat in Siralim is odd. Its tactical yet it isn't at the same time. Its complicated yet its sinfully mundane also.\n\nThe other aspct is gathering. Each realm you go to has resources scattered around which you use to make stuff and spend to upgrade your castle. You will need a LOT of resources. An ungodly amount. This game is 100% all about grinding. That's what people want when they go to a jRPG title. And this one has litteraly no story! Just gathering and fighting. Well, a little more to it then that but that's the idea :)\n\nI won't even get into explaining the creature system. just know there are hunderds of them to collect. Each one you hatch starts at level 1. And there are something called nether versions of creatures. Oh and creatures have elelments and stats. And I mentioned each creature has its own unique ability too. If this stuff makes your nips hard you get a LOT of game here.\n\nI enjoy it. Its a grind but that's why I play it. If you are an old school Dragon Warrior III and IV fan like myself I'd say get this! Oh and pick up LAST DREAM too! That's another GREAT one! I give this one a score of 4/5","May 8","true","83.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This was wrong, and while I bought it after the demo end (because the demo was rather short for me), I soon became disappointed. I mean, monsters only have one ability, and you can't breed, so what the heck, right?\n\nI came back to it later, after a few updates (there was a bug that kept crashing my game once I was around lv 18 or something anyway, so that combined with my disappointment made me put it away). I realised that my initial HEY DQM! was really not giving Siralim a fair chance. For one you can't really dominate in Siralim after a few hours like you can start to in DQM. For two, you can't just haphazardly throw things together and just expect them to work (which you can for like, 99% of the DQM content, haha). For three, fifteen levels is like a drop of ♥♥♥♥ in the ocean for this game; I'd never gotten into Nether monsters, I'd not even gotten into artifacts, much less synergizing monster teams ... I'd even considered spells absolutely useless trash, hahaha.\n\nThis game is *very* deep, and if you're looking for a quick nostalgia trip or a replacement for DQM/DWM, I think that you may be disappointed initially like I was. It's definitely a fair comparison of inspiration (monsters, randomly generated maps), but honestly while there is a good level of complexity in the old DWM games (I'm not up to date on the very newest releases), I'd have to say Siralim has a lot more depth going for it.\n\nIt also takes a lot more time to ramp up actually needing to get into that content, and it's really something that you discover by accident - it doesn't hold your hand, and things like party synergy aren't just told to you. It requires experimentation and really playing around with things to get a good feel for what works together.\n\nWell, that or reading on the community suggestions. I have to say replacing my Minotaur Warrior with a Brim Smith (after a restart, so pretty early team) has definitely increased my win rate. ;p\n","April 26, 2015","true","9.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Siralim not only won me over with the constant content updates and responses from the developer, but won me over by its community.\n\nWhile the game itself isn't multiplayer in any way, the community behind Siralim is more than happy to help new users with their builds, team compositions, and other tips. The reason such a community presence is important is due to the fact that Siralim boasts almost unlimited combinations when it comes to artifact creation (items used to buff party members), Nether Eggs (special monsters that have above average stats), and roguelike randomized dungeons with randomized quests.\n\nWith only about 6 hours in the game I have barely scratched the surface, but if you're on the fence at all when it comes to purchasing I have no doubt in my mind that if you enjoy games like Dragon Quest Monster and Final Fantasy styled battles you will enjoy everything Siralim has to offer.\n\nEDIT: In my prior review I stated the game was a mobile port. In actuality the game was created on PC first and then ported to Android/Apple devices! Honestly, I would highly recommend purchasing the game for both platforms to support such a dev team.","May 11, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Most of my playtime was on my phone.\n\nSiralim is basically an endless RPG game where you inherited a kingdom and you must bolster your kingdom's defences by diving in to random dungeons along with your monsters, recruit monsters and do quests. The game has no level cap and continue on endlessly. Story is basically non-existent so you will be disappointed if your are looking for some interesting plot or even your basic run-of-the-mill fantasy story.\n\nThe game takes inspiration from the old Dragon warior/quest monster games. There are around 325 monsters that you can fight and tame in the game. To recruit a monster, you need to extract 3 monster cores fromthat monster then pay some resources to summon that monster. Your monster doesn't have any skills but they will each have unique abilities similar to the creature abilities of pokemon (i.e one monster has a 50% chance of reviving your other knocked out monster whenever it attacks, this creature gains 200% attack from its equipment, etc.). Only your character can learn spells on your limited number of spellbook slots (expandable by spending points). Spells in this game are different, they use Mana and charges. Once you run out of spell charges, that particular spell is gone. Your creature can only equip one artifact. Each artifact can bestow different stat boost and additional abilities. The game allows you to create and level your artifacts and imbue it with different skill for your monsters. The skills are basically passive ones similar to the abilities.\n\nThe battle mechanics are similar to the Dragonquest RPGs. Despite the lack of active skills similar to pokemon/demon/monster moves of SMT, Pokemon and DQ/W monsters, the battle is still tactical and you cannot just rofltstomp all your enemies. The wide variety of abilities per monster and team can let you encounter a lot of different threats. The synergy of each monster abilities in the random mobs you encounter would determine the difficulty of the battle. Different combos and synergies exist because of the variety of monster abilities. Balance might be a problem especially when you encounter a mob that would have overpowered monsters. The best part about the game is that there are no tiers like how Smogon classify pokemons. Any monster is viable as long as you can make in synergise with your other monster's abilities.\n\nThe game has no breeding or fusion/synthesis mechanics that are found in Pokemon, DW/Q monsters or the Shin Megami Series. The game allows you to make nether and demonic monsters. Nether and Demonic monsters are basically a version of a monster that has super high stats. They take a long time to create and the monsters take a long time to level but they are worth it.\n\nThe game is grindy but basically that kind of addictive grindiness you can get in playing those hack n slash lootfest. This is basically the equivalent of those hack n slash lootfest feeling translated in to an RPG. The game has been classified as a roguelike but it is not meant to be played as one. Activating hardcore mode basically gives you that extra challenge of suriving for as long as you can.\n\nAt a glance, you might dismiss this game as some other shallow RPG game. The graphics are similar to those good old GBC games and I am amazed at how the devs captured the colour pallet similar to the old games from the GBC. The art-style is nothing compared to any modern AAA game but it is surely appropriate for the type of game and if you are a fan of those old school sprites then you will definitely love it.\n\nOverall, the game is really worth your money, it is super addictive and you can really see that the devs know what are the addictive parts of the dragonwarrior monsters game and put it in one neat little package. The game has endless replayability since it puts disgaea's 9999 level cap to shame with its infinite level cap. I would highly suggest that you try the game on PC or mobile if you have doubts about it.","August 15, 2015","true","7.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It features a large host of monsters the player can "capture" and randomly generated dungeons. The game has no story or ending which could be good or bad depending on what you are looking for in a game.\n\nWhat makes the game shine is how the party system works. Monster have very few actions they can take in combat, i think the only choices are Attack, Defend, Provoke (taunt), Magic, and run. There are no skills they learn in games like DQM or Pokemon; however, each monster has a unique passive ability that effects combat in different ways. Party building works around getting these abilities to work in synergy to pass more and more difficult levels.\n\nThe ability system is further increased by the crafting system. Crafting allows you to add stats and effects to your gear. Each piece of gear can also have one of ANY (i think) creature ability in the game attached to it. This allows for really deep party customization and gives the player alot of room for strategy.\n\nPros\n+Deep party customization with both monster choice and item choice.\n+Essentially endless replayability\n+Graphics are retro and look fantastic in my opinion.\n+Dev(s) still activly working on the game and very vocal with the community.\n\nCons\n-Alot of the crafting materials and consumables tend to not get used.

I've just gotten past the tutorial sections because I spent so much time playing my way and just having fun in the maps and leveling up different aspects of the game before more advanced mechanics were added.\n\nPros:\n+ Great retro feel. The graphics really bring me back.\n+ Huge variety of monsters that there are innumerable customization options (although some will clearly be better than others)\n+ A great "play at your own pace" game. I ventured out on my own away from the suggested tutorials, leveling my creatures and building up my castle.\n+ Rewarding "Duties" system that makes you always feel like you're working towards something.\n+ Intuitive level/skill tree. Very customizable and easy to understand exactly what each skill does. There are no real skill walls that you must have one to access another. I personally have mine currently geared towards resource-gathering and quest rewards in order to accelerate my castle advancements and team-building.\n+ Challenging without the feeling of hopelessness. If you need to grind, you can, or you can just keep starting over.\n+ Tons of communication from Zack on the forums.\n\nCons\n- I would love to be able to see more about my enemies, whether it's their skills, HP more specifically than "Complete health," "Lightly bruised, "Somewhat hurt," "Bady wounded" and "Mortally wounded." Sometimes it feels like a guessing game knowing who I should attack. This is particularly frustrating when I run into a new monster, attack it, and suddenly my entire team is suffering from massive debuffs because I had no idea what the monster did.\n- Early game Nether creature quests are just too hard. Particularly the return Siralim's monsters back to the country duties. They're nearly impossible until you have at least one decently high level nether monster of your own. That's daunting so early in the game.\n- No wiki. A website has been reserved for it, but man would it be nice. There's just so much variety in this game that sometimes you want to look up information for things like team-building. There is an in-game library that houses much of this information, but it is strictly limited to things that your character already knows about.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed this game an incredible amount.

In the realm of Siralim a king is not one of leadership or royalty, instead they are pretty much guardians that protect the realm. As such you will not be commanding anybody, setting taxes or anything else one would associate with a king. Your duty is to travel to other randomly generated realms and kill its inhabitants for the fun of it or to capture their souls. Once you capture three souls of the same monster type you will be able to go back to your castle and summon your very own loyal minion from fusing the three souls together. I'm pretty sure we are the villains of this game but due to it having absolutely no story it is open to interpretation. Starting off you can choose one of several mage types that have different abilities and can be changed for a different class later on with a few resources. The gameplay is split into two parts, the exploration and the combat phase. While exploring you will have an overhead view of you and your party and are able to search for treasures, resources or gambling dwarfs. Bumping into an enemy will trigger the combat phase which is in first person and plays like a turn based dungeon crawler.\n\nEvery monster has their own quirks to them such as being able to revive from death, gaining attack power each time it is hit or sacrificing some of its own life to attack. It does make each monster feel unique though there is not much fun to be found in the combat regardless. Each monster can only attack, defend or provoke an enemy meaning the only strategy is which enemy you should attack first. Most of your time will be spent mashing the attack prompt without bothering to read what is going on in the battle since there is not much you can do about it anyways. Your monsters have no skills, positioning doesn't matter in the slightest and there is nothing more to fighting than a simple attack. Our mage is an off screen support character that can cast some spells granted he has the mana to do things like heal or attack enemies. In order to use magic you will need to equip a scroll with a limited number of uses meaning that you cannot rely on your mage as a source of varying up the combat since you may need the spells later on. Combat really gets tedious fast and fighting is a very common thing in this game. There are some flaws to the battle UI such as not showing how much mana a spell would use and displaying what in the world the status effects do or even if an enemy is inflicted with one or not.\n\nLeveling up your creatures does not feel fun at all since the only information they give you is that your creature has leveled up which doesn't really mean anything since they will not learn new skills or be any different than when they were at level 1. When your mage levels up it is a bit more interesting since you will earn royalty points which allow you to increase attack, mana or a various amount of other things such as bigger rewards when completing duties. Even that lacks any sense of excitement or fun since most of your skills will only be augmented by 1% making for a tedious grind and dedication to one skill in order to notice even the slightest effect. There are artifacts that can be either made or found that will have a noticeable effect in defense or offense on the monster you choose to equip it with. Artifacts level up the more they fight with them but it falls in the same problem as the monsters in that they fail to tell you how it's any better only other than it being a higher level. There are a metric ton of consumables in this game that you can take before battle in order to gain more experience, defense or allowing you to attack first. Pretty much everything leads back to the lousy combat unfortunately. It is rather hard to stay motivated when every reward, trinket and consumable you are fighting to get does not change the formula of mashing the attack prompt until you’ve won or have died.\n\nIf one of your monsters is killed in battle it is no big deal, everyone will be at full health with no status effects crippling them once you have either won the battle or fled. It kind of cheapens fights and makes them even more boring since every fight will have you be at your strongest. There is no tension as you fight more and more, meaning that preparations are not really needed, you just step in a dungeon and grind away. After battle you are given resources which in turn can be used to research more realms to explore, blacksmiths, enchanters and many other services for your castle. Once you purchase your selected research you must kill enemies until you got enough life-force to complete it. Realms contain a few differences such as different effects during battle like freezing or enemies reviving, different music and different themed sprites for treasure & resources. What realm you are thrown into is purely random. You can summon a two way portal to go back to your castle any time and return where you left off but if you turn off the game or die that portal will disappear and you will start in realm 1 again.\n\nThis game is not pretty by any means but it gets the job done and it is pretty cool to be followed around by a conga line of summoned monsters. There are a ton of monsters to collect and you even have a stable to keep them all in. It is pretty satisfying collecting a bunch of unique monsters. Despite not personally enjoying this game I can definitely see the appeal of being a death mage king followed by a horde of minions. This is definitely the slow burning type of game where it will take you a ton of time to do anything but there is always something to do. Whether that is a good thing comes to personal preference. The amount of content on here is quite massive but very stretched out. Tons of different monsters with a few quirks but in the end all there is to combat is to press the attack button until one of you dies, tons of different realms but little difference between them, tons of missions but no substance to them as they are usually kill X amount of monster or collect X amount of items. One of the selling points of Siralim is that it's truly an endless game and one that will offer you countless hours if you manage to get past or even enjoy the combat. If you are one to enjoy collecting all the feathers in Assassin's Creed or the type that collects all of the Pokemon this game will surely entertain you for a good while.","February 29","true","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Try out the demo first.  It'll give you a good idea of what's in store, and the Steam version will even seamlessly import your demo game savefile.\n\nSolid, surprisingly deep old-school RPG game.  It starts out simple, with only one dungeon type unlocked and a limited set of enemies.  Then you start rituals.  Rituals to open up more monster tiers, which give you new monsters to fight.  To open up new dungeon types (each of which tends to be high or low on certain resources).  To build facilities for a forge to make new items and an enchanter to put enchantments on them.  To build an arena.  To give you useful items and monsters.  To enchant gems and eggs so you can hatch yourself super powerful monsters.  The complexity adds on and on, always giving you something new to do.\n\nI also like how the challenge scales.  You control it.  Hang out on the low-level dungeons, and you'll always have a nice, easy slaughterfest.  Go further down in search of rarer items and you'll always have a challenge, until your monsters are fighting things high above their own level and tactical use of consumable items, equipped artifacts, compatible monster skills, and a friendly RNG is all that's keeping you alive.  Not to mention, you get to fight some pretty cool monsters with unique abilities right from the start, then summon them to fight for you.

No really, I mean too much.\n\nPros:\n-Tons to do.  Lots of creatures, unique abilities, gambling, ways to buff your creatures, spells... you name it.\n-Pretty decent AI to go with all that.\n\nCons:\n-No end goal (that I know of).  There's a tutorial/story that lasts quite a few hours, but after that it's just sandbox.\n-Balance issues.\n-Repetitive.\n-Too much to do.\n\nEven though it looks like I'm stacking the cons, I'd still recommend the game for simple (if you like strategy) fun.  I'm a fan of widely varied abilities, and this game is one of the best I've seen for that.  However, the risk/reward balance is off.  You can make an unbeatable team with some of the earlier creatures.  There's no incentive to go deeper... in fact, you get more powerful rewards faster by just repeating the first few levels.  And until you make a fairly unbeatable team, you'll just be repeating about the first 5 levels anyway.  As for abilities, some low level creatures have some great abilities.  And as soon as you start getting legendary materials, you can just customize them into the most powerful units, anyway.  The AI is decent, but fights get quite repetitive once you've built a team that can take on anything.\n\nWith a little more balance adjustment, this game could be even better.  Unfortunately with all the skills built in so closely with the creatures, I don't see a fully balanced game unless a sequel is made.  But as I said, I'd still recommend it as a good simple game with lots of potential.","May 2, 2015","true","362.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I wouldn't NOT recommend it.\n\n+ Limitless combinations for your team (weapons and monsters)\n+ Weapon customization\n+ Limitless random maps and map upgrades (ie, snow map, forest map, sorcery based map)\n+ Pretty decent music\n+ Oldschool graphics (hey, I'm a fan)\n+ Male OR Female main character\n+ You're a wizard, 'arry.\n+ No but seriously, you're a wizard.\n+ You're also King. Or Queen. Automatic plus for that. Hail King Daedra.\n\n- Tasks are tedious (I haven't gotten through but the first few hours of gameplay and all the tasks are pretty much the same)\n- Resources take some serious time to get (For example, many rituals take somewhere around 1000+ resources. Each battle only gives maybe 150 of each, and the battles can get long and tedious as well)\n- Gets pretty repetitive after a while.\n- Not any REAL difference in the maps. They're all pretty much the same concept. There's not really an open world map or anything where you get to choose which map or place you get to go to.\n- Limited NPCs. All the NPCs you encounter are inside your castle. (I'm a gamer who likes his NPCs, so this was a bit disappointing to me, but yo, that's just me)\n- Not really any story to this game, even though it seems like there would be. You just kinda...catch'em all.\n- No real achievements...hey, ya built a blacksmith? Well that's great, but you have to upgrade him again to get him to actually make you weapons/armor/wizard things.\n- Grinding heaven.\n\n\nThose are only my personal peeves on the game. Yet I'm still playing it in the hopes that something new happens. This is literally just a quest game. Quest after quest. Despite that, it's not too bad. I wouldn't buy it at $10, though. Got mine on sale at 51% off, so yeah. Not sure if I'd recommend at full price. This game is a good time killer, but it's literally mostly all grinding.

One day I decided to buy Terraria. When I started it up I was disgusted at the graphics and I laughed at any idiot who would be dumb enough to play a modern game with such ugly graphics and simple gameplay. One week later I had clocked in over 50 hours.\nWhat I realized is that GAMEPLAY and not Graphics are what really matter in a game. No one will ever remember a game for its graphics, but for it's gameplay.\nNot all indie games are good and I hate when review sites praise games for being artistic, but when they are good we need  to try and give them a chance to see if we like them. Siralim is only $10. I bought it, and once again I found a great game that feautures far more content than many $60 dollar games that we buy year after year. Try it!\n\nI am now going to go in depth on what I believe makes this game so special.\n\nIn Siralim, you gather a team of 6 different creatures that follow you around on maps that get progressively harder the more you complete.\nThe game is extremely similiar to an older game called Dragon Quest Monsters and feels very much like a spiritual succesor.\nThere are over 300 creatures in the game and they each have a perk that is oftentimes crazy good, like a unicorn that has a 50% chance to ressurect another creature every time they attack.\nIn addition, their are gear pieces like swords, shields and helmets that also have abilities on them. With other 300 creatures and a vast variety of gear pieces, the various absurd combinations that can be made are staggering.\nThe game is hard, but It gives you every oppurtunity to come up with your own unique strategy to overcome that challenge level.\nThe game is stunningly indepth, even though in the beginning it seems fairly simple. The game is constantly throwing new things to do and work towards and new mechanics to try and master. I love always playing and always have something unique/fresh to look foward to.\nLastly, I LOVE the fact that the developer is willing to stick with the game and update it for free. Heck, I would even pay money for substainal updates. We have an oppurtunity here as gamers to help see such a unique game thrive so that more new ideas can be brought to the table as well.\n\nIf you have ever played and liked Pokemon, Dragon Quest/Dragon Quest Monsters, Hearthstone, custimizable party RPG's , turned based RPG's like FF1-10, and really any other game that required you to actually think about strategy in order to overcome difficult challenges, then I promise Siralim is for you.","May 9, 2015","true","15.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Siralim captures everything that is loved about this style game and just emphasizes it. Not only does it have great gameplay and it flows really well, but it also has a great amount of diversity, especially since version 2.0 came out. I love the mages, I love the creatures, I love the realms. Not to mention it reminds me of Dragonwarrior Monsters which I have always loved. It truly is the best game I've played of this genre since then.  I love everything it. Siralim is totally worth the money and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone.

There is really so much to do in this pixel rpg. So much so that I have a great big headache. In a good way.\n\nYou start of as a very inexperienced mage commanding one creature and slowly work up to being in command of up to six creatures who fight for you in turn based battles.\n\nThe battles themselves may seem simplistic but you sometimes have to decide between attacking an enemy or attempting to steal a creature core. Steal 3 cores from the same creature and later on when you return to your castle you can create the same creature to join your ranks in your spell chamber.\n\nAll dungeons are randomly generated which includes the quests. No game will ever be the same.\nAlso there is no level cap. All your minions level up and so do you. You can for instance be a 387th level Sorcery mage or a 2497 level life mage...(Yes I know this will probably take a very long time) you really can do this.\n\nThere are so many rescources to find to cast spells , craft items , level up gems...and probably others but I cant be bothered to mention those.\n\nAlso you can add buildings to your castle to gain new options such as an arena to fight in and an enchanter to do all gem and enchantery stuff in...ahem...any way what im trying to bloody tell ya...(Yes I know I said Bloody..I am British you know..) is buy this game...IT DESERVES YOU....\n\nThere is so much gameplay here for a measy £6.29 I feel that I have ripped of the devs.\nI hope they keep on adding stuff to make this the biggest rpg/beardy/weirdy game in the world !!!...yes my friends and you will have only paid a pathetic £6.29.\n\nNo I dont know the developers and im not in anyway connected with them...although on a fundamental level we are all connnected my brothers and sisters and...er....anyway I got to go and play more...I need to  play this more...I must play more...must not sleep...sleep is for losers anyway.....hey is that you ron ?!!...oh sorry its my mum...anyway gotta go now for real.\n\n10/10 Would lose myself in this gem of a game forever...\n\nP.S On their website the devs said one of their goals was to create a game that you can play forever !!!...yes forever !..the fools I thought...dont be silly...erm well I think they were not kidding...you can play this game forever....and ever...so much stuff to tell ya but im off now to play some more...farewell for real this time.....","April 30, 2015","true","75.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What may seem like a fairly simple game with oldschool lackluster graphics and chiptunes will quickly become an addiction that you can't seem to shake.  There's incredible depth in this game that I haven't seen in AAA titles. I've played 17 hours at the time of the review and have barely scratched the surface of this game.  Be warned though, this game is a never-ending grind; as it is intended to be.  There is hardly a story and no end to the beautiful madness.\n\nSiralim harkens to the days when games weren't out to purely capitalize on the gamer.  I can tell that this game is made by a team that grew up playing games and respects the artform.  It's challenging, it's deep, it's complex but it's easy to grasp and understand and completely approachable.\n\nIf you enjoy rogue-like RPGs, monster taming, and grinding out to awesome chiptunes.  Get this game.  For the price it is offered at it's a steal.  I could easily put hundreds of hours into this game and still not be finished with it.  I'm the type of gamer that is really hard to please.  I have 250+ games on Steam and play only a few of them, because only a few have garnered my attention.  If you are an RPG and rogue-like fan, take it from me when I say that this one will hook you.\n\nI honestly have no clue how to classify this game besides the umbrella term of RPG because it mashes so many different aspects together.  Strategy, roguelike, turn-based, stat building, monster taming, castle building, crafting...\n\nI really love this game.  The developer is super responsive too.

While the combat system is quite different, it's unique - which is a stunning achievement in one of the most oversaturated genres: the turn-based rpg.\n\nThis game beats out modern AAA rpgs with strong mechanics and simple pixel art alone. There is no story, little direction, and limited handholding - just a simple tutorial that introduces you to each mechanic. You have to be the type of gamer who appreciates exploring game mechanics over presentation to consider this game.\n\nIf you are that gamer, hoo boy, strap in - you've found a hidden gem!\n\nThe game feels like it has Disgaea levels of content (near infinite), and the gameplay loop is rediculously satisfying. You're constantly expanding your team, finding and crafting interesting loot, and fighting tough battles. You are not just farming numbers however, as building your team, and surviving, takes serious thought and experimentation.\n\nOn top of everything the dev is seriously amazing, answering questions, turning feedback into updates, and spreading this game out to every platform under the sun. I've played this on android, I've played this on Windows, and I've even played this on Linux.\n\nLooking forward to the sequel!","April 19","true","29.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Permadeath is not the default, and is only for very, very hardcore players, since I've been playing 35 hours and I still feel like I'm at the beginning of my run. There are random dungeons, yes, but they all feel the same. Nothing you find in a dungeon will make it feel or play any differently from the last time you visited that realm. The only loot I've found that really felt like it changed the game was a weapon with a legendary enchant, and that's happened just once in 35 hours.\n\nBut none of that should stop you from buying it! Siralim is all about collecting and battling monsters. And there are hundreds of them, each with its own special ability. Battles are old-oldschool turn based, like the original Final Fantasy, but the tremendous variety of monster abilities keeps it from ever becoming boring.  These are not directly triggered by the player (but you have spells that fill that role), rather they are used automatically in certain situations, such as the beginning of combat, beginning of turn, when attacking, when being attacked, when an enemy dies, or even at the end of combat. You can have up to six monsters in your party, and choosing a group that complements each other is key to your success (or failure). For example, my tank mob is able to provoke enemies into attacking it 100% of the time, and I've got a legendary enchantment on its boots that causes any creature attacking it to fall asleep. There must be thousands of combinations other than this basic and obvious (though very effective!) one.\n\nBeyond monsters, there are artifacts to craft and enchant. Each monster can have one artifact equipped, which will improve various stats and sometimes provide an extra ability. For my tank monster I mentioned above, I enchanted his artifact with defense (duh) and speed (so he can use his "provoke" ability before the enemies attack). Every monster ability in the game has a corresponding material (some are very rare) which can be used to enchant an artifact, giving that ability to the monster who wields it. With hundreds of monsters and abilities, the level of customization is ridiculous.\n\nThere's even more--some kind of egg thing that you put jewels into, and enchant the jewels, or something, that gives you a "nether monster", a powered-up version of a regular monster. As you can tell, I'm not familiar with this aspect of the game yet. I just opened it up.\n\nCastle upgrades, character perks, the list goes on...the depth of Siralim is astonishing. During all the 35 hours I've played so far, I've felt like I'm constantly discovering and building toward new things. It's a grinding game, but there's just so *much* stuff to grind that it never feels boring.\n\nVerdict: Highest recommendation. Unless you hate all the stuff I described above, you should buy Siralim immediately.","June 1, 2015","true","549.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But ultimately\nA test in tedium.\n\nOverall I love the idea of the game, and it DOES get my dorky min-maxer rocks off a bit, the whole "endless" everything, "no cap", theorizing game breaking monster builds.\n\nunfortunately there is a fine line in between being fun in theory and being fun in practice.\n\nThe game seems to be designed with unnecessarily long grinds in mind. There is an artificially long barrior from seeing some of the higher tiered monsters, seperated by very long "creature tier" rituals you must do over and over and over again, increasing in cost each time, all to see one or two new monsters per ritual. You will subsidize this cost by spending a majority of your early game skills points in boring skills like "Gain more resources" after battle. and other comparable economy styled skilled. Another popular one "get better loot", sounds cool right? not when the early game loot is borderline trash, and it seems that this must be leveled to get any sort of "normal" loot that you finally feel was worth your efforts.\n\nThe levels (realms) while starting off simple, small, cute, a good time waster size, turn into massive expeditions with tons of wasted space that your character will take forever to walk slowly over. The upgrade for faster move speed in castles would have been nice in realms too...\n\nThere is no goal, unlike pokemon with badges, this has no direction other than, like stated previously, to get EXTREME cases of "min-maxer" typed brain people's dopamine flowing, so they can get deeper and deeper in the endless dungeon, and so they can show off there "suber OP" level 462 team off to... their friends when they visit them... or, an online message board if they post pictures... because the game isn't multiplayer.\nIn my opinion a bit more sense of direction would have been nice, maybe bosses every ten realms or so, some sort of small goal atleast. When you defeat them you could get a little trophy and some sort of loot, possibly some unique or rarer loot to make it worth your trouble.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, it does have it's moments, and i will probably even pick up the second one. I just feel like most of the 'reward' never feels worth the effort.","April 27","false","28.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

There's a lot to say about this game so let's dig in.\n\nGameplay: The basics of this game involve you, a sorceror king/queen, but you're no fighter. You must summon creatures to fight your battles (up to 6) in turn based RPG combat. Along the way you'll collect resources to build your castle out and uncover powerful artifacts that give you the edge you need to delve deeper.\n\nThe difficulty is steep, but enjoyable because it rewards thinking about your party setup. Each creature has a unique perk such as "reving upon 1st death" or "casts a barrier on party at start of combat," and so a well thought team packs an extra whollop. What will really break the difficulty for you though is how well you use the 3 primary stat systems: Royalty, Artifacts and Nether Creatures.\n\nRoyalty is a prestige system where every level the Lord earns it gets to permanent upgrade some facet of the game in its favor. Increased loot, loot quality, +1% to dmg, etc.\n\nArtifacts add heaps of extra abilities onto your creatures. Though they can only equip one at a time, artifacts level up indefinitely and each level lets you add another enchantment.\n\nNether Creatures are your usual monsters, but on magical steroids you've been injecting it with since it was an egg. These take a lot of effort to build and a lot of time in investment, but a well thought Nether can be 2-5 times as strong as a plain creature of its level.\n\nGraphics: Quirky old fashion sprites.\n\nSounds: Ho-hum. I turned it off and played ambient dungeon sounds instead.\n\nLength/Story: There is no story. The game is all about diving deeper and deeper and forever upgrading. Think Disgaea without all the pesky "humor."","April 28, 2015","true","27.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As you win battles and encounter new creatures in the wild, you quickly reach a point where you can summon a second creature to fight for you. Then a third and so on, until you can summon a total of six creatures to form a fighting team.\n\nThe abilities, attributes and fighting styles of the creatures vary wildly, and the game rewards innovation and experimentation: You'll quickly learn that various combinations of creatures can amplify each other's abilities, or work in synchronicity. Some creatures specialize in heavy direct damage; others have wide-ranging attacks that can hit multiple enemies at once; some have limited offensive prowess, but severely punish enemies that attack them; others are mimics, taking on the abilities of their enemies; some can turn enemies to stone, put them to sleep, confuse them into attacking their own allies, and so on. There are others that defy categorization completely.\n\nThere are more than 300 creatures, including various types of demi-gods, angels, banshees, dragons, wyverns, giants, flying fortresses, nature aspects, hunters, unicorns, scorpions, giant sand worms, demons, elemental priests, necromancers, ethereal warriors, Lovecraftian horrors, storm incarnations, and more.\n\nOnce you've assembled your team (or teams -- you can keep as many creatures in the stable as you like), you've only just scratched the surface. There are a wide variety of "artifacts" which function essentially as weapons and gear, with customizable enchantments, and stat attributes that can be upgraded and leveled. There are rituals, which can expand your castle and allow you to construct chambers for blacksmiths, spellcasting, enchanters, etc. There are Nether Orbs, which can be seeded with as many as 40 gems of varying types to create Nether Creatures, more powerful versions of the game's monsters. There's a Gem Temple, where those gems can be customized and tailored to the specific creature and role you have in mind.\n\nAll that, on top of various realm types, various types of quests you can pick up in the realms, special packs of powerful enemies that can be summoned with Sigils, gambling dwarves, rival mages who challenge your reign, mysterious items that can grant a range of buffs and debuffs, an emblem/token system to purchase additional items, merchant NPCs, daily quests, and an arena.\n\nIn addition, there are several hundred spell types, augments, special abilities that can be added to weapons and armor, and "legendary" crafting materials that can grant powerful abilities to your creatures. All that, and I haven't even scratched the surface of the leveling system that allows you to upgrade your character and creatures with a wide variety of perks, skills and stat bonuses.\n\nAs of writing this review, I have 110+ hours in Siralim and I still have not explored everything the game has to offer.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Absolutely fantastic creature design reminiscent of old-school, classic NES roleplaying games, in all their pixelated, nostalgic glory.\n\n- An intuitive combat system that feels familiar the instant you begin your first fight. It's just like playing Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. It's easy to pick up, difficult to master.\n\n- Varied realm types that are much more than just different skins: Each realm type has its own quirks, items unique to that realm, destructables items that hide loot, and NPCs to encounter.\n\n- An extraordinarily deep team system that encourages players to experiment with different creature lineups, creating endless possibilities for synchronicity and creatures/abilities that complement each other.\n\n- Opponents that are truly crafty and difficult to deal with in the later levels. Even when your team becomes exceptionally powerful, there are points where you'll have to carefully consider your plan of attack, your defensive strategy, and the spells you cast.\n\n- Extraordinary depth in every aspect of the game. If you're into min/maxing, experimenting with set-ups, finding new ways to accomplish goals, and coming up with your own strategies, Siralim allows you to do that.\n\n- NPCs and dialog that have a sense of humor and wit. There are barmaids who are willing to throw themselves at you (you are the King, after all), rival mages looking to usurp your thrown, dozens of creatures walking the halls of your palace, gambling dwarves, and pet kittehs ready to greet you with a meow.\n\n- A very friendly developer who engages with his players and is always happy to get feedback. A lot of that feedback was incorporated into game updates, and that feedback has informed design choices for the sequel. Siralim received several signficant patches and content updates that also helped smooth out the game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The music is charming at first, and certainly helps with immersion and the nostalgia factor, but you will probably find that your adult ears are less tolerant of repetitive tunes than your kid ears were. After a while, I turned off the music and started listening to podcasts while I played Siralim.\n\n- While sound effects can also be disabled, there are no volume sliders. It's all or nothing, which means that if you're listening to something else while playing, it will be drowned out in regular increments by the sounds of attacks and spells.\n\n- While the Nether Orb and Nether creature system is an awesome idea, and the reward is definitely worth it, the process by which you ultimately hatch Nether creatures is long and needlessly confusing. Siralim's developer knows this, and has plans to streamline the system in Siralim 2. In any case, it's a good idea to visit the in-game library and/or read the Wiki and official forums to learn about Nether orbs, eggs, gem types, and orb colors.\n\n- YMMV, but I've experienced an odd bug that arbitrarily slows my character down as he's walking through the various realms. Sometimes I'll play the game and everything is fine, then the next time my character will walk slower for some reason. I have not been able to figure this out.\n\n- The "extraction" system can sometimes be frustrating. In order to summon a particular creature, you need to extract 3 "cores" from that specific type of creature during battles. But later in the game, it can become a lot more difficult to predict your attacks, and sometimes you're forced to kill creatures before you can extract them, because letting them live could cause you to lose. This is only a problem later on in the game, and it's not a problem for all builds.\n","January 31","true","117.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather light in story, but instead of hindering the game it sort of helps it. There is a focus then on the gameplay. You collect creature 'cores' through extracting them in combat, then buil up an army of crazy, awesome, powerfull creatures. As you progress nemuerous feaatures re added, each one increasing the depth. Combat at first might appear simplistic, one you aquire more creatures and progress though, the difficulty increases. Thankfully the increase is a true curve as opposed to an abrupt cliff.

You start out as the ruler of a castle and go through portals to randomized dungeons. Extremely addictive and by far one of the most replayable games I've ever seen. It starts out fairly simple, but as you earn more things and do more stuffs it gets progressively more complex. You will unlock more monsters, castle areas, and dungeons. Fairly good pixel art, as I find alot of indie games have extremely unnatractive art this was pretty refreshing. Akin to Final Fantasy III or the Dragon Warrior games. Music is also quite good and fairly relaxing. Worth three times the asking price. BUY IT NAOW.","August 10, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is only a problem later on in the game, and it's not a problem for all builds.\n","January 31","true","117.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather light in story, but instead of hindering the game it sort of helps it. There is a focus then on the gameplay. You collect creature 'cores' through extracting them in combat, then buil up an army of crazy, awesome, powerfull creatures. As you progress nemuerous feaatures re added, each one increasing the depth. Combat at first might appear simplistic, one you aquire more creatures and progress though, the difficulty increases. Thankfully the increase is a true curve as opposed to an abrupt cliff. Not for everyone, it is a real gem, whose quirks just make me love it all the more.","January 29","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
