There was a lot I liked about the first game.\n\nHowever there is a lot about this second chapter that makes me really sorry I bought it.\n\nGood points first:\nThe visuals are decent.\nThe story is engaging\n\nThe bad:\nThe hammiest voice acting I've ever heard.\nThe puzzles are llogical\nPixel hunting to find objects and locations is not fun.\nThe pace is really slow\nOne aspect of the plot is just weird and creepy and disturbing\n\nOnly buy this if the future episodes turn out to be  more promising and you want completion of the story.","February 20, 2015","false","9.1"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","3"

This result is even better than the previous chapter. The Eymerich saga is a must have for who love point&click adventure.","January 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the second part just to see how the story progresses.\n\nThis time navigating around the game world is so clumsy and terrible it's practically impossible to find your way around the game world. When you hover a cursor over a medieval village scene half of the screen says "exit". There are actually several different exits, though, but how are you supposed to tell them apart when the open scenery looks like you could go anywhere?\n\nSolving the puzzles is awkward. Half of the time I knew exactly what I was supposed to do, but I wasn't clicking stuff in the right order. Or at the right time. Or I didn't quite find the right spot to click. Sometimes the protagonist clearly said that he can't do this or that, but sometimes he didn't. So I just fiddled around and hoped for the best, basically. Gotta give this a thumbs down, even though I like the atmosphere and the fact that the protagonist is a bit of a d1ckhead.\n\nOh, and the game is buggy. Better save often or you might lose an item and get stuck in a loop when a cutscene glitches.","November 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Where do I start. Maybe I should start with the Lord's prayer to absolve my purchase of this game. This game is not a game , it is a virtual flogging of your better judgement for pressing the "add to cart" button. It is filled with nonsense, bad graphics, horrible controls, bugs galore and voice acting that will make you vomit. This is a TERRIBLE representation of the Adventure  Genre.  I cannot put into words how bad this game is.  I played through the whole thing and I need to be asylumed for it. Lord forgive me for I have sinned.

Όπως εκείνη αποτέλεσε μαύρη σελίδα στην ιστορία της ανθρωπότητας συχνά καταδικάζοντας αθώους πολίτες, έτσι κι αυτό καταδικάστηκε απ' τους ίδιους τους δημιουργούς του ν’ αποτελέσει ένα μελανό σημείο της ιστορίας των adventure game και τίποτα παραπάνω.\n\nJust like the Holy Inquisition was a black spot in the history of mankind, due to convicting innocent people to death, TIconBLU convicts its own game to be nothing more than a black spot in the history of adventure games. A disastrous second part of an interesting opening chapter.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/nicolas-eymerich-the-inquisitor-book-ii-the-village-pc-review","March 14, 2015","false","15.7"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","8","24","3","0"
