I can't get enough of it\n\nControlls, super smooth. Feels like I'm playing a next gen version of CSGO.\n\nCons:\n\nThey have my family hostage","September 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 154 of 251 people (61%) found this review helpful 245 people found this review funny","61","154","251","245","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/400790/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Two months ago I loaded up The Juicer and played for a good thirty minutes or so. I had some mindless fun shooting fruit people and giggling at the cutscenes. Upon reflection it wasn't a very deep or interesting game, but it was functional and nothing about it was bad, per se. Since that day two months ago, I have seen The Juicer sitting ready in my library, and have been completely unwilling to launch it even once more.\n\nYou play a dopey farmer who I guess gets his pesticides from Umbrella or SinTek or something because it turns all of his crops into rampaging monsters. Each chapter is a series of shooting galleries where you blast your misguided produce to earn coins, power-ups, and juice (hence the title). Each stage ends when you fill up your juice vial, which if I remember correctly is used (in the storyline, not the actual game) to research a way to turn everything back to normal.\n\nThe cutscenes, just like your farmer and his creepy crops, are adorably dopey. Unfortunately, each chapter has you fighting only one kind of crop for the duration, such as pears or corn. There are a few variations of each enemy, but generally just bigger ones and shielded ones. You can also shoot buses and hot air balloons to stop reinforcements and earn bonuses. There's an upgrade system, but you only have four things to upgrade and obviously your gun's power is going to come first and foremost. In my experience, as long as you keep your gun fully upgraded you don't need to upgrade your fences or grenade stash or even worry about the special weapons like machine guns and shotguns.\n\nI almost feel bad about downvoting such a simple, earnest game, but there's just no reason to recommend it. The gameplay is just hammering on your mouse button as fruit monsters from a Win95 screensaver charge you. There's no weight to the weapons or impacts, no purpose to the upgrade system... nothing really good about any of it. I can't say there's anything bad about it either, but if there's no reason to play it over anything else, why bother?","January 8","false","0.5"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","24","33","2","1"

Sure, that may sound over-the-top or superfluous in praise, but it's TRUE. The game itself is fun, the controls are surprisingly accurate, the difficulty is appropriate to which one you select...but it's more than just that. Bad day? Shoot some veggies. Great day? Celebrate by shooting some veggies. Bored? Shoot some veggies. Each level is different enough to keep you interested. BEST OF ALL...is the developers. Yes, for just a Dollar, I have found through personal experience that this game's developers give service above-and-beyond, and better than ANY developers whose game's prices cost you your first-born and ignore or take personally any complaint you have. I had troubles, at first, getting the game to work, and these developers took personal interest EVERY DAY until they helped solve my issue, and were polite, and shared in both my worry AND my joy once the issue was fixed...and ALL THIS happiness, fun and personal joy for one dollar. I cannot think of ANY other time IN MY LIFE I had this much value for such a reasonable price. So yes, I recommend this game on several levels, and offer the highest praise possible for value inestably higher than the price offered. By all means, GET THIS GAME!! Enjoy life as a result! :)","October 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","5"

Store has weapon, fence (shield), grenade upgrades bought from the money you earn clearing the levels.\n\nControls are simple; left mouse button to shoot, right to throw grenades, and middle button to switch to different gun types, or can use keyboard counterparts. Personally I use mouse buttons to shoot and throw grenades and space bar to switch weapons.\n\nSo really, the controls are kept clean and simple. Lots of things to shoot at.

There's always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, one more butterfly to catch. It's a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional space packed with content that consistently surprises. The changes made since Juice are many, and result in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Juice series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing The Juicer is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.","February 14","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

There are better flash games for free out there on the internet.\n\nThis is a mindless shooter, and that's it. You spend your time trying to blow up the left button of your mouse.\nThe story is forgettable, same goes for the weapon upgrades and the "enemies".\nThere are far better zombie/thing shooters on steam (Nation Red the first one that comes to my mind).\n\n\nThere are, though, 2 PROs:\n- You shoot veggies, and you know how much you hate veggies, don't you?\n- Corn riding scooters is charging your fence to destroy you...
