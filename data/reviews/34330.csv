"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/34330/","TakedaYabu","大名 Tanegashima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/","187 products in account","I have been playing many different strategy games being most of them from the Total War series, and I must say that Shogun II is so far, the most complete strategy game available in the gaming industry.\n\nLet's begin by talking about the positive aspects of the game, which are many...\nShogun II is a historically accurate game presenting a wide, never-ending content during Japan's biggest civil war known as the Sengoku Jidai Era. You will be able to play with many important factions that played major roles into shaping Japanese history along with their rulers which are until today famous and highly respected in all of Japanese society.\n\nIn Shogun II, having a good solid army wont be enough for you to achieve success, to hire agents such as the Ninja, to have a respectful diplomatic relationship among other clans, to have a good technological progress over other factions and to control trade routes with other Asian nations will be all equally important in order to achieve your goals.\n\n\nThe game might look slightly complex, but it's easy to learn compared to other previous Total War games\n\nIf you’re new to the series, the overload of information can be quite unnerving, and perplexing. But dig deeper, and you’ll start to appreciate the game, and its small details and intricacies. For a strategy game, this is near flawless, and definitely the best of the Total War series.\n\nThere's no need for mods, the game is well-balanced and extremely polished in all of its aspects\n\nIt's true! After long hours of playing this game, you will realize that there is nothing on this game that might require mods either to fix something, or to add any content that is lacking of.\n\nFrom a strategy perspective, it is a perfect game\n\nIt has gunpowder units, artillery and even bomb throwers, but just enough to add a new element to the game without taking away its melee battle core. Despite the deadliness of these units, they must be placed in strategical locations in order to be truly effective and to counter the terrain penalties.\n\nThe campaign mechanics, such as the family tree and events you can encounter throughout, really make you connect with your leaders\n\nIndeed, each player will feel very connected to the game in overall making the difficult task of leading and ruling an entire faction militarily, economically and diplomatic, a very pleasant task.\n\nPolished and clean graphics\n\nThe graphics in the units, in the battlefield and even in the campaign map are beautiful and they will make you enchanted with their additional effects depending of the 4 seasons you are in.\n\nThe multiplayer mode\n\nThe multiplayer mode in Shogun II is unique as the rest of the game itself. Players will have a Daimyo, the faction head-ruler, which will also be the general in multiplayer battles that can be fully customizable from his face structure to each individual armor piece and weaponry of himself.\n\nBefore you play your first multiplayer battle, you must select your clan starting point by moving your general on to it, and as you progress and win battles, you will conquer lands which will unlock you more online troops, accessories for your Daimyo and also retainers to boost your army base bonuses.\n\nLoading screen quotes\n\nThe presence of quotes said or wrote by renowned people is well known in Total War games, but in my personal opinion the quotes were so well selected, that will almost give you the feeling that you are improving yourself in the game after reading them.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music in this game is capable of adding even more atmosphere that wraps perfectly with every moment of the game either during battles, in the campaign map, or simply in the game menu.\n\nExtra content\n\nThe DLC's and the two singleplayer / multiplayer expansions available to this game, is seriously a must buy for anyone who enjoys this game, because not only it unlocks more factions and their unique units both for singleplayer and multiplayer, but also because the expansions such as the "Fall of the Samurai" and "The Rise of Samurai" will make you emerge to another dimension of old Japan making you feel that you are playing a different game.\n\nNow, to the negative aspects.\nThe loading time\n\nDespite the clean, polished and detailed graphics, there comes the price of it. A long loading time both before battles and also during the initial loading screen of the game which can be sometimes, quite depressing.\n\nThe multiplayer mode\n\nShogun II blows us away with its unique refreshing multiplayer system, but there is simply too many de-syncs among players and the enormous lag during battles with more than 2 players.\n\nIrrational AI\n\nBattles with the AI will often become easy as you learn the same strategy they use in the three battle types (Naval,Land and Siege).\n\nHard dificulty\n\nInstead of making the AI strategy effectiveness wider and complex, what happens is that the enemy units will have a greatly increased fighting stats making the game unbalanced, instead of harder as it should be.\n\nConclusion.\nI would rate this game 93 out of 100 or 4,9 out of 5,0 stars. It's a masterpiece of game within the strategy genre, a must have for anyone who likes strategy or to be taking the seat of a strategian!","May 17, 2015","true","066.5"," 426 of 446 people (96%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","96","426","446","19","29"

It has great graphics and optimization, spectacular gameplay and balance, and the sound effects immerse you into the game. I could actually write a review on this games music alone. This is one of the best Total Wars in gameplay standards, but the only thing this game lacks is cultural variety from other Total War games, which isn't too much of a problem considering the game is based on only one country. Other than that, I can't think of a way they could improve this game anymore. It is simply a masterpiece, and one of my favorites.","November 26, 2013","true","656.2"," 446 of 471 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","446","471","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rozzok/recommended/34330/","Rozzok","Rozzok The King of Memes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rozzok/","118 products in account","I was being attacked by angry avon ladies at my door so this review is updated to contain more information regarding the game, if you were thinking about buying it you should start here. TL:DR At The Bottom with some funny fake quotes.\n\n\nField        Rating        Review                Graphics        9.5        The graphics are near perfect for a styled game like this, samurai swinging swords and spears around in sengoku jidai. You won't find anything like this anywheres else looking as good as it is. However you will need a modern pc in order to run it at maximum graphics, which is well worth it                Gameplay        8        Gameplay is great,  The morale [en.wikipedia.org] works as intended, if your units drop to a certain amount of men left they start getting nervous and then waver. Causing them to retreat to your set up regroup point or shatter, being unable to be clicked on and retreat offscreen for the remainder of the battle.  Cavalry [en.wikipedia.org]  do what they're supposed to do, they are used for flanking, charging men without spears and helping chase down routed enemies.  Ashigaru [en.wikipedia.org] are Peasants armed with weapons. Very low morale but comes with huge unit sizes with the ability to combat cavalry but do bad in normal melee against better melee units.  Samurai [en.wikipedia.org] are Samurai, better than ashigaru, but more expensive. The normal type of samurai which is  Katana [en.wikipedia.org] And  Yari [en.wikipedia.org] And No-Dachi which is a big katana are what we are going to cover here. Katana Samurai are easily outmatched by cavalry. Yari Samurai are easily outmatched by Katanas, The balance is great. No-dachi is basically katana samurai but if you charge with them they literally take twice the amount of units they are and bring them down. Like chuck norris as their spirit animal they go in and clean up everything. With a banzai ability stopping them from routing. The only problem is Multiplayer veteran balance which I won't cover in this review, however do not let this deter you from buying the game. The music is EXTREMELY well made. we're talking about music on par with Animes soundtracks such as  SAO [en.wikipedia.org] ,Your lie in april [en.wikipedia.org] and  BoT [en.wikipedia.org] while still on par with some classical pieces I feel. You should honestly pay for the soundtrack.                Multiplayer and Co-op        10        Multiplayer balance is mostly fine, it's rock paper scissors dressed up with samurai units and some variety such as siege weapons, now you're probably wandering " This game game out 4 years ago, I bet the community is dead " It's not, if you want to buy this for multiplayer then I recommend it. Averaging at about 5,000 people playing every day (EST) and maybe more on the weekends, this game is far from being dead. and you buying it will help the game grow back to it's former glory of 25,000 people. Now explaining rock paper scissors in shogun 2, Spear beats cavalry, cavalry beats swords, swords beat spear. bow beat everything at range but everything beats bow in melee.\n\n\nthis game has a form of RNG, Think payday 2 but without masks and colors you're getting armor pieces and retainers. Retainers boosts your armies stats, gives you helpful stats for your general and does other useful stuff. Some retainers are LEGENDARY and only have a 1/1000th Drop Chance, while giving you extremely powerful abilities. Example here is Legendary Retainer : Tengagoken Katana, gives your entire general unit +10 Melee attack. If you complete armor sets you also get retainers ONLY available if you completed that armor set, you can also wear the armor on your generals avatar and it can be seen in battle. I'm not covering naval because I don't play naval.\n\nCo-op campaign is another means of multiplayer under the multiplayer button. It's campaign but with two people and you can go head to head or play it together. More details for the same things under campaign.\nCampaign        9        Campaign is brilliantly done. so many ways you can replay it, and  many difficulty settings for the die-hard. It includes most of the notable clans during the sengoku jidai era, while most smaller clans get wiped out in the first 25 or so turns. theres trade routes to boost your income you get to by ships while also giving you that item you're trading so it may not be in japan being highly valuable. You have a general system where they get traits overtime and rank up for a special skill tree, they also get retainers aswell. There is a research tree like many Total war games where you research what you want to learn with it branching down from two choices " Bushido " and " Chi ". Bushido is ment for military means and getting better units, chi is ment for civil/diplomatic means while also giving you access to some units or agents. Agents are useful for many things such as apprehending ninja agents or infiltrating a castle and setting it ablaze with assassins.                 Replayability        10        I can easily see people getting 3,000+ Hours on this game, theres nothing to NOT do. You can do campaign custom battles reinactments with friends conquer japan on multiplayer do Co-Op campaign, the possibilities are endless. Of the time i've had this the only reason I don't have over 3,000+ hours is because I have a  Youtube channel  to worry about, Piano/Music Theory, and other games.                 Overall        9.5        No game can be perfect, except this one. There are such tiny issues i've found its the only reason it's getting a 9.5. Other than that it would be a MASTERPIECE\nDo you buy it? Yes.\n\nTL:DR do I buy it? Yes\n\nI'm not being payed to make this review.\n\n\nAngry Avon ladies visiting my house :  And who are you? You just got about 450 likes that doesn't say anything haha. Anyway, you were just saying everything is fine, everything is beautiful, everything is balanced, gameplay is funny, long term motivation blabla, you never wrote anything in detail. Why should someone buy or play that game after such a superficial review?:D\n\nRozzok : you're right completely unacceptable, review is now twice as long and filled with more detail, while i'm at the door, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior jesus christ?\n\n" Peasant : but general, how can they see with such tiny eyes? Fots General : ah but you see you don't understand, japanese squint,  have many vision, can shoot great distance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/recommended/34330/","LeonDeclis","Leon Declis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/","240 products in account","I am the Daimyo of the Shimiza... I think.\n\nI'm not sure, we're just the ones who wear green and we're less likely to betray each other, which is good enough because we are extremely similar to everyone else on Nippon, the great land of Japan. We fight the same, eat the same, use the same weapons, if we all didn't agree to strict colour codes, it would be chaos.\n\nAfter hundreds of years, we have decided it is time to have a civil war. We're not too sure why, but it seems right. Some bloke turned up from Denmark, handed us Japan's first gun, and that was it; time to declare war on each other and decide who will be Emperor... No, not that, we're just going to fight for the honour of being the guy who fights for the Emperor. Okay then. Thankfully, everyone got the message and we all decided it was a grand old idea.\n\nSo I began by sending out my son and two of his best mates with 400 blokes to the nearest town, where we had an honourable of 500 vs 45 men. Naturally, we won and peacefully looted the place, and paid the locals to pick up a spear and help us do it again.\n\nOur neighbours were honourable men who promptly got eaten by some nobody clan nearby who in half a year managed to have seven provinces; I had two. In the winter of Japan, we fought a great battle; a whole 700 people took part, a great size of blood and glory. I gave a speech in Japanese; naturally I can't speak a damn word, but rather than learn the language, life conviently provided subtitles so I wouldn't have to try and learn it. As we fought, I had an advisor shout at me in stereotypical Jinglish about the honour of my family and soldiers. We lined up, we ran at each other, and I sneezed. As I looked up, the enemy had broken and run and my advisor was now screaming at me about the honour of our win. Alright then.\n\nI asked if we could develop our technology, to allow us an advantage. My advisor told me I could either research how to stab better, or I could research some poetry and make everyone feel happier about me ruling them.\n\nWe went with the stabbing route. They'd give some flowery prose about honour and balance, but it was just how to better stab people. My population was unhappy? Stab them. Clan unhappy? Stab them. Enemy unhappy? Stab them. We went for... Total War!\n\nNow, war is waged not just on the battlefield, but also by cloak and dagger. We began to hire people with a certain set of skills, skills that make life difficult for our enemies. First was the ninja; after we decided to build an entire building just for him, he agreed to work for us. He began to open gates for us, but then we realised we can just climb up the hill of dirt that is our castles. Then we asked him to sabotage buildings, but then we realised we would have to repair it later. Then we asked him to kill the other leaders; after only 10 years of constantly getting caught and showing us the comics later of how he did it every single time he failed (and he only ever did the same thing, again and again), he began to kill with semi-regularity. The new recruits? We forced them to stay on the gate of each town and look for suspicious people.\n\nThen we hired the metsuke, or the police guy. After we had to build him a whole building for himself as well (not wanting to be second best to the guy in pyjamas), he then leaves the town (and not needing the building anyway) and spends him time sending monks to jail, and telling people to quiet down when they complain about the fires and stabbings. All in all, not a bad investment.\n\nLastly, we built a Temple and the monks came; they had the special power of making the enemy feel a little bit bad about themselves. Ultimately, we just had them sit in towns were foreigners came. You see, if you wanted the guns, you had to get the Christianity as well (Americans, amirite?), so we had the monk walk behind the Christians and refute everything they said, seemed to do well enough. We remained sufficiently Buddist, and in the spirit of Buddism, we continued our war.\n\nDuring the war, we began to trade with other countries. Now, we had an ally trading with China; they said no. "But we're friends?" Yes, they replied, but if you want us to share trading with one of the biggest countries in the world, you'll have to declare war with us. "But you only have one trade ship, how can you possibly be trading with all of China? Why don't you have Beijing, and we have Shanghai?" HOJI DOESN'T SHARE TRADE! So we went to war for some silk.\n\nAfter about 30 years of conquering, making vassals, having those vassal betray us, re-conquering vassals and burning them to the ground after learning our lesson, we eventually conquered Japan. Just in time for the Americans to conquer us later in the expansion.","September 9, 2015","true","33.5"," 305 of 326 people (94%) found this review helpful 342 people found this review funny","94","305","326","342","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/34330/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE:I was never able to play the original Shogun: Total War since it was before my gaming days, therefore, I will not compare it with Shogun 2. I'm  primarily a singleplayer gamer so I will focus on the single player aspects only.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Shogun 2: Total War is the 7th installment in the Total War franchise which takes the entire series back to the era that started it all. It retains the trademark featured gameplay of mixed turn based campaign and real time strategy battle map, along with a completely revamped and redesigned game mechanic on the campaign map.\n\nShogun 2 revisits Feudal Japan, more specifically, the Sengoku Jidai era which was marked with social turmoil, political intrigue and an almost perpetual state of war among the different samurai clans. Take control of one of these clans and pave your way towards the capital city of Kyoto and gain your rightful seat as Shogun, military ruler of all Japan.\n\nPROS:+ Graphically Unrivaled in scale: -The environments, the level and map designs, art assets, unit animation, kaiga (gadō) Japanese artworks and the splendid seasonal weather effects brings feudal Japan to life once more. Although there are other games that also sport amazing graphical fidelity, I have yet to see any game to deliver it on the scale that was done in Shogun 2.\n\n+ Sound and Music: -Great Japanese inspired music themes, fully localized voices for all units (meaning they all speak Nihon-go except the advisers), and believable sound effects will trully be a treat to anyone's ears.\n\n+ Revamped Game mechanics: -Shogun 2 vastly improves on the mechanics that were laid down by Empire: Total War. New family management system, diplomacy, religion, unit types, General's Skill Trees and the Honor meter are just some of the things that make this game an improvement from Empire: Total War. Also, expect a lot of dead people from both sides after each battle due to the brutality of combat that is nicely recreated in this game.\n\n+ High Replayability value: -Different clans feature different specializations which will force the players to adapt to a new gameplay style to fit the clan's strengths. This game also adapts an "Avatar Conquest" feature which provides a good and fun co-op experience.\n\n+ Mods: -A lot of mods from a very active and dedicated community will extend your play time, experience and enjoyment.\n\nCONS:- Artificial Intelligence: -Given that this game's AI is vastly superior than that of Empire: Total War's AI, it still falls short from what I expected. One particular instance that I found to be annoying is the fact that the game outright spawns WHOLE STACKS of free military units for the AI to increase difficulty rather than improving upon the strategy or tactic that it should be utilizing. Naval battles are a bit clunky, specially when trying to board another ship.\n\n- Bugs and Crashes: -I can almost guarantee that you will experience some sort of bug or crash during your game. Saving occasionally is highly advisable. Conveniently though, Ctrl+S works as a quick save feature. No Anti-aliasing was placed on the game if the system is running on DirectX10 (disregard if already patched). FPS may also drop during some of the more cluttered or hectic battles that you will definitely encounter.\n\n- DLC: -There are good DLCs and there are BAD DLCs, unfortunately, this game has the latter. Factions and certain Unit Types that could have easily been placed as free DLC or in-game content were locked behind a pay-wall. One of the greatest sins for me is the "Blood Pack DLC" which adds a minor feature where blood and gore are added to the game. The Blood Pack DLC should have been a patch rather than be sold for $2 (or your regional equivalent).\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! My personal favorite of the series and what I believe to be the best of the franchise so far. It retains the formula that made the Total War games great, and at the same time, mixes it up just enough to give a fresh new experience.\n\nTotal War fans would find it fun with its vanilla version, but more can be had with the different mods available a the Steam Workshop.\n\nIf you're a strategy fan but not particularly fond of the Japanese Feudal era, then this game might not be the game you're looking for.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Shogun envelopes you into 16th century Japan and challenges you to control some of  the strongest families during the Sengoku jidai or age of war. The challenge that is posed against you is to overthrow the shogunate who has betrayed your family , therefore striking you to pursue unifying and controling Japan. With the highly acclaimed single player which contains the Civilisation style turn based gameplay to the real time strategy from the likes of Command & Conquer and competetive multiplayer, you will never be stuck with nothing to do.\n\nThe multiplayer incorporates a unique personal avatar system that was introduced in Napoleon total war and has been reworked, adapted and enhanced within the newest total war title. The user has an avatar which can be created and edited from the start of the multiplayer experience. Throughout the multiplayer battles and through gaining single player acheivements new items for your general can be unlocked to make your leader dominate the battlefield with his new shiny greaves . Upon winning matches you start to conquer the area's of Japan, allowing for seperate unlocks to units and retainers (buff cards) which gives the multiplayer some replayability and continuinity.\n\n8/10 -\n*Great strategy with beatiful visuals and great competetive Avatar multiplayer*\n*Lacks greater unit variety in the single player*\n*AI has improved massivly since napoleon total war however still somewhat lackluster*\n*Wonderful mix of real-time and turn-based strategy really makes this game a winner*","November 26, 2013","true","279.0"," 101 of 112 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","101","112","0","2"

They ****ing butcher everyone else.\n- The voice acting is great. There's a lot of passion in it to help deepen the immersion. (THIS IS A SHAMEFUR DISPRAY!)\n- Being able to recruit new generals from the rank-and-file if they lead an army to victory in the absence of an actual general is cool.\n- Gunpowder units are well-balanced in the base game. They require excellent tactical manouverings to actually do well, but if you get them into a good position, and prevent them from being engaged in melee, and stop them from hitting your own troops too much, then they will rek all shiz.\n- I like the tech trees, they're real frickin' nito. And the encylopedia has some nice little history tidbits for each unit.\n\nCons:\n- THOSE ****ING LOADING TIMES, SRS\n- Rise of the Samurai doesn't really do anything for me, I find it dull compared to the base game and Fall of the Samurai.\n- It's honestly easier to play exactly the same for every faction; lots of yari ashigaru to pin your enemy in place whilst bow ashigaru (or bow samurai later in the game) do all the killing.\n- There is no unit variety; even the factions unique units are just the same as everyone else for the most part but with higher stats (there are a few exceptions), and the rest of the armies are exactly the same but for their colour scheme.\n- Defending a castle is laughably easy, which rather goes against the history that the feudal Japanese preferred to sally out and fight their foe on the battlefield.\n- Attacking a castle is extremely hard, until you get the long-range bow troops like warrior monks or daikyu samurai. Then it becomes easy.\n- Actually using your generals in combat is always a last resort; since most of all armies have either yari or naginata, your general will get slaughtered if he gets into combat for the most part. You can dismount them of course, but that weakens them anyway to a degree. Again, kind of clashes with the reputation of the lords rarely if ever shying away from getting into the thick of things.\n- Gunpowder units are borderline haxx in castle defence. Unless the Date are attacking, dem Bulletproof Samurai are pretty coo'.\n- The food surplus system isn't great. Kind of annoying at times. FotS removes that though.\n\nIt's a great game though, despite all the flaws I list; I personally am just better at picking out the bad bits I feel. I've invested a huge amount of time into playing this game; it's a lot of fun and you should definitely get it over Rome II or Attila.","September 26, 2015","true","894.8"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","77","82","6","1"

Its really captivating and its one of those games which can tie you to your chair for hours and hours, just like Anno 1503. I'm not bad at strategy games but I think that even for strategy newbies this game will be easily understandable and enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n\n-The setting. Feudal Japan is cool, Samurais are cool, Ninjas are cool, being Shogun is cool.\n-The graphics. Ok, the map is not the eyecatcher here but the battles are. The details are amazing and you can follow each samurai until his death.\n-Intuitive control and UI. Its impressive how easy to understand this game is. The principles and priorities are clear, you don't have to search for anything and the interfaces for diplomacy, trading and all that stuff are well done.\n-Sound in general. Wether its the effects, the music or voices (the japanese accent sounds great), everything feels right.\n-The campaign. Its pretty long and its full of surprises, you can always do something in a different way than you did before.\n-The characters. I'm talking about the generals, daimyos, ninjas, metsukes and all these people. I got pretty attached to them and it was exciting to see how they grew with the time (plus the skilltrees are awesome).\n\nCons:\n\n-After you've finished the big campaign, there ain't much to do, you can go for the DLC's like Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai, but if you want to play the campaign again I noticed that you don't get any more clans that you can play, like in Medieval 2 for instance.\n-Sometimes you have to repeat battles (if you mustn't lose them) and it can get pretty frustrating after the 17th try.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI highly recommend this game and if you enjoy feudal japan and strategy games, get this game.

The game is set in mainland Japan in the 16th century in the aftermath of the Ōnin War during the Ashikaga Shogunate. You play as one of the Japanese clan and aim to become the new Shogun.\n\nTotal War: SHOGUN 2 retain much of gameplay from the previous Total War, with some of it improved or changed to suit the Japanese culture. The game feature less units variety since all of them are Japanese, but each faction has their own bonus and unique traits, and each general and character now has specialization which can be unlocked as they gain experience from battles. Generals can also be appointed to some positions thereby increasing their loyalty to the faction.\n\nGraphics in Total War: SHOGUN 2 are improved and there is a DLC that enables blood and gore effects. Units animation are better improved than in Empire: Total War or Napoleon: Total War and will animate better when garrisoning in castle or fort walls. Water shader has also been improved. With all these graphics, Total War: SHOGUN 2 yet has far better performance than the previous game, it's so polished.\n\nMultiplayer in Total War: SHOGUN 2 takes different approach from the previous game. Multiplayer campaign also make a return here. Multiplayer battles now will be played through avatar conquest mode. It's a fine addition in multiplayer mode. Total War: SHOGUN 2 multiplayer battles now also protected by VAC from Valve.\n\nTotal War: SHOGUN 2 is great sequel of Total War series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CVGAnton/recommended/34330/","CVGAnton","[CVG]Anton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CVGAnton/","277 products in account","Released on Steam in March 2011, Shogun 2 was a long awaited game for by fans who enjoyed the first game and fans were not let down with this installment in the series. I had pre-ordered this game and paid full price, I was only upset that a few short months later is dropped to half price. Otherwise the game is very addicting to play.\n\nThe game story takes place during 1467 to 1477 where all the nations in Japan came to war, a war that involved the Ashikaga shogunate and the territorial lords. The result of this massive power struggle three individuals would emerge who would unite Japan under one rule. You play one of the warlords who is to dominate the other clans and rule the whole of Japan.\n\nThose who are familiar with the Total War series will know what to expect in this game, but for those who are looking for a medieval Japanese strategy game, like me, will probably find this game overwhelming at first.\n\nI found this game difficult to get into from the start and learn what to do. The tutorials really help with the controls and how to do things in Shogun 2. You need to build, manage your clan, scout and war. When it comes to fighting another army you can let the game auto resolve it or you can go into battle mode.\n\nWhen you are in battle mode fighting another army, you will find yourself in a whole new mode, commanding your forces and setting up how they will advance and what formation they will be in. I really like this mode because its interesting to see how your battle is actually going and how you will react to the fight. The game holds allot more, sea battles using ships, storming castles and ninjas.\n\nThere are cut scenes during play, such as when you send a trained ninja out to assassinate an enemy force. You will get to see a successful attempt or one where the ninja fails.\n\nThe tutorial at the start to help you learn to play is very helpful and the Japanese geisha girl voice is a nice touch to help you learn what to do.\n\nThe multiplayer portion of the game requires you to join a Total War Shogun 2 group and then you get to view a map of Japan and place your avatar on. Beyond this I haven't figured out how it plays out as there isn't any option to go to a ground to ground battle or auto resolve it. I am sure its something simple to do but I haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nOverall the game is hard to understand how to play and takes some time to learn. The multiplayer side I found very hard to understand and troublesome to figure out. I do enjoy playing it but its one I have been able to put down and wait a long time to get back into. I think I will have to give this another try sometime soon.\n\nI haven't gotten to the point of dominating all of Japan or anything but I do like the whole game because you get to fight during a most interesting time in Japans history and that period is a time of Total War!\n\nPro's\nSamurai's an Ninjas\nVery detailed and historically accurate\nPersonal control over battles or automatically resolve\nMusic\nDLC adds more clan's to play as\nCon's\nHard to comprehend\nCut scenes are repeated\nMultiplay isn't as easy to understand\nVery large download\n\n\nCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz-x1_GYQIw","October 9, 2014","true","12.0"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","43","51","0","2"

The art style, the music, Samurai skewering each other with Yari and Katana, the beautiful campaign and battle maps - everything is just polished to perfection. They captured the feel of 16th century Japan with the art style and music so perfectly that you get totally immersed in the game. I'm not even a fan of Japanese history but this game does such a perfect job of capturing the feel of it that I simply love it. The expansions (especially Fall of the Samurai) are both excellent. In fact I would consider Fall of the Samurai to be one of the best expansions ever created for any game.\n\nIf you only ever buy one Total War game then let it be this one. Don't even waste your time with Rome 2 or Attila, just get Shogun 2.

Great Avatar conquest system in multiplayer. Nothing similar created in other TW games. All those faction systems are not even a bit as deep as  Avatar conquest in Shogun 2. Veterans, skills creation of your personal army. Nothing can compare with this. Yes it is really rough to new players. But if you have enough patience eventually you will enjoy Avatar conquest like nothing else before. The main negative feature of multiplayer of Shogun 2 in my humble opinion is that CA don't give a damn about this game any more and so they don't put any effort to it to make it better, they don't patch the game. Nothing. As for single player I find it really good as well. As far as I remember it is the first game where food system was implemened. So you get not just money but also food as the resource you always need to check and watch thoroughly. Also I really like coalition system as you grow strong and everyone else are turning against you even your vassals and allies. This feature makes you plan your strategy really caferully trying not to overextend too much. And that's great because for example in Rome 2 you just pierce through your enemies like a knife through butter and no one can stop you in the late game at all, so in the mid game you simply lose interest to game process because of no challenge what so ever. Overall I recomend this game to all RTS fans, it's totally worth its money.","May 10, 2015","true","425.5"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","25","26","2","0"

Looking for a TL;DR?\n\nTL;DR Shogun 2 is the best representation of the Total War style game since the original release of Rome 1. The Expansion DLC's help to add additional features on top of an already winning formula.\n\n\n---The Good--\n-Map Navigation and Army Stacking has yet to be overhauled like it was with Rome 2. The classic form of 20 unit cards created from a city can be moved about the map without the need for a General.\n\n-As bad as the AI can get in total war games, Shogun 2 manages to maintain a certain level of not headlong rushing into your spears and archer lines. However this is often the case when playing on lower difficulties. We are not talking about high capacitive thinking AI opponents but at least they dont charge into a meat grinder as consistently as previous entries.\n\n-Shogun 2 released on the cusp of CA attempting to nickle and dime players out of playable factions and unit packs. That being said the core game does not falter under the weight (or lack there of) of these numerous fluff DLC packs. Rest safely in the knowledge that the vanilla game is just as grand as the fluffed out version.\n\n-Battle UI is clean and unintrusive (I am looking at you Rome 2). Abilities and unit flags are easy to read and are distinguishable at a glance.\n\n-Graphics Presentation; what can I say besides how amazing this game looks years after its initial launch. It is unfortunate that one of the best visual moments is locked behind a dlc purchase. This moment being a close zoom up to your samurai cutting limbs off his adversary among a field of flowers with blood spraying forth, in stark contrast to the beauty of the landscape. Cough up 1.59 for the Bloodpack, it's worth it.\n\n-If you are a Mod person I shouldn't have to tell you Shogun 2 fully supports mods. Go forth and mod to your hearts content.\n\n\n--The Bad--\n-AI charging into meat grinders. When it happens boy does it happen in spectacular fashion. Balls of Japanese soldiers ordered to their demise by crashing like a wave upon fixed spear or matchlock units behind baracades. When it happens make sure the blood is turned on.\n\n-Most of the issues stem from the AI functionality, auto resolve with Sea Battles is entirely one sided in favor of the AI even when the player holds the advantage. Be aware of attempting piracy through vicarious means.\n\n-Realm Divide. Diplomacy in Shogun 2 works well enough that the player can create long established trade routes and alliances with AI controlled factions throughout the majority of a playthrough. However; there is a functional game design choice that follows history a little too closely resulting in unfun gameplay past a certain point. If a player is unaware of what a "Realm Divide" is, it is entirely possible to lose everything within a few turns of the event triggering. Doubly so if players deside to invest in early game AI diplomacy and treaties. It is a balancing issue and design choice that requires save scumming to prevent the worst outcome (especially if going into the late game blind) creating needless frustration. For those unaware; Realm Divide is an event that happens when your clan is influential enough that the current Shogunate desides you are a threat to his rule. A cool idea if implemented properly. The incarnation of Realm Divide we got was the entire country turning on the player on a single turn. The AI forceably burns all of your bridges and can immediately attack any of your forign armies within any province. Previous allies always turn on you, there is no way to even buy their loyalty. In terms of a history vs gameplay decsicion I would have liked to see a threshold for diplomatic allies to stay as an ally if their loyalty were high enough. Alas this is not the case and the player always loses potentially useful allies.\n\n--The Meh--\n-DLC; it's is a sore spot for many people. Understandably so as the number of skin packs, unit packs, Blood effect packs, faction packs, ect. (I could go on and on) is just staggering. Nearly all of the DLC for Shogun 2 is fluff and not necessary, outside the actual expansions, Rise and Fall of the Samurai, the dlc can be ignored entirely.","May 2","true","102.8"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","0"

The game has two major mechanics I will get briefly into here. After you have chosen your clan you will see a map of Japan, and where you have your units and town. This map isn't the entire game by far, but here you have an overview of how you run your lands by building necessary building for your war effort, diplomacy and gathering resources and researching technology. You will also have a family tree where members can grow up to be leaders or the women can be wed to form alliances or make them stronger. Basically you govern everything from this map.\n\nThe major strength of this game is the battles however. When you enter a battle you will enter the zone from the map you are either attacking or defending, and is where the game gets more complex for strategy fanatics. If you have 80 men attacking you will see 80 detailed men on your side in formations you can change, and the same goes for 1200 men which make battles huge and impressive as you see them battle it out. The various formations and approach you can make is extremely fun, and even the terrain and weather has an affect of how everything will play out. This also means you can win despite being severely outnumbered if you somehow manage to use the terrain to your own advantage. Generals also play a huge role here as they give better morale and can add buffs to units as well.\n\nThere are also many units in the game, and this is not counting the DLC's out there either.\n\nI found this game to be impressive and extremely fun too and challenging. I certainly enjoyed this game and if you like any form of strategy game you should consider this, especially if you like samurai, ninja or is just fascinated by feudal Japan!","September 25, 2014","true","200.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

You will find yourself in scenic Japan, conquering regions in Total War style as the blossoms flutter over your battleline. You will have plenty of choices and options for your empire and they are all meaningful in some way. You can embrace the new western technology and get yourself some guns, take on christianity or stick to the old ways, eventually becoming the ruler of Japan.\n\nAll of this comes with you being able to manage your entire clan - Build your holdings, expand them, train units and send your military to where they're needed and command the battles yourself. Naval battles of ancient Japan(Floating castles and archers) are an interesting thing, with entirely new tactics to learn - Which you can do yourself. Just as battles on land are commanded by you personally if you wish. You can lead your clan from humble beginnings to glory, personally commanding every battle on the way there. Watch those forts though - They may look simple, but they are not to be underestimated. Keep in mind that this is still an arcade-y game, as far as history goes. So while it does present a decent historical accuracy it does ignore some things for the sake of gameplay.\n\nThat said, it does have its flaws. It occasionally crashes and there are arbitrary unit limits preventing you from using more than a certain amount of specific units , along with an AI that is not too amazing(Not awful either though) are some of the lesser points of the game. The AI is very keen on plundering your lands, which ends up being more of a pain in the...Rear end than entertaining as you have to repair -yet another- farm and hunt down another four units of spearmen that ran past your defence and just keeps running away from you. It does mean that you can't really sit in your fort all the time and let the enemy come to you, but in the end you don't really gain anything aside from a headache from hunting down all the little armies running through your land. Luckily there are river crossings and mountains you can stand by to block most of the enemy from getting through\n\nOut of all the Total War games to get, Shogun 2 and Rome (The first, not Rome 2) are the ones you should consider first. Shogun 2 provides you with excellent quality and a great experience, and is well worth spending your time and money on\n","June 3, 2015","true","144.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Once you've played all total war over and over, and then all total war with mods (darthmod comes to mind for me), you get to know what's good and bad for each of them. Shogun 2 is first place for me with Medieval 2/Rome 2 in close second place. I'm too lazy to write a detailed cons and pros for each etc. but for Shogun 2 here's some pros:\n-Good campaign and battle AI\n-Very replayable, each game different factions will stand out\n-Diplomacy is important as there's many clans out there and the AI is decent at it\nSome cons still:\n-Economy is not as clear or detailed and there aren't as many things to build as a Medieval 2\n-Units are not as varied as a Medieval 2 or Rome 2\n\nStill, Shogun 2 is a solid consistent game for me which holds the podium as to which Total War game is the best. You can't go wrong buying this game.\n\nPS: Bear in mind that I've gradually converted to be a darthmod lover, that I've never played Attila yet AND that at the time of this review, the amazing looking Total War: Warhammer has not yet been out, peace!","November 11, 2015","true","253.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Some may argue this game is the best of the entire series. Honestly, I can't agree more.\nGraphically, this game looks amazing with the highest setting. Though three years old already, this game presents a kaiga style graphical experience that few newly published game can compare with. The water reflection looks just fantastic, soldiers realistic and fog artistic. Different modifications even make the graphics better.\nIn terms of gameplay, it has too parts. In macro, just like other Total War games, Shogun 2 relies on a turn-based strategy system. In each turn, as the learder of your clan, you can conduct treaties with your friends and foes, recruit different kinds of soldiers, manage han or clan wide tax, etc. Battles are fought at a real-time basis in which you need to be smart enought to use the right tactics and be fast enough to micro your units. You always need to combine strategy with tactics in order to win.\nThe history background truely intrigues me. As a Ph. D in History, I can never deny any game that involved with historical reality. All three backgrounds of this game are well selected. They are the watersheds of the history of Japan. Shogun 2 Vanilla takes place during the Sengoku Jidai, the Warring States Period. It is just amazing when you can control Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu yourself! You see them riding, speaking and moving. Perviously too me they were just names in some history books. Fall of the Samurai expansion takes place prior to the Boshin War, the era of Meiji Restoration. Japan was westernized. You can hardly find samurai units in this expansion because they have been outdated. Instead, line infantries, line cavalries, cannons and iron clads dominated the world. You can also work with the Westerner. They have superior units. In some modifications you can even recruit soldiers from Napoloen Total War in this game. Currently I use French Grenadiers and Voltigeurs as my elite units. Rise of the Samurai takes place during the feud between the Tairo and the Minamoto. You can read about it in The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu. Historically, the Minamoto defeated the Tairo, becoming the first Shogunate of Japan. In this game you can change it if you have the ambition and the competence!\nSee, I ramble on and on. Just buy this game already!

Shogun 2 stays true to the grand strategy and battles of its predecessors. The Total War franchise is great. Not only has it created (and is still the leader) a new genre, it also defined the way we play strategy games on a grand scale.\nAt the time Shogun was a mind-blowing experience. I still hear sometimes the music of that game in my head.\nThe sequel, Medieval, was also great, but it felt like a step back.\nRome was a huge leap forward and is still one of the best games out there.\nAnd while Medieval 2 didn't bring much new to the table, it was still a good game, as were Empire and Napoleon. Shogun 2 was certainly a big step forward for the developer Creative Assembly. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435728331 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438234559","July 5, 2015","true","399.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anhvu86/recommended/34330/","anhvu86","Sentient_Fool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anhvu86/","239 products in account","Total War: Shogun 2 remains one of the definitive Total War games to date, upholding the series' longstanding reputation for melding turn-based campaign gameplay with the scope of real-time  tactical battles. Taking a focused setting in Japan, it sacrifices the ambitious scale of previous games for a more fine-tuned setting which to its credit works very well.\n\nIf you are new to Total War, then in layman's terms it's a wargame. You vie for military control of Japan, taking on the role of one of several prominent clans with unique attributes as you fight, negotiate, and conquer territory. Most of the gameplay will be on a geographical map of 16th century Japan's provinces. Here you move armies and manage your provinces. When your army contacts with a foreign one, the game transfers to a 3D battlefield where you then fight using your army's units.\nCheck out some videos to see the map and battlefield and if your inclined the demo on Steam.\n\n\nFor Total War Veterans:\nIt is a grand improvement over Empire and Napoleon's awkward execution. An impressive return to its roots. Shogun 2 is also aesthetically tantalizing, stylistically and graphically impressive.\n\nDespite the A.I. still being prone to occasional lapses in judgement, Shogun 2's A.I. is quite capable of self-preservation and is formidable. In battles it will try to flank, take higher ground and on higher difficulties is merciless in the campaign but not irrational: skilled use of diplomacy will save you.\n\nThere is also the addition of two DLC expansions into the Genpei War (Rise) and Boshin War (Fall). Thus incorporating antiquity and modernization in new campaigns. You have a choice between the old ways of war or the struggle to modernize Japan. The rest of the DLC is passable, mostly superficial unit packs.\n\nMultiplayer has working cooperative campaigns with two players. When it works, it is great fun. The classic lobby is still there, albeit hidden under the new avatar mode (which is more or less a customized progression based match-making system).\n\nNo regrets, still the most polished Total War game as of the present.","January 1, 2015","true","870.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I've got to say that the developers really succeeded in improving things while still keeping the core concept of the previous games intact.\n\nEverything from managing your towns  to controlling armies works and feels great. Even though those systems isn't as advanced as the previous game in the series.\n\nUnlike the other games in the series Shogun Total War 2  is set in 16th-century feudal Japan which i think fits very well. Both the enviorments and units looks amazing and really gives an fair representation of what Japan could have looked like during the time.\n\nFor anyone not familiar with the Total War games they basiclly consists of two diffrent parts.\n\n1. The Campaign Map:\nThis is where you will spend most of your time playing total war. From here you can get an overview of the diffrent clans territory, their respective armies/agents aswell as the diffrent trade routes. This is also where you will be able to manage your settlements, recruit diffrent types off soldiers and make diplomatical proposals with other clans.\n\nYou can also move your armies/agents by simply selecting them and then clicking wherever you want them to go.\nThe amount an army or unit can move every turn depends on what kind of units you're using (cavarly units moves really fast while cannons moves extremly slow).\n\nin terms of balance every single unit/agent plays their own role. The thing that makes this work is that every unit/agent in the game has a counter, basiclly it's kinda like a game off Rock-paper-scissors. Spears wins over cavarly, cavarly wins over ranged units, ranged units wins over spears.\n\nWhenever one off your armies engages in combat you get two choices\n1. Auto resolve the battle (which let's the AI fight the battle for you)\n2. Manually fight the battle (which transfers you to the real time battle mode)\n\n\n2. The Battle Mode:\nThis is where you will be able to controll your units during battles. The battles is always fought in real time and are in massive scale.\n\nTo win an battle you will have to utilize every unit to their full potentional by using diffrent formations, flanking the enemy soldiers and by using your units special abilites. How good your units performs will also depend on their morale, which is based on a number of different things like for example your chosen general and overall odds off winning the battle.\n\n\nConclusion:\nShogun total war 2: is an amazing strategy game that's well balanced and has very well suited design.\n\nLike the other games in the series this might not be everyones cup of tea and i whould recommend it to anyone who enjoy slow strategy games rather than RTS games like StarCraft and Age Of Empires.\n\nI give it a solid 9/10 rating -IGN\n\nAnd finally a quote from the game....\n\n"Our men are running from the battlefield! Shameful display!”\n- Asian advisor guy","April 20","true","42.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Well if any of you are still in that mindset, I've got bad news for you. This game changes ALL of that to a more historically accurate representation of what happened during the Sengoku Jidai, Boshin War and many other areas.\n\nNormally when a game changes my understanding about reality I'm not really keen on reviewing it. I mean it shamed my knowledge and as the consumer I want to be able to have some control over what is right or wrong in a game. HOWEVER, Shogun 2's depiction of this is so good There's no point me trying to argue, I mean hell I can change the course of history what more do I need?\n\nIn general user Freindlyness this game requires some work, Either you need to have practised on another total war game when they updated the engine, (So From Empire total War onwards according to the time this review was written) Or you mastered the turorials right off the bat.\n\nThe mechanics are shockingly good and shockingly bad, If your general dies unlike other total wars when you got a fairly decent morale hit. In Shogun 2 you get a HUGE one. In competitive multiplayer (My favourite Field right now) if you or an ally looses his general. It could be game over right there, however other mechanics like the action chance on the campaign map and the unit abilities on the battlefeild are extremely good. Only once out of the hundreds of times I've used ninjas has one turned into an extremely skilled master killer who kills anything. Hell he killed the shogun as well!\non the battlefield Things like whistling arrows and fire arrows make total sense, if your near the arrows weather right when theyre loosed or where they fly/land, the Devastating morale effect is there. meaning you have to really think before using some of these double edged sword abilities.\n\nGraphics are beautiful, and even the lower graphics still meet Napoleon and Empire total war standards. The fire arrows, Cannons/other siege equipment and blood do do a number on your PC. And you'll need a decent one to get full action unfortunately. nonetheless They are definitely a stratagey gamers Eye candy.\n\nThe historical battles are mediocre at best. Glitches are easy to find and some of the battles are so exploitable you can win them without even trying. They fail to depict Oda Nobunaga, Uesugi Kenshin, Tokugawa Ieyasu and many other important characters from the sengoku jidai (Note I'm not a weeaboo, These are historical figures like any other country's it just happens to be from the land of weeaboos) The historical battles of the Boshin war have a great story to them, But some of them are just so random I don't even have to push foward that much and I can win them.\n\nI'dve liked to add more to this review but to be honest you really are only here for the final verdict. I rate this game 8/10 because it's such a pretty game and if you love the competitive gameplay like me you'll know you don't have to not enjoy the game to play multiplayer, you can just watch in awe as your experienced army marches onwards to victory! As I say though there are some horrible things about the game but they only take 2 off the score because a fair amount of them can easally be avoided. Buy this game with all DLC, your missing out on a lot without it and buy it on sale.","February 5","true","113.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

The campaign is stellar and reeks of creativity. Many features from previous Total War games really lacked in comparison to this game. It literally kept me up for a 36 hour period of non stop campaign fun. Multiplayer is the most hilarious fun I've had in years. The players are fair and challenging, not to mention friendly which is a surprise from most of my RTS experiences over the years. The games mechanics and innovation from previous Total War games are awesome to say the least, the Concept of Bushido, the ability to convert to Christianity, and the whole concept of massive warfare, I loved this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed an RTS or a TBS game. The game play is fun and challenging. The one flaw I'm sure they will correct is the sort of uselessness the Bow Calvary have, otherwise this is simply a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GinjaNinja1997/recommended/34330/","GinjaNinja1997","New Age Republic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GinjaNinja1997/","149 products in account","So, at just under 700 hours I feel like I can finally review this game properly. As of writing this we've had Rome 2 and Attilla, and the new Warhammer is under way too, but until that gets released and we can get a feel of it, Shogun 2 remains the pinacle of Total War so far.\n\nI'll try to split this up for ease of reading:\n\nAnimation - The animations in this game are simply the best we've had so far. From crossed blades to beheadings (Only with DLC I think though) to men drowing on their own blood on the floor, it all looks so real. Admittedly you can see how two people have to awkwardly shuffle into what seem to be "combat lanes" and their  can be clipping due to this, this only takes a second and afterwards the fight is very fluid. Men will cheer when they rout a unit, your general swanks along cockily as he walks towards his foe, infantry lower their spears when they're close enough to charge... Its all done very well. On the campaign man, generals will pull out chairs when they run our of movement, and agents will act of small gestures and do an action when they level up, such as a ninja dropping a smoke bomb. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lack this attention to animation, especially in fights, where combat animations are hard to see or very short. Overall, the animation of Shogun 2 is very in depth, if not without its occasional clumsy moment.\n\nCombat - Using a smaller amount of unit types makes combat a more strategic affair, as unit abilities and stats are easier as you will have access to the same units. The game uses a easy to remember but hard to master formula of sword beats spear, spear beats horse, horse beats bow and bow beats sword. On the surface this is simplistic, but your katana samurai won't last long running uphill into a spearwall. This means that each unit type has its advantages in certain situations, for example bowmen seem to be alot better at attacking a fort than defending, but they can still fit into an overall formula. Gunmen are the awkard exception to this, as at times they seem to beat everything due to their high morale shock, while at others they simply refuse to fire fast enough or fire at all, rendering them useless. Added to the mix of unit types are unit tiers, with peasant (Ashigaru), samurai, monk and hero units being respectively better yet costing alot more. This means that a balance must be struck between rather weak but cheap peasant units and more hardy samurai, though at a later point ashigaru are basically useless due to the player having a large economy. Hero units are rather unbalanced, being able to take on whole units before dying, but they are certainly not invincible and die very easily to ranged units. While there are not as many exciting units as Rome 2 or Attilla, the balance is alot better, though expect to see lots of spear ashigaru in the majority of your battles.\n\nGraphics - I run this on max, and I have to say that it still looks pretty damn nice. On lower settings however, the game looks pretty dreadful, but this then again what did you want from low graphics? Take a look at the community screenshots to decide for yourself, but I think the game looks very nice. Rome 2 suffered from always looking bland IMO, while Shogun is full of life and colour. From a short distance the graphics get abit blurry, but I guess this allows it to run smoother, and by abit blurry I mean that specific detail can't be spotted, but maybe this is just me being picky. Each person in a unit usually looks different, though Rome 2 and Attilla have more face variations. Unit clothes are nice and detailed, with monks, samurai, ashigaru all looking very different and ofcourse all the different subgroups such as bowmen adding more diversity. Naval battles are quite bad at times though, as holes are blown in the ships you can see water just awkwardly clipping through, but again this is me being picky. Overall, very nice.\n\nSound - I don't know much about sound so this will be short, but the music is entertaining and can make you feel engaged alot of the time. Its not something I'd sit and listen to in my free time, but it fits the setting very well. One of the songs was even used by the Japanese in the Sochi olympics, so I guess it must be good! The narrator is amazing in my opinion, especially at the start when he shouts "The reign of the old shogunate... IS OVER!". Battle sounds are well done, and the choking sounds even managed to make me feel sorry for the troops every now and again.\n\nMultiplayer - While not much of a fan of just playing battles, Shogun 2 has a clan system and tournaments, so if competative play is your thing you got it! You can conquer provinces on a special multiplayer map by beating other players, which then unlocks new units for you and advisors that give bonuses. Personally, I feel like this aspect of multiplayer ruins it, as a starting player is going to have a VERY hard time beating anyone expect other new players as they are locked to basic peasant units with no buffs while higher level players have hero units and buffs such as being able to see your deployment, Multiplayer is far from fair, so if you're new a hard climb will be infront of you unless you boost, which kinda sucks for people who want to level up legit or just play for fun. On the positive side, you can do large battles, seiges and naval battles online, and the maps are well made. One AMAZING aspect of multiplayer is the ability to make your own avatar and customise him from lots of armour sets unlocked by doing the steam achievements, winning multiplayer battles and conquering regions. You can choose his banner, colour and abilities, so if you've ever wanted a daimyo called Sam Peggle who wears fabulous pink and can personally tank an entire army, you can go for it! This character customisation is the only thing that makes me play multiplayer, as otherwise I find it too unbalanced, but the prospect of new armour is too good a reward! Rome 2 and Attilla sadly lacked this aspect, which is a great shame. Finally, the entire campaign can be done in coop, and unlike Empire and Napoleon players can battle the AI instead of forcing the other player to be the opponent or auto resolving, which made coop for me. You can spectate your friends battles and they can gift you units mid battle to use to keep it from getting boring. The only problem is that you are stuck between coop or vs, so in coop if your friend on the other side of the map gets declared on you are FORCED to help, but in VS all you need to do is hold their capital for a turn, meaning you can just rush through their entire empire ignoring everything. Rome 2 and Attilla sadly didn't fix this.\n\nCampaign - Final part now, sorry if I've bored you! The map itself I find quite interesting, if not unbalanced in a way; In the south you have islands which can be heavily fortified and used as a powerbase, and also brings in naval warfare. As you get closer to the map it gets more messy, as each province can have 4 bordering provinces to be invaded from unlike the south. East and North are full of huge provinces that take ages to cross and have little need for a navy. It is alot easier to play near Kyushu as you can't be invaded from the west as the map ends, so you can focus on pushing right, while clans like Oda or Hattori will always be surrounded. Diplomacy seem off to me, with Rome 2 making more sense. Allies will randomly break all their pacts with you, neutral clans will attack or factions on the opposite ends of the map will delcare on each other. You have a family tree mechanic which is nice and reminds me of Medieval 2, and this creates a roleplay element as characters get traits and followers. When you are powerful enough all the clans unite and declare on you, which is a fun challenge as usually in TW games at this point you can't be beat by single clans, though its damn hard! The building mechanic isn't as good as Empires, but its clearer and more refined.","June 14, 2015","true","731.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","2"

When you can simply hit the reset button in this game and start a fresh!\n\nShogun 2 is a total war game and if you have been following the total war series you know how consistent they are with breaking the game at first and then developing upon it into something that looks and works great. This game however was a great exception and its release was alot more smooth than the other total wars.\n\nThe diplomacy is a pretty good system in this game however I find myself bribing to many kingdoms in order to gain a favorable status to the point where the neighbors are attempted to invade my barn! You have to remember that just giving people gifts can weaken your own status and make you more prone to attacks.\n\nThe RTS combat is pretty great in this game however I find myself hitting the fast forward button (basically making AI fight) when I am being lazy and I suffer great losses as a result. The Generals do not take kindly to a lazy shogun/Daimyo (player). While your generals might have ranks that can help them overcome battles easier for you its best to improve your own skill set to outmatch any AI you encounter!\n\nI have tried the multiplayer with my friend and tend to drive him mad.

Multiplayer sometimes takes coordination between two people in order to better penetrate the enemy forces or you might end up with a minecraft partner.\n\nOverall I would say shogun 2 is a great RTS that has lots of re-playability both single player and multiplayer wise.","December 5, 2013","true","40.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I first learnt to program on a zx81. And, actually has a ZX80!  I loved stratagy games and tried to play and find as many as I could, good and bad growing up!  So, I looked forward with great anticipation the first Shogun game, it was discussed in the game magaines of the time and I couldnt wait! I bought it the day it came out - same with Medievel, and Rome I bourght on the day after I was on the old BBC 2 show"Time Commanders", just look up Time Commanders, vicars take on Teutoburg Forest  in any search engine and you'll see us..... We Won!!!\n\nI've kept the boxes guide prima stratagy guides and all the expansions, I've some complations  and a collectors full set.  I loved this series (.. I'm what is probably called a 'fan Boy')\n\nHowever, .... Work and Family life hit in and for a few years couldnt play as much, Empire and Napolean pretty much past me by, I kept buying  them all as and when they went on sale, beacuse I knew one day I might get to play them again! (Sorry "Game Horder" alert!)\n\nThat day has come, I've played when I could on and off over the years, but this week I managed to knock the bottom out of Shogun 2, and its quite frankly awsome!\n\nThe graphics are so good I keep taking screen shots,\nThe Diplomacy and the AI seem great, and a challenge\nThe Multiplayer fun , (except theres a lot of guns out there in multiplayer world),\nI like the Avatar system\nShogun 2 is polished, runs well and truthfully, I've not had so much fun since Time Commanders!\n...Did a tell you we won!\n10/10","March 18","true","172.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

Shogun 2 exceeded all expectations and will forever be a "golden age" for the series. Utilizing the unique history of Japan and the time period while incorporating necessary RTS components is pulled off flawlessly. This is a game I spend a lot of time with for good reason. The historical knowledge gained from playing is always fun. Plays how you would expect a Total War game to play. If you're a fan of turn based strategy games or RTS battle games, This might be for you. ***warning can be found to induce addiction***\n\nGameplay 9.5/10. Exceeded expectations. Very easy to get lost in "Just one more turn" Many in depth aspects that make your ability to either get extremely involved with every decision or let the AI take over some for you.\nVisual effects 8.5/10. A wall of flaming arrows is a thing of beauty.\nGraphics 8/10. Any RTS/TBS game on this scale will struggle to make each individual unit/building visually pleasing let alone a thing of beauty. Shogun 2 has in depth units and great castle design. Above average.\nControls 9/10. As always I am a big fan of Total War in battle and campaign map controls. Very genre appropriate.\nStory 8.5/10. Total war games will always take a hit in this category with reason. You influence every aspect of the game with every choice from turn one. You either follow or re-write history. Sega and Creative assembly does everything they can to give you a historical perspective/background. The rating is given due to that.\nReplayability 10/10. This is a game you can play however you'd like. Dump hours into quick battles, hours into grand campaigns. Play as one faction three times, three factions once. If you enjoy multiplayer this Total War shows us how great of a multiplayer experience one can get from a TBS/RTS game.\n\n9/10. Beautiful.\n","May 26","true","257.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Following the time axis and saigo takamori,  the player would have a chance to command the imperial force in Boshin War. The historical battles really recall my memory of Shinsengumi! and Ryomaden, two of my favorite Taiga dramas. although a bit of complicated, the avatar multiplayer system is really a nice MP experience, you can set your own unique fighting style with your veterans and avatar skill. The difficulty may prove to be the one of the hardest one in the total war serie, but it's definitely worth to study for a while and learn the game mechanism.

My tip is when you first start a campaign, instantly try to make allies and start up trade agreement.

Mechanics include: Ship boarding, burning ships, castle sieging, hill charges, and troop morale.\n\nSpeaking of troops.  In this game, I feel like each individual soldier is counted.  For example, with archers, rather than getting in range, shooting at an enemy unit, and having a % chance to kill a random soldier in the unit; every arrow launched has a path determined once it is launched, and if that path happens to intersect with a soldier, then the arrow will hit someone.\n\nShogun 2 is one of the few strategy games that makes me feel like I'm commanding an army instead of playing high-tech chess.","April 6, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pete9320/recommended/34330/","Pete9320","Pete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pete9320/","118 products in account","Shogun 2 is quite, a game.\n\nLet me give you a rundown:\n\nSo you're playing a strategy game taking place during the sengoku-jidai ''The age of the country at war''. Essentially this was a Japanese civil war, where landlords (daimyo) are fighting for control over feudal Japan. It's quite an unique setting, and it leads to some unique and cool things (which I'll cover a bit later).\n\nI'll start off with the core gameplay; There are two core modes in the game, an overworld with a stack movement and city management game, where you're administrating armies, agents and your castle towns. This mode is super cool, since you can ambush other armies by hiding your armies in forests, have agents (like ninjas) assasinate or sabotage armies and towns and so fourth. There's also a whole financial management game (I'd reccomend auto-management and then minimal taxes if you're doing very well financially). There's also diplomacy, and, oh I won't spoil it.\n\nThe other core mode is on the battlefield, where you'll have your units fight. It's super awesome going all close to the battle and seeing individual units fight. All (I think melee weapon combat) was correographed by professional users of the katana and naginata (People who practice kenjutsu and naginatajutsu). It's really freaking cool, combine that with archers and all you can get some interesting battles. You're in control of unit stacks, where each unit also has special abilities etc. There's a lot to talk about, and it's quite hard for me to explain (even though it's really simple). If you know Total War however, you'll know what to expect combat wise.\n\nGraphically this game isn't that bad, in fact it requires a lot from your pc. Since all units are rendered etc. However, even on mid-tier settings this game looks great. It's what to expect from a strategy game in my opinion.\n\nNow; what sets Shogun 2 out, is the period. You have a combination of melee units as well as ranged as well as gunpowder units. So the battlefield combat can get really interesting, since you'll take chances etc.\n\nI won't explain how it feels, just, get this game. If you can get it cheap, do so. Full price is worthy of it all though.","June 28, 2014","true","751.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Taking place in Feudal Japan following the Middle Ages, you can play as one of several warlords, or factions, whose job it is to take over and unite Japan under one ruler. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, Economic, Political, and Militarily. There are several DLC's for Shogun 2, including; Rise of the Samurai, Fall of the Samurai, The Dragon War Battle, as well as several downloadable clan packs. Unlike previous games in the series, Shogun 2 takes place only in Japan and not Europe or the overall world as a whole.\n\nThe tutorial is also different, in that when I tried using it, it seemed to be a series of video clips on what to do, as opposed to an actual playable tutorial, the way previous Total War games have allowed. The game is straightforward, easy to learn, and reminds me of a rebooted and upgraded version of Shingen The Ruler, which was an old NES game. I had a lot more fun with this game then I figured I would, given it's region-specific story arc and lack of a sandbox feel the way previous Total War games were. As with all Total War games, it is part real time battle strategy and tactics when in combat, and turn-based role play when not fighting enemy units. A departure from many of the previous Total War games in some ways, but a fun and interesting game in any case.","June 27, 2015","true","21.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Will you unite a divided Japan under one rule. Do you have the will to lead your house to its destiny in order to become the next Shogun?\n\nOverall, this is probably the best Total War on the Warscape engine to date.

However the use of archers is limited if you have infantry fighting the enemy as well, make sure your archers do not kill your swords/spearmen! That has annoyed me countless times,  almost costing me all my battles!\n\nThe diplomacy is superior to most other total war games, you can see the perosn you are trying to make diplomacy with for the first time I have seen, also you can exchange hostages, unlike in Rome II.\n\nPolitics is less good though as Rome II's is better, but Shoguns 2 is still good, making the game feel more real as well as adding more fun and challange to the game.\n\nYou also get the change to master the arts, this is also done in Rome II, but though  in Shogun 2 you have a much more complex mastery of the arts system, instead of researching technology you master the arts, you get to decide form mastering the arts of chi or bumi ( they are called something like that ) the bumi masters the art of war while the chi masters the art of farming, tax and buildings.\n\n\nAll in all this is a great and challanging game that will make for many hours of play time, currently I have not done that much with this game but I can tell I am in for many hours  of my life spent planning out my camapigns and killing multiple enemies with my magnificent chosokabe armies!\n\nI hope that this has helped anyone who was contemplating buying this game, I can promise that your money will be well spent here, and with modding available you can make the game even better for yourself, so do not worry, if you do find that the game is not 100% and you want more then you can always rely on the greta steam community to hel pyou out with your predicament.\n\n( also if you want to join my Total war group then plase go to my profile and clicko n the groups button, on the right if you scroll down a little, there you can go to the discussions section and read up on what my members think of Shogun 2 and other total war games, you can also comment, asking if you should buy the game, do not be afraid as my group is good. )\n\nYours Sincerly\nGaius Julius Ceasar","April 7, 2014","true","157.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

For the reasons below:\n\n+ Rather good graphic with low hardware requirement. (My PC can't run Rome II.........)\n+ Though developed by a western group, this game is kind of the best one reflecting Japanese history and wars. (I am not Japanese, maybe biased)\n++ I was reading the fiction "Tokugawa Ieyasu" by 山岡荘八 while playing this. And many history event can be justified in game, including the geopolitics, the roles of religions, the strength of each clan etc. It has an amazing sense of identification. I felt like being a real clan leader and each of my action in the game can be recorded in the way written in those history books. Believe me, it is amazing.\n\n- the Mods didn't contain material changes to the original game. So when I was looking for something new, I failed.\n\n9/10 for a strategy game.

Shogun 2 is like playing through a new, remastered edition of those films (if...they..where...games hmm >_> anyway....) complete with both the character dramas and the enormous battles.\n\nCombining beautiful graphics, scheming generals, awesome multiplayer, and deep strategic gameplay with countless small details that fill it with historical flavor and drama, Shogun 2 is one of the most captivating strategy games ever made.\n\nYou can take charge of any of the major factions of Japanese feudal history, from the mighty Oda to the more delicate but well positioned Tokugawa clan. Any of the clans could rise to take the position of Shogun under your leadership.\n\nI would also highly recommend you to get the two main DLC for Shogun II the “Rise of the Samurai” and the “Fall of the Samurai”, as they are stand alone games in there own right adding a whole new level to your gaming experience.\n\nTo finish I'd like to say this game is possibly one of the best RTS's I've ever played, the attention to detail is impressive and the tremendous replayability make the game a must have for any gamers library, enjoy hours of entertainment with Total War: Shogun 2.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","October 1, 2015","true","155.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

You will plan your steps or you´ll regret them. The stories you make yourself in your campains are so awesome.

Shogun 2 is a Turns Based Real Time Strategy Game. You play as one of the selectable clans from Sengoku Jidai periods, also known as the time period where the samurai dudes were killing each other becasuse they were high on the bushidos (Suicidal Warriors Code) stuff. There are around roughly 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 clans. Each with their own Unique traits and special unit. If you haven't played any of the total war games ,you should just unplug your computer and donate it to someone more deserving. But in case you're a newborn and haven't experience the glory of a total war game, you should pick up this game whether it's on sale or not ASAP and play as either the Chosokabe or the Date clan to learn the basic. Now, I called this game a Turns based real time strategy game because the world map is like a board game based on the island of Nippon or Japan unless you're not as weeaboos as I am. You construct buildings, raising armies, recruiting spies, politicians and (Women that do nasty stuff for money because pros-ti-tute is apparently censored) to do your bidding. You can also make diplomacy with other clans. Once you attack an enemy's army. The game shift into hawk eye view of the battlefields and you commands your troops to do all of these fancy tactic you've always dream of doing because you watched too much actions movies. "Why should I buy shogun 2 when I can buy Rome Total War  since it has more people vouch for it? or Heck I can buy Rome 2, it's newer so it's probably better" Rome 1 is a great game, but it's a relic of the past. Shogun 2 is the best total war game to date at the time I wrote this review. Rome 2 is a complete joke compared to this game. Each and every single little character in the battlefield in Shogun 2 are animated. The graphic is beautiful and it has a great mod community.  The musics and sounds effect are amazing. But, if you cringe at the sound of japanese language I would suggest you not get this game and spend the money to get a new personality because you are racist. In a war game such as this, the AI play a huge role as they are your opponent most of the times so how are the  AI? The AI in this game are great for a total war game. They do sometimes make stupid decisions though. As a strategy game enthusiast, I recommend you get Shogun 2 Total War. It is a great game that would suck your life away. Once you beat the vanilla game you can try out the two new expansions Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the samurai to see how it all started and how it end. I rate this game a 10/10/10 it's a must have! Unless you hate Japan for some reason. Then don't, go buy a new personality instead because the world doesn't need closed minded person like you.","March 20, 2015","true","283.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","5","6","5","0"

At the start you can make alliances and grow in power. Once your big enough, you start the civil war where everyone is against you providing a fun late game challenge I felt other total war games lacked. The atmosphere is spot on, but troop variety is limited so the different factions only have 1-2 unique units.\n\nThe multiplayer is also the best out of the Total War Series, allowing for co-op campaigns and a clan focused completive multiplayer where your army levels up and you can customize them.\n","October 28, 2014","true","81.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is the BEST Total War game. Rome 2 does not come close to it. The campaigns are well thought out, and the units are well balanced. If you like micromanagement of everything from your units to resource generation, this is a game for you. If you like smart AI who can counter your moves and act with relative intelligence, this is a great game. The details from units to buildings to the descriptions are perfect and gives an air of authencity.","January 8, 2014","true","147.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

All the shame you feel from dishonering your family will be washed away when you are immersed into the experience that is Shogun 2!\n\nFeel your innter girly side by being bombarded with countless cherry blossoms...Relive the glory days of Japan before the thing that is left out of most Japanese textbooks happened...March your armies to victory with more efficiency than the Bhutan death march...Build the most glorious railroad since the Burmese railway, but with less slaves...Pwn and r4pe your enemies  more than the city of Nanking...and destroy your enemies harbors more than Pearl Harbor!  The experiences and playstyles are endless!\n\nIn all seriousness though here is my actual review....above was just my promotion of the game..\n\nI could never get in to any of the other Total War games.  I played both Rome 2 and Empire a bit, but eventually stopped playing them after a game or two.  I find this game way more fun to play and I think it is way better to look at.\n\nHere are some reasons why I think this is the best newer Total War game..\n\n-Balance.  The other Total War games can become confusing with the huge amount of other units...It takes way too long to figure out what counters what.  In this game, it is quite simple but still complex at the same time.  Horse beats archer, archer beats soldier, soldier beats horse...this rock, paper, scissors forumula makes it easy to pick up and learn.  There are still other units that add complexity, but for the most part you can rely on trusting this simple formula\n\n-Design/Graphics.  Rome 2 might look slightly better in terms of polygon count and effects, but not by much.  This game looks better overall though!  The Japanese artwork and music throughout the game really helps to immerse you.  Everything else looks nearly identical to the new Total War games, but this runs better and has better performance.\n\n-Decent unit movement, control, and COLLISION DETECTION!  One of the main reasons I always got sick of the other Total War games was because it always felt that you wern't in control of your units or armies...A group of 40 soldiers, essentially acted like one unit.  This game still isn't like other RTS games where you have control over a single unit...a single unit is still considered an army, but this concept has been improved and is actually better than it is in Rome 2.  Sending in a group of 30 or so soldier in Total War games was always lame...the individual soldiers would kinda just walk around the enemies not doing anything and every 5 seconds you would eventuall see one of your units hit someone with a sword.  This is only really a problem with melee units, but its a really big problem because it make it feel like your units arn't fighting right.  Its still an issue in this game, but units are much more likely to engage eachother in battle and not just walk around not doing anything.\n\n-The expansion!  Usually expansions in Total War games or other RTS dont really change the gameplay that much.  The expansion in this game almost turns it into a whole other game!  Without the expansion, you are just using mainly archers, sword, horses, and other simple weapons....but by installing the expansion you upgrade the technology of the Japanese by like 500 years!  This is mainly because Japan was feudalistic before the arrival of western powers...The introduction of such different weapons and technologies would seem out of place usually, but in this historical context it makes sense!  It really changes the game a lot, and it makes both versions of the game fun to play.\n\nWay better than any other Total War game I have played...which is medieval 2, empire, and Rome 2.  A great game which you can always come back to!  Tons of cool MOD support, like one where they add tons of blood and decapitations!  Awesome!\n\n8/9 Sudoku boxes!","March 8","true","134.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaleb_Smith/recommended/34330/","Kaleb_Smith","Kurota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaleb_Smith/","98 products in account","In my opinion Shogun 2 is the best Total War game to date. This game does have bugs and sometimes pisses you off but it is still a really good game. I'm sorry for the length of this review buyt I wanted to give you an in depth feel of the game.\n\nGood\n\n1) The game allows you to do whatever you want with your empire. If you want to set the Takeda Clan's land on fire, you can. You want to assassinate a general that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off? You can. Do you want to be a cold ruler and kill your own subjects if they disagree with you? You can (With consequences). Do you want to build a huge trade empire? You can. You get the picture.\n\n2) It looks good, not amazing compared to today but back when it was made people were like "DAMN!!!!"\n\n3) All combat in the game was animated using real-life sword masters therefore it looks amazing\n\n4) Large scale battles. While on the campaign map you control your empire, but when you go into combat with another army it is a whole different story. You have thousands of soldiers (all animated, and looking unique) fighting each other at one time with cavalry charges, gunfire, arrows flying everywhere, and even mortars in the later stages of the game. While this is going on you have the morale factor, if a regiment sees allies routing, starts loosing a lot of men, is set on fire, is surrounded, or if the commander dies they loose morale which leads to them being less effective in battle and if it gets too low they will break (They will run away for a short amount of time), and if it gets worse than that the unit will be shattered (They will run from the battle and can no longer be controlled).\n\n5) Meaningful allies. I found that in most of the other Total War games your allies don't help much or all out betray you all the time. In Shogun if you ally with another clan and start a war with another clan, they will amass an army to help you. They may also trade with you or give you military access to their territory.\n\n6) Familty trees. You have the ability to arrange a marriage with another clan if you have an unmarried woman in your family. As time progresses new family members are born and after a few years in-game they become adults ready to marry or command an army (Each have their own skills, disadvantages, and personality). You may also adopt generals into your army and make one of your best family members your heir (It is chosen for you in most Total War games).\n\n7) Huge map. Shogun 2 features a huge detailed campaign map filled with cillages, mines, docks, farms, etc. There are also 25 - 30 clans to dominate on the map each with their own buffs and weaknesses.\n\n8) Naval battles. This is the first game in the series with naval battles. Basically you have a fleet of ships with a certain amount of archers and infantry on each ship, each ship has their own speed and strength of their hull. The battle either ends when you set the enemy ships on fire using flaming arrows or bomb throwing ships, or by boarding the ship and letting your infantry fight (This makes the crew surrender on the enemy ship if you are successful, adding a new ship to your navy).\n\n9) Avatar conquest. This is the main multiplayer mode of Shogun 2. You create a general, create a banner, name your faction, and invade territory on the conquest map. You also build your own army, and if a unit sees a lot of battles you can make them veterans allowing you to color, name, and upgrade them. You attack other players using the army you created and are ranked on the leaderboards.\n\n10) DLC. There are multiple DLCs that add new units to the game, and one that makes it bloodier. The two large DLCs are Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. These are based in different time periods than the base game and add new units, factions and a new story.\n\n11) No real noticeable bugs that I can think of\n\n\nBad\n\n1) At times units will loose morale and run even if they were about to win the fight\n\n2) Some units in the game are unbalanced and can easily destroy most of your army\n\n\n\nWell now that you know the good and bad about the game hopefully you have decided on whether or not to buy it.\n\nAs for my rating I give this game a 10/10\n\n\n\n\n","February 21","true","60.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/34330/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","Total War: Shogun 2 is a Turn based strategy game based on 16th century in Japan. Time that most people call the "Edo Period". Period with mainly only wars, destruction, pain and sorrow. A time when almost every bigger clan was battling to gain their place on the "throne". Every clan wanted their Daimyo to become a Shogunate.\n\nIn Total War: Shogun 2 (I'll just say Shogun 2 from now on) your objective is to rise your fame by conquering other clans and province, make alliances with other clans and to get big and strong enough army to face the Shogunate himself. In case that you do not know, Shogunate was like a "king" in Japan. "The ruler of them all".\n\nIn Shogun 2 you can chose almost any of the strongest clans that existed in the Edo Period.  And if you ask me, Shogun 2 is a great way to learn what was happening in Japan in 16th century. Maybe you even start to like one clan so much that you'll know almost everything about them! For example, I'm a huge fan of Date clan because they were masters of the sword ( Katana ). My dear June is a big fan of Takeda clan because they were best cavalry in that time. She likes horses. She even has two horses at home!\n\nEach clan in Shogun 2 has their own boost at the things that they were good at. As i stated before, Date has boost in sword fights and Takeda has strongest cavalry. Clan named Chosokabe has a boost in bow damage and so on and on. You chose your clan by how you want to play, and what kinds of tactics do you want to use in battles. You start off on the part of land which was owned by your clan from the very beginning. Then you need to start making armies and start conquering.\n\nShogun 2 is not like any other turn based strategy games. In this game you do not have many buildings to build. There are, but you can't chose where you want to put them. And you can't really even see them in battle (unless you battle on the terrain where that building is). You can only build the amount of building as your owned area allows you to. For example if your "fortress" (sorry, i don't know how were those buildings called in that time) is on level 3, you can only build 2-4 more buildings on the area. As you upgrade the "fortress" to level 4, you get another more building spot for some other building such as stables, archery school or any other combat or non-combat oriented building.\n\nIn Shogun 2 your goal is to become a Shogunate. You have few years (i think that 25 is on easiest) to do so. 1 Year has 4 turns - Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. One great thing about Shogun is that if your army is on enemy territory during the winter (or enemy's army is on your territory) your army (or enemy's ) will get slightly smaller in numbers due to deaths because of colds or lack of food or something. Very realistic indeed!\n\nUnlocking new, stronger units is easy in this game. Just build few new buildings and you get samurai units such as "Katana Samurai" or "Yarri Samurai". But even those stronger, Samurai units can fall easily if your opponent uses a good tactic against you. That's why Shogun 2's multiplayer is very hard and tricky. You can't just plan your attack two days before you have a battle and then just do it. You need to plan it within the fight! Because there is always something that goes wrong.\n\nThere are also three different game types in Shogun 2. Naval battle, Land battle and Siege mode. I am terrible in Naval battle and thus, I really can't tell you anything about it. Land battle is a battle where your only objective is to eliminate your enemy, with any units that you have. You can put your Bow Samurai on the top of a hill and Katana Samurai at the bottom of it so nobody else could kill your Samurai and BAM! Your victory is almost granted. Unless your enemy has cavalry which means that your Katana Samruai  might die very fast. In Siege mode you can either be an attacker or defender. Defender needs to kill the attacker and hold the fort for as long as they can, while attacker's mission is to get into the fort any way they can (either with bombs that destroy gates, or climbing over the wall) and either kill all the defender or grab all the spots in the fortress. Sounds easy but it's actually very hard. People usually tend to use Ninjas a lot on this kind of missions since they think that Ninjas are better in stealth or better climbers then samurais. Sure, they are, but Samurais are bigger in number, and in my opinion Samurais are better fighters.   I only say that because I like Samurais more :P\n\nIn Avatar battles you make your own clan, which is awesome if you ask me. There are various ingame signs that you put on your flag, you put your own custom colors and chose which weapon will they be the best with. I didn't play too much of Avatar combat because people that usually play it are all higher rank than me and thus, they have much better and more trained units then me. That doesn't mean i can't win thought. In fact, i won quite a few games! And all were versus people on 8 + higher level! You can even do more then 1 versus 1. You can get into group battles. So call your friends, ready your horses, swords, bows or spears and go into battles together!\n\nOne commentator asked me to write some battle tactics. Honestly i'm not good at deciding tactics. I do tactic while i play. But in single player, i usually put all my army into the forest and i put my katana users in front of bow users. So in case that enemy gets closer, i pause the game, grab each unit ant point each onto their own enemy. I do the same with bow users. So the enemy can't come near my bows who actually kill everyone and everything. That's my normal, very easy to learn and master tactic.\n\nPros:\n- Wonderful fraphic.\n- Massive battles with over 20 units per player.\n- Various terrains to chose from.\n- Make your own clan in multiplayer.\n- Unit customization in multiplayer.\n- Make your own story and become the next Shogunate!\n\nCons:\n- Requires a very strong computer.\n- Has way too many DLC's which only means more cost.\n- Loading on beginning of the game lasts very, very long.\n- Character's mouth don't move when they talk (yea, very unneeded detail.... But it's a detail!)\n\nNow when you rode this whole review, its up to you to decide if Total War: Shogun 2 is a game for you or not! To be honest, it's currently one of my favorite games. I was playing it a lot with June over summer (we sat together, one beside another. She would build armies, conquer lands, and I'd be her war general. I'd win all the battles) so it's kinda boring now when i play it alone.\n\nBut if we forget that, I love this game! It's absolutely great! If you're as big Samurai fan as I am, and a strategy fan, this game is a MUST GET!\n\n\nThank you for reading my reviews!

I played Empire and NTW briefly but got bored. That being said, here's a few reasons why I think this game is a winner.\n\nIt looks amazing even 4 years on. Not just the battlefield graphics, but the effort they put into music and aesthetics which makes Shogun 2 really unique and immersive. The campaign map is a serene mix of handrawn maps and little 3D communities and towns, forests that change colour in the autumn, fields that freeze over in the winter.  Everything is represented as drawings and paintings. Units communicate in Japanese. It's polish like this that shows CA went the extra mile.\n\nOn the battlefield it also looks amazing. The individual choreographed fights among thousands of detailed soldiers is incredible, I've never seen anything like it before in a strategy game.\n\nAI is decent. Not amazing, but not brain-dead either. They use cavalry quite well to surround you and get behind your lines. They know when to attack vs. defend on a hill, and support weakened units with reserves. However I've found they're too quick to charge into battle even when they're at a disadvantage. EIther way I get a good challenge.\n\nThere are very clear advantages/disadvantages between unit types, terrain, weather etc. so you can quickly formulate tactics and strategies.\n\nCampaign-wise, I find it's the same old as previous TW games. Attrition and seasons add a nice strategic layer: you can't always afford to starve out cities but storming them will always be costly.\n\nI really can't think of any major problems with this game. 9.5/10.","April 3, 2015","true","26.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

And it was: wouldn't it be super cool if, like, all these Japanese people started shooting each other?\n\nTotal War: Shogun 2 (Fall of the Samurai) has answered my question. And the answer is: "Hai!"\n\nIt's so fun! Seeing Japanese shoot each other, especially with artillery and gatling guns! And when you see a bunch of spear-weilding Japanese rushing an enemy Japanese rifle unit, and get mowed down, oh man, it feels so good! Like an angel has come down from Heaven to bless my soul. There's this inner peace unlike any other when I see, like, 5,000 Japanese dudes unload on each other until they're all dead.\n\nSo you should get this game.

Maybe you have a better troops but you dont know how to play or you have a bad strategic the enemy can overun you esily because they have a strtegy.\nEX: you make your general and marksman out first than your normal troops your army is done.\nIf you are playing is a castle defender and you dont know where to locate your troops correctly your enemy can overun your gates  really fast and your troops can't hold and defend them if they are overun.\nIf you are playing naval battle and you dont know your and enemys' ship well you can loose even if you have more and better ship.\nFor me this is one of the best Total war series I have ever played. Also this game graphics is really high so its make the game really realistic. And if you want to finish all of the possible story campaign than it will take you atleast 1 month.\nFor me the DLC are really worth it because it dont just include little things or small campaigns but its add a whole story and the DLC price are fairly cheap comaring to other games with worse and more expensive DLCS.\nSo to end this I can only say it is '' FANTASIC ''","September 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's been a long time since I have played a TW game where playing on the defense of a seige has been so fun that I always look forward to it. Religion plays a much bigger role than in some previous titles and causing Religious Unrest can really be a fun way to stick it to your enemies. This game also has neat little cut scense for when your Ninja assassinates someone, commits arson, or fails in the attempt. Even if your ninja fails you might end up laughing at how pathetically bad they are if not yet trained up. This game gives you all new challenges. Will you stick to honor and tradition and the old ways? Or perhaps honor means nothing to you and the old ways must go! You might even adopt firearms to turn the tables on rival clans! Do you want samuarai or some bad ♥♥♥ crazy monks? Both are equally bad ♥♥♥! Perhaps you will lead the Religious Zealots and Peasants of the Ikko Ikki to victory, swarming your foe with vast numbers of peasants and rogue samurai (Ronin). Well who is to say?

Katana's clash, bombs are thrown, flintlock muskets are fired, and throats are slit by shinobi in the night. The Battle AI is finally competent enough to make use of forests for ambush and avoid charging directly into your spearmen across the bridge, and finally put up a decent challenge to your forces. In Direct X 11 mode, the game looks absolutely superb, a big step up from Napoleon, and uses the new form of anti aliasing called MLAA created by AMD, which increases performance. Multiplayer is engaging, and the coop mode is simply fun to play with a friend.

For me, the campaign proved to be challenging but not tedious. I recommend this to wargamers.\nThis game is more balanced as the effects of spear, cavalry, and sword units are more obvious than other games in the Total War series. You will have access to the same base of units as your enemy, but its not really a bad thing as there are enough nuances to each faction. Likewise, a bone-headed cavalry rush into a spear unit will skewer cavalry with confidence, though with no certainty. Likewise, spear units will die at the hands of sword units, and so on. The key in winning therefore is knowing what unit to commit in an action. A reserve is helpful in exploiting gaps in enemy lines or plugging holes in your own.\nThe game is not without its faults; the chief complaint I have is that the AI loves to spawn little armies that wreck a little havok in your lands but offer little challenge in a pitched battle. The campaign AI is worse as its diplomacy is still vague. Strangely, though the AI offers a good challenge in hard or higher setting, its predictability in patterns of attack and consolidation of its forces cheapens my sense of accomplishment. It would have added a little flavor and attention to detail if an enemy general with a supposed penchance for cavalry rush do so rush me its cavalry reserve as a coup de main. The enemy agents are OK and add a little unknown factor that adds immersion into the game. But I digress...\nThis game is best enjoyed with your friends. A match with friends or even strangers will give you that added flavor and quirks that make you come back for more. The Shogun 2 community is good, and often welcoming to new players willing to listen to veteran gamers.\nLong story short, what you find lacking in the singleplayer campaign you will get in the multiplayer.","October 1, 2012","true","187.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Rome II has been out for almost a year and I just couldn't get into it the same way.\n\nI love the 'family tree' feature in this game. Being able to look back at the end of a long campaign, with my Daimyo(clan leader) now 53 yrs old, having started the game when he was 18, it's a great feeling. To remember the past battles, close calls, the sacrifices etc.  It really helps build that immersive connection, so that you actually care about your clan and your armies.\n\nLike all games, this one isn't perfect. The multiplayer could be better. I'm a big stats type of guy with a game like this, and I really felt like the end of game stats weren't as informative as they could have been. For example, when you look back through the history, it says "Won battle on this date", but that's it. I wish it said which general and included all of the stats for that specific army, etc.\n\nIf you've never played a game like this, you're in for a treat. Obviously, like every other game you spend money on, you should watch some youtube 'Let's Play' videos to see what's really in store.\n\nThe top-down strategic view is nicely done, coming from the Civ series, it wasn't hard for me to get used to. Having the option to enter the battles in 3d is just fantastic. These battles can be absolutely epic and it's a joy to watch them unfold, especially when you're the underdog.\n\nNow to be honest, I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me during my first campaign. I didn't read any tutorials and I jumped right in without paying much attention to some important bits of info. The starter clans differ in difficulty, for starters. Select auto-management for Taxes at first, this will help in not becoming overwhelmed as you add more cities to your clan's dominion.\n\nThat's all for now. Grab this game if you're a Civ fan that has always dreamt of actually entering the battle in 3D!","July 18, 2014","true","013.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The difficulty in learning what unit does what, and how each operate was a very difficult task, but learning to overcome that uncertainty pushed Shogun 2 into a limelight that it's easier predecessor (Empire) held.\n\nShogun 2 provides a mixture of well-designed characters with extremely detailed animations into deadly historical war. In true Total War fashion, just having superior numbers and "zerging" an enemy unit does not always win. It's the proper use of the right "tool" to do the job that prevails here.\n\nIt does take a LOT to get used to, and it takes awhile to get into the "swing" of things, but give it enough time and you will be stroking your chin in thought as you effectively play your real-time chess against an opponent that already knows your army better than you do.","August 18, 2011","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternalsamurai/recommended/34330/","eternalsamurai","Ronin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternalsamurai/","119 products in account","TW: Shogun 2 is by far one of my favorite games. The reasons being the balanced units, co-op, multiplayer, the excellent expansion that is Fall of the Samurai, unique and interesting bonuses for the majority of the clans, well placed tactical structures  on the maps, a very well designed skill tree that scales into late-game, and the manual battles are something else.\n\nHowever as much as I could praise any positive attribute i've previously stated in detail, i've no intention of doing so. You'd be better off not having what the game has to truly offer being spoiled. Which leads me to the negative attributes of TW: Shogun 2 because I will go into a bit of detail, and you should definitely know what you're getting into because realistically what is a minor complaint for me could be a major problem to you. Specifically within the standard campaign diplomacy is for the most part a joke. The player has options to increase their diplomatic standings with another clan, but you will face situations where neighboring clans refuse nearly all attempts at diplomacy and ultimately on the higher difficulties this means going to war early with 4 or more clans. The only ways to avoid this are to pay other clans off and/or hope you can set up a prearranged marriage, and realistically both are not an option in the early game phase. Well that or you have to choose a clan that is positioned in a corner or the Chosokabe which are on a small island. Now if you reach a certain point where you've gained too much territory there will be a realm divide and you instantly lose about 250 diplomacy with all clans meaning you're instantly at war with every remaining clan in Japan unless you've been paying them off until that event happened, and even still it's meaningless to pay that clan off because no matter what you do they'll eventually go to war with you anyway due to the fact you lose a large amount of diplomacy every turn after a realm divide. Essentially within the standard campaign at a difficulty of 'hard' or higher, the diplomacy mechanic within the game is what will literally make your life a living hell  and it gets worse as you bump up the difficulty. That isn't to say you can't win, but unless you're either willing to play co-op or sacrifice much of what you've conquered for a better tactical position you can and will be completely crushed losing all time invested in playing. Regardless though the game can still provide a challenge at normal difficulty for some time, and the hard difficulty isn't going to give you nightmares if you're well versed with the game. Anything beyond the hard difficulty obviously isn't going to be forgiving at all. Now that we're done with that, how about that Rise of the Samurai expansion? It's fairly horrible due to the same diplomacy issues, less unit types, slower gameplay due to each province needing to be converted to a specific allegiance, less building types, less potential money made per turn, etc. Buyers beware of the RoTS expansion.\n\nTo end this review I want to reiterate that the Fall of the Samurai expansion is truly excellent. Most of the diplomacy issues are fixed in this expansion, there are even more unit types, a longer overall campaign in regards to available turns, siege units  matter now, a similar skill tree but with a nice twist and better economic opportunities that make it feel very different from the standard skill tree, more provinces, design changes to the overall map of Japan, etc. Personally I prefer the feudal units in the standard campaign to the more modern units in the FoTS expansion but there's still so much to enjoy here.\n\nWhat else can I say? Great game, but it has its faults.","June 23, 2014","true","850.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And when I say 4/5, I am talking that if you play the genre, or are interested in playing this genre of game- this is a game you should pick up. 5/5 is reserved for things like minecraft, L4D and to be honest WoW- even if you hate the genre, you should play the game just because it is either incredibly amazing or just such a cultural phenomena/industy changing game that it must be experienced.(3/5 is something you should look at if you like the genre, 2/5 is something you should avoid actively unless the game sounds like it is catering to your tastes exactly, and 1/5 dont touch it)\n\nThis is the best total war, its only problem being that I do not like the time period. But it is still my favorite total war. This was done 6/25/2014, and Ihave played every total war except shogun 1(top 3 for me are shogun 2 >medieval 2(pretty bad UI,great systems) > rome(combat is probably more varied in rome but shogun has good combat/amazing campaign).\n\n\nNOTE: both expansions have the same issues and strengths of standard shogun unless noted otherwise\n\n=<Standard Shogun 2>=\nSet in feudal japan, nations use the same basic units but it really doesnt feel old because of the flavor your generals, agents, and just overall setting. Graphics are great, sound is great, game engine makes melee combat look good(unlike in rome 2, I think the lack of shield combat makes it work)\n\n\n+Agents are interesting and insightful,and have a great upgrade system\n+Good mix of siege and open field battles\n+combat units stick to a "Type > slight bonus" style of variation, meaning it is pretty easy to tell who is good against what, and still have enjoyable special units(hero units, national specialties)\n+All units are useful the whole game- yari ashigeru can win you\n+Good choice of teams for COOP(I played with the DLC though)\n+AI is best in series(only in sieges can it wig out and be dumb, otherwise it is all legitimate moves)\n+diplomacy is reasonably fleshed out daimyo honor system is really cool\n+flavor. Everyone has flavor- your daimyo has a particular style, agents are easy to get attached to\n+ lots of interesting tactical choices, and the map is small enough that conquering 4 or 5 provinces is a big deal.\n+ bug free! Just dont try and do anything on your buddies turn(you can read tooltips and stats, but dont change policies on anything)\n\n- loading times, still pretty nasty- turn timers are fine though.\n- AI is reasonably derpy in sieges, but works great on open maps\n-Game engine(warscape) handles only single combat and all animations are between 2 people.\n-I dont like samurai, its a personal preference\n\n\n\n=<Rise of the Samurai>= A campaign set at the rise of the samurai(WHAT A TWIST!) where early game is mostly filthy peasants running around, and late game everyone is a samurai archer- I thought it was okay(has some good mods) but it was my least favorite of the 3 campaigns due to the lack of national choices(3 teams).\n\n+made for 2 player coop(3 choices for "teams")\n+3 team choices means that you are guaranteed to have giant wars with them\n\n\n- I did not like the progression of the units: you go from arrows being great because nobody can field more than 1 or 2 armored samurai, to entire stacks where you have just samurai, because why not.\n- 3 team choices feel very similar, not so great replay value\n\n\n=<Fall of the Samurai>=\nStarts with petty muskets and ends with mightly rifled barrels for your sharpshooters. This is my favorite way to play shogun as it actually gives me something the game engine is good at, as well as something we barely ever see in other games: line battles! Other than total war and mount and blade, I cant think of any good musket era games(paradox games dont count; unrelated genre).\n\n\n+Warscape engine made for ranged combat, looks great\n+boat combat is actually fun and navies are interesting\n+Artillery in first person is just peachy\n+great balance between muskets and melee: early guns are terrible and yari ashigeru can walk right through it\n+tech tree provides unit progression on both sides of the tree! madness!\n\n-Choices for nation are very ho hum, you essentially pick "the left side" or "the right side". This makes coop kind of bleuarg for starting area choices.\n-maybe too many siege battles? could be personal preference/playstyle though\n\n\n\n\n=<Final thoughts>=\nNo matter which of these three you get(skip Rise unless thats your cup of tea), you are getting the best of total war. Shogun 2 on the whole has an interesting campaign that the AI can challenge you in(agents, province build choices, diplomacy), battles have AI that works! looks great and still has a lot of tactical positioning. And along with the classic total wars, Shogun 2 has the feeling of being attached to your nation: the daimyo honor system combined with actual diplomacy, fleshed out traits and family tree, general somber/serious tone, and visual differences between all factions really makes me(someone who does not like honor and samurai and cherry blossoms) really get into the game.\n\nI played this game maybe 70% COOP, rest solo- did not touch the multiplayer(I hear it is good!) about 150 hours.","June 25, 2014","true","313.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though I received this game a year after it was released, I feel no regrets in purchasing this game. Shogun 2 is the perfect game for beginners to get a grasp of what the series is like and its now become one of the classics for Total war veterans. Nothing feels more amazing than leading an army of samurai in Japans warring states period: The Sengoku Jidai. In this game, the mix of turn based strategy (with economic, political, and diplomatic ramifications) and real time battles is wonderful but the need to balance timing and aggression is more important than ever. The AI may seem difficult at first and hard to deal with but the Total War series has always been about realism and the AI's scripted actions make logical and historical sense.\nGraphically Shogun 2 is stunning and one of the more easily run games in the series. It is a testament of Creative Assembly's hard work.\nIf you end up playing Shogun 2, I would also recommend playing its two expansions as well: Rise of the Samurai and Fall of the Samurai. Both expansions add more depth to the title while adding various new units and factions to play as.\nMy final word is Shogun 2 is the perfect game for history buffs and action fans alike who love leading massive armies into battle but also love using passive or aggressive diplomacy in the campaign as well.","November 26, 2013","true","176.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No this is just my opinion that i feel the game is just not with my expections.\n\nThe graphics as anyone can say are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic and if someone said they are not they are foolish. The amazing graphics as always in Total War games have pushed systems to the edgy, something i love.\n\nSo what do i dislike? just about everything else. Everything you know and love is in this game and even improved such as the battles, support units and even the cities are refined. Yet the factions are boring with not much variation between them and all share pretty much the same tactic. Good but soon wore off. This is a complication mainly because of the setting and not much can be done about it.\n\nI disliked the fact the devs focused so much on the online aspect. It has washed out the rest of the game. The Rock, paper, scisors aspect has been taken too litiral, games are now very predictable.\n\nSo its a good game, just not for me.\nSorry to all fans :( 8/10","August 15, 2011","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

I personally think it is among, if not the best game from the Total War franchise. As a RTS and turn-based strategy game, it lives up to all that and much more. Unit, structural and environromental details leave nothing to the imagination; however, the campaign cinematics are humble despite the game having perfectly rendered in-game clips. Overall audio and visuals are breathe-taking (comparable to much newer AAA games). Don't be fooled, this game can still give your PC a run for its money especially on ultra settings with multiple AI's in the mix. I strongly recommend getting this game in a bundle with the standalone expansion (Fall of The Samurai) and the other existing DLCs. It is also VERY replayable and will always be great value for your money. If you don't already own this game and you like RTS and Japanese feudal lords, it's time to commit seppuku.","February 11, 2014","true","96.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What I was more excited about was the historical battles you get to fight, really amazing how they made that so every ramdom battle turns out to feel like you were reviving the Japanese's past fights (at least for me).\nMy only complaining is about the multiplayer, it is true, I didn't play much of the avatar conquest, but from what I played (2-3 hours) it was a real ♥♥♥♥, and the coop campaing could be really awesome, but as I said, it is dead now...\n\nSummary, if you are a fan of Samurais and Japan history.. buy the game for sure!

For me, the campaign proved to be challenging but not tedious. I recommend this to wargamers.\nThis game is more balanced as the effects of spear, cavalry, and sword units are more obvious than other games in the Total War series. You will have access to the same base of units as your enemy, but its not really a bad thing as there are enough nuances to each faction. Likewise, a bone-headed cavalry rush into a spear unit will skewer cavalry with confidence, though with no certainty. Likewise, spear units will die at the hands of sword units, and so on. The key in winning therefore is knowing what unit to commit in an action. A reserve is helpful in exploiting gaps in enemy lines or plugging holes in your own.\nThe game is not without its faults; the chief complaint I have is that the AI loves to spawn little armies that wreck a little havok in your lands but offer little challenge in a pitched battle. The campaign AI is worse as its diplomacy is still vague. Strangely, though the AI offers a good challenge in hard or higher setting, its predictability in patterns of attack and consolidation of its forces cheapens my sense of accomplishment. It would have added a little flavor and attention to detail if an enemy general with a supposed penchance for cavalry rush do so rush me its cavalry reserve as a coup de main. The enemy agents are OK and add a little unknown factor that adds immersion into the game. But I digress...\nThis game is best enjoyed with your friends. A match with friends or even strangers will give you that added flavor and quirks that make you come back for more. The Shogun 2 community is good, and often welcoming to new players willing to listen to veteran gamers.\nLong story short, what you find lacking in the singleplayer campaign you will get in the multiplayer.","October 1, 2012","true","187.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

No more. There are flaws, but the game gets almost all aspects that made the Total War series into what it is and executes them in an almost perfect harmony. You start controlling a Daimyo in the Sengoku Jidai era of Feudal Japan and is up to you to make your way trough rivals, missionaries, rebellions and even the Shogun itself to bexome the Supreme ruler of Japan.\n\nNow why is this game so good?\n\nBecause it is the epitome of polish, everything seems to flow naturally, like the stream of a river. The strategic map is very well done, it creates chokepoints and natural obstacles so you will nedd to fight certain enemies to control vital regions, which also makes for excellent defensive positions to hold. There are three types of agents( actually 5 if you include Geisha and the portuguese Missionary), and their rock-paper-scissor way of interacting is perfect. The Ninja is perfect for infiltration, sabotage and assassination, and excels at eliminating Monks. Beware of the Metsuke, they may buy off your Generals, kill Ninjas and bribe settlements. The Monk may seem harmless at first, but leave one alone and you may have a full rebellion deep inside your territory, and that can be your downfall.\n\nUnfortunatelly not everything is perfect, as the map design tends to promote siege battles regularly, and sometimes agents fail much more than they succeed. Fortunatelly, having a level 6 agent means you have a BIG advantage over your opponents( level 6 ninja and their generals will fall one after the another like maple leaves on Autumn).\n\nNow the battles.... What can I say regarding them that anybody else hasn't said better than I? I can only say that even after 900 hours of gameplay  leading your Samurai while they charge shouting 'Banzai' still gives me goose bumps. Units are very disciplined and will often fight to the death of you have a powerful general and high morale, which enables Epic Last Stand situations. Siege Battles may become tiresome, but are very good nonetheless, because they are sometimes quite challenging, for example, try taking Kyoto without Two full-stack armies to see what happens, specially at hard at very hard.\n\nThere sooooo many things to talk about this game, but if you want to know what I'm talking about, simply play and you'll see.All things considered, BUY this game.\n\nThis game is a "glorious victory my lord!", and not a "shameful display"\n\n","September 4, 2015","true","037.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Along with the campaign, which is great fun. The multiplayer is a massive improvement, there's coop campaign and avatar conquest; which is where you create your own general and army, and battle other players either in custom battles or for territories in Japan.\n\nIf you're a Total War fan don't hesitate in getting this game, the same can be said to anyone else who is interested in a good strategy game.","January 10, 2014","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The difficulty in learning what unit does what, and how each operate was a very difficult task, but learning to overcome that uncertainty pushed Shogun 2 into a limelight that it's easier predecessor (Empire) held.\n\nShogun 2 provides a mixture of well-designed characters with extremely detailed animations into deadly historical war. In true Total War fashion, just having superior numbers and "zerging" an enemy unit does not always win. It's the proper use of the right "tool" to do the job that prevails here.\n\nIt does take a LOT to get used to, and it takes awhile to get into the "swing" of things, but give it enough time and you will be stroking your chin in thought as you effectively play your real-time chess against an opponent that already knows your army better than you do.","August 18, 2011","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These games are exceptional to say the least.  SHOGUN 2 is probably my favorite out of the franchise thus far.  The ease of map and town navigation make the game simple to jump into if you've played any of the previous Total War games.  If you haven't, the overwhelmingly helpfull "advisors" will get you through the early stages of the game rather quickly and efficiently.\n\nWhat's good:\n- Graphics are smooth and quite detailed even when you zoom way in on units\n- Map control is crisp and easy to manage\n- Naval battles are easy to get a handle on after a few battles\n- The technology trees are easy to understand and plan out\n- It's easy to jump right in and play\n\nWhat's not so good:\n- Understanding what each building does or chains to easily (it took me a few games to get it right)\n- Not knowing what building to make keeps you from getting the right units as early as you can in the game.\n- The time table to win the short campain is VERY challenging\n- Takeda clan never wants to trade with me....... WTH Takeda!?!?!\n- There always seems to be SOMETHING that makes your Dynamo dishonorable, and everyone hates that.\n- some diplomatic solutions just plain don't work, I've tried to give children away as hostages so many times, nobody want's my kids!  they must all be brats.....\n\nAll in all I love this game.  I've played it a bunch just solo.  I can't vouch for any online play however so those experiences may vary.  I hope you pick this game up and check it out.  Enjoy!\n","February 16, 2014","true","76.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Take a seat and hear me fellow Samurai!\nYea.... kinda over the top opening line.. But! Back to the topic!\nI was always intrigued about Asian warfare,especially Japan and its samurai.\nTotal War:SHOGUN 2 was the game that came before ROME 2 to the TW series known for their turn based campaign and real time-chess like battles.\nShogun 2 is set durning 3 crusial time periods of Japan's history (well,one if you don't buy the DLCs...):1) Sengoku Jidai (The age of the warring states) set at 1545 when most of Japan's notorious warlords were already alive and active.\n2)The Gempei war,set at 1175. This war is what caused the Shogun to be the main ruler of Japan and what made the empror who ruled until then a figurehead.\n3)The Boshin war,set at 1865,During this war,Japan yet again fought itself to change the regime,this time the empror wins. This war also marks Japan's massive modernazetion which will lead her to be a superpower eventually,but not all are happy with this and some tradition-loving Samurai will revolt and try to take matters into their own hands (Sheesh... sounds like Mea Shearim on an asian grand scale...)\nNow enough with history lesson! (if you wanna know more just go to wikipedia or somthin'... thats what I did... and somehow got hooked on anime in the prosess...) Lets talk about the game!\n\nGameplay\nEven for an unexpirienced player to the series (which I was when I bought it) learning the controls is easy as they give you a well directed tutorial on every aspect of the game.\nThe AI might be a bit annoying (waiting on the highest hill,setting tax rate on extreme and not getting any rebellions,betray you when you can clearly crush their arses,etc) but it is still quite well made,still,if they grind your gears,there are many wonderful mods on the community's site: twcenter.net which change gameplay for the better (some are even setting the game on different timeframes if you ever get bored with the main campaigns).\n\nGraphics\nFrom my limited japanese: kire desu! Or,the game is looking f***ing beautiful! (well if your computer can run it on med-high settings and up... I seriously upgraded my rig just so I can see those tiny asians kill each other without the game moving slow! But thats just me,and if you'll know me,you will see I'm bloody wierd!).\nGraphics look amazing! both on the battlefield and the campaign map. If you close up durning a battle, you will see samurai and ashigaru fighting to the death,on the campaign map you can see clouds around mount Fuji,seagulls flying above ports and your generals (who used all their movement points) sitting on a stool with your clans flag in hand and relaxing (or taking a crap,they do sit like they are...). If you zoom on a unit that's been hit by a volly of arrows (considering they are not naginata or bulletproof samurais) you will see that some men will instantly die with 2-3 arrows stuck in them while some others will roll around in pain with the arrow stuck in their body (I'm pretty sure an arrow to the knee won't kill you instatly... we have the guards from Skyrim to justify this!). There is much to say about the graphics but its better for you to see everything yourselves,after all,a picture is worth a thousand words!\n\nSound\nThe game sounds wonderful! When on the campaign map,a calm tune will be herd,changing from turn to turn to have the feeling of the season's changing. A tentious music will be herd during a realtime battle,until the two armies clash and the tune will become glorified and brutal to mark the horrors and beauty of war at the same time.\nAs for the voices,in Japanese they sound amazing,the commander of the unit will respond to every command you give them as they should (they will shout "kogeki!" when you order them to attack and "zenshin!" when ordered to advance,I ain't gonna explain to ya what his words mean! use your logic,or google translate if you are in dire situation!),that massive "hai!" a unit shouts after the commander always makes me smile.\nOn the campaign map,everyone of your figures will call you "dono" or lord in japanese and will always jabber something after you order them to do something (as I said,my japanese is LIMITED,very!),too bad the voices in english don't sound as authentic as the japanese ones as most of the accents sound very forced (and all the VA's of the game are japanese,kinda wierd...),but,at least it can make you laugh a little.\nI forgot to talk about the speeches a general makes before battle,but they are getting annoying and repeatable after a short while so I'll leave that aside.\n\nMultiplayer\nAlthough Rome 2 came out not a long time ago,there are still many honorable samurai lords who have'nt abandoned 16th centuary Japan for Roman europe!\nMultiplayer has two sections: online battles and multiplayer campaigns.\nOn multiplayer campaing I don't have much to say aside from that you can play with a friend and conquer Japan together (or fight against each other for control). I haven't tried this so I won't speak aout what I do not know.\nOnline battles is realy where Shogun 2 differs from other Total War games:It is the only game on which there is a dynamic campaign-You start with costumizing your own general (other TW games doesn't have these feature aswell which is a shame...). During the battle,if you zoom on your general you will see that he looks like you cotumized him! same goes for enemy generals!,As time passes you willl earn more costumisable armor for your general.\nAfter a battle,the game will suggest to make the unit that earned most expirience to become a veteran-veteran units are also costumizable,but,the most important thing about them is that the veteran unit can enhance their skills (as you desire) to make them better,but more costly! After your general fights enough battles he will rank up and earn skill points which will help him enhance his skills as well.\nOne of the most important things on mp is to join a clan ASAP! after every victory you will earn clan tokens which will unlock further abilities for your veterans,to do so,simply click on a clan name,or look for a Shogun 2 group,go to the clans panell and click "mark this group as my clan" or something like that,there are clans that will only accept proven players but most will accept you with no conditions,one clan for example is "HeirOfCarthage Fans",or,if you wanna,send me a message and we can start a clan together and rule over Japan!\nBeaware though! Most of the players are pretty expirienced in the game and the matchmaking system will usually throw you with whatever they find,even if it means a 10 star gold player! So you might have a rough beggining but after a while,I'm sure you will master the art of war in Shogun 2! So I'll say for ya-gammbatte!\nAnyways,if you consider buying this game,I don't see any reason why not! It is the most refind TW game at the moment and many still play it and generally,don't buy this only if you hate strategy games,it has both guns and swords for your pleasure (empire/napoleaon and rome combined) and is a very good game.\nSo if you somehow made it to the end of this review (and didn't skip right to the end like we Israelies usually do) all I have to say is thank you for reading this! arigatou and sayonara!\n\nP.S\nIf you found anything in this review offensive (like those dots...) I had no intention to insult you! Its just my stupid humor! Thats all!","March 3, 2014","true","642.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Japan is, of course, not as big as some of the other places Total War games take place in (see Rome 2 huge map) but it doesnt feel small, and the relationships with other clans in the campaign map can make or break you, also there is a wild card called Kyoto that can crush you early on if you make them mad, and eventually you can capture it. The fighting is also very interesting, and I would actually recommend the blood DLC because sometimes you will want to zoom in on the 1v1s the unit AI automatically go to, put on the slow motion mode, and watch a display of skill samurai versus samurai, or a charge of ashigaru and see people get impaled and lifted off their feet. Unlike the other Total War games, this one doesnt have sheilds. You may have mixed feelings about this, but ultimately it just means ranged is more effective and strategy for this game must usually be done differently. The maps have a lot of terrain you can take advantage of, so that's a plus that replaces sheilds if used correctly. If you are not a fan of the artillery in other Total War games, there is very little of it used in this game, unless you get FotS because then you pretty much bought a game based on gunpowder.\n\nThe multiplayer is more fun than the traditional; choose units, fight. In Shogun 2 you pick your army, after some time playing, from veterans that you have leveled up, that have their own skill branch and that you can specialize to fit specific needs and change the color of their uniforms (my entire army is pink), including your avater (general (mine is pink)) who can specialize in swordsmanship, bows, or just being a commander. There are also buffs and debuffs, and more units you can gain and use in multiplayer through a small slightly interactable map of Japan. This kind of multiplayer certainly isnt for people who hate investing time or getting slightly wrecked at lower levels because the veteran system/buffs allows higher ranking or people who have spent more time to have a large amount of veterans. You may also be discouraged by the FotS players if you play the traditional style Japanese units, which I do. I learned just to suck it up and adapt my tactics.\n\nI find it hard to say bad things about this game, and it is probably for you if you like other Total War games.","November 18, 2014","true","330.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Indeed you get an avatar that get experience, levels, points and armor pieces that allow you to get stronger units and bonus, but also less money for your army, but that mean you dont start with the same army than your opponents, in contrary to other total war games, and it seems creative assembly will keep these things for the next ones (not sure, due to some steam petitions from total war players - you can still play unranked classic battles). Except that, shogun2 offer nice siege battles, with tough fort and less money for defense, where empire and napoleon missed it : on these 2 games, defense is as strong as attack, but as forts are undefendable, then the game become a standard land battle. All works fine on shogun2, you get land, sea (less epic than in empire and napoleon) battles and solo, multi campaign. empire/napoleon and shogun2 have quite different atmosphere. Large battle due to artillery on empire/napoleon whereas large mellee on shogun2. The extension Fall of the samurais is playable inside the vanilla game, land battles should look like empire/napoleon battles, but have a different feeling and way of playing. Naval battles are epic at start, but lack in number of ship after a while.","August 16, 2013","true","436.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No more. There are flaws, but the game gets almost all aspects that made the Total War series into what it is and executes them in an almost perfect harmony. You start controlling a Daimyo in the Sengoku Jidai era of Feudal Japan and is up to you to make your way trough rivals, missionaries, rebellions and even the Shogun itself to bexome the Supreme ruler of Japan.\n\nNow why is this game so good?\n\nBecause it is the epitome of polish, everything seems to flow naturally, like the stream of a river. The strategic map is very well done, it creates chokepoints and natural obstacles so you will nedd to fight certain enemies to control vital regions, which also makes for excellent defensive positions to hold. There are three types of agents( actually 5 if you include Geisha and the portuguese Missionary), and their rock-paper-scissor way of interacting is perfect. The Ninja is perfect for infiltration, sabotage and assassination, and excels at eliminating Monks. Beware of the Metsuke, they may buy off your Generals, kill Ninjas and bribe settlements. The Monk may seem harmless at first, but leave one alone and you may have a full rebellion deep inside your territory, and that can be your downfall.\n\nUnfortunatelly not everything is perfect, as the map design tends to promote siege battles regularly, and sometimes agents fail much more than they succeed. Fortunatelly, having a level 6 agent means you have a BIG advantage over your opponents( level 6 ninja and their generals will fall one after the another like maple leaves on Autumn).\n\nNow the battles.... What can I say regarding them that anybody else hasn't said better than I? I can only say that even after 900 hours of gameplay  leading your Samurai while they charge shouting 'Banzai' still gives me goose bumps. Units are very disciplined and will often fight to the death of you have a powerful general and high morale, which enables Epic Last Stand situations. Siege Battles may become tiresome, but are very good nonetheless, because they are sometimes quite challenging, for example, try taking Kyoto without Two full-stack armies to see what happens, specially at hard at very hard.\n\nThere sooooo many things to talk about this game, but if you want to know what I'm talking about, simply play and you'll see.All things considered, BUY this game.\n\nThis game is a "glorious victory my lord!", and not a "shameful display"\n\n","September 4, 2015","true","037.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I will split the following review into three parts starting with G, graphics, gameplay and godly awesome animations.\n\nGraphics.\nThis game is simply beautiful. The highly detailed distance scaling units and landscape add so much to the game visually. It looks very fitting into the time period of which it is set. Other details such as falling cherry blossom flowers on the battlefield make the game's atmosphere very appealing and genuine. Although the rediculous blood effects may turn you to believe it is bad exagguration, it honestly reminds you of good samurai movies with similar effects. These small details make the game so much more fantastic.\n\nGameplay.\nTotal War: SHOGUN 2 has an easy to understand "food chain" of units.\nSpear beats cavalry, cavalry beats bows, bows beat swords and swords beat spears.\nThis is the core of the game, however other units are thrown in as well to make it more exciting. These include matchlock units, which are basically short range gun units effective at murdering everything on the battlefield. You might think at first these are overpowered, but just like everything else in the game it has a weakness. Other missile units because of it's low range.\nAnother example are kisho units such as ninjas who can hide on the battlefield while moving slowly or sitting idle. These units are usually weak to cavalry and missiles, so they are best at engaging melee infantry units from the flanks using their special abilities such as grenades.\n\nRetainer cards are special, well.... cards, that you can choose a limited number of to play for a battle. These retainer cards can give bonuses to your units such as +2 melee attack to all sword infantry or hinder your opponent's army with cards such as -10 ammunition for enemy bow units.\n\nThe main multiplayer mode is called avatar conquest, where you create your own general and build his skills and army using veteran units, which are experienced soldiers that you can upgrade and keep in your reserve. In avatar conquest you are given a map of Japan on which you move your general across to capture provences. Each time you win a multiplayer battle you will unlock the provence you are currently standing on, which may reward you with a new specific unit or retainer card.\n\nFinally we have god damn animations.\nThe animations in this game are fantastic. Using motion capture technologies Creative Assembly was able to create some of the most beautiful animations I have seen in a video game. From decapitations to complete entry and exit of a weapon through a man's chest, these animations happen in 1 vs 1 duels in the middle of a battlefield surrounded by other units who are also doing the same. The clipping in this game is barely noticable unless you are really looking in a high clipping scenario such as when a unit of yours moves through another unit of yours. The detail of the animations are fantastic and inserted EVERYWHERE. Interestingly there are highly detailed animations for men climbing walls, throwing flaming kindling and even firing and reloading seige weapons. Simply well done Creative Assembly, if I wore hats I would take mine off.\n\nSo, well done on reading this entire review. What are you doing? Honestly? Get out there and murder some fools!","April 25, 2015","true","273.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fitzydarksouls/recommended/34330/","Fitzydarksouls","Fitzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fitzydarksouls/","102 products in account","This game is a perfect example of a total war game done right. The game feels very polished wether that be the sleak graphics in battle, agent videos, or the neat menus and tabs on the campaign map,  everything comes together very nicely. Unlike most previous games in the series, the campaign ai is aggressive and can easily end your campaign prematurely if you make to many enemies or neglect diplomacy which is a welcome change.\n\nDiplomacy has been improved greatly with the campaign ai generally making sensible decisions( e.g. they will usually accept any terms when close to being destroyed, allies will often offer money to assist them in wars, or offer to assist you in wars in exchange for helping them in their own)Allies  are easily the most reliable in the series and will normally not backstab you unless you are allied with a trechorous clan, have become weak and failed to maintain good relations, or triggered realm divide(more on this later) , and have even occasionally send troops to help you in battles which is a refresing change.\n\nThe co-op or versus campaigns(when no connection issues are present) are a complete blast, cordinating attacks with your friends and building your empires together is satisfying and a very enjoyable experience. While it is unrealistic that you will both have armies in every battle, it is possible to give friends in the campaign units under your control in both the campaign, and on the battlefield allowing participation in eachothers battles, regardless of faction and distance from one another.\n\nNow that we have spoken about what is good about the game, I will now discuss the main problems, the battlefield ai is hit and miss. Sometimes the ai catches you by surprise  with clever use of flanking, or whittling you down with massed archers when it has missle superiorty, on the flip side the ai is prone to getting careless with it's generals, or playing far to passively on defense allowing players to take the initiave. It's most noticablely bad in sieges, where it often deploys it's troops akwardly allowing them to be dealt with easily( e.g. leaving it's archers completely undefended) and will climb the walls every time, even if a gate to the castle is wide open, causing their troops to take uneccessary casualties and morale loss. Unfortunatly though bad ai is nothing new to the total war series and  may stay this way for quite some time, however if this concerns you you may opt to allow a random player to take control of the ai armies on the campaign map to offer a (usually)greater challenge.\n\nA lot of people are uhappy about the lack of variety in the clans, while each one has it's own unique specialty, and often gets a more powerful and cheaper, variant of a certain unit type, they do all use the same units(dlcs add some unique units to each faction, as well as one or two factions with many different units) although personally this doesn't bother me to much as playing to the factions specialty allows each clan to play differently offering a unique playthrough each campaign.\n\nFinally one of the biggest issues in shogun 2 is realm devide, this mechanic happens late in the game when you take enough provinces. This causes the shogun to fear your power and declare you a enemy of the state, the result is diplomacy is thrown out the window, and inevitably all factions will declare war on you, including your allies. This mechanic is not implemted well and can often feel unfair, although mods can change the way realm devide works allowing you to easily keep your allies and friends after realm devide allowing for a much more enjoyable experience.\n\n\nSome people may feel intimited by the setting of the game or the flaws that i have outlined, but i can't stress enough that this game is a easily among the top total war games in the series, and in my opinion is vastly superior to it's successor rome 2. There are ways to deal with most of the games flaws which i have outlined above allowing you to take full advantage of the many great features CA nailed when making this game.\n\nWether you are a total war fan that has not purchased shogun 2, or someone who is interested in the franchise or strategy games in general, i can't recommend this game enough.\n\nTL:DR The game is polished and has some of the best diplomacy/battles in the series, multiplayer is fun and addictive while it does have some issues(siege ai/realm devide and a lack of variety) it's in my opinion well worth the price.","October 17, 2014","true","458.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall audio and visuals are breathe-taking (comparable to much newer AAA games). Don't be fooled, this game can still give your PC a run for its money especially on ultra settings with multiple AI's in the mix. I strongly recommend getting this game in a bundle with the standalone expansion (Fall of The Samurai) and the other existing DLCs. It is also VERY replayable and will always be great value for your money.

I have to say, that original Rome was my personal favourite for a long time... because I was so damn good in it. I also hated Medieval 2, because its diplomacy made no sense (to me) and I got my bottom rammed every time I tried it. So... Shogun 2?\n\nOverviewTotal War: Shogun 2 is strategy game, mixing turn-based strategy, economy and army movements in campaign map, and real-time strategy in battles.\nIn campaign map you control and move your troops around the map, improve cities with new buildings or upgrading old ones and of course making diplomatic decisions for or against your enemies. In my oppinion, the campaign map is where you actually play the game and you can, if you want to, skip all battles by using "autofight" option. Focussing only in the campaign map and its varieties will take, on its own, a great deal of time and demands that you actually think what you want to do and how and by what expenses. Luckily, the game has inbuild wiki/guide that helps in most of your question.\nIn battles you control your armies of sometimes thousands of troops and, hopefully, win. Game has fair amount of different troop types that support each others. Your job is to forge an army that conquers any foe and you feel good to battle with.\n\nCons*If you've ever played any Total War, you know how this works. And yes, that is a bad thing. Even if they have come a long way in 11 years from Shogun to Shogun 2, it is still Total War.\n*The Shogun 2's diplomacy, however, is quite frustrating and a mod to fix it is highly recommended. You can make vassal states, you can forge strong relations by marriage and all other sort of stuff, however, when you conquer Kyoto, everyone starts to hate you. Everyone. Even that family, who has traded three daughters for your leader's sons and vice versa. When the "Realm Divide" triggers, all other factions declare war on you and if not well prepared... you will get your ♥♥♥♥ rammed.\n*I'm not really sure, because some reviews say that this game has absolutely too hard difficulties. I on the other hand have had no trouble at all with the game and would like to note, that it is maybe a bit too easy in at least normal difficulty. Especially in battles if you allow yourself to pause the game, it becomes really easy and to massacre the enemy army of thousand spears stronger than yours, is not a big deal at all.\n*Special clans as DLC? Special units as DLC?\n\nPros*Moving your units in battle is fluent (as it should) and makes the RTS part of the game quite enjoyable.\n*Big map, many routes, many enemies, many friends. The campaign part is good, way better than in any other Total War,  which makes the game interesting even without a single battle. To keep up your economy up and running requires some attention, which is good, things won't happen on itself\n*Varying generals who can be specialised into roles you want them to do on battlefield\n*Steam Workshop. Because... if something is bothering you, you can get rid of it. Enabling mods and modding community is always a good thing\n*Graphics and sounds are amazing (excluding the English in Japanese accent), music is good\n\nConclusionIn overall, the game is by far the best Total War so far, I don't own, but I've seen and tested the Rome2 and I can say that this rivals it totally. Comparing Shogun 2 to some old nostalgic games like Shogun, Rome, Medieval, Medieval 2 or more "recent" Empire or Napoleon is unneccessary. Shogun 2 gives you the feeling of Sengoku Jidai and the chaos and rivalry in late feudal Japan. If you enjoy more, lets say, story of Medieval Europe or some other setting, I'm sure tyou'll enjoy those games too, or more. But in gameplay and looks this game is teh best.\n\nMe being one who preordered this back in 2011, I can say that I have not been disappointed and that that 30€ is not too much for this game.","October 15, 2014","true","114.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The different ship models are also great during sea battles. The music and sounds add to the atmosphere and are very good as well.\n\nThe controls are not too difficult to grasp and the in-game tutorial/advisor is very helpful in orienting new players to the game/series. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are not familiar with the Total War series (or RTS-games in general).\n\nGameplay occurs in two-fold: first, you move your armies around in the main map and build your structures/defenses. After that turn phase, if any battles need to resolve, you will go into the battle screen (unless you decide to autoresolve). Here, you can deploy your units and then begin combat when you are ready. Night battles are very fun, and sieges are awesome to watch if you field a large number of archers and/or siege weapons. You can storm castles by scaling the walls as well.\n\nDiplomacy in this game is fleshed-out very well - your reputation will affect how other leaders respond to you (have a history of betraying your allies and other leaders will be more hesitant to enter negotations with you). Establishing trade agreements with your neighbors can help increase their disposition towards you.\n\nThe special units like the spy or general (increases army training while in the field) are very useful, and you can level up most units and pick skills for them. The research tree is essential to ensuring that you are on an even playing field with your opponents technologically - fall too behind and they will not only field larger armies, but also have them outfitted with more superior equipment.\n\nThe game (and series) is an absolutely amazing staple of the RTS-genre and you must give it a try if you are interested at all.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 30, 2014","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW HAPPY I AM THAT CA FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT AGAIN! So, let's step off my joy and get down to brass tacks. First off, the good.\nThe setting was a home run for CA, finally bringing back the Samurai origins of the original Total War: Shogun. Take control of various Clans across Japan in the Sengoku-jidai, to claim the title of supreme Shogun, military leader of all of Japan. The thing that is crucial for this is the campaign map, which is easy to learn how to use and the new graphics set by the game are stunning.\n\nThe battle AI still needs some improvement, but it is far better than Napoleon, and let's not mention Empire. I can actually have a hard time battling an army outnumbered 3 to 1, but it is easy to win if you have the altidude advantage. Shogun 2 brings back tactical thinking and how to respond to real charges, rather than just line infantry warfare from Empire and Napoleon.\n\nAs of me, I am Takeda Shingen, Daimyo of the Takeda clan. I proved history wrong by denying the Oda of their title as Shogun, and had created numerous triumphs in the Kyushu peninsula, as well as reclaiming the Imperial Capital, Kyoto, for myself. The Uesugi scourge is no longer a threat, as i had slain Uesugi Kenshin in the grandest battle.\n\nThe thing i love about the total war Series, and I mentioned this in my Napoleon walkthrough is that the Immersion is something that CA always gets right. I was actually feeling like a 16th century Japanese Warlord while charging my Katana cavalry straight into the enemy General.\n\nAnd not to mention, the agent feature is new and improved. Gaishas? Ninjas? HELL YEAH! There isn't a better feelign than to killing an enemy general in his sleep, or killing 3 japanese generals while posing as a sultry maiden of the night. Let's not mention the rest.\n\nThe bad is almost not there; I had no problems while playing my Takeda campaign. It was smooth, immersive, and most of all, fun. This is what i had been waiting for for 4 years, and i'm really glad CA finally delivered. It's a shame that they gave most of the attention to this, not the even more anticipated Rome II. *sigh*. But I digress, let us go to the final verdict.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9.5 out of 10. You guys might wonder why i gave it a 9.5 and not a 10, because of how I boasted it, but it still doesn't achieve the perfection that was Rome. I know that this might sound biased, but I am serious. This game is the pinnacle of CA comebacks, but the same can't be said for Rome II.\n\nClosing up, I have one final thing to say to you: GET THIS GAME NAO, NOT HAVING IT IS A DISHONOR FOR UR FAMIRY!\n\nSHAMFUR DISPRAY!","August 31, 2012","true","79.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At the time I wrote this review, I must've invested a good 20-30 hours in this game already, only 9 days after recieving it.\n\nThe main problem I find with most Total Wars (Mainly the ones before Empire) is how complicated it can be, both in battle and the campaign map. Shogun 2 isn't very complicated at all, and it's quite simple and easy to play. You could say it's optimised for a Human's CPU lol. At the same time, the gameplay in both campaign and battle is epic. Despite all being in their same Japanese cultures, the clans have different units and advantages, without ruining the atmosphere of the game, and that, I'm pretty impressed with.\n\nFor example, the Otomo clan are great with matchlocks, whether it's recruiting them, or firing them; So this makes up for the fact the Otomo isn't well liked due to being Catholic. The Shimazu clan are well known for their mastery of melee combat; And for a simple player like me who relies more on the skill of their soldiers rather than their strategic minds, that's pretty awesome.\n\nA tactic I commonly use is matchlocks at the front, bows behind the matchlocks, and infantry behind the bows (And obviously, heavy cavalry at the flanks). This way, both the bows and matchlocks can unleash devastation on the enemy, and when they get too close, I tell my matchlocks and bows to pull back and my infantry to charge. And obviously, if they try to flank me, I'll just run them down with the cavalry.\n\nThe campaign is pretty damn awesome too. Everything from the diplomacy, to the technological tree, to the city and army management, it's really well made in my opinion. Honour is also taken much more seriously in Japan as well. I wouldn't recommend sacking or razing cities, or any other dishonourable actions, no matter how raging you are because you were betrayed. The thing is, horrendous actions like that lowers your Daimyo's (Faction Leader) honour significantly, and this causes many problems, such as relations being strained with other clans, even if they're your allies. Your subjects and generals will take a disliking to you and become less loyal.\n\nShogun 2 has alright graphics, and runs pretty smoothly most of the time. But I suppose it all depends on what computer you have. Shogun 2 runs on pretty high settings smoothly enough for me though.\n\nAside from the gameplay, I really love the atmosphere of the game itself. The soundtrack reflecting the bloody and terrifying times of the sengoku jidai period in Japan. Especially during battles, the soundtrack gets a bit scary. It just makes you think about how terrified the soldiers must've been, because not all of them were samurai just wanting to die, a lot of them were just civilians levied into the army.\n\nI love both Total War and Japanese history, that's why I love this game. If you love Total War and Japanese history, then I would definitely recommend this game.","April 17","true","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is of course frustrating to purchase a new game only to have to wait many, many hours for it to download, but we must accept that the era of disc based gaming is coming to a close and the more cost effective method of direct downloads from the net will dominate the coming decades of gaming. To clarify, I agree that waiting long download times SUCKS completely, but it would be ridiculous to pan a game based on such a development as many fans of the Total War series have seem to of done.\n\nNow that aspect has been discussed, we can focus on the gameplay itself. This is a stripped down, back to basics Total War experience, doing away the global theatres of Empire: Total War and also the multiple trade continents that spanned the earth. This far more manageable, niche setting of Shogunate Japan provides an authentic, raw and beautifully brutal backdrop for the Total War series, enhancing the original Shogun instalment and roaring it into the modern era. The aesthetics of the game, the soundtrack, images and unit appearances, all feel genuine and carefully crafted. We truly feel part of the period.\n\nAlthough Japan does not provide the largest of operating theatres for multiple warring factions, this adds to the relentless feel of warfare during this period, as you will be vying for provinces constantly changing hands, battling for strategic strong points. The politics of Empire have been done away with and trade simplified, many will point towards a sense of ‘dumbing down’, but I would argue the developers have changed the game effectively based on the period. Politics, trade theatres and revolution suits Renaissance colonies perfectly, yet by slightly simplifying this edition of Total War we are fully focused on the aspects that made gamers fall in love with the original games, warfare. Battles are large, numerous and chaotic, while the graphics and sounds are Total War at its atmospheric best.\n\nAs your clan develops (which it will through a streamlined technology tree) you will gain access to powerful units that feel powerful, that you can use effectively in battle. You will also have to choose between foreign temptations and domestic devotion, choosing to gain new weapons and religions from the West or choose to remain loyal to Japans heritage. Both options have their advantages and bring diversity to the gameplay and also provides an historically accurate backdrop. Options for choices such as these are not as numerous as we may like them to be, but they do at least convey the sense that we are head of a powerful clan.\n\nDiplomacy is still far from perfect, however Shogun 2’s diplomacy has the fewest faults as opposed to previous instalments. Clans will still turn on you despite alliances and military access can be cancelled at a moments notice for no apparent reason. It would be a welcomed edition to include many more options in the diplomatic relations panel helping to add depth to the diplomatic process, which hopefully we will see in future editions of Total War.\n\nUnit types are accurate yet they are not as diverse as previous games. Rome: Total War provided such a high standard of diverse unit type that every game since then has not quite matched it for its unit variety. Most clans have the exact same unit types with only skill bonuses based on clan type that fully distinguish them. Although this may be partly due to the time period, it means that replayability is not quite as enjoyable as many of the clans feel the same. That being said, many hours of gameplay are still available here, its only the miscellany of the hours that is an issue.\n\nSea battles are far more engaging than in Empire, yet withmedieval Japanese warships, the battles were always going to be limited in excitability. They don’t pack the punch that naval battles had in Empire, but they are easier to control and maintain which is an essential plus during large scale battles. They look fantastic however, becoming a staple of the Total War genre. Generals can now gain experience through such sea battles, allowing you to improve certain traits of your commanders  in a basic RPG element that works in tangent with the main game seamlessly.\n\nShogun 2 goes back to what made the original games fantastic. Fast, ferocious and tactical battles supplemented by strategic considerations in the theatre of war. This is Total War back to its brilliant best. There are still issues with the game of course, many of which can be altered and changed through a certain DarthMod, however the vanilla game is still extremely playable. I would fully recommend.\n\nWhere should the series go next? Empire 2? Ancient China? The Great War? What are your thoughts on Shogun 2 and Rome 2? Any comments are welcome whether you agreed or disagreed with my review. I’ll be sure to reply to all comments when I can.

From the music and voices to the artwork, this is a very immersive game.  Combat animations give the most fluid and interesting (and brutal) portrayals of combat I've ever seen in a Total War game (haven't played Rome 2 yet though)\n\nThe main tutorial teaches most of what you need to know, such as how to use the campaign map, the basics of attacking, but I would strongly recommend searching for and studying battle tips on youtube (and there are plenty!).  Just remember: Spear beats horse, sword beats spear, horse beats sword, bow beats everything at distance, and everything beats bow up close, and keep your general safe and close.  Naval combat is the game's only weakness, as early on it feels like its just archer platforms shooting eachother.  You'll be desperate to upgrade and get ships with cannons to spice it up.\n\nJust don't do what I did on my nooby first try...expanding and recruiting too many too fast, running out of food and money, losing public order, and starting an early realm divide, A PERFECT NIGHTMARE  (It's actually pretty much common sense when governing the campaign map, so don't worry about stressful brainstorming on this)\n\nAll in all, this is a game every PC should have.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games or would like to get into RTS games.  I also strongly recommend it to RTS fans who have been on the fence over getting this game.  It's worth every cent.  (Don't forget Fall of the Samurai though, some people say it's even better than plain Shogun 2)","December 17, 2014","true","390.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a hybrid turn-based/RTS game.  While you are in the strategy map you must build and move armies, upgrade cities, manage family affairs, adjust tax rates, and open new trade routes in order to gain a strategic edge over your enemies and allies.  Once an army or navy engages another in combat it becomes a classic RTS game.  This game engine is CA's most stable, well-balanced engine out of the entire TW series.  If their Rome2 engine was even half as good as this one, then Rome2 wouldn't be such a piece of ♥♥♥♥.

From the campaign map you run your clan and make decisions regarding what is built in your lands, how much you tax those living under your rule, building your armies in a strategic Risk like manner, and in battles you have the chance to either auto-resolve or personally take command of the battle yourself, of the two options I highly recomend the latter.\n\nThe battles are large, epic and quite a sight to behold and the fact that you cant replenish troops mid battle means more focus on actual tactics rather than simple zerg rush style tactis. Plus there are few things more satisfying than overcoming a larger army through good strategy and tactics. The fact that you can zoom in for a close view of the clashes as they happen and the pre-battle speeches by your generals add to the feel and presentation of the real time battles and because of that it' all the more worth it to take control for yourself. Other things that add to it is your troops fatigue, the morale that is effected by the flow of the batle and the presence of the general and even weather condition that can help or hinder.\n\nThings are slower on the campaign map of course, much like chess thats where more than anything you will be thinking and planning, with your armies and agents being represented like game pieces on the map which you can move from place to place. Expanding, and growing is something that cant be rushed, or else you will be crushed under the weight of a clan that simply cannot be supported, whether it's because the army is simply so large it costs too much to maintain, food shortages across the land, or just large scale public unrest, it's better to be methodical and take it slow, picking the right moves for the right time. Diplomacy between clans has features not seen in other games that add to your immersion. Your clan's daimyo (ie: you) is not some disembodied presence giving orders, but an actual unit that is a powerful general, not only is he represented but also his family tree, with sons that will one day become generals, and take his place when he dies, daughters which can be useful in forming diplomatic ties to other clans and various other relatives. Another thing to keep an eye on is our generals and their loyalty, a disloyal general can turn on you and tke his troop with him so keeping them loyal is a good idea.  Aside from that there are the standards like trade agreements and alliances.\n\nOverall Shogun 2 is a must have for fans of the strategy genre.","November 30, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It fulfills that requirement and more. The campaigns can be tough, especially since you seem to be beset by enemies, and you have a limited amount of time to fulfill your ambition of ruling Japan. This is especially true if you are at the far end of Honshu and need to march all the way to Kyoto to secure the Shogunate.\n\nAnd that's just the base campaign. There is a Rise DLC which puts you in the same situation about 400 years before the base one. And then there is Fall, which adds a LOT of gunpowder weaponry and modern tactics, and deals with a short period that lead to the modernization of Japan (and indirectly to the Japanese Empire of WWII).\n\nThere is also a multiplayer game that can be fun, though challenging in a different way. As hard as the AI can be, other players are often craftier and less prone to being trampled underfoot by cavalry. And since those with Fall can use their weaponry it can sometimes lead to quality versus quantity matchups.","December 24, 2014","true","108.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

ROME 2 IS BUGGED SH!T.\n\nThe Shogun 2 campaign is awesome and challenging on legendary difficulty. Battles are a lot of fun with good AI, nice fighting animations and overall balanced when it comes to units, spear against horses, bows to pick off advancing foes and swords against infantry etc. The General system was my favourite part with this game. You can make your general into this living samurai buddha on the battlefield becoming your armies most powerful soldier if you dare to gamble and use him so or you can have the clan revere him as a living treasure raising morale, taxes and happiness with just his presence (recommended to use a nice mod to give your generals cooler portraits and its perfect).\n\nMultiplayer is cool, except for when they added Ashigarus (peasants) with swords and now the peasants can overcome the samurai even though samurais should dominate the battlefield.\n\nSome cons with the campaign is that you will have to go through a lot of sieges, every province has a castle and it does get annoying after a while climbing the walls of so many castles.\n\nFinally: Why could they not take all that was good with Shogun 2 and implement it into Rome 2?!?!","April 6, 2014","true","163.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

From the campaign map you run your clan and make decisions regarding what is built in your lands, how much you tax those living under your rule, building your armies in a strategic Risk like manner, and in battles you have the chance to either auto-resolve or personally take command of the battle yourself, of the two options I highly recomend the latter.\n\nThe battles are large, epic and quite a sight to behold and the fact that you cant replenish troops mid battle means more focus on actual tactics rather than simple zerg rush style tactis. Plus there are few things more satisfying than overcoming a larger army through good strategy and tactics. The fact that you can zoom in for a close view of the clashes as they happen and the pre-battle speeches by your generals add to the feel and presentation of the real time battles and because of that it' all the more worth it to take control for yourself. Other things that add to it is your troops fatigue, the morale that is effected by the flow of the batle and the presence of the general and even weather condition that can help or hinder.\n\nThings are slower on the campaign map of course, much like chess thats where more than anything you will be thinking and planning, with your armies and agents being represented like game pieces on the map which you can move from place to place. Expanding, and growing is something that cant be rushed, or else you will be crushed under the weight of a clan that simply cannot be supported, whether it's because the army is simply so large it costs too much to maintain, food shortages across the land, or just large scale public unrest, it's better to be methodical and take it slow, picking the right moves for the right time. Diplomacy between clans has features not seen in other games that add to your immersion. Your clan's daimyo (ie: you) is not some disembodied presence giving orders, but an actual unit that is a powerful general, not only is he represented but also his family tree, with sons that will one day become generals, and take his place when he dies, daughters which can be useful in forming diplomatic ties to other clans and various other relatives. Another thing to keep an eye on is our generals and their loyalty, a disloyal general can turn on you and tke his troop with him so keeping them loyal is a good idea.  Aside from that there are the standards like trade agreements and alliances.\n\nOverall Shogun 2 is a must have for fans of the strategy genre.","November 30, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The multiplayer is great, the campaign is great, the units are great and the varying factions are all great. Shogun 2 is the second version of the shogun series and one of the newer Total War games. It is unique in the use of its DLC to expand on the base game and features other great unique features that older Total War games lack. Now, although medieval Japan is not my variety historical period I loved the look of the game and got into lots of information about it before buying it finding it to be worth it. Sadly my system is not the best at running it but in playing it I've enjoyed it, especially the multiplayer for what I could run smoothly. With co-op systems, avatar general and army building combined with leaderboards that can be attributed to Steam groups the system is a great improvement to the Total War games before it. I personally stuck to the multiplayer for most of my playing period with the game unlike in previous games where I stuck to the single player nearly the whole time. Multiplayer alone would still make this game good. Unit choices are another really great aspect which works with the varying factions too. Their is even one on the president! I won't give you any clues on what its called though. The other great thing about the game not mentioned yet is the graphics. The general look of the game is great despite my poor specifications which shows that it is great beyond what I considered already good as higher specification computers will have an even better sight. To summarise the good points-\n\n- Improved multiplayer\n- Good DLC that works well improving on the base game\n- Great graphics\n- Interesting and varied number of units\n- Unique and original factions\n- Great Campaign\n- Great Historical battles with huge clashes and great explanations to them\n\nNow to the bad. The game is hard to run for me and since my system is alright I would say it may be an issue for some others out there. Lowering the quality of the game helps, but the single player can lose the nice look due to the game struggling. Also, from what I saw, the early mulitplayer battles are awful if you don't have riflemen as they are incredibly over-powered.  The DLC, although improving on what the game offers greatly is a bit unfair at times to those without it. Without DLC its hard to beat armies who have them and since most players have already got high in the rankings late entries may find the first ten to twenty matches a bit of a slaughter on them. I got some riflemen and soon found I was the one slaughtering others which became fun though, so it worked out! To summarise the bad points-\n\n- Over-powered DLC at times\n- Specification is slightly too high for some lower specified computers.\n\nSo the game is great despite its obsession with paying more on upgrades in and out of the game to make your experience more pleasing in combat I would easily score this game a 4/5, 8/10 or 80%. It shows Total War games to be improving in many aspects and is definetly a great strategy game overall.","March 9, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level of detail they put into the minute details are a HUGE improvement from the TWRome, which is the only other game I've played in the series.  The agents are much more involved, and you can tailor each agent to the type of skills you would need from them.  For instance you can have one ninja that is used for assassinating, and another that is just used for sabotage, developing their individual skill trees in those areas.  The trading system took some getting use to from TWR, but it's so much more competitive now.  The Navy plays an important role in this game, as opposed to TWR where I primarily used them to transport men, and the occasional blockade mission.  I have a buddy who to my knowledge has never played a game like this, but he has recently got into Clash of Clans, and I definitely want him to try this out if he likes that, this is on a whole other level.

The land battles are a ton of fun to play very good detailing. Although I was playing and found a glitch that in the starting city of Chosokabe there is a glitch where all the buildings cost 777 at a certain time. Yes, I would reccomend this to a friend for sure.

From the music and voices to the artwork, this is a very immersive game.  Combat animations give the most fluid and interesting (and brutal) portrayals of combat I've ever seen in a Total War game (haven't played Rome 2 yet though)\n\nThe main tutorial teaches most of what you need to know, such as how to use the campaign map, the basics of attacking, but I would strongly recommend searching for and studying battle tips on youtube (and there are plenty!).  Just remember: Spear beats horse, sword beats spear, horse beats sword, bow beats everything at distance, and everything beats bow up close, and keep your general safe and close.  Naval combat is the game's only weakness, as early on it feels like its just archer platforms shooting eachother.  You'll be desperate to upgrade and get ships with cannons to spice it up.\n\nJust don't do what I did on my nooby first try...expanding and recruiting too many too fast, running out of food and money, losing public order, and starting an early realm divide, A PERFECT NIGHTMARE  (It's actually pretty much common sense when governing the campaign map, so don't worry about stressful brainstorming on this)\n\nAll in all, this is a game every PC should have.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games or would like to get into RTS games.  I also strongly recommend it to RTS fans who have been on the fence over getting this game.  It's worth every cent.

ROME 2 IS BUGGED SH!T.\n\nThe Shogun 2 campaign is awesome and challenging on legendary difficulty. Battles are a lot of fun with good AI, nice fighting animations and overall balanced when it comes to units, spear against horses, bows to pick off advancing foes and swords against infantry etc. The General system was my favourite part with this game. You can make your general into this living samurai buddha on the battlefield becoming your armies most powerful soldier if you dare to gamble and use him so or you can have the clan revere him as a living treasure raising morale, taxes and happiness with just his presence (recommended to use a nice mod to give your generals cooler portraits and its perfect).\n\nMultiplayer is cool, except for when they added Ashigarus (peasants) with swords and now the peasants can overcome the samurai even though samurais should dominate the battlefield.\n\nSome cons with the campaign is that you will have to go through a lot of sieges, every province has a castle and it does get annoying after a while climbing the walls of so many castles.\n\nFinally: Why could they not take all that was good with Shogun 2 and implement it into Rome 2?!?!","April 6, 2014","true","163.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Although the game is seperated by two seperate products, "Shogun II" and "Shogun II Fall of the Samurai," it is impossible to enjoy the experience with solely one. The multiplayer mode "Avatar Conquest" was a novel addition that added an RPG element to the franchise that makes the player feel more connected to one's avatar.

Shogun 2 is a serious upgrade to the Total War franchise and for sure the best iteration so far.\n\nAt first the Sengoku Jidai historical period might seem confusing, with lots of names and places true to the Japanese medieval setting, but after some time the essence of TW games surfaces as strong as ever. The campaigns might get long but never boring.\n\nThe art and design is impeccably well presented, and the music is top-notch, even if somewhat repetitive when playing long sessions. The graphics are good and adaptable to a wide range of PCs. The interface is clear and beautiful, and I never encountered a glitch or bug in 70+ hours of gameplay.\n\nThe new mechanic of Realm Divide brings freshness and challenge to the stalled and/or boring mid-to-endgame, and is a very welcome feature that will divide the weak and inconsistent from the true strategists. The AI is really not that smart, and makes very illogical decisions---many times downright stupid---when playing the lower difficulties. The best experience comes playing on Hard and above, and of course the light RPG-like multiplayer avatar system.\n\nShogun 2 can entertain you for hours. With high replayability and infinite options, no campaign is ever the same. All DLC is worth having.\n\nIf you liked previous Total War games, this is a must own.

As it stands, the FoTS campaign covers a pretty interesting bit of history that I would otherwise not have known about/cared about/wanted to spend several hours reenacting. The artillery (historically accurately or not) is intensely overpowered. Although I can't decide whether this is good or bad, prepare yourself for an extreme, pinpoint-accurate gorefest as chunks of Japanese people fly all over your screen.

There is units for everything, there is some all-around units, but they arent so good in all fields as specialized ones. For example Katana-Samurais are better then Yari-Samurai in infantry combat, but fail against cavarly.\n\nAlso to add: Fall of the Samurai is very good expansion for this, nothing wins using Gatlings & Amstrong Guns against enemy spearmen.\n\nBanzai!","December 18, 2013","true","93.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played almost ALL the total war games and this is by FAR the best. You play one of the clans in japan and u must capture Kyoto and hold it to become the shogun.\n\nNow to the best bit of the game. the battles. First of the battles look amazing on high setting and still look prettu darn good on medium. The anommations on the infantry are amazing as they where motion captured by people who could use swords. The interface is the best and very easy to use.\n\nThe campaign map is also very good and easy to use. I found it very hard to find out how to build units and buildings in ther earlier games but in Shogun 2 it is so simple. You select the city u want to build something in. You go to the tab you want and u select the building or unit you want.\n\nIn summary this game is ♥♥♥♥ing epic and a must buy for all total war fans. One thing i must say is you need a quite good pc to run this game on mediuem to high settings and my old pc still struggled on low so make sure u can run the game before u buy it","July 5, 2014","true","143.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, here are some tips to give you the full experience:\n\nGet good sound system, preferably head phones, with great bass and depth. I swear I can feel an earthquake whenever I start a three thousand man charge and my enemy initiates a charge of the same scale.\n\n1080p is not bad, but I imagine a 4k monitor would be so much more noticable on a game like this compared to a FPS or RPG. Frankly, this is one of the few games where a 16k monitor would be worth the investment. Obviously, this is expensive and not necessary, I'm just making the point that in a battle involving 14000 men, it would be nice to see the whole battlefield\n\nThe AI is both incredibly smart and very stupid at the same time. For instance, during naval battles, if I was severely outmanned, I could play ring around the rosey around an island and watch their ships get caught on the island, where I can pick off the single ship that managed to keep up with me. On the other hand, and this really amazed me, the AI reciprocated this tactic against me. I had attacked an enemy fleet with brute force as I had an equal or superior fleet, and I set ablaze or otherwise forced surrender of all but one enemy ship. This ship then literally kited ME and very nearly picked off 2 or 3 of my ships. All the while, I was chasing him expecting him to make some stupid illogical AI mistake, and it never came. I noticed he was circling and it seemed he was not about to make a mistake, so I sent a ship infront of his path. They collided and he lost all his momentum, and then I was able to box him in and finally kill him.\n\nThe large scale land AI seems to be fine and doesn't act very different than I would. They tend to put archers on hills, and even try to redirect my melee force and make pockets where calvary is to be sent in to crush my archers. However, they tend to be impatient if they are on the offensive and put themselves in chokes that I've set up with the land around my armies. I don't suppose there was any way around that though, that was the only way to get to me and as my archers were at higher elevation he couldn't pick me off with his archers\n\nSmall scale AI, as in a unit by unit basis, could have room for upgrading.\n\nMy final thought: Great game to have and experience. Brings strategy to a whole new level","June 30, 2014","true","218.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

В роли даймё — лидера одной из враждующих группировок — игрок должен вести боевые действия, заниматься экономической политикой и вести дипломатическую игру, чтобы добиться главной цели игры: объединения феодальной Японии в единое государство под властью клана игрока.\n\nВ сухопутных сражениях игрок командует армией. Армия делится на отряды, максимальное число отрядов — двадцать. Каждое подразделение имеет свои преимущества, недостатки, стоимость обучения и общий уровень эффективности.\n\nПодразделения имеют определённый моральный уровень, который может увеличиваться, если битва проходит удачно, или уменьшаться при тяжелых потерях, гибели офицеров или в случае смерти генерала.\n\nОсады принимают в учёт архитектуру японских замков, которая отличается от своих европейских аналогов. Японские замки состоят из нескольких террас, окружённых стенами. Высота каждой террасы зависит от рельефа. В Shogun 2 нет нужды строить осадные машины, хотя в состав армии и могут входит мангонелы (катапульты) и европейские пушки, которые не могут перемещаться во время боя. Все пешие войска способны карабкаться по стенам во время штурма замка. Чтобы захватить замок совсем необязательно уничтожить всех защитников. Достаточно пробиться к центральному зданию и захватить его. Войска также могут поджечь замковые врата, чтобы иметь более прямой доступ в замок и позволить кавалерии вступить в бой с защитниками. Также, кавалерия может спешиться чтобы залезть на стены. Крепостные башни могут быть захвачены во время штурма, как и различные здания присутствующие за стенами замка. Например, захват фермы повышает выносливость армии в этой битве, тогда как захват додзё лучников пополняет запасы стрел и аммуниции.\n\nВ «Shogun 2» разработчики вернули подбадривающие речи генералов перед боем. Все речи — на японском с субтитрами. В ней по возможности максимально точно описывается ситуация: кто противник, количество обеих армий, честь вражеского даймё, качества своего клана, и т. п.\n\nЧтобы стать сёгуном, клану необходимо захватить и удержать Киото, а также необходимое количество провинций.","July 22, 2013","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games additional content is well above par. (rise of the samurai can be a little bland, but that is a personal opinion) and will provide even more entertainment for your money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/34330/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Easily the best Total War game since Rome and Medieval II (and it may be better than both of those), Shogun 2 takes the franchise back to where it began: Japan's Sengoku Era. You play as one of the great Daiymo lords struggling to unite the country. This is not the easiest of tasks, and it is one that inevitably involves a great deal of violence since ultimately there can only be one Shogun. Unlike previous TW games, once you reach a certain level of strength in the campaign, all of the other factions unite to fight against you, leading to an intense mid-late game. Since past TW games tended to get far too easy once you conquered enough, this is actually rather refreshing to see since it staves off boredom. Overall, the gameplay is similar to all other TW games, except here it is more polished, more focused, and altogether better than previous installments.\n\nIt also has a rather unique and well-designed multiplayer system which, while unfair at times if the matchmaker puts you up against vastly more experienced foes, at least manages to give a player reasons to keep playing it. I'm not sure if anyone still plays the multiplayer, but i'd hope so. Besides, i've been given to understand that Creative Assembly made a mess of Rome 2's multiplayer (among other things), so Shogun 2's is probably a superior experience.\n\nThere are flaws in this game though. The AI here is much better than in past TW games, but it still has its dummy moments. People who have crazy-good PC's may be irritated to find out that this game at its maximum settings might be too much for their computers to handle. The larger your empire gets the more micromanagement you have to do, which, although no different from previous TW games, still can be annoying for those who just want to fight the battles. Lastly there are bugs and crashes that, while not too frequent, are still frustrating when they happen.\n\nIf you have an interest in this franchise but have yet to try it out, Feudal Japan in general, or really just well-made games, then this is worth checking out.","December 28, 2013","true","229.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally got annoyed with the game, I don't really have the patience to learn all the nuances and it's easy to get quite a ways into the game before it becomes apparent that you made a fatal strategic mistake many turns earlier that you won't be able to recover from and either tough it out to the brutal end or start a new campaign.\n\nI know some people enjoy this type of gameplay and the mastering of it, but even on easy the AI can be quite aggressive in steamrolling you with a "stack of doom" army and the learning curve is pretty steep so you will have many failed starts before even getting close to victory. From reading online, apparently once you figure out the AI they're quite easy to beat, but due to the slow pace of this game that still requires many hours of time investment. This is the kind of game one can really get into which is great if you like it, but it is not very approachable for a more casual player.\n\nNot my thing, but the game is well done and has a lot of depth so I can still recommend it if you like grand strategy games.","November 18, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game shines in the battle sequences, where employing different tactics and strategies can give you the upper hand, even in battles that would otherwise be lost if auto-resolved. You feel in absolute control over every aspect of battles, and when you lose you feel like it was because of something you did, not due to some mechanic of the game. The game is fantastic in single-player, but there is also a multiplayer meta-game, where you create a general and battle against others for more money and different troops. This mode isn't as popular, but is still functional, and entertaining to fight friends with.\n\nPlay this game for the battles and military strategy. Do not play this game for diplomacy and nation building.

It plays like a massive Hollywood samurai epic, featuring a simple yet layered management interface, yet never forgets the sanctity of its source material - the original SHOGUN that launched the franchise. If anything, it is a massive update to the original game, and as such it is ironically a downgrade to previous TOTAL WAR titles. And this is a good thing; referring specifically to the entries after MEDIEVAL 2 - EMPIRE and NAPOLEON - these were ambitious yet deeply flawed games that perhaps bit off more than they could swallow (something that is currently plaguing the equally ambitious ROME 2 that failed to follow the strides of its predecessor nor honor its masterful original).\n\nSHOGUN 2 rather addressed the issues of its predecessor and, to Creative Assembly's credit, took a humble path and simplified itself to not only a feasible light, but an infinitely satisfying one. Conquering and running your empire is now easier than ever, and in the process you actually recieve a fairly accurate history lesson that glorifies the grit as well as the spectacle of the samurai era. However, you'll find a fairly limited diversity in units as well as actual land area to conquer (which while historically accurate, can make you nostalgically hearken to the massive diversity of ROME and EMPIRE), and a by-the-book "who beats who" battle gameplay. Despite this, there is something incredibly satisfying about watching - in the midst of a gigantic battle - two samurai engaging in single ceremonious combat, ending with one effortlessly stabbing the other through the neck and kicking him down like a total badass. And this is the appeal of the real-time battle interface (the other half of TOTAL WAR gameplay), the incredible battle visuals that allow you to look at the whole picture from above like a bloodthirsty god or down to the individual combatants like someone fighting directly beside them on the field. While the graphics aren't exactly award-winning (probably the one thing ROME 2 has over this one), the inherent satisfaction of watching and commanding these battles is as aesthetically appealing as it is culturally respectful to the samurai era.\n\nTo top off all the awesomeness, FALL OF THE SAMURAI is perhaps my favorite videogame expansion ever made, refining the gameplay of the samurai era mode and bringing it to the gunpowder age - proving that for TOTAL WAR simplicity can be achieved for gun gameplay without delving into the needless complexities of EMPIRE. It is my preferred mode to the game (as I dont need to research gunpowder technology for fifteen years to recieve subpar firing squads), partly because there is something sadistically appealing to watching outdated sword units being torn to shreds by unstoppable barrages of bullets, or flying through the air when they are the unfortunate victim of a cannonball airstrike. And also partly because it does not have the limitations of the primary mode - as it does away with the troublesome "food" mechanic, makes naval battles actually fun to watch, and features a bit more unit diversity. However, as an Imperial supporter, I find that the Shogunate side has the advantage far too often (perhaps purposely, as historically the Imperials triumphed); it often becomes so unfair I have to start a new game altogether where the Imperials have a fair chance. Plus there are fewer clans to actually choose from - six, three for each side - though it doesn't matter to me, I'll always stay loyal to my Shimazu bretheren and expand my empire from the isolation of Kyushu. Have your own opinions about RISE, to me it seems like a simple rehash of the primary mode.\n\nAll in all, SHOGUN 2 represents the best of TOTAL WAR since ROME, and it almost seems sad to me that Creative Assembly abandoned the strides this game made in the series's favor and delved back into needless complexity for ROME 2. It's not that I don't recommend ROME 2, as it is still a solid and ambitious game, but if you want to experience the true mastery of the TOTAL WAR series then go with SHOGUN 2. It has its issues, such as uncommon but far-from-rare crashes and questionable AI that has plagued the series since the beginning, but I believe SHOGUN 2 will join the likes of ROME as one of the greatest strategy titles of all-time. And if Creative Assembly wants to continue the series on this entry's high, combine the mechanics of SHOGUN 2 with the production values of ROME 2. Simply put - play this game.","January 27, 2014","true","490.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign can be played in co-op with a friend which only bolsters the experience. it was fairly rare that i experienced any latence, drop outs or de-syncs within the co-op and the same can be applied for the adverserial multiplayer, which provides a rich and deep experience in of its own. The games additional content is well above par. (rise of the samurai can be a little bland, but that is a personal opinion) and will provide even more entertainment for your money. It would of been nicer to see a more in depth diplomacy system, but past that i dont have many quells with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/34330/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Easily the best Total War game since Rome and Medieval II (and it may be better than both of those), Shogun 2 takes the franchise back to where it began: Japan's Sengoku Era. You play as one of the great Daiymo lords struggling to unite the country. This is not the easiest of tasks, and it is one that inevitably involves a great deal of violence since ultimately there can only be one Shogun. Unlike previous TW games, once you reach a certain level of strength in the campaign, all of the other factions unite to fight against you, leading to an intense mid-late game. Since past TW games tended to get far too easy once you conquered enough, this is actually rather refreshing to see since it staves off boredom. Overall, the gameplay is similar to all other TW games, except here it is more polished, more focused, and altogether better than previous installments.\n\nIt also has a rather unique and well-designed multiplayer system which, while unfair at times if the matchmaker puts you up against vastly more experienced foes, at least manages to give a player reasons to keep playing it. I'm not sure if anyone still plays the multiplayer, but i'd hope so. Besides, i've been given to understand that Creative Assembly made a mess of Rome 2's multiplayer (among other things), so Shogun 2's is probably a superior experience.\n\nThere are flaws in this game though. The AI here is much better than in past TW games, but it still has its dummy moments. People who have crazy-good PC's may be irritated to find out that this game at its maximum settings might be too much for their computers to handle. The larger your empire gets the more micromanagement you have to do, which, although no different from previous TW games, still can be annoying for those who just want to fight the battles. Lastly there are bugs and crashes that, while not too frequent, are still frustrating when they happen.\n\nIf you have an interest in this franchise but have yet to try it out, Feudal Japan in general, or really just well-made games, then this is worth checking out.","December 28, 2013","true","229.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the music and voices to the artwork, this is a very immersive game.  Combat animations give the most fluid and interesting (and brutal) portrayals of combat I've ever seen in a Total War game (haven't played Rome 2 yet though)\n\nThe main tutorial teaches most of what you need to know, such as how to use the campaign map, the basics of attacking, but I would strongly recommend searching for and studying battle tips on youtube (and there are plenty!).  Just remember: Spear beats horse, sword beats spear, horse beats sword, bow beats everything at distance, and everything beats bow up close, and keep your general safe and close.  Naval combat is the game's only weakness, as early on it feels like its just archer platforms shooting eachother.  You'll be desperate to upgrade and get ships with cannons to spice it up.\n\nJust don't do what I did on my nooby first try...expanding and recruiting too many too fast, running out of food and money, losing public order, and starting an early realm divide, A PERFECT NIGHTMARE  (It's actually pretty much common sense when governing the campaign map, so don't worry about stressful brainstorming on this)\n\nAll in all, this is a game every PC should have.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games or would like to get into RTS games.  I also strongly recommend it to RTS fans who have been on the fence over getting this game.  It's worth every cent.

Shogun 2, despite trimming down some features like town management, manages to capture the previous games' glory without sacrificing much beyond excess tedium. Despite this, it still has a steep learning curve as in the previous installments. The more focused scope of the game allows for a much easier time of getting into the series, placing Shogun 2 as the first game that one should buy if they are interested in the Total War series in this reviewer's opinion.\n\nStrengths:\nPreserves the depth of the franchise without getting lost in the tedium.\nBeautiful, engaging visuals with some heavily stylized artwork.\nPreserves the culture of feudal Japan, doing it great justice.\nGood mod support.\nFocus on Japan ensures you understand every unit's purpose.\n\nWeaknesses:\nRelatively steep learning curve, despite having been more simplified.\nDiscouraging to new players, as the game can take some time to truly start in force. (Not exactly a con for veterans)\nSmall focus on Japan, disallowing unit diversity.\n\nOverall numerical rating: 9-9.5","November 25, 2013","true","60.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why not send your agents of chaos while you're at it and decimate the enemy troops before your army reach them?

Shogun 2 has a great design and creative layout. Once you get past the (not so hard) learning curve it is very hard to stop crushing your enemies, and trading wifes to save alliences.\n\nIf you havent played any of the total war games they essentually play like this, its composed of a strategic map view where you build your armies, manage your empires economy, organized your generals, and engage in diplomacy with other diamoes in futal japan. The other part of the game is when two enemy armies meet on the campaign map, they will engage in a real time tactical battle which will display thousands of soldiers engaging in ranged and hand to hand combat. All of this with really impressive combat animation. This game has come a long way from the original offering in Total War Shogun back in the year 2000. Naval battles, siege battles, and even ambushes all add to keep it fresh and interesting. Campaigns can take a single day, or up to weeks depending on the perameters you set.\n\nMultiplayer:\nSo you can see how multiplayer has always been a really tough mode to include for the series. But Shogun 2 does a few things that makes it manageable. First you have the real traditional (and now) cooperative multiplayer campaign, a feature that Napolatin Total War lacked. This is where you can ally with a friend or even compete against them same as you would in a normal campaign with all the features. With each of your taking turns on the campaign map. And in battles you can even split control of armies just make sure you have plenty of time to go this full mode. However for people that like their gaming in shorter bursts you can now engage in a new mode called avatar conquest, where you can create your own general, create your own army and then engaege against other multiplayer generals. These wins and losses then apply towards a campaign map where your fighting for control of japan. WIth all these new features creative assembly has really found the perfect balance for legitimate multiplayer in this already epic game, extending its huge playtime already hundreds of hours to some ridiculous levels.\n\nGraphics:\nThe element aspect of this game is amazing, I usually rate the graphics of games by their water graphics. The way the water moves from the current and wind, the shine from the sun and other light objects. Well I am very happy that this game gets it right. In naval battles the ocean currents crash against your ship if your not facing the against the current, you must pay attention to the wind to see if it will be easy to sail, etc.. The huge battles that play ontop of big moutainus regions and hilly lands are amazing to watch and control. All of the soldiers have visible combat animations by actual sword master. and this takes up upon thousands of troops at a time. A truly remarkable game.\n\n94/100        94% Magnificent","July 16, 2013","true","193.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Modern graphics, beautiful menu and art style, incredible real time battles and in-depth macro strategy.  This iteration came with a little more polish than Empire, and harkens back to melee combat which, in my opinion, makes the franchise shine.  It's been on sale a few times and is no longer full price; that makes this title one to pick up if you are a TW fan.  The multiplayer is also a treat, with your co-op player's ability to command part of your troops during battle.","January 13, 2012","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Singleplayer gameplay is centered around a Turn Based campaign map, where you are allowed to Macro your Economies, Commerce, Armies, Diplomacy, and Agents all on one easy to follow medium. One drawback is the lack of castle variation or construction ability, each siege battle will have the same castles for each stage of construction achieved in the province; However in other modes in the game, you may choose to preload a unique castle for one battle. The actual battles themselves take place in a Real Time Strategy environment where the player must field their units in battle against enemy forces. There are many types of battles; Sieges, Skirmishes, Night Battles, Ambushes; Each battle providing a different experience and strategy. Countless units will allow you to construct a diverse army capable of accommodating for any possible enemy strategy. The online play has obviously seen better days considering the date of release; However one can still find a competative game here and there. The Avitar campaign feature was truly one of the best facets of the game, allowing for players to join clans with their friends, and play a competative campaign style map which eliminated all Macro management, and focuses only on the battles to consider the outcome of each turn. The player then gains veteran units to field in later battles, and also the opportunity to upgrade each veteran unit with unique abilities such as fire arrows, or the swooping crane. The game also allows for historical battles which actually have some historically accurate information provided in the massive in game index. Trust me if you have any questions about how to do something in the game, it will be in that index. All in all this game will keep you entertained for hours, whether you enjoy playing solo, or multiplayer; there are endless opportunities to replay this game.","October 29, 2013","true","244.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'd reccomend getting the Otomo and the Ikko Ikki clan packs over the Hattori one because they are "more" than the Hattori clan considering on how the Hattori is just your vanilla clan with ninja skills.\n\nBut still the new graphics, smoother UI design and the overall better atmosphere is a significant plus even if you liked guns better. But hey that's what the Otomo clan pack is for!\n\n8/10, great game, would have 9/10 but less 1 point because they are selling the blood war DLC isntead of having it come in with the game by default lol.","February 1, 2015","true","178.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is units for everything, there is some all-around units, but they arent so good in all fields as specialized ones. For example Katana-Samurais are better then Yari-Samurai in infantry combat, but fail against cavarly.\n\nAlso to add: Fall of the Samurai is very good expansion for this, nothing wins using Gatlings & Amstrong Guns against enemy spearmen.\n\nBanzai!","December 18, 2013","true","93.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Singleplayer gameplay is centered around a Turn Based campaign map, where you are allowed to Macro your Economies, Commerce, Armies, Diplomacy, and Agents all on one easy to follow medium. One drawback is the lack of castle variation or construction ability, each siege battle will have the same castles for each stage of construction achieved in the province; However in other modes in the game, you may choose to preload a unique castle for one battle. The actual battles themselves take place in a Real Time Strategy environment where the player must field their units in battle against enemy forces. There are many types of battles; Sieges, Skirmishes, Night Battles, Ambushes; Each battle providing a different experience and strategy. Countless units will allow you to construct a diverse army capable of accommodating for any possible enemy strategy. The online play has obviously seen better days considering the date of release; However one can still find a competative game here and there. The Avitar campaign feature was truly one of the best facets of the game, allowing for players to join clans with their friends, and play a competative campaign style map which eliminated all Macro management, and focuses only on the battles to consider the outcome of each turn. The player then gains veteran units to field in later battles, and also the opportunity to upgrade each veteran unit with unique abilities such as fire arrows, or the swooping crane. The game also allows for historical battles which actually have some historically accurate information provided in the massive in game index.

The multiplayer is great, the campaign is great, the units are great and the varying factions are all great. Shogun 2 is the second version of the shogun series and one of the newer Total War games. It is unique in the use of its DLC to expand on the base game and features other great unique features that older Total War games lack. Now, although medieval Japan is not my variety historical period I loved the look of the game and got into lots of information about it before buying it finding it to be worth it. Sadly my system is not the best at running it but in playing it I've enjoyed it, especially the multiplayer for what I could run smoothly. With co-op systems, avatar general and army building combined with leaderboards that can be attributed to Steam groups the system is a great improvement to the Total War games before it. I personally stuck to the multiplayer for most of my playing period with the game unlike in previous games where I stuck to the single player nearly the whole time. Multiplayer alone would still make this game good. Unit choices are another really great aspect which works with the varying factions too. Their is even one on the president! I won't give you any clues on what its called though. The other great thing about the game not mentioned yet is the graphics. The general look of the game is great despite my poor specifications which shows that it is great beyond what I considered already good as higher specification computers will have an even better sight. To summarise the good points-\n\n- Improved multiplayer\n- Good DLC that works well improving on the base game\n- Great graphics\n- Interesting and varied number of units\n- Unique and original factions\n- Great Campaign\n- Great Historical battles with huge clashes and great explanations to them\n\nNow to the bad. The game is hard to run for me and since my system is alright I would say it may be an issue for some others out there. Lowering the quality of the game helps, but the single player can lose the nice look due to the game struggling. Also, from what I saw, the early mulitplayer battles are awful if you don't have riflemen as they are incredibly over-powered.  The DLC, although improving on what the game offers greatly is a bit unfair at times to those without it. Without DLC its hard to beat armies who have them and since most players have already got high in the rankings late entries may find the first ten to twenty matches a bit of a slaughter on them. I got some riflemen and soon found I was the one slaughtering others which became fun though, so it worked out! To summarise the bad points-\n\n- Over-powered DLC at times\n- Specification is slightly too high for some lower specified computers.\n\nSo the game is great despite its obsession with paying more on upgrades in and out of the game to make your experience more pleasing in combat I would easily score this game a 4/5, 8/10 or 80%. It shows Total War games to be improving in many aspects and is definetly a great strategy game overall.","March 9, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes everything that is good about TBS games and adds to it;\n\n~ Weather conditions play more of a factor in battles, adding realism. Thus players need to adapt better strategies when deploying troops.\n\n~ Naval battles have been expanded and mechanics are much improved from Empire.\n\n~ The overall feel to the game is improved. Clans and Generals seem to have different personalities which enhances your intrigue for the game.\n\n~ The Campaign map on Empire, I felt was too large and I personally seemed to get bogged down with watching things such as finances and overseas settlements than actually trying to dominate the map.\n\nShogun goes back to focussing on the "War" element, that made Rome and Medieval 2 so popular but it adds more in depth realism where it's wanted most; battles.\n\n~ Creating an avatar and unlocking units on online multiplayer keeps your drawn once you're through with campaign.\n\nBy far one of the best games I own. Must buy for TBS gamers and Total War fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Singleplayer gameplay is centered around a Turn Based campaign map, where you are allowed to Macro your Economies, Commerce, Armies, Diplomacy, and Agents all on one easy to follow medium. One drawback is the lack of castle variation or construction ability, each siege battle will have the same castles for each stage of construction achieved in the province; However in other modes in the game, you may choose to preload a unique castle for one battle. The actual battles themselves take place in a Real Time Strategy environment where the player must field their units in battle against enemy forces. There are many types of battles; Sieges, Skirmishes, Night Battles, Ambushes; Each battle providing a different experience and strategy. Countless units will allow you to construct a diverse army capable of accommodating for any possible enemy strategy. The online play has obviously seen better days considering the date of release; However one can still find a competative game here and there. The Avitar campaign feature was truly one of the best facets of the game, allowing for players to join clans with their friends, and play a competative campaign style map which eliminated all Macro management, and focuses only on the battles to consider the outcome of each turn. The player then gains veteran units to field in later battles, and also the opportunity to upgrade each veteran unit with unique abilities such as fire arrows, or the swooping crane. The game also allows for historical battles which actually have some historically accurate information provided in the massive in game index. Trust me if you have any questions about how to do something in the game, it will be in that index. All in all this game will keep you entertained for hours, whether you enjoy playing solo, or multiplayer; there are endless opportunities to replay this game.","October 29, 2013","true","244.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is because Shogun 2 has a way better AI than Rome 2 and you can have a decent amount of fun watching the sometimes, hilarious cutscenes that it shows you of, for example your ninja being detected and stuck in a wall etc.\n\nAlso I thought that the naval combat on here was beautiful and intriguing to watch (imo). So if you are looking for a good strategy game, then I would recommend Shogun 2 (or Rome 1 which is my favourite strategy game ever).\n\nEDIT:3/13/2016, Now that I have more hours in Shogun 2, I can say that this game is the most polished total war game to date (without mods). I also definitely recommend getting fall of the samurai, it has fluid gun combat and is actually very different from the base game, since navies have a very important role to play with the added naval bombardments that can leave an army in a land battle in dissaray. Fall of the samurai is the perfect example of what an expansion should be.","April 23, 2014","true","348.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
