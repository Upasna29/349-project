Stick RPG 2 is a lot like its predecessor. In one way, it runs dry very fast. It runs dry even faster now that they've decided to include a cheat menu! No more running back to your home, just press the 1 button to teleport to it! Don't feel like waiting for your interest to increase? Hold in the T button! Of course, all of these have to be activated, which I did. But all in all, it was a fun experience. You won't get very much time out of the game, but the time you do get it pretty fun. Lots of secret things to explore and funny things to read. The price tag is something I do NOT agree with though. This game should not be 20 dollars. Or even 10! This game should be 5 dollars at MOST. Get this game if it's on sale for 75% off or more. Nothing lower.\n\nwww.youtube.com/adambel2009 https://twitter.com/MisterBellyt","June 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 247 of 287 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","247","287","0","13"

One side is a time management sim featuring wild goose chase quests, and the other side is a top down arcade brawler.  Both sides completely different from each other, and both are necessary to master to complete the game.\n\nAs a sim, your character has to make money through working jobs, gambling, and performing various tasks.  Doing favors (quests) for individuals will help you aquire different tools, which will ultimately lead you to the game goal items.  As for time management, you have to decide what jobs and tasks are worth your time to work to build up your bank and character stats.  You can also develop a love life interacting with potential mates.  You also sometimes have a choice on how to accomplish certian tasks, but there are very few choices offered throughout the entire game.\n\nAs a top down arcade brawler, it feels very similar to Hotline Miami, but everyone has a life bar, and you can't pick up weapons off the ground.  You can build weapons through quests, shop at the weapons store, or sometimes even win them as fight rewards.  Some battles will only allow you to fight with your fists, but there are also battle grounds where you can exploit all your weapons.\n\nAs far as the overall experience goes, it feels really unpolished and unfinished.  Prices of various items and services are very inflated, forcing you to spend a lot of time working jobs to develop a solid bank account.  It is also frusturating working a job and losing stats on a bad shift (on the job accidents, with no insurance options).  You also can have lucky days where you get a substantial bonus on your shift, but you can't adjust the odds in your favor for these events.  On a funny note, your strength stat will make your firearms stronger for some reason, and you have unlimited ammo, so running blindly with a machine gun or flame thrower on full auto is an acceptable tactic.  As fun as it is the first two or three times, it gets old really fast.\n\nThe game feels more like a prototype for something really awesome, but definitely lacks a lot of ambition, and needs to be tweaked.  I do recommend it to hobbyist level game designers who want ideas for implementation, but need some direction.  For everyone else, pick it up as cheap as you can (I got it for $1), and waste a good 4 to 6 hours before you give up on it.  It isn't so bad, it just isn't all that great either.","November 12, 2014","true","6.4"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","62","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/307640/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Stick RPG 2: Director's Cut is an expanded version of the flash game many of us have played. These types of flash games with collection quests, stat management, and simplistic combat are common on free game sites. It does seem as if the game has been fleshed out a bit, and more can be completed than in your standard flash game, but I don't believe enough has been added to justify the hefty price tag.\n\nGameplay is split into two major types. In the first, you run around the map, work for money, build your skills, and complete fetch quests. The second is combat, which is a top-down battle arena where you can switch weapons and attack by clicking. Niether is particularly deep or nuanced.\n\nGraphics are the same that have been seen before in countless flash games. Nothing noteworthy. All characters are stick people.\n\nThe sounds consists of a constant background song, and some sound effects when you perform a task or fight. Very basic.\n\nThe writing is good enough to keep you interested for a bit, but there seem to be only a handful of quests to complete in the entire game. Gameplay is stretched out by the outrageous amounts of money or stats needed to obtain items. It would take hours and hours of mindless running back and forth and clicking to obtain some of the pricier items which are needed to continue quests.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend Stick RPG 2. The game length is padded out by the ridiculous stat or money cost of some of the necessary quest items, which just hides the fact that there is not much to do in this game. Maybe it deserves a small price tag for the fact that it is a little longer than some of the free flash games, but it is nowhere near worth $20. Even if it was closer to the $5 range, I'd have a hard time recommending it because there is just not that much to do in it.\n\nGrade: D+","April 2, 2015","false","3.2"," 59 of 85 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","59","85","0","0"

The problem is, that when it was free it was never finished, and 10 years later, it still feels like its a free game. Here are some of the frustrating problems I have encountered.\nFirst off, the aspect ratio is crap in the game, unless you go fullscreen. That means it is either really small, or it locks you into one screen when most people have two monitors. Not a big deal, unless you want to watch Netflix while playing, then its agrivating as hell.\nIn a world where quest lists and pull up maps are a given, it breaks the flow of the game when you are given a quest. How might you ask? Well because you will immediantly forget about a quest given, and items are rarely found/given, whenever a task is presented to you, it means you will have to prettymuch stop whatever you are doing, and go for that task, unless you don't care. Its not like "Hey do you have a popsicle?" and then find one a little bit later. Not the case in this game, so either you are playing with a walkthrough, or break flow and go task running.\nThere really seems to be no direction, if you forget the last step you where on, guess what, you have to retrace to see if you can remember where you are. And this game has a ♥♥♥♥ing time system, which means quests and quest givers are dependent on the time of the day, so a walkthrough is probably a neccesity if you don't want to run around a city hunting down during each time period for stuff.\nThe reward system in this game is meh, doing the right thing screws you, and doing the wrong thing still screws you. I have had to save/quit/load because even if you are working a normal job, you can lose days worth of progress in stat loss. It is frustration from a system that when it first came out was fun, but now is outdated. And here is how work in this game works: run up to the place that you have enough stats to work at. Click person a few times a day. Run to place to sleep. Repeat. FOR A PAID GAME I WANT SOME DAMN VARIETY! This is a point in click game 10 years in the making that literal thousands of dollars would have been pledged to through a kickstarter to make it right. They did nothing in the time between Stick RPG 1 & 2 it seems. Its not edgy, its not original, and its not updated.\n\nIf you have the nostaliga bug, ignore it. This is a poor remake of a game that inspired an entire generation of flash game makers. I wanted to love this game, I bought it the second I saw it was out on Steam. Stick RPG 2 can be best described as a middle finger to anyone guilible enough to purchase it. Outdated design, lack of innovation, annoying aspect ratio, no direction, and archiach structuring is why I couldn't recommend this game under any circumstances.\n\nEdit* 2014/07/07: Save games apparently are a huge issue in this game as well. Ive lost mine, then they came back, then didn't, and they go through this process where you may or may not have to sign up with Xgen's website. Didn't mention it before, but thought it might as well be called out as well. They do seem to come back, but its when the game seems to want to.","June 17, 2014","false","3.2"," 196 of 323 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","196","323","0","31"

It's worth mentioning that you can still play games like these for free on Newgrounds, so to drop actual money on this or not is totally your prerogative.\n\nAs for the gameplay you should know what you're in store for if you played the original Stick RPG.  You wake up, go somewhere in the city to click on a dialogue option repeatedly until you've increased your stat/money quota for the day, head home, sleep and repeat.  It's mind numbingly dull but oddly relaxing if you're in the right mindset.  This game hit the spot for me at a time where I was so record breakingly lazy that any and all other video games on Earth seemed like they required too much effort to play.\n\nThe resolution is terrible and there's no way to modify it.  Fullscreen mode looks ugly.  You have to go into this game wanting it really bad, or having brain damage like me, otherwise you're probably going to throw up.  You can look on the bright side, at least Stick RPG 2 a finalized product and not another Early Access game stuck in purgatory forever.\n\nI think the creator and I would get along really well, his humor is as unfunny as mine.

This is an amazing game, but the price is a bit too much. The game has somewhat of a story, I didn't know till I unlocked the lab. It took me around 224 days or 5 hours to beat the game, but I really wasn't trying to speedrun it. The game has a lot of jobs to choose from, being good and bad. Like any RPG, there are stats, Intelligence, Strength, and Charm, all important for certain jobs and quests. Theres also another stat called Karma, determines if you are good or bad. I prefer bad, it's just better. Three things I didn't like about this game was the fact that the game is locked at 30FPS, second, the game is 20 bucks, retail price (I got it for 5 bucks on the summer sale.) and the controls would sometimes ♥♥♥♥ up and force me to close out the game and relaunch it. The game isn't worth 20 bucks, plus it is a browser game. This edition just adds some stuff that wasn't in the browser version. I'd say pick this game up at a discounted price, this game does have a lot of replayablilty so, it's really all up to you. 8.5/10","June 27, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They were my primary source of flash games, I was even big on their forums and had a brief tenure as a moderator before I graduated and found better things to do.\n\nI played SRPG1, 2, and a LOT of Stick Arena. I've been around.\n\nI will say, immediately, that this is not a twenty dollar game. I find that quite a bit high for something that (probably) isn't even being worked on much anymore. I got it for four dollars, I'd put it's value at anywhere between 5-10$. So anything in that range or lower during one of Steam's various sales - I'd say nab it.\n\nIt's a simple game where you flail around four maps findings things to do. Slowly working up your cashflow, grinding out some stats that ultimately unlock more things to do. It's a neat distraction and functions as any browser-based flash game would. A simple distraction before work, or something to do with Netflix on the side.

Though, it may be good to first check it out on your broswer and see if you like it. Then you can decide if you wish to buy it on here or add it on to your broswer, either way it still means buying it.\nIt's basically a little, what the title says Stick RPG game. You can work in jobs and get paid, kill mobsters, own a castle, and much more. One of my favorite features, because I am a noob is the cheats, which is only available to the Directors edtion, that to me makes the game a lot more enjoyable because honestly it gets repitive after a good while of gamplay.\nOverall, I did by this Directors Edition for about 50% off, and honestly I do not think I would buy it full priced.

Except, it's just about the same thing! Sure, you have all the cheats, but the way I play is the legit way, so I never have cheats on anyway. Fullscreen? Good one! It's a slightly increased resolution letterboxed in the center of the screen, with just a bunch of blank outside of the game. Doesn't take half of my 1366x768 resolution. The new area was really "RGH I WANNA GO THERE SO BADDD" without the Director's Cut, and when I finally got it, to be honest it's nothing special. Just stuff where you can earn a lot more money (Doctor 2.0 because 900 intelligence required), and there's a bakery AKA karma farming. There's nothing there that anyone'd care for that much, and there are many bugs. The bugs in the flash game are also in this cut too. My guy is always running Sideways, even though I have Workaholic. It's just. Ech. Just play the flash version.

Some of the more advanced weapons are overpowered and make the battles too easy near the end of the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of grinding and leveling up, you will enjoy this game. Most quests are unlocked based on your level, so you're going to need to get yourself a job and improve your skills in order to make money to pay for your upgrades.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the ending, but others might find it appropriate. Personally, I was looking for something more.\n\nThere is replayability to this game, and you choose the way you complete the game. If you want to be an honest, friendly visitor who helps the law, or a rebel who gets a job as a pimp or hacker and works for the underworld, it's up to you.\n\nI might start this game up again and give it another go, and see if there is anything differen that I might have missed.\n\nAlso, there are trophies to win based on acheivements, which add some more challenge to the game.

The only real thing you get with this is you can play offline,no ads, and you can use built in cheats. Those are the only real perks. The game has some of the glitches I remember. The battle sequences tend to lag even on the lowest quality. The buttons tend to keep pressing when nothing is being pressed(In battles) The only difference I could see is new weaspons(which the kings gatling gun is buggy) new jobs(with new payouts) and spoiler alert. You have a new option for the ending(which leads you back to the original stick RPG(with lower payouts for max jobs) Also I should mention that last one the Stick RPG 1 playback is glitchy(really bad) I can't tell if it's a joke about the dimension being unstable or it's just buggy.

That is right, you go to a job of your choice and you work to gain money.

I'm a sucker for weird RPGs and adventure games, so I gave it a try. Gosh, why do all the games I try these days have such horrible direction? I mean, it's looking like a trend for me: horrible short music playing in a loop (they have slightly less irritating music in some of the shops but it's only played in them!), controls are QWERTY only, meaning if you have an AZERTY keyboard you're screwed (unless you're eager to use AutoHotKey to fix the layout), or have to use the arrow keys, which of course isn't too practical if you're right-handed because you still have to use the mouse to click on dialog boxes -- and it gets worse: there's only a small area you can click to dismiss a dialog, so you have to navigate awkwardly with your keyboard, and then take your mouse and target an area to keep going. It feels like the UI is taken straight from my Windows 3.1 days. And I had Solitaire on it, which was way more entertaining.\n\nI kept going for half an hour because I really wanted to give it a chance, but it's hard to find any qualities to the game. Combat is confusing, characters are only differentiated by their head color which is amusing but not particularly useful, I couldn't find the professor I was supposed to find at the beginning and I had no way to read a log reminding me of where/when he's supposed to be, and the map is huge, which is usually a good point but in this case I kept getting lost and there was no mini-map to help me. Plus, I actually spent 10 minutes running around the city until I realized running to its 'borders' would take me to another portion of it. Again, no visual clues...\n\nCome to think of it, it isn't even that 'weird' a concept for a game, as it's inspired by other similar Flash games. The only weird thing in this is the implementation itself. And that's exactly where it should have kept to the basics.\nWhy, why, oh why?!","September 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

Im gonna run through the Pro's and Con's to people can clearly see whats good and bad about tis game.\nPros\n+Good time killer. A fairly good amount of content in the game, as well as a good enough sized world to explore.\n+Lots to do in-game. Alot of jobs, a murder mystery to solve, etc.\n+XGen Account. If ya set one up online and made some serious progress on it, that transfers over here. Just log in.\n+No need to buy extra XGen Cash for the Cheats.\n+Cheats are fun.\n\nCons\n-XGen Account. Need to relogin every time to load up my game.\n-Full screen is lame and useless.\n-£15 is not a fair price for access to 4 or 5 new areas, and a couple of new jobs. Those areas are also required to earn. some acheivments, which to some may be a kinda stupid idea. Its basically saying "Pay if ya wanna be able to gget these new acheivements."\n-Would be nice if we could actually explore the homes we purchase in game.\n-Graphics are kinda bad.\n-Not so much an RPG as a Life Simulator.\n\nOverall Thoughts & Feelings\n=Game is good in general in terms of gameplay, and some of the mechanics can be quite fun.  But the game lcks alot of contents, as well as the Free, Stanndard version they could also ship on Steam. The price is also kinda bad really.\nGet the game if ya want, but definetly not at full price, case £15 just isn't worth it.\nOverall, I can recomemmend it in a sale, but not at full price. Maybe at 70% discount or more. £5 or less.","March 15, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a few holes like the incredibly difficult storyline tasks in which google seemed to be my best friend, the pure repetive nature of the game and above all the fact its free to play online and you can't play saved characters offline.

It was one of my favorite games back during high school, and while I don't think it's held up as much as some other online game classics, there are still a lot of things I really like about it.\n\nI highly recommend trying Stick RPG 2, but I wouldn't recommend this version.  And here's why.\n\nMy major problem is that this game is in no way shape or form a $20 game.  I personally think it's barely a $5 game.  The features exclusive to this version add little to nothing.\n\nThis game has given me months of fun and I'm really happy I was finally able to financially support it in some way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hstypt/recommended/307640/","hstypt","hastypete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hstypt/","154 products in account","Review: Down UnderRating: 5/10\n\nStick RPG 2 is an interesting game to me. It was, at one point, a fun flash game you'd play when you had not much else to do, but then, they decided to release an extended edtion, not on Steam, for around 20 bucks, then release it on Steam later for the same price tag. Yet, I still found it interesting enough to pick up while on sale, a play through it finally.\n\nThe 2 in the title may not entice to get this game, because, why play a sequel when you've never played the game that came before? This isn't really the case as the first game didn't really have a story other than you dropping into a world, doing stuff, and getting extremely bored if you played a hacked version. Stick RPG 2 does have at least a little bit of a story line: you drop from your home and have to find a way back. The way you do this is by getting a job, so you can afford to get stronger, fight mobsters, gansters, etc., and collect all artifacts to unlock a portal so you can go home. The main issue with this, however, is that either you'll be stuck for a long time, or will finish this game in either a few hours or even less than that with a walkthrough. Why? Because this game has a lot of filler that gets in the way of the main goal.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, the fighting has been heavily improved from the first game, which had you using an RPG-like system that wasn't very good to begin with. Now, you aim, and click to fire, punch, and/or attack. The issue is, with this being a flash port, and not having been moved to another engine entirely, lag is a MASSIVE issue, and often times gets in the way while you're having a fight. Also, there is a boss fight in this game. I won't say anything about him other than he's incredibly weak, and, to add salt to an open wound, is the final and ONLY boss in the game.\n\nDespite these glaring issues, this games also pretty fun. Doing jobs can be pretty fun, despite seeing the same lines of text over and over again, and, the whole role-playing thing works well. However, with this said, it's time I mention what this does different than the flash game: a couple of unlocked locations, ineffective cheats, and a full screen mode. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, those are the only extra things you get when you pay $20 for a normally free game. The cheats aren't even very good, and, plus of which, you need an X-GEN account to even save your game. This is sad, very, very sad.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not recommend you buy the Director's Cut version of SRPG2, unless you want a few practically useless features, and way more lag. The only thing stopping me from giving this a lower rating than 5 is the fact that Stick RPG 2 is still a fun game, despite it's many issues.","April 15, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the $20.00 price tag is ridiculous I highly recommend getting this on sale I myself purchased it at $3.99 and that was fair. One little issue you'll encounter in the game is when you have an occupation that requires a stat increase for promotion but wont say how much, you may have enough but they wont give you a promotion still so you'll have to exit the game and go back in and you'll recieve it if it's enough","February 28","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though fairly simple and short, Stick RPG was a great game for its time. However, when Stick RPG 2 came out, it has improved upon evry aspect of the previous game.In case you might not have known, there are two versions of the game; There's the free browser version and the "expanded" Steam version. Though both have similar features, the director's cut gives you access to another area to explore, more jobs, full access to cheats that you would otherwise have to pay seperately for, etc( All the info is in the game's description I'll make it simple and list off the pros and cons of this game:\n\nPros:\n-Combat plays similarly to Stick Arena: Ballistic (A game also developed by XGen Studios) which is not perfect but not bad at all either\n- A VAST number of jobs to choose from and max out\n-Several weapons at your disposal with varying ranks and tiers\n-each job has a certain benefit that sometimes can be useful\n-"Moral" game (game let's you to either pick the good path or bad path)\n\nCons\n-There are times where it stutters a little while transitioning to another area or to combat mode\n-Relationship feature is a bit lacking\n-Prices are a tad bit too high\n\nVerdict: 8.9/10;  This game serves to be a pretty fun time waster/RPG game. Though some aspects of the game are a bit annoying, you might not bother to notice it when you're strolling around the city, boosting your stats, and beating the living bejeezus out of each and every foe. If Stick RPG 3 is a possible thing in the future, I hope that XGen Studios can improve on making it even better than this installment.\n","January 30","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
