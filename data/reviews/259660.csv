Some basic commands are there (switch target, target nearest etc.).\nThere are 4 possible views on any ship (1st person, 3rd person -or chase-, 3rd person with free camera -like eve online-, but the last one is not suitable for direct control, turret control, single one or all). Correction: there's a fifth view, command, that lets you steer your ship with the mouse, select targets and shoot, very dynamic, very similar to eve online.\nWhen a ship has turrets, they track the targeted enemy on their own while you can fly around.\n\nTactical command: you can view the map with a far camera, the units are re-rendered as green/yellow/blue small ships with some bloom effect, you can give basi orders, like patrol an area, move to a point, attack etc. You can select multiple units and also give formation orders. You can select your main base and adjust three bars with three resources -research/energy/ore mining. Resources are generated/used every given time. You can build structures (like shipyards, weapon platforms etc. around the base, selecting placement on all three axis.\n\nPersonal thoughts:\nTactical view UI is too basic, you have little control over what's happening and the menus with ships and objects in space are lists of units you need to browse with your eyes. There is no clear counter of resources spent/used/available/produced, so you have little knowledge of what you need. Camera controls need a lot of improvements in this mode, for now it's quite hard to move, find, select, command units.\nThere is no research panel nor research tree. You research a shipyard->build one->research corvette->build corvette, switching to main base to each research, all done in a list menu. You have little information on unit types, their characteristics  etc.\nCampaign is quite difficult, you can save games and there's an autosave but it's quite difficult to win against an enemy that is most always superior in numbers, usually you'll need to repeat missions in order to do what's right to do and do it faster in order to win.\nThere is a ship cap devided for ship class, but all is moddable.\n\nOverall I like the direct control mode, it switches to another unit when yours die, with a button you can cycle all your ships, you can control any ship. I like the graphic style, the units are well designed and interesting. What I don't like is the sound, too few sounds, too little music, there's a lot to add in this. I like the graphic style although there's little of interest in space, asteroids and some dust clouds, needs a lot. The background space is convincing but quite sterile. The lack of objects leads to disorientation when using a single ship.\nAn interesting idea that needs new features, polishing of UI especially in tactical control mode, more sounds and a complete soundtrack. The editor is nice, but should be more open since it would let us learn game basics such as base building/progression and test ships with direct control.\nBuy it if you want to support the product and give inputs, wait if you are looking for a finished game. Like all early access we don't know when this will be finished, how many patches-builds will come in the future and at what pace.\nThe game developer is a nice guy who is willing to confront with the crowd, speaks english and is dedicated since kickstarted his project, a true indie.\n\nUpdate after some more time in game:\nI'm experiencing a lot of crashes, random ones, I can't replicate them in any way and there's little I can do to report bugs etc. As regarding the campaign I've reached a stalemate, my progress is frustrated by crashes and extreme difficulty, my side and the enemy's are so well placed we both toss each other small fleets of 8/10 ships (there's a cap of some sort I can't figure out more information) and the attacker loses always. Finally, the interface in tactical mode is quite difficult to navigate, especially when it comes to move commands in the xyz axis, there's no clear way to distinguish the position at the end of the move.\nYou can upgrade your flag ship with several improvements, from auto-repairs to engine to turrets (additional). The way you do it is quite nice, get the ship closer to a transfer structure, order to move some resources into the ship (this action is shown in game by crates popping out of the structure and flying towards the ship) and then order the upgrades you want (there's a timer).\n\n\nUpdate2: after quite some more time.\nLooks like crashing bugs were related to something in the 3rd mission of the campaign, maybe attacking some enemy platforms. I still get a crash from time to time.\nI have to point out that there are 4 factions I've seen now. The progression in game not only unlocks ships and factions in the mission editor but also adds single missions (scenarios) to be played.\n\nUpdate3:I managed to unlock all ships via some out of game files, which I opened in wordpad. The game truly is moddable, you can modify practically all ship data, damage, HP, speed, acceleration, even the phisics (reaction controls), ROF/speed of projectiles or missiles, and I looked at their textures too, all of this was very accessible (considering I have no idea how to mod a game), and there is a practical folder for mods, that folder will prioritize loading any mod file named after game files, so you only have to drop your modifications there without touching the vanilla game files.","January 16, 2014","true","8.3"," 107 of 124 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","107","124","0","0"

But there is so much potential and nice ideas in so it ends in a love-hate relation. That's why the frustration.\n\nVoid Destroyer is a RTS space combat game very similar to Homeworld so whoever played one of those will instantly feel familiar with it. The interesting part is that you can take direct control of any ship in your fleet and fly it yourself in 1st or 3rd person mode, blasting away at enemies like a space combat sim. At the same time you can use a tactical mode to manage your fleet and bases. You can research new stuff there, build ships or gun platforms, form fleets and have an overall view of the battlefield.\n\nHowever that's where the problems start: The interface, while nice looking, has it's kinks. So you cannot, for example, select all ships of a type to form into groups. The only way to select several ships is by dragging a box or shift-clicking one ship after another. You also cannot remove ships from an already selected group (at least I haven't found out how).\nThe fact that there is no tooltip for anything doesn't help finding out what all the clickable commands really do.\nForming formations also is quite tedious as some ships simply ignore that order or they leave the formation at a latter time for no apparent reasons.\nAll in all keeping all your stuff doing what you want them to do is like herding cats. It more or less works but it is way more exhausting that it should be.\n\nMy biggest gripe though is with the difficulty spike. Since your fleet is consistent from one mission to another and in several you are unable to re-build stuff you are forced to optimize earlier missions to be able to beat later ones. In addition many missions seem to have triggers for enemy reinforcements and if you trigger too many while being not ready no strategic genius will save you from doom. In addition in some missions the enemy bases are so close that the battle turns into a totally confusing free-for-all as you cannot move one step without drawing more enemies after you. Other missions where the enemy is not reinforcing infinitely are then in contrast rather easy and allow you to finish without losing anything.\n\nEven while the Dev is trying very hard to be helpful in the forums and seems to constantly answer questions and improve the game this is a playstyle I simply can't stand for long. While there are tactics to deal with certain enemies the only strategy seems to build more stuff faster than your enemy and if you cannot build anything then you have destroy the enemy's capabilities to build faster than your fleet dies.\nPerhaps it's only me that has problems with that, perhaps I'm too stupid to play Void Destroyer, but this game is simply too much frustration for me.\n\nSummary:\nWhile it has many neat features and looks interesting there are simply too many frustrating problems I have with Void Destroyer to be able to really recommend it. Which is sad, since the game really has potential and the dev is active and helpful. Perhaps it's only me that has such a hard time with the game but you better make sure which category of player you fall in before you buy it. I do not consider myself too casual a player and I have played strategy games since Dune II or Warcraft I but Void Destroyer gave me The Finger.","January 25, 2015","false","12.7"," 160 of 208 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","160","208","9","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/recommended/259660/","xcutex","XcuteX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/","37 products in account","SO on the fence about this one! Short version: Homeworld meets X3, with big bugs and frequent crashes, but frequent auto-saving and short loading times to partially compensate. There are achievements for each of the endings - highest is 0.4%, total is 0.9%; that means less than 1% have even finished the game... Maybe the fact I have will add a little authority to my review.\n\nUpdate: You know, I might go so far as to say ignore the positive reviews because they don’t know what they’re talking about. If you look at them, notice how many hours played and the fact these reviewers haven’t finished the actual game: xsmasher, Morally Bankrupt, templelord, and Cyrus (90 hours, must be a beta tester). I know this makes me look stuck up “I've finished the game, I'm H@rdc0r3!”, but we can see the highest-rated helpful positive reviews are likely beta testers. And if anyone else gets the game, they’re less than 1% likely to finish.\n\nLonger:\n\nGraphics: Cell shaded. Nothing special, but the models don't get boring or look ugly. Good.\nWhen contolling ships (only in the first few levels) the ships will shake alot, like when you try to glitch through a wall and your character oscillates rapidly between two positions. The dev says this is due to "Intel graphics chips". Well I have a graphics card, but almost everybody has an Intel processor. Bad. When placing stations, icons for some items are very small (and the build method is unintuitive).\n\nStory is alright, gets into improbable coincidence territory, but alright. Need to find if there's info on the character/faction backstories.\n\nShip-to-thip combat is ok. Like a flight simulator. Flight modes are kind of whacky. Cockpit, camera chase 3rd person, and 'command' view where you control the turrets. For fighters, cockpit view. For everything else, chase view. Command view is pretty worthless since you won't be dodging fire well that way. Turrets do auto-track with Shift+A, I think. There's also a view to move the camera around your ship and admire it. There are some command ship specific issues I'll address later.\n\nTactical mode (Homeworld) is eh. An issue that only appeared toward the end is that engagement rules and ship orders will revert. You'll see dudes fly halfway to a target (target's still alive), and they just turn around and go back. I don't know what causes engagement rules (tiny buttons!) to revert, but I've given the same order 5-6 times to a group only to watch them stop caring until I gave up. Ouch.\n\nThe command ship is also iffy. At least 4 of its abilites are worthless except a few parts in the story. Command: take over enemy ships! Except about 1/3 the way through enemy ships stop being capturable. Radiation field: damage yourself and anything right next to you! Useful for two engagements where enemy drones are trying to saw their way through your ship. Quick-ish reverse: accellerate backwards sorta fast. Rarely could that benefit you. Right side shield: temporary energy shield on the right side of your ship. By the time you get this, the enemy laser weapons seem to ignore the shield. Worse than having a million bucks on a desert island. The other abilities are also iffy: tractor beam the enemy, but make sure they don't hit your ship; rapid repair, but lose control of engines and inertia takes you to wherever. The ship does passively repair, too, which is way more useful. The main gun of the ship is only useful when upgraded 5/5 during the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the game.\n\nExtra: The game is continuous - your fleet, ship upgrades, etc are preserved between areas/levels. It does feel like one big activity - first fighting miners, then running from overwhelming aliens, then fighting back against those aliens that were supposed to be overwhelming. Upgrade progression is awkward. Would have rather gotten most (except shield and the main gun) as soon as you got the command ship. Instead it's "you're at this point in the game; here is some research that should already have been done and some upgrades/repairs you should have already been able to access". The game is supposedly focused on numerical superiority, but your fleet usually forms up with the command ship and it feels like your fleet is really just one really big gun turret. The rare few times you send ships away from the main group is so you can control one of them, to act as distractions, or two instances where enemy fleets just sit there and you can irradiate part of them to death with a Bear. You'll lose/reload a lot, part from crashing, part because the game gives you a bunch of "FU" situations - the digger Cruiser you can't control, and figuring out how to keep it from drilling you to death (hit 'F'); Teardrop drones that latch onto your ship, and figuring out how to keep yourself alive (you die fast); aliens that can warp into the map wherever, and realizing they just completely bypassed your defenses. You do get an additional cruiser and carrier through the story, and the carrier's pretty boss, but they'll mostly chill far away from the fight so they don't die.\n\nAwesome idea, but ultimately you just end up loading a lot to argue with your units that refuse to reposition correctly. And the dev is working on the second game so these issues are here to stay.\n\nThumbs up if the review is helpful.","February 26","false","52.2"," 78 of 92 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","78","92","3","5"

(It truely deserves an updated review)  First of all, the dev has CLEARLY put in a TON of effort into the game.  Although, I find it hard to fault a game that has such a devoted creator, this game gets the best of both worlds with addictive gameplay and constant updates.  The game not only runs smoother than in the past, but actually has a battle editor now, with tons of new units and more to come.  Even the clunkiness I mentioned in my original review got attention.  The only thing I feel is missing now is multiplayer, as I would LOVE to play this game with friends.\n\n\nSo heres a bit about the game:\n\nYou are essentially a commander that can give orders like any space RTS style game, only you can take manual control of anything from the largest capital ships, to the capital ships indivdual turrets, to the smallest fighters (Either built or launched from a carrier).  The whole feel of the game is very unique, and it has newtonian style physics.  The models are all pretty detailed, and the gameplay is what brought me back to check out how this game has been updated.  I love games like Sins of a Solar Empire, Homeworld, and Elite Dangerous, and if you like any of those games, you will love this one too.  Just be sure to go through the tutorial when you buy this game, as there is A LOT to learn.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIts addictive, its refreshing, and I'm glad I payed $15 for this game.  Buy it without hesitation if you see it on sale.  If you like space games, you won't regret it.\n\nThe devotion the dev has show towards improving his game, as well as the actual improvements made to the game makes me want to update my score out of 10.  You don't get many indy devs who will show that they care about their game (if you keep up with gaming current events, you know what I'm talking about).  That is why, for $15, I am updating my score to a 10/10 (up from an 8/10).  You will probably get more hours out of this game than some AAA titles for a quarter of the cost.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game IS NOT 100% finished, but it is still a fun game to play.  Keep in mind that pretty much all of this game has been done by 1 person (if I heard correctly), so my review is rather forgiving.  The story is fairly challenging, the UI, however, is rather complicated.  There are some things in the game in terms of camera movement and overall functionality that make playing it somewhat of a hastle.\n\nEG:  double clicking a unit both centers the camera on it and selects all similar units, which makes you move your camera back to where you want to give them the order to go.  Another example of this is trying to give an attack order on a unit that is very far away.  You basically can't right click said unit because the detection area is so small (or non existant in some cases), so you have to manually move your camera over so your view is closer.\n\nClunkiness aside, if (or when) this game gets multiplayer, I will definitly be buying another copy to play with a friend.  I like the graphics and the overall feel of the game.\n\nIf you want a completely done and polished Homeworld 2 only with the ability to directly take control of every craft, this isn't the game for you.  Though it definitly feels inspired by Homeworld, it lacks quite a few finishing touches.  Like I said, despite the thousands of hours put into making the game, there is like literally 1 person doing all the work.\n\nReading all of the patch notes the developer seems really devoted to making this game a success, so I will definitely be following this game as it progresses.\n\nAll in all, I am having fun playing the game, and if you like space battles as much as I do, you probably will too.  It just needs a few finishing touches, but a lot of the game is there.\n\n8/10,  Always glad to put a little extra money in the pocket of an indy dev.","September 1, 2014","true","38.7"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","40","41","0","0"

The UI can feel awkward, but that's more a symptom of the game being a hybrid of two genres that are typically fairly heavy on the controls, and generally the game does a good job of preventing this from becoming a serious inconvenience. The intial learning curve can seem a bit on the steep side, but this only hearkens back to the days of Homeworld, a game that was no pushover by any means.\nTo the developer's credit, both aspects of Void Destroyer (I'll try my best to refrain from using the acronym), RTS and space sim, feel tight and function how you would expect them to, and there's satisfaction to be had in the immediate availability of a variety of vessels to pilot at your discretion, each with enough differentiation to make hopping between them more than worth the player's time.\nAlso to the developer's credit has been his conduct on the Steam forums: always-courteous and informative responses, that are, very frequently, remarkably prompt; it's the kind of behaviour that should be help up as an example to any other developers and publishers that may wish to exhibit their wares on the Steam store, and to all those that currently do.","January 25, 2015","true","11.4"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","39","41","4","0"

It reminded me of one of my favourite simulator called The Babylon Project, which is a fan made space combat sim game based in the Babylon 5 universe running on the Freespace 2 engine.\n\nThis game, while still in alpha, is quite playable and in my opinion, very enjoyable. Having played various space sim games, one thing that makes this one stand out is its Borderlands 2 style art, which I love, the fact that it follows newtonian physics, and the ability to switch between roles of being a fighter pilot or a fleet commander.\n\nHaving said that, I must warn that this game has a somewhat steep learning curve. If you're one of those people who just wanna plop down and shoot something, this isn't for you. If you've played and enjoyed games like Sins of a Solar Empire, Homeword series, and Freespace, or Wing Commander, I'd highly recommend this (though keep in mind this is an alpha). However, this is more complacated than those games, as newtonian physics introduces new challanges.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to people who like RTSes and Combat Simulator games.

I personally love the art style, and I think it works well with the game.\nGameplay wise, the control of ships is really nice but feels a bit float with some ships and slow on others. The tactical view is really good, but an option to turn off the wireframe view and have a real graphics view would be nice. The combat is fun, and challenging, but the controls work well for it.\nIt has a few tutorials that introduce you well to the game, although some of the tutorial stuff is in the single player campaign.\nBugs wise, there are very few bugs that I can find, especially for a beta, although there is a CTD bug if you have 2 screens.\n\nAnd just to top off this game, it was made by 1 person (to my knowledge) and it is better then some Triple A titles that came out in the past 5 years, seriously, he is active in the games forums and is offering a free steam key for the game if you find game breaking bugs which is nice of them, and he will deal with any issues you have with the game, and answer questions, very rare to see such an active dev.

If you ever played one of the "Homeworld" games, and wished you could jump into the driver's seat of a ship - now you can! The game "plays" very smoothly. Once you wrap your head around a few of the interface conventions and shortcuts, you'll be pretty quick at switching between crew and manual control, as well as managing your ship's throttle and picking which ship to actually sit in.\n\nThe reality that the developer managed to marry an actual, working space sim with an actual, working, "Homeworld 2 recognizable" tactical mode is a feat to be applauded. It all works about as seamlessly as I imagine is possible, and it's even more impressive when you realize that the strategy simulation can NOT be dumbed down to a "stats battle." The computer has to actually handle ship-to-ship combat with real maneuvering - and it's VERY good at it.\n\nThe CPU is so good at ship-to-ship that it actually opens the door to one of my negative points. It's true that the player taking control of a ship does not (and is not meant to) confer "superfighter" status on that ship. However, the advantage conferred by player control is so small that it easily becomes insignifcant. Yes, there were certain situations where human control did make it possible to really beat the pants off an opposing unit, but this was because the opposing unit simply could not handle a ship that was "strafe jinking." Also, the opposed unit did not have the advantage of numbers. This is not the situation the game seems to put you in most often, however, and most of the time the combat will very efficiently grind you up. Actual fighters and turret-bearing heavies will track and hit you very reliably, and "many against one" scenarios where you are at the disadvantage are not likely to go your way - lateral thrust tricks or no.\n\nAll of this is to say that I find the game marketing's empahsis on the single-ship control to be a little off the mark. Grabbing personal control over a ship really isn't the key to victory. Managing the RTS scenario is absolutely essential, and with the CPU being as good of a dogfighter as it is, you're often better off just letting the computer fly while you issue the overall orders. This deeply undermines the "fly any ship you want" idea, because it tends to make that ability a mere curiosity.\n\nA "YMMV" point (which I happen to enjoy) is that the game combines a basically manageable learning curve with very little hand-holding. I was especially impressed that the first mission with actual RTS elements did little micro-managing. You have a number of things suggested to you as things to do, but exactly how you go about them is quite freeform. You get space to make your own decisions, and you don't get artificially railroaded into checking off a bullet-pointed list in a certain order. I found it nicely refreshing. (I also found it refreshing that the "get through with minimal casualties missions" allow you enough creative leeway to actually pull off the objective with flying colors.)\n\nAn actually minor, but detail-demanding complaint is that the tactical view is not "AAA" polished. I'm not saying this to denigrate the developer's achievement, but I think it merits pointing out. The tac-view camera is actually given too much freedom, in that you can tumble the view into all kinds of weird angles without having a quick and unambiguous directional reference available to help you get your bearings back. The tumble and rotate control of the camera is very "twitchy," meaning that getting the angle you want can be a real chore. Further (and ironically) scaling the view is VERY ponderous, which is frustrating when you're trying to wrangle a bunch of ships that have run off while tracking a target, or if you're trying to get an overview of what's going on beyond your perimeter.\n\nIf I were to make a suggestion, I would ask the developer to make it such that the tac-camera's rotation and tumble were significantly slower, while the zoom and pan/dolly should be signifcantly faster. Also, I would highly recommend that the tumble be restricted to +90 degrees over the "plane of the ecliptic" (overhead view), and -45 degrees below. Full freedom of camera movement seems nice, but actually hurts situational awareness when you get all flipped around and have to re-establish your bearings.\n\nI will readily admit that I'm taking a break from this game due to getting stymied. There's a mission that I just can't seem to crack, because I can't find the course of action that will let me endure the battering my fleet is subjected to. In that, I'm a little disappointed, because I was hoping for a title where "jumping in" to a ship would really allow me to tip fights in my favor. "Void Destroyer" doesn't do that.\n\nBut, even so, this game is a brilliant piece of work. It demonstrates that this kind of idea can actually be done, and done very well.","March 12, 2015","true","14.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/recommended/259660/","Insignus","Insignus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/","520 products in account","Void Destroyer is an indie FPS/RTS Hybrid that builds off of inspirations such as the Homeworld Series and Battlezone of yore. Overall, this is a very strong game made by a very passionate one man development team that used kickstarter to generate some surprisingly good visuals and art, and I would strongly recommend it.\n\nThe story premise is as follows: You are a retired veteran commander of a military space force who is thrust back into a command role in response to a surprise attack in an un-named star system far from Earth. A series of gates link these systems. Miners and military folks don't get along. Pretty standard sci-fi space game stuff. Void Destroyer is, however, a unique and interesting execution of this concept, most notably because you can, in fact, win the game in a variety of ways, focusing on your own piloting skills, fleet/strategic management, or more likely, some mixture thereof.\n\nVoid Destroyer thus allows you to choose between jumping into a big honkin cruiser and duking it out, trying to dodge and prioritize your turrets, or you can hit space and zoom out, ordering your ships to focus fire on an enemy or attacking from a different direction to exploit a weakness. The developer has stated that this is by design, and appears to have accomplished this.\n\nThe game has campaign, skirmish, and sandbox modes. There is no multiplayer mode. Items used in sandbox or skirmish modes are based off of campaign unlocks, although the developer has posted instructions on how to get around this.\n\nThe campaign is difficult, and will require some study *You can't simply brute force your way in a "BUILD X OF THIS SUPER UNIT, KILL THOSE GUYS", but there is carry over (Your fleet persists over the campaign). The story depth is about average for its genre, not overly sophisticated, although there is a minor amount of world-building that takes place, but the dialogue (Which is text based, likely due to cost constraints) is surprisingly witty and even funny at times.\n\nBase management and resource management is minimal, but well situated (There are only three resources, which run off a percent of crew devoted to producing them). THere is a fleet size cap that varies over the campaign, and some unique units that can filter in, as well as hero and unique units. The centerpiece "Hero" unit is your command ship, a cruiser class ship that can be upgraded in a variety of interesting ways (Such as a tractor beam to to pull objects, both friend and foe) or special engine upgrades.\n\nOverall, there is a learning curve, however, there is a surprisingly helpful and frankly worded in-game guide of "If this is too hard for you, don't forget to try X and Y." Developer response and support, from my personal experience, has been strong, with pointed and considered responses over steam and in forums. If you have a serious problem with the game, there is a decent to above average likelihood the developer will respond.\n\nA note on downsides: There are situations in the game where the game will put you in unwinnable scenarios, IF YOU SO CHOOSE (Between 2 and 3 times( , without always making it completely clear through dialogue. Some players appreciate this appeal to player decision making, others will be driven up a wall by it.\n\nOverall, if you liked Homeworld or similar titles, enjoy fleet or strategic command games, or are simply a die-hard space nut, I strongly recommend Void Destroyer as a worthwhile purchase.","June 9, 2015","true","42.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

When I first got this game, I though that the advertised feature, "the ability to switch from fighter to cruiser" was nothing but a gimmick, as I found most of my time in the tactical screen. But as I continued on, I found myself needing to constantly switch from ship to ship to successfully win battles, such as needing to switch to a fighter and lead a squadron to take out some mine launchers which are harmful to my larger ships. It's pretty cool. Not only that, this game also has a time dilation ability, which allows you to slow down time to quickly manage your fleet. That is also pretty cool because most RTS games lack some form of pause feature, which can be inconvinient against the AI since they can instantly manage their units. The only problems I have with this game is a lack of a fast forward system, and friendly AI does tend to ignore orders and go after other units","September 15, 2014","true","26.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","1"

Then I got my act together, upgraded my capital ship to the fullest, built up my fleet, and spent god only knows how long whittling away at the enemy...then they sent in freaking ships with saws on them....SAWS! They glommed my capital ship and ♥♥♥♥ing ruined me. So I tried again and lured them back to my defense perimiter, letting my turrets chew them up, before sending the Marines in to capture the base and end the madness. All of this being the very first mission after the tutorial....\n\nI had to die a few times to get a good strategy, I had to lose lots of men to gain ground, my unstoppable fleet is built on the lives of thousands of men....and there's still enemies to kill, enemies that keep getting better.

I walked in thinking I could use my typical tactics only to get murdered so many times by guys with SHIPS MADE OUT OF ASTEROIDS.\n\nThis game is a labor of love by a single guy, this game is better than some AAA titles I've played....and a damn sight more challenging. I love how many features were plugged into one game, especially the combat...the combat is so in-depth that you could command your entire fleet using the Tac mode, slowing down time to set up an entire assault and then execute it in real time (like a sci-fi Rainbow 6), yet so simple that you could  hop into the captain's chair of a cruiser and never issue a single order.\n\nAs stated, this game is made and supported by one guy...and since I've gotten this game I've seen him responding to comments, inquiries, and forum posts all across the internet. He actually cares for this game, and for the people buying it, and that deserves a lot of respect.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone with a desire for a challenge.

I love that I can organize a fleet and that I can play as an individual ship.  Both parts of the game are satisfying, and the combination is terrific.\n\nI love the art style.

That's terrific.\n\nThere's bits of the interface that I hope get fixed.  In the ship mode, the locking can be strange.

While the gameplay in itself is very fun, my main gripe with this game right now is that the campaign is very difficult, giving you limited time to get back on your feet before swamping you with enemies. One enemy type in particular, the Teardrop, latches onto your command ship (that you MUST keep alive at all costs) and does damage to it, except there are 20 of them attacking your command ship at once. Brutal difficulty, especially for a relatively new player such as myself.

It is a mix between RTS & Space Sim (Think Battlezone but in space...with space flamethrowers!).\n\nBefore speaking more about the game I just want to talk about the Dev\n\nOf special note is the AMAZING commitment and involvement from the Developer.  Void Destroyer was developed by a SINGLE person so not only has he made an amazing game he is increadibly responsive to questions and feedback on the forum.  There is no lip service here as he really takes player feedback on board and is very supportive of questions or when you hit a particularily tough mission.  Again, this is a single Dev who has far better customer support/service than giant mega corps with armies of employees.  Simply amazing!\n\nThe game has three main components\n\n- Tactical Mode - Here you get a tactical view of your forces and bases.  This can play out much like a normal "RTS" where you manage your resources, production, research as well as can give orders to your ships and fleets.\n\n- Command Mode (Aka Capital Ship mode): Here is where you directly control a capital ship.  You have a variety of options here from only controlling turrets and letting to crew fly or having complete control of everthing to only handling a few turrets.\n\n- Fighter Mode - This mode is were you control a figher and plays much like traditional space fighter sims.\n\nYou can switch between these modes freely.  This allows you to maintain strategic control but also allows you to move to where the action is thickest, whether it be duking it out with cruisers or in a tense figther furball.\n\nThe game is quite challenging, especially as it will take awhile to get a handle of all the various components but there is a fantastic sense of achievement when you finally crush your enemy beneath your boot!  Void Destroyer where victory is earned not given.\n\nAlso the Dev has designed the missions to not only be challenging but also each mission is different, presenting different challenges & handicaps(rather than just throwing more/powerful enemies at you).  The plus side is that the missions do not get boring, it doesn't feel like repeating a previous mission, each has to be handled differently in order to triump.\n\nIf you like Space Sims, strategy and Flamethrowers this is definatly a game worth trying and imo at it's current price it is a steal!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED","January 25, 2015","true","32.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you hit any key while holding right mouse to orbit the view, you have to release rmb and hold it again to continue orbiting, that's really nasty\n- the combat element of the game is awesome, ai seems pretty good, but still stupid enough to split a lingering grp by kiting. For the rts element, the timeslowingdown-thingy is great, especially if you aren't familiar with all the stuff and need to take some deeper looks. The feedback in combat like "ship ... destroed" is a bit too less for my taste. Having a vanishing list of actions would taste better if you ask me, because it is super easy to miss actions this way, and you may not have the time to watch the fight in realtime.\n\nHowever, 15 bucks, totally WORTH IT!

Controls are, "different." After an hour of fooling around, just trying to figure out what the hell to do with a command ship, I still have no clue what to do. At times the controls seem to have a slow response time, or not work at all.\n\n2. I had some annoying graphical problems. I have a hard time believing that the developer wanted grey ships, grey asteroids, all on a grey background. Shortly after this problem, textures stopped loading, leaving me with giant black spots on my screen where objects should be. From the images on steam, the game had a very appealing contrast. Which, I do not seem to have on my computer. Also, my cursor was constantly disappearing in tactical view and when switching ships.\n\n3. There are points in the storyline that leave me asking, "How am I supposed to do this?" and "I am spamming ESC why won't the storyline window go away??" I really wish there were free roaming options, just to explore the vastness of space.\n\n\nI do enjoy this game. I love battling through space in small incredibly fast ships.

I've seen depth to the RTS element - and I've seen depth to the dog fighting, (for example you can fly to keep all your guns on the enemy - and keep most of the enemies guns off you).\n\nThe game's UI needs some work at the moment.  Sometimes the rotation axes are unintuativly the "wrong" way around.  So this game can make you bounce off it quite hard.  Bot it is actually worth sticking with it.  The game clicks after about six hours or whatever I've just been playing it for now.\n\nThe tutorials are good - but weak at the moment - and I know how hard tutorials are to make. . . . But I didn't know untill now how you get fighters to form up on my main ship.  Also I don't know how you get more ships in space than the five the main base can spew out. . . . The enemies can launch dozens in one go.  I've just got the ships I survived the first encounter with plus the five I can have in space from the main base, , , is that possible?\n\nSo - not everything is fully polished at the moment.\n\nAnother issue. . .Weird rotational controls seems to swap the axes all the time.  F5 is one way - tactical is the other.  Also the transition between tactical and and F5 seems to take forever and you can't interupt it. . .Annoying.\n\nBUT.  The game seems to be golden.  I'm going to leave it for a couple of months now - and I really look forward to what the author does with it.  When I do play it - I think this one will be worth it to wait till it is a bit moar better :)  And I really will monitor it and look forward to it.\n\nIt is going to rock - and I've already had my 5 hours or whatever it was worth of fun out of it.

Both the RTS and Flight Simulator aspects of the game impressed me.  While I haven't spent a lot of time trying out the RTS side of things yet, I do appreciate the ability to slow things down, issue orders, and speed things back up again.  There are also a lot of different commands available that you can assign to individual ships.  The flight sim side reminded me a bit of Battlestar Galactica in the sense that you can strafe in one direction while pointing in another (by turning off smart thrust).  The ability to switch off between different ships is a nice touch too.  There's a lot here for the $15 price tag and is thus an easy recommend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsbhDO8jgdg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOQ0KtF0qMY","January 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I had it on my wishlist for a while and finally had the extra money to buy it and I'm really glad I did.  There is a lot of control given to you in the game.  You can move your entire fleet with ease, set up formations multiple different ways, pilot each ship in your fleet or fire an individual turret.  The dev gives you multiple different control schemes; each one has benefits depending on the ship you're piloting.\n\nThe campaign has been challenging so far but you learn a lot in the earlier missions and you'll apply this knowledge to the missions to win.  You can tweak the difficulty if needed too.\n\nThere is a skirmish / quick battle mode with a bunch of scenarios.  You can set up base battles or just a 10v10 epic dogfight bonanza! Go nuts!\n\nA guide is accessable in-game to check up on topics while playing.  It's pretty in-depth and reviews almost everything in the game.  Part of the fun is also figuring out how things work and experimenting.  I had fun sitting in a ship, equipped with a flamethrower (yep a mutha♥♥♥♥in' thrower of flame in space) clearing out an area of space while I parked the rest of my fleet back at the gate, told them to rest up for the next big fight.  There's a few ways to accomplish each mission, are you an RTS player?  Fine, go HAM on the Tac Map and RTS the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game, or you can #quickscope420blazit and pilot a fighter to go all Maverick on the enemy.  You can do both, almost at the same time.  Speaking about time, you can slow it down.  Well, you actually speed your brain up which gives the illusion of everything else slowing down, think NEO in the Matrix.  This bullet-time lets you set up your RTS strategy and then resume rocking enemy's worlds in a turret on your capital ship.\n\nThe dev is also very active in the forums/discussion boards, so drop him a line and you'll get a response.  (Well I can't guarantee that because I don't know the guy, but he responded to me within a few hours).\n\nGreat game, check it out.  I don't know of any others that give you this amount of control.","December 7, 2015","true","24.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Void Destroyer, like Homeworld breaks that mold and goes beyond it too with the ability to control individual ships.\n\nControls are a bit clunky for me - sometimes w/out knowing I tend to revert to HW controls, which feel more fluid with this type of gameplay imo, I'd love it if there was a way to have it similar to that.\n\nThere's a lot to learn and remember in this game and I found I needed to do the tutorial again to refresh my memory after not playing for some time.\n\nOverall though, I'm really enjoying this game.

No need to be an Octopus though since controls are well thought (1 button to switch between tactical & combat, 2 command to select a ship & enter it...) but you need to make your brain work to record all those controls - still, it's less than X3 & arma 3 to quote the worst, and you know how much we love those games.\n\nThe combat feeling is amazing. I'm used to the X3 series flying model which looks rather flat compared to Void Destroyer. Indeed, It's closer to Freelancer (Newton based physics) so fighters feels like jets but damn when you boost it really boost! If you've never experienced a 30vs30 fights where you're just another ship -in the middle of ships you've made- (like an X-wing you know..) Void Destroyer could be the game to lose your virginity!\n\nThe base management part is reduced to simple tasks that you can perform under an unlimited bullet time effect (so that you don't miss the fight). Basically, you'll adjust sliders to optimize income according to your currents actions: station building, ships productions & research. I really like how the interface is handling the job here, once you get it it's easy to start a research, build a couple of ships and set their rally point. The point in the strategic part is to analyze your ennemy, build the adequate type of ships & overcome the ennemy.\n\nThen, that's where the game surprised me a lot, CONTENT! Let's just throw it: Solo Campaign (Hard & Persistent), Showcases/Single Mission (Worth doing since it unlocks ships for Random Battle), Editor, Free Open World DLC... It only lacks multiplayer. And ships, so many ships.. Bad ♥♥♥ cell-shaded ships!\n\nIf you're into cell-shading it won't graphically be a problem for you, then it's all about taste. I really enjoy the design here and it renders good in space, first time i see this so far. Technically speaking, the only thing about Void Destroyer i don't like is the sound! It's too quiet in my opinion and i'd love the music to be more present in the game. On the contrary, sound effects serve the game well and give essential information in the middle of the fight i.e ship construction finished, capital ship upgrade. The game is stable and i saw a developper saying he'll offer a key if you can find a game breaking bug. Just get quickly around the steam community hub to see how the support is real, this game is alive & Void Destroyer 2 is on its way.\n\n\nWorth at any price for every Space Sim fan. If you've have never experience this kind of game before, consider that the time to learn this kind of game is long (between 5 to 10h) but extremely rewarding. There are tutorials in this game that can give you enough confidence to have fun in a "short" time. How will you be rewarded? Epic battle, a nice feeling of freedom and the sensation to master a hardcore piece of video game. Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n","June 19, 2015","true","53.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Congratulations, Void Destroyer!  You did it.  I wanted to like this game, too.  Every game it's been compared to I like.  I've played dozens of space combat sims over the years.  Very few I haven't liked.  The same goes for space strategy games.  Combining these 2, I thought I wouldn't be able to stop playing this game.  Then I made it to mission 2.\n\nI've loved the Wing Commander series.  Free Space was awesome.  The X series has taken hundreds if not thousands of hours of my life.  The dog fighting in this game, it just doesn't do it for me.  I understand things have to be dumbed down because of  assortment of ships you can control, but I didn't enjoy that part.\n\nI can just control everything tactically!  That'll be fun!  And it was.  It worked great through mission 1.  Every time I accidentally went back to ship mode I made sure to put an end to that crap with a quick tap of the space bar.  Things were great.  Then came mission 2...\n\nBoss fights?  Some really fast, yet massive ship with drills on it.  It starts about to ram your command ship, hits you, knocks you around, you explode.  Over a dozen times I tried this fight, I lost.  I hated to do it, but I looked for help online.  Some people suggested lowering the difficulty.  I tried the “lose 30% health” feature so that giant drill thing died faster.  Nothing happened.  I tried it back in mission 1.  Nothing happened.  The difficulty option doesn't do anything.\n\nI tried a few more times, followed any advice I found, I died.  I threw smaller ships in it's path.  Apparently there isn't hit detection for them.  Straight through the big ship with no damage done and on it comes, smashing my ship.  Is this a bug?  The sound is horribly buggy so it wouldn't surprise me if collision didn't work correctly.\n\nThe only advice I didn't try was to dogfight with your command ship.  I don't want to dogfight in this game any longer.  Honestly, nothing leading up to mission 2 trained you for this completely off the wall fight.  It's almost like the developer put it in the game as a parody.\n\nObviously my experience isn't the norm.  There are quite a few positive reviews for this game.  I'm glad people liked this game.  I wanted to like it.  I like challenging.

It's a 3D space-shooter/rts hybrid that allows you to jump between any of your army's craft and control them directly, in the style of Urban Assault. However, I very quickly ran into serious problems with the gameplay. While I applaud the developer for creating such intricate and precise controls, I found them immensily convoluted and very quickly had to switch to the optional "arcade-style" controls. As someone who grew up playing space sims like the X-Wing and Tie Fighter games, this was rather humbling. However, Void Destroyer's real flaw is it's difficulty. I made it only a few levels into the campaign, on the easier of only two difficulty options, before I was utterly torn to pieces by the game's merciless AI. Void Destroyer uses Homeworld's campaign mechanic of limiting you in some missions to units you had produced in a previous mission, and forces you to carefully manage your fleet's resources- on top of dogfighting enemies in person with the afformentioned controls. I'm not sure wether I need an extra pair of hands or an extra brain or both, but until I get such, I won't be touching this game again.","July 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","1"

It's not that it's hard, because I like a game that doesn't pull punches, nor is it about complexity because I also like games that make you think.\n\nHowever, when the 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th time your ship does not do what it is asked to do, you start to wonder. When your ship becomes magically immobile because enemies spawned in/on your ship and you cannot kill them while they're glitched into your hull, so you die you really wonder.\n\nThe hints/tips seem like an afterthought, not because they offer the player help after they died, but more because they offer information that was never told to you in the first place. For example, in the first mission you apparently have a super weapon (or something), but you won't find out about it unless you die. You'd think it would be pointed out, when it is literally the first ship you sit in.\n\nI asked Steam for a refund (which I got), because the game just did not live up to expectations. I did not want to exceed the 2 hour cut off, so maybe the game did not get a fair shake, but I would be hard pressed to consider buying this game a second time with the experience I had.\n\nThis is the only game I have ever asked a refund for, so even though I really want to like it, I am not sure I can honestly recommend this game.","September 1, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","6"

There is obviously going to be some comlexity given there are so many different modes and movement options in 3D space, but the controls didn't transition smoothly. Swapping between ship modes and the tactical mode was not clean. I noticed a couple times that when I switched from tactical back to my command ship, it was unresponsive. The HUD just jittered some, and I couldn't get the ship to move through manual flying. The game crashed once and then randomly minimized about 4 times in the middle of gameplay. I spent 4 hours today doing the tutorials and the first couple storyline missions and finally gave up.

How about Art? People love art!\n\nArt:\n\nThe art style in this game is just fantastic, beautifully presented, very well maintained. You can really see that alot of care has gone into making this game gorgeous. Alright, It's not like it's some ultra realistic simulation of nebula and dust cloud (If you want that sort of stuff, Go look at Limit Theory) BUT, It reminds me alot of Borderlands. Cell Shading, Toony, Dark and Grimey? GORGEOUS!\n\nGameplay:\n\nSuperb, Absolutely mind bogglingly good, and from a solo developer? Holy hell. Paul (The dev) Has really put in a ton of time and effort into this game. And, after the kickstarter, has used his various new resources to completely revolutionise the art style, UI, and better improve the games mechanics and AI. He continues to polish and improve this game, NEVER considering something "Finished" (Damned fussy :P) I hope that, One day, I can be half the developer he is. Maybe I'd even get on Steam too! Anyway, Tactics, Cross-System fights (Practically), Large scale combat (Much akin to X3, Sins of a Solar Empire etc), Jumping from a fighter to a large scale capital ship/carrier to annihilate your foes? ALL IN REAL TIME? WITH EVERY HEART STOPPING MOMENT THRILLING YOU TO YOUR VERY CORE! Brilliant, simply wonderful. For this alone, I recommend it!\n\nStory:\n\nAll right, So on to something I'm never good at understanding stories within game, but bugger it, I'll give a quick brief.\n\nYou are in charge of a small fighter ship, performing your basic training routine, no biggy. But you get summoned, some sort of disturbance? A fight perhaps? Ah well, You go and check anyway. Then bam! You are thrust into a civil war! With raiders in one corner, You in another, All whilst fighting off that damned rebelion of mining vessels! Damn it men we have a war to stop!\n\n\n\nIn short, I CANNOT recommend this game more, It's simply wonderful. I REALLY urge you to pick this game up and just try it!

It's true that the audio/soundtrack might not live up to AAA standards and that the video quality and shading cannot be compared to one such as Homeworld Remastered, but the gameplay and reproduction of how space should work is top notch.\n\nThe difficulty spike and the general UI complexity are still there (i.e. a hovering tooltip of what each command/button does would greatly help reduce the complexity of the game).\n\nOne tip for those playing the game: Be sure to read the forums or post questions about the problems you are having. More often than not, the developer will straight up patch the game to fix your problem or offer you quick and simple solutions to what you can do to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\nThough one gripe I have is how gamey the game feels sometimes i.e. that the game tends to focus on one particular solution if you want to survive the game till the end. You can do the riskier move but you'll whittle down your forces that makes the end game harder (as you are left with less ships when you reach the end game). That tends to make the game slower as you slowly make every careful move to get the result you want.\n","March 4, 2015","true","32.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I've tried to like it, I've tried to learn it and it just sucks.\nThe controls are convoluted, the mouse is so floaty It feels like I'm blowing on a rubber duck to get it to face the right way in a bathtub. So my dogfights are just me trying to get the enemy into my view screen and failing. I've seen videos of other players struggling with flying so its not just me. And even when I succeed I only have one weapon to shoot with. Other games have more feedback and a "fire all weapons" button. They have more strategy that "shoot it till its dead".\nThe dogfights are like driving bumper cars with nerf guns.\n\nI tried the sandbox mode and I'm thrown into the game and given a target. A target I know nothing about because I have no HUD info. And some other guy shoots it down before I do. Who is he? What was that? And what am I flying? I try to find the options to select new ships, new enemies, map, etc. Nothing. No info. Two minutes into my first game and some guy shot my only target.\n\nI then try the regular mode. I'm going through the in game instructions and then get stuck at the beginning because Im told to go through the jump gate but I have to go at full speed while holding alt-o, right click, f13, a turducken and a shoe. As I keep bouncing off of things, I start to realize I might be at the wrong structure, nothing shows up on HUD to identify it. I got as far as parking it at a "base" and waiting for some ships to be built.\nVD has a lot of hidden options that you can learn but there is nothing fun about any of it. Whats the use of having three different ways to do something when none of them make you more in control?\nThis game is trying to capture the feeling of Homeworld but fails miserably because in Homeworld you care about your base and your ships. They are yours, you have some control over your circumstances, you have agency in the game. VD just throws you in and says "don't fail" without any help or info at all.

On the first level where you get the command ship and you have to upgrade it and build other ships, the game constantly attacks you and does not let you build your forces. They should call the game protect the command ship because that is all I am doing. Forget trying to attack or complete objectives. Just let me learn how to play the game first before you send wave after wave. The difficulty setting is a joke. It has a setting to reduces the enemy ships health by 10 20 or 30%. However it ADDED to their health. WTF! I think the developer made this game for himself and did not consider what it would be like for a first timer to start playing this game. For a positive the concept is great, having a shooter with a RTS. The interchange between the two is almost perfect.

I tried to learned the controls (and gameplay for that matter) about 4 or 5 times.   The whole time I kept thinking "why is it so hard to do everything in this game?"  I have been gaming for 25+ years.  This isn't my first rodeo nor will it be my last.\n\nTo be fair, the premise of the game is simply awesome: massive space battles, control of ANY ship in the battle and an RTS game behind the scenes making it work.  Its the execution that really hurts the game out of the box.\n\nI read the developer notes.  I get the idea that this is a throw back to the truly complex and wonderful simulations of the golden years of PC gaming but there is a problem: the developer put too many ideas into one box and couldn't decide what to take out.\n\nFor example: Flying a command ship requires 5 different viewpoints, several functions (that you can turn on or off), and manual control of the weapons to even get any use out of them.  Flying a small fighter plane is much easier to understand but now your command ship is a sitting duck because you aren't in control.  By the way, THERE IS AN ENTIRE RTS mechanic that you have to manage behind the scenes.  To make it even worse, the control scheme is much more complicated that it needs to be.  Simple commands take multiple button presses when you probably just want to move forward.  The key mapping configuration is a nightmare.  It makes flight simulator feel like simon-says.\n\nMy message to the developer:\n\n1. Fix the wonky and honestly, broken RTS portion.  Either simplify it or cut it our completely.  It COULD work if it was reduced to its strong points:  command and control.  Get rid of all the clunky base management and simplify the control scheme.  Remove or streamline what the command ship needs to do to be effective.  Waiting in base doing nothing is extremely boring.\n\n2. Streamline how capital ship control works.  We don't need 5 different ways just to do one thing.  Pick something and make it the main way to control the ship.\n\n3. Reduce the overall key mapping and massively overhaul the controls.  I can't stress this enough.\n\nMy personal message to the developer:  I seriously LOVE the idea behind this game.  It has so many cool things I just wish it worked...better.\n\nI want to be extremely clear that the developer's time and effort is not wasted.  I can't imagine how hard it is to do something like this.  The person driving this vision has development talent some people can only dream of.  The execution of this game can be fixed if the right steps are taken.\n\nThere is a great game in here somewhere.  I can see hints of brilliance but right now its just muddled in needless complexity.

I've never reviewed any game, but the disengenious store page copy infuriates me to no end, and since I can't just get a refund, this is my only option.\n\nWhile the game louds that it supports multiple play styles and pretends to allow gamepad input, it does not. If you want to use a game pad you will be able to roll your ship and fire the main weapon. End of list. You cannot accelerate, turn, pitch up, or anything else.\n\nThere is an interface to set the controls, and it simply refuses to set the controls. I was able to add "fire secondary weapon" to a trigger after about 10 minutes of trying. Everything about the games interface claims it will allow a joystick or gamepad, but it doesn't.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that lets you dogfight using your joystick or gamepad, I suggest buying any chess simulator, it will be closer to the experience you're looking for than this game.\n\nAnd yes, I've played plenty of dog fighting games using my gamepad (this exact gamepad) and it's never had an issue with any of those, as well as dozens of other games.

Instead i got clunky controls, a migraine, and a sore throat. Let it be know, i love this genre, and I am no stranger to RTS games either. Something about this game though just didn't click. I spent 2 hours trying to fight my way through the tutorials to learn this aggravating control scheme, and 3 hours playing the actual game. Only making it to the first base building mission before i just quit. In that time i experienced frequent crashes, auto saves right before i die (slots 1 and 2), and more than my fare share of aggravation.\n\nWith an engineering background, I’m very familiar with working in a 3D space, so I spent most of my time in the Tactical mode. The counterintuitive controls however, made it so that I could only to watch my units die one by one as the dumb AI targets enemies that I tell them not to and get overwhelmed on their way to the complete opposite end of the battlefield.\n\nEven switching to manual control of the ships didn't help much as the targeting system would insist on targeting everyone besides the enemy in front of me that I happen to already be shooting at. Even going to turret mode for a better view only successfully gave me a better view of the hull of my ship before it gets blown up half of the time.\n\nThe loading times going in and out of tactical mode killed me. I don't want the ship I’m in; I want to see the map so I can choose something else that’s you know, TACTICAL! But nope! I need to wait until the game allows me to do anything that I want to do. All the while I get to listen to the groaning of the game telling me that I can't do what I want.\n\nMaybe this game would be better with a sound track, who knows? I only heard 1 song, and when it ended, I did one final assault, lost everything, and rage quit. I hate to leave things half finished, and I paid good money for this game, but nothing is worth this much of a headache. Too bad it was a complete waste of my time and money.\n","April 13, 2014","false","5.2"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","14","37","0","6"

I have boiled it down to a few things that desperately need attention. I am changing it to a recommended game because the developer actually seems to be intent on taking down suggestions.\n\nYour first person mode and switching between pilot seat and gunner seats and ALL interactions with the game from your first person perspectives are great. 10/10\n\nThey remind me a lot of playing older space sims like star wars and even a little battlestar galactica. I had played mechwarrior in the past as well and the speed setting where you can set speed using backspace feels right at home.\n\nYour dedication to making the game intense and fun is VERY well displayed in your pilot mode in game.\n\n\nCommand mode is purely my area of dislike. As I stated in my previous posts (which I admit were slightly raging) this area of the game is where 90% of my issues stem from. I can see where you tried to blend RTS and FPS into one. Not the first time this has been done and surely the attempt is commended. Dungeon Keeper did this and it was pretty good. The problem with meshing the two is trying to balance them. I know it's probably friggin' hard.\n\nDuring engagements I feel that It's better to stay in my ship of choice and engage enemies because I get the biggest bang for my buck that way. While in command mode, I feel crippled. Map size is small, it's hard to simply move my mouse to control things.\n\nBasically what I'm getting at is you nailed the FPS but you missed some of the hallmarks that make RTS games good. When all your units are just green dots it's hard to select a group of what you want easily. Take Rome Total War. On the battlefield you have unit cards. Not in your game. You have a unit window but it's not that easy to navigate as you aren't sure what units are in your line of vision and what ones aren't. You're selecting two fighters in the list yet one might be halfway across the map. You just don't know. Perhaps find a way to make the command interface for viewing your units easier. Color coordinate them by class? Not sure. You're the developer.\n\nSometimes when in command mode and I try to use WASD to move the camera it moves slower than crap. That seems hit or miss. I can look past that. Mouse movement seems fine. Tooltips. Need tooltips.\n\nGoing back to the command mode. I know you can hotkey select units using keys, but again, a hallmark of most RTS games on the market make that much easier. Your zoom level isn't terribly helpful. I can't seem to zoom out to get a bigger picture of the field.\n\nThere's no other way to really say it, but your RTS mode in the game is needing work. From unit management to building. I have so far played the majority of the game using pilot mode and the only reason I go to command mode is to move groups around sparingly or build. I can't even really get a good feel for how moving units in command mode will make an impact on the battle. I actually get much more out of the game by going into a ship and blowing ♥♥♥♥ up myself as opposed to struggling with the interface to try issuing commands. I feel that takes away from a lot of what you're trying to do and I feel that entering command mode (which should give you MORE options and MORE control over the battlefield) actually takes away from your ability to conduct your business in the game.\n\nIf you can find a way to make command mode feel more like command mode in terms of unit management, issuing orders and navigating your environment it will go a long long long way to making this a better experience for new and old players alike.\n\nI feel that the way the game is made right now you should be getting more things accomplished in command mode than in pilot mode. And at this time it feels reversed. If your goal is to create a more FPS immersive experience then you may as well cut back heavily on the amount of RTS you have currently in the game because it will go mostly to waste and not get much attention.","January 15, 2014","true","1.9"," 14 of 49 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","14","49","0","8"

I hooked up my xbox 360 controller hoping for an easier way to interact with the game but no dice, don't bother with this game if you are accustomed to maybe 14 buttons and a few combinations. Void Destroyer expects you to learn dozens scattered around the keyboard thus making the game frustrating for anybody who was looking to jump into the action rather then drive a flight simulator.","July 3, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mouse is VERY sensitive to the point that it move's on it's own.There is invisable wall's were I am supposed to go. And the gravity jump is very buggy and unresponsive. I hope you can get these bug's fixed in the near future.","February 16, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

The difficulty spikes the game likes to throw at you aren't challenging in a legitimate sense; the game just likes to overwhelm you with poorly explained information or mechanics that is then accompanied by various gimmicks and hordes of enemy units. After i overcame them i didn't have a sense of accomplishment, i only thought to myself "yay, i finally found a way to cheese this nonsense, or figured out how to X, now i get to do it again next level"...\n\nIf you are looking to play more on the dogfighting side of things, you'll probably need to stick to the custom games; in the campaign you will be hard pressed to succeed managing a victory without your constant attention being devoted to a tactical overview.\n\nAll in all, this game has a lot of potential that is beset upon by the various frusturating aspects, such as: poor controls, that "clunky" feeling, bugs, crashes,  and general lack of polish. An example of this is the upgrade on the Wardrum that shoots missile mines. If you shoot enough of them, it crashes your game..\n\nWho knows, maybe void destroyer 2 will meet that potential, but it isn't met here and the quality of the game just isn't there.\n\n6/10","April 1, 2015","false","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story mode was long, and VERY diffcult, had to exsploit some points where the AI was somewhat lacking in order to get past alot of stages. I feel like this game needs some more work but was worth the play through.","June 3","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
