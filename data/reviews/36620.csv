Cash rules in this game, I quit after many many exploits were exploited by less than honorable users. Despite this, exploiters were given hand slaps.  It became an inside joke in the game that if you discovered an exploit, abuse the hell out of it before anyone found out.\n\nAs if you needed another reason, the balance in this game is god awful.  Basically, you have 3 trees per class.  Only one of these is viable in pvp.  That's if you chose a class that's viable in pvp at all.  Set teams rule arena, (I was in one) which is like queue, accept, cast 5 spells, battle over in 1 min.\n\nWhat ruined this game?  The cash shop.  You can spend up to what your cc can stand.  Pure straight up CC to power. Several people have spent over $100K USD. No, that's not a typo.\n\nI would be remiss to not point out that the game is beautiful.  It does have it's strengths.  If you don't pvp, the dungeons can be fun.  There's not raids as such, and don't take forever.  It's quick fun runs, they did that right.  There are dailies, but not onerous.\n\nIf you don't have 10K lying around, getting into this game at this late date, you'll never be good at pvp.  If you just like beautiful games and exploring, give it a try.\n\nOh, and the global chat is NSFW and not safe for children, thought I should mention that.","November 7, 2014","false","366.3"," 130 of 145 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","130","145","17","5"

I managed to get to max level, all but two purple gear,and level 1 wings. All of this with minimal cashshoping(Only $80, which in Forsaken Worlds, IS minimal).\n\nI've also managed to play this game with a guild who during most of the game, was very postive about the guild and could always see upsides. Until about 6 months ago, we all had faith in Forsaken World lasting a lot more years, espically since an connent update has just came out that was supposed to be HUGE. Unfournatly, it wasn't. We got about 1/3 of the things China has gotten, and the things we did get was either very glitchy or very VERY grindy. To the point where, the only thing interesting that really came from the update was the incraed level cap(Which was still next to impossible to get without countless hours of grinding).\n\nAs if a stripped down overhyped update wasn't enough, there was a huge bug that where if you exploited it enough, you get max level, with plenty of items. The Product Manager, at this point, took  weeks to acknowledge that the expliot WAS a thing and that it needed to be addressed. He stated that they were banning each and everyone of the people who explioted it, rather they were cashshopper or not. Unfournatly, that also was untrue. Months later, we still had people who clearly explioted the bug, running around in the few active PVP instances runing it for everyone.\n\nTo stop the expliot from happening, the GM's decided that the only way to fix it was to change server times for every server. While this seemed fine to some people who could now do events that were late at night, it was devasting to everyone who was optimzed for their timezone.  Many people had to miss certain important events in game due to the new server times. To add insult to injury, tthe patch that they added this in, was unannounced and unaddressed for days after. About a wek later, the GM's finally discovered our hate for this change, and made a poll addressing if it should be changed back, with different changes added. This was addressed with a huge 'CHANGE IT BACK'. Months later, we're still getting "We are unable to complete the results of this poll at this time".\n\nTo top all of this sad turn of events up, after the poll, we had one of our GM's(Who was the most/only helpful one) transfered to their new game. This was followed by all of the rest of our GM's going silent. We would go weeks without hearing a response from any GM's  and when we did, it was either only to address issues for the cashshop, or was not useful at all. This is still going on now, as well.\n\nSo, to sum all of this up, we had a stripped down overhyped contnet update, with an extreme amount of bugs We also had a huge expliot that was addressed by harming many people without getting reverted. We also have had very little  communication from our GM's. If I were you, I would suggest not playing this game unless you don't mind glitchyness and minimal communication.","September 30, 2014","false","105.5"," 93 of 108 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","93","108","4","8"

There is a bot system for farming exp and points wich is stupid as hell way to ruin an online game.\n\nPriests have a hard life everything is expensive as hell for them like the scrolls skills (wich arent distribute automaticaly, anyone can roll on it) some agree to roll class but there is always one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that will steal it and leave the party. Maybe the only good side now is the pvp wars that has awards but it is up to the guild leader to distribute and some will lie to keep the awards for themselves.\n\ni have officialy quit early 2012 after 9/10 of my friends dumped that game down. i had a great time on that game before it all changed, wich is a shame i never found another MMORPG that good, ty perfect world for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ruining it. its now a very bad game.","December 1, 2013","false","571.7"," 138 of 185 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","138","185","0","4"

Early levels aren't too bad, and a lot of the dungeon mechanics are actually very interesting and fun.\n\nBy the time I stopped playing, game development had been going in an increasingly bad direction. Things were becoming increasingly and ridiculously grindy. I suppose in some recognition that it was too grindy, they implemented a bot system that would control your character in a limited fashion that helps with some of the more mundane grinding.\n\nAt some point, even with sinking ridiculous hours into the game, it's nearly impossible to be competitive without cash shop purchases. Dungeons start to become gear-gated. Many of what were once challenging dungeon mechanics become trivial once you hit a gear threshold. And you end up running these dungeons a ton of times because of how grindy the game is, and it really becomes a chore.\n\nBoth in PvP and PvE, class balance doesn't seem to be handled very well, which becomes increasingly clear the farther you progress. This may have been fixed in the meantime, but was one of the main reasons (along with client instability and the absurd amount of grinding) that I stopped playing. I was playing one of the two classes that were considered basically unviable in PvP (Protector and Marksman).\n\nOn the plus side, I've heard good things about large scale PvP and inter-server PvP have been added as well, but it's not enough to make me come back to what I feel is a broken game.","November 27, 2013","false","304.8"," 82 of 106 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","82","106","0","0"

Terrible.\n\nFirst of all, this is the biggest most blatant pay to win I've ever played. Like, shamelessly so.\n\nPlayed it for a full year, maxed out 5 characters, and although there are ways to get the "good stuff" as a free to play, it takes months. and by then, a new update is out with more stuff.\n\nThe game has a ton of systems which pop up every update that just pile up on top of each other to make it exponentially more and more confusing or give you more annoying tasks to do on a daily basis. Just doing the "dailies" takes 2 hours everyday, sometimes doing the same quest 6+ times in a row.\n\nThe biggest issue is the wiki for the game though: there's nothing in it.\n\nWant an example? There's a newer class in the game. try going to the official site and find out info about it. You won't be able to, because it'll direct you to the wiki, which does not even list the class.\n\nThis reflects a lot ingame. People who have played this for months often are shocked when someone reveals a basic mechanic to them. No one knows where to look for information and most people don't know how things work. Late game content requires both ludicrously powerful gear and intimate knowledge of the asinine instance/boss gimmicks.\n\non a personal note, I didn't like how it overrewards PVP over PVE.\n\nMaybe it's not the worse MMO of it's kind, but it's WAY up there.","June 22, 2015","false","557.7"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","47","59","9","0"

Unfortunatly playing them once again I have almost completely changed my opinion of them.  Though this is more of a neutral review to at least let others take a chance at it.\n\nOpinions:\n-Community is not as big anymore meaning there are less people to play with. Though if you just started you may not notice this.\n-Nicely designed maps but if you are like me nitpicking at everything you can see some things don't line up.\n-Plenty of classes and species to choose from.\n-One-Click. If you just click on your Quest Log you can complete everything without lifting a finger.\n-Pay to Survive. Though you don't neccessarly have to pay to play, you have to pay to survive. Better equipement, mounts, weapons etc.\n-Pay to start a guild...? No thanks! I can find better ways to spend my money.\n-Quests are not exciting especially Solo. I use to think some quests were okay, now they are just boring.\n-Graphics could be better but are not bad when it comes to some things.\n-Get a pet and fly for free.

It has a large player base that you can do pug's with or join a guild of like minded players if you hate pug's like I do. There is plenty to do other than instances but it will get repetitive very quickly. But over all if you don’t have a lot of time to invest daily in a MMO, this might suit you as it has key features designed to attract the casual MMO player.\n\nNow for the PVP in this game.... STAY AWAY, its 100% pay to win if you want to be competitive. Its possible to be somewhat competitive but in no way will you achieve top rankings without a deep wallet or many years devoted to char development and gearing.","February 15, 2015","true","592.2"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","1"

Only 1 major problem with it. PWE runs this game. They don't care about the players if said player is hacked and loses everything PWE will tell you "You are out of luck we can't do anything." Customer Service is terrible. The only way to catch up to older players is probably spending about $100 a day. That is how bad the cash shop is. PWE also does not punish players for exploits. In fact they say "Stop doing it or we will issue bans." But they never hand out bans so you can essentially get away with everything in the game. With FW being down to 1 staff member that is product manager you can tell that this game won't recieve any love. You want something fixed. PWE won't fix it. They must ask Wanmei first before doing anything and must wait for fix. If there is one.\n\nTL;DR   This game is not worth your time.

Preferably you should also choose one of the more crowded servers. From Europe? go Illyfue. The US? Lionhart. Anyhow, this MMO is special compared to the many others I've played, since It has several pretty fun Daily and Weekly event, a decent amount of instances you can run and even a even where you wage war against other guilds for territories. The downside to the game being, the lower levels are not as fun. You'll have to preferably be lvl 75 and higher to enjoy most of the most fun event that this game has to offer. As a guildleader in this game I often see players eagerly joining the game just to quit 3-4 days later. So you gotta really step up your early game!\n\nWell, besides lots of pretty neat event going on. This is a very nice game for when you have achived max lvl, since there are always upgrades to do for your Avatar, whether it be getting the best PVE or PVP gear, fortifying gear to the max (harder than it sounds) or increasing your resistances for that extra PVP durability. Well, to new players this most probably sounds like a heap of gibberish.\n\nNow the last part I wanted to mention, which ofcourse makes the game more fun but can be annoying for regular players. Are the people who CS (cash shop for real money). With CS'ing you get the option of for example Marrying someone in the game including marriage quests, various amounts of fashion to make your character look nice, pets, mounts and Orb (basically open them to randomly get lesser rewards - epic rewards depending on your luck).\n\nLuckily most of these things can be achived by buying them from the ingame auction house.\n\nIn the end I would definitly recommend this game, since it means a lot to me and has brought me tons of enjoyable moments, more than any other MMO so far. Heck I even met my current Girlfriend in this game. To me this is more than a game, it's become a part of my life. Also I usually play on Arc another substitute to steam. See the Hours on record?\n91 Days 21 hours + those few 125 hours. If that doesn't convince ya idk.\n\nAnyhow have a good one and ty for reading this far xD ~Zeroshira","August 20, 2015","true","127.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","1"

Or maybe just for fun?), I'm about 90% sure (I haven't played this in a while) that they have  one of those automatic running systems where you click on a highlighted word in the quest bo and it automatically runs you there, and a few other less important ones.\n\nThe only thing bad about this game that I can say is that PvP is ridicously Pay 2 Win. If you're not willing to put up hundreds of dollars to get the best equipment, you're not going to do well in the general PvP. If PvP is really important to you, but you do not want to spend a lot of money on this game, then do not play it.

Among them Forsaken World, a game from the creators of Perfect World and other free Chinese MMOs. Forsaken World is their most recent game and offers content that is similar to World of Warcraft while maintaining its own identity. There are eight classes scattered across five races, each of which fills the usual roles of either tank, healer or DPS. Nagivation is very easy due to the click-to-move way of nagivation. Quests have hypertext which can make your character move to precisely where you need to go. This means you spend less time getting lost in the huge terrain, and more time killing bad guys, completing quests and whatnot. A free for all PVP system also is quite refreshing for those used to faction based PVP on other games. Most surpriseing however is not only how beautiful the game is, but also how solid its translation is. Overall, Forsaken World is a very enjoyable game and a good alternative for medieval fantasy MMO if you're sick of WoW.","July 6, 2011","true","11.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It should be noted the overall for this game is 73%, but at the time of this writing the Recent is 57%. This speaks more volumes than I can. Also, my 2015 review is still listed below.\n\nMy new review: GODS HELP US IT'S EVEN WORSE NOW! I tried to pick up my old lvl 70 Stoneman and had NO idea what was going on. Gone of old is the world, more than half of it has been taken over, in story, by the Storm Legion. But worse is now the whole game seems to be a disjointed mess of new and old. I decided to roll a new character, one of the new 'Reaper' classes. And spent about 2 hours playing. And in that time... It felt like as it did before: Bland quests, go here go there, blast skills, get rewards. I guess the new classes and race (Demons now? I thought the Lycans joining Lionheart was BS) are nice, but that's just it. It's lost it's magic, and playerbase with it. My No recommendation stands.\n\n\n2015 Review:\nYears later I can no longer recomend this game. Realize this, outside of TF2, was the first offerings on Steams Free-2-Play section. I was wanting for a deceint MMO at the time that the name of did start with W and end with "orld of Warcraft". I found this in FW.\n\nOver the past few years, 3 and a half to be exact, this game has gone from good to long of tooth. Just like WoW has in my mind (newest expansion be damned), this game has gone on too long. Even with expansions, even ones that break the lore of the game (Seriously? Lupine working for Dyos?), this doesn't have the healthy polish it once did.\n\nIf you want a F2P MMO RPG, here ya go. If you want something decent, look elsewhere.","May 6","false","195.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty. But if you are a verteran MMOer, you may not find this game much of a challenge. The mobs went down easily even without weapons equipped and I was supposed to be a 5 star difficulty character and it was simple to figure out and play. Everywhere you wanted to go, you could just auto travel there so there was no real exploration. It felt like a Facebook "MMO" more than anything else. An hour in and I was already almost lvl 20 and I was talking to random people as well. I don't know the lvl cap, but if it's the normal lvl 50, I imagine I could have gotten there in less than a day at that rate.\nIf you're new to MMO's, it would probably be a good start, but if you're a veteran like me, it will feel incredibly generic and way to easy. It seems like an MMO for the casual gamer and nothing more honestly.\nI  can't recommend this to any of my friends because they are all veteran MMOers, and I know they would be bored out of their minds in the first hour like I was.","October 20, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","5"

Forsaken World is a game that takes place in a large realm. You choose your race among the Kindred, Elf, Lycan, Human, Stoneman and Dwarf. You then choose a class such as Assassin, Bard, Warrior, Protector, Priest and much more. Customization is great. The point is to level up on one big quest and endless smaller quests for new items, clothing, weapons, pets and mounts. My highest level character is a Lycan Priest at level 30 so far, but I already have awesome items. 10 of 10, no doubt.

It took me about 2 weeks to get to lvl 60 then after that it got boring because of the BOT that the game gives you. I must say this is the first game, that I've seen, that let's you bot in it. Normaly if you bot in a game you would get banned but not in FW they give you the bot so coders can have a break, I guess? But all in all, it's a really fun game untill the latter part of it. I suggest this game to people who don't have a very strong PC, or who are new to the MMORPG/PC world. Then after you play this game come play Tera, Rift, or ArcheAge. Then you'll see what a really good free to play MMORPG looks like. If you like the hold right button to move you camera then play Rift, or ArcheAge after you're done with FW.\n","December 31, 2014","true","192.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

This review might seem misguiding, as it is filled with content by a person who hasn't played in like 3-4 years.\n\nSo when I joined, it was the Summer of 2011, when I was fresh into looking for MMORPGS like this game. I gave this game a go at it, and I really liked it. If you are the type of person who doesn't like reading, and you like to quest more than read what the people have to say, then chances are that some missions can get tough. Yet, prior to my knowledge, they give you somewhat of a tutorial, but it really doesn't help that much. Reading in this game is a huge factor. You might end up getting lost, and don't know where to find/buy clothes when you have the material.\n\nIt was fun, and yet God Trials (?) was a very fun dungeon (except the time when I was a level 30, then became a level 50 after the end of it). The community was nice, and everyone I've met was rather friendly. I used to look forward to using my Milk and Cheese everyday in my INBOX, and there is still a lot of it that needs to be used... I think.\n\nI stopped playing, because I got stuck behind the church dungeon, and the Mountain behind it. I thought I could take shortcuts to make it back, but instead I couldn't teleport, and I was stuck in the same position. I wonder if I'm still stuck back there.\n\nI recommend a yes, until I install the game, and play it to change my mind.","January 20, 2014","true","20.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Soul gold is useful for buying everyday necessities in FW (Forsaken world) and real gold which is impossible and frustrating to grind for upcoming players can be used to buy lucrative items.\n2. Henry is a ♥♥♥♥. Your main source of soul gold will come from a man called Henry that stands in freedom harbors square. He sends you on the most ridiculous quests you can think of.\n3. It's a pay to win. You can get geared to the max just by dropping a couple hundreds on it.\n4. PVP 5's,3's', and battlegrounds, consist of gloop boosting, or a bunch of geared players versus noobs.\n5. The game is repetitive as can ♥♥♥♥ing be.

Hay una versión en Español. Cuestión que parece que aquí han pasado por alto. Ahora, dicho esto.... El juego en si no esta mal. La ambientación es distinta a los típicos MMO que se encuentran en el mercado. Cosa que lo hace diferente, sobre todo la inclusión de vampiros. Pero aunque los creadores de este juego lo han intentado.... Y digo que lo han intentado, porque exactamente es la palabra que yo le pondría para definir a este juego. Un juego que esta a medias, que podría haber sido algo mas dentro del genero, y solo se ha quedado en uno mas para pasar la tarde. Por cierto, un apunte mas: la traducción de la versión en castellano, esta fatalmente traducida. No se a quien habrán contratado como traductor, o traductores, pero creo que si hubieran utilizado el traductor de Google, la traducción les habría quedado bastante mejor que la chapuza que han hecho. Y además se habrían ahorrado dinero que podrían haber invertido para poder mejorar el juego.","November 17, 2013","true","1.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

PVP is very unbalanced if you are using a class other than an assassin. hence this game should be called Assassin's World.\n\nand the bugs, I almost forgot the bugs. bugs is the first thing you will see in this game since the very first level til the very end. the game is 4 years old and the same bugs from the begining are still there. nothing has changed or fixed despite all the forum messages and reports. the amount of money they make from this game is ridiculous but they can't afford to fix the bugs it seems.\n\nand now there is a new patch running which destroyed "80%" of the old map, leaving only 1 big city to "all players" to stand in creating a huge lagging experience. and there is no way for you or anyone to go to the destroyed areas. the thing is, this last patch pratically killed the game leaving it like a ghost town.\n\nif you are looking for a good MMO to play with or making friends, do not try this one at all. people are jerks and dou.chebags.

The game itself would be absolutely fantastic if this game wasn't so heavily reliant on long grinding times and "cheap" ways of advancement. To start off, the community itself is not friendly to beginners in the slightest. You'll have a hard time trying to figure out why you're starting to die and not be up-to-par with other more "well informed" people around your level when you reach your 50s and 60s. If you're used to the traditional way of getting a new piece of gear and having that hold you over, i'll be the first to inform you that you're going to be expected to enhance your gear to be anywhere near where you need to be stat-wise once you hit these levels. The enhancement chances are extremely low after a few tries, but don't worry, you can spend your real hard earned money to increase those chances slightly.\n\nThe PvP system in this game is a joke. I've heard of guilds dominating PvP in other games, but this game will make you a god for more of your hard earned money if you're willing to take the time to open up the cash shop and browse their selections of stat-enhancements for your gear. Whoever has the bigger wallet wins the draw here folks.\n\nWell, i've talked stats for a while. How about those of us out there who like lore in their games? Well, the lore is semi-interesting if you take the time to read it. It's nothing amazing, we're talking about a F2P game here after all. However, you don't have to waste your time finding the lore itself in the game at all. Most of the lore that i've found to be in the cards that drop that you can claim as a sort of "achievement" if you will can be bought and sold through the in-game auction house. The rarer cards that are harder to find are farmed off of world bosses that spawn at random times of the day by the bigger guilds of each server. They're nigh impossible to obtain through regular means if you're not a part of the group who aggros the boss and kills it. So if you're looking for lore, open up those wallets again.\n\nAnd finally, let's talk about cosmetics. The game itself is beautiful for a F2P game. The graphics are a bit dated, but the game itself isn't exactly new. The cash shop does have a wide variety of different outfits you can purchase (promptly named "fashion" here) and they're all very interesting. Zones are varied and different when you travel, as well as the look of the mobs of the area. The world itself is fun to explore when you have time to just look around and wander a bit off course, it's certainly not boring. The skills look interesting at times, there are a few that look a bit odd, but for the most part, they're rather flashy, befitting a JMMORPG.\n\nOverall, the game has "some" interesting mechanics that aren't listed here, but they're things that you can find in other MMOs with much more credibility with their companies than PWE, so I didn't bother to list them. I've played the game for two years on and off, trying to force myself to look past all of the gaming design flaws that PWE has brought upon it, but I simply cannot overlook some of the major concerns I have with it listed here. Most people will agree with me that this game is another F2P with a formula set up for P2W in a nutshell, it just has a nice coat of paint to get people looking at it and interested. To close this up, if you're looking for a game that has casual playstyle so much to the point where you can quite literally AFK in dungeons and run them and want to spend money to make your character look good and kick ♥♥♥ in PvP, by all means, play this, it's perfect for you. But if you're looking for a game who can do all of these things without the mindless gameplay in mind, pay this one no mind.","January 30, 2015","false","134.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as there being SOME jerky players, and SOME greedy players -- welcome to planet Earth. As far as I have seen, the vast majority of the community is polite, fun, friendly, helpful, and altogether extremely generous. I've NEVER had a run in with evil/unjust GMs nor was I ever ripped off by PWE in any way.\n\nAll in all I have been playing since right after the initial launch. I started my main in May of 2010, which benchmarks me at 4 years now. I have played several different toons and several different classes. The game has always been fun to me, a veteran to Everquest for 10 years and MMORPGs in general.\n\nThere are many pros and cons to the game [as with any -- here are a few].\n\nPros:\n1. It is free to play -- all core game functions and most premium content is available for free in game through various quest systems.\n2. The graphics are pretty good for an MMO and superior to the WOW and EQ series in my opinion.\n3. Most of the game's bugs and dead ends have been worked out to create a fairly straight forward and smooth transition through levels. There are many ways to find where you should go next.\n4. The community is seasoned and helpful. Most people playing have been where you are and are willing to help new players.\n5. The player economy has balanced out. People are no longer charging 1gp ($0.25 US) for basic foraged items and most expensive premium items are cheaper in game than from boutique.\n6. The in-game economy/monetary system [gold acquisition rate] has become more generous so most people aren't always broke.\n7. The amount of "power-players" is no more than any MMO -- and the way the programmers have divided the zones and the leveling -- you will not even encounter these people until you reach much higher levels, instances, and PvP arenas.\n8. The character race/class system is well balanced and creates requirement for various classes in group instances to succeed which forces a degree of player interaction.\n9. There is an auto-group function for necessary instances and events where you register and are assigned to a group which encourages interaction with random new people. You can also enter an event with a preformed group. Whichever is more your style.\n10. There are always recruiting guilds so making new friends isn't hard. If you are new you may want to join a guild that specifies "accepting players new and old all races all classes," typically these people will be most likely to help you.\n11.  The "training grounds" experience [afk training etc] is NOT the fastest XP in the game as some have stated, there are various daily quests [Henry/Buckray/Rio/Ingvar/Mitchell/Luia/Niachilo/etc] in Freedom Harbor and a slew of instance zones that award FAR more exp FAR more quickly than AFK-ing. Not to mention the level 40+ main quest line itself is the best way to get exp after 40.\n12. The Non-linear quest system unveils an interesting story line while providing the main portion of the game's progress. Almost all bonuses and gift items are dependent upon a combination of level and story line progression.\n13. The game rewards interactions between new players and veteran players through the Master/Apprentice system and Recruitment Orders. Level 55+ characters can join in groups with new characters to guide them through instance zones and events as well as specific quests tailored specially for the Master/Apprentice system.\n14. Huge full customization guild halls.\n15. Tons of useful in-game jobs and abilities useful in generating player trade-able gold which can in turn be used to purchase Leaves which is used to  purchase premium content without paying cash.\n16. No real methods to grind or power-level toons to the top.\n17. Zones, instances, event, and monsters are level-based to discourage high levels in low end zones, also loot is level restricted, and respawn times of monsters are fast [common mobs 30 sec, elite mobs 10-15 minutes, and world bosses are on 8-24 hour cycles] which makes kill-stealing/camp-stealing almost redundant.\n18. The game is full of customization options to make each character unique.\n19. To start the game the learning curve is pretty easy.\n20. Easy drag and drop interface customization.\n21. Simple point and click interface by default with custom control options, simple 360 degree tethered style camera controls.\n\nCons:\n1. Simple point and click interface by default with custom control options, simple 360 degree tethered style camera controls.\n2. Few custom UI options.\n3. Many Trolls [the annoying internet chat variety not the ones under bridges] since the new abundance of free World Flutes -- though it is easy to tune them out by ignoring the World Chat.\n4. No grinding or power-leveling really available in game which makes it so you have to play through fully [or close to it] with new characters.\n5. There is somewhat a "pay-to-win" feel in the sense that many of the games useful items are few and far between in game but can be easily purchased for a few dollars. Some more expensive items are pay only [i.e. Certain mounts and flying mounts, some pets, fashion, etc.], though most of these are trade-able which makes them available for high gold prices in the player auction. [Note: Most of the "pay-only" items are more aesthetic than not and NONE are necessary to play the game]\n6. There are some bugs, broken quests, and minor glitches that can occur. There are a few places that you can get stuck in the scenery [though using a town portal spell or switching realms often will fix the situation].\n7. There is an AFK experience system where a person can level their character by literally leaving it online in the training grounds while they are not physically present to play their character. If someone were to leave their character in AFK for several weeks they could achieve a higher level at about 3-4 levels per day -- above 20 below level 40 -- and 1-2 levels per day -- above 40 and below level 60. [However, in regards to previous statements again, this is by no means the fastest way to level, just the easy way for gamers that don't like actually playing games]\n8. Several minor factors of the game tend to change often with new expansions which creates a minor learning curve upon occasion. Some items are removed and replaced with new ones. The constant evolution of the game is refreshing to some and aggravating to some. [Never have any of these changes been a real "game-breaker" anyone that claims such is exaggerating]\n9. Support is okay but is not stellar. Often long wait times experienced.\n10. Some item/skill/quest descriptions are not properly translated to English when a new patch is released, and sometimes [uncommonly to rarely] you will still encounter Kanji characters.\n\n\nMy personal summary: The game is a great game, one of the best in the free-to-play MMORPG genre and honestly one of the better MMORPGs I have played [EverQuest, EQ2, WoW, Perfect World, Jade Dynasty, Diablo, AD&D, Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star Online]. I also honestly feel the majority of gripes you hear -- on forums and in game -- come from people that poured $1000+ into a toon and when a new expansion came out something cooler was available and someone else beat them to it so they rage quit the game -- or did not invest the time to learn the game. When you consider the thousands that play [active] and the fact you seen the same 20 names in world chat complaining about things is a testament that few are truly complaining just making a spectacle of themselves. The majority of these complaints tend to be unsubstantiated.\n\nI feel most people aren't giving this game a fair chance when they are rating it. Here is an honest review [pros and cons] with 4 years experience backing it.","May 22, 2014","true","493.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Altogether, it's pretty highly recommended, though I'm by no means a fan of MMOs.\n\nIt plays a lot like Perfect World, with some serious improvements. The graphics, environments, quests, and dialogue are all beyond PW. It's just generally more engrossing - where PW was a foot-dragger after about lvl 24, Forsaken World still had a fair amount of interesting things to do up until lvl 30 (about my lvl). There are daily quests that yield solid amounts of EXP, but they get repetitive after a while - the longer you play, the more sparse the story-ish quests become.  Enter "kill x amount of x" ad infinitum, I guess. It's probably more fun when you can do Instances with friends.\n\nI've been thinking of playing it again recently since my hiatus, though.  I'm on Storm server, world (or whatever) 8, usually.  I main a Kindred Vampire, though I have a Bard I want to raise, too.","June 14, 2011","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as there being SOME jerky players, and SOME greedy players -- welcome to planet Earth. As far as I have seen, the vast majority of the community is polite, fun, friendly, helpful, and altogether extremely generous. I've NEVER had a run in with evil/unjust GMs nor was I ever ripped off by PWE in any way.\n\nAll in all I have been playing since right after the initial launch. I started my main in May of 2010, which benchmarks me at 4 years now. I have played several different toons and several different classes. The game has always been fun to me, a veteran to Everquest for 10 years and MMORPGs in general.\n\nThere are many pros and cons to the game [as with any -- here are a few].\n\nPros:\n1. It is free to play -- all core game functions and most premium content is available for free in game through various quest systems.\n2. The graphics are pretty good for an MMO and superior to the WOW and EQ series in my opinion.\n3. Most of the game's bugs and dead ends have been worked out to create a fairly straight forward and smooth transition through levels. There are many ways to find where you should go next.\n4. The community is seasoned and helpful. Most people playing have been where you are and are willing to help new players.\n5. The player economy has balanced out. People are no longer charging 1gp ($0.25 US) for basic foraged items and most expensive premium items are cheaper in game than from boutique.\n6. The in-game economy/monetary system [gold acquisition rate] has become more generous so most people aren't always broke.\n7. The amount of "power-players" is no more than any MMO -- and the way the programmers have divided the zones and the leveling -- you will not even encounter these people until you reach much higher levels, instances, and PvP arenas.\n8. The character race/class system is well balanced and creates requirement for various classes in group instances to succeed which forces a degree of player interaction.\n9. There is an auto-group function for necessary instances and events where you register and are assigned to a group which encourages interaction with random new people. You can also enter an event with a preformed group. Whichever is more your style.\n10. There are always recruiting guilds so making new friends isn't hard. If you are new you may want to join a guild that specifies "accepting players new and old all races all classes," typically these people will be most likely to help you.\n11.  The "training grounds" experience [afk training etc] is NOT the fastest XP in the game as some have stated, there are various daily quests [Henry/Buckray/Rio/Ingvar/Mitchell/Luia/Niachilo/etc] in Freedom Harbor and a slew of instance zones that award FAR more exp FAR more quickly than AFK-ing. Not to mention the level 40+ main quest line itself is the best way to get exp after 40.\n12. The Non-linear quest system unveils an interesting story line while providing the main portion of the game's progress. Almost all bonuses and gift items are dependent upon a combination of level and story line progression.\n13. The game rewards interactions between new players and veteran players through the Master/Apprentice system and Recruitment Orders. Level 55+ characters can join in groups with new characters to guide them through instance zones and events as well as specific quests tailored specially for the Master/Apprentice system.\n14. Huge full customization guild halls.\n15. Tons of useful in-game jobs and abilities useful in generating player trade-able gold which can in turn be used to purchase Leaves which is used to  purchase premium content without paying cash.\n16. No real methods to grind or power-level toons to the top.\n17. Zones, instances, event, and monsters are level-based to discourage high levels in low end zones, also loot is level restricted, and respawn times of monsters are fast [common mobs 30 sec, elite mobs 10-15 minutes, and world bosses are on 8-24 hour cycles] which makes kill-stealing/camp-stealing almost redundant.\n18. The game is full of customization options to make each character unique.\n19. To start the game the learning curve is pretty easy.\n20. Easy drag and drop interface customization.\n21. Simple point and click interface by default with custom control options, simple 360 degree tethered style camera controls.\n\nCons:\n1. Simple point and click interface by default with custom control options, simple 360 degree tethered style camera controls.\n2. Few custom UI options.\n3. Many Trolls [the annoying internet chat variety not the ones under bridges] since the new abundance of free World Flutes -- though it is easy to tune them out by ignoring the World Chat.\n4. No grinding or power-leveling really available in game which makes it so you have to play through fully [or close to it] with new characters.\n5. There is somewhat a "pay-to-win" feel in the sense that many of the games useful items are few and far between in game but can be easily purchased for a few dollars. Some more expensive items are pay only [i.e. Certain mounts and flying mounts, some pets, fashion, etc.], though most of these are trade-able which makes them available for high gold prices in the player auction. [Note: Most of the "pay-only" items are more aesthetic than not and NONE are necessary to play the game]\n6. There are some bugs, broken quests, and minor glitches that can occur. There are a few places that you can get stuck in the scenery [though using a town portal spell or switching realms often will fix the situation].\n7. There is an AFK experience system where a person can level their character by literally leaving it online in the training grounds while they are not physically present to play their character. If someone were to leave their character in AFK for several weeks they could achieve a higher level at about 3-4 levels per day -- above 20 below level 40 -- and 1-2 levels per day -- above 40 and below level 60. [However, in regards to previous statements again, this is by no means the fastest way to level, just the easy way for gamers that don't like actually playing games]\n8. Several minor factors of the game tend to change often with new expansions which creates a minor learning curve upon occasion. Some items are removed and replaced with new ones. The constant evolution of the game is refreshing to some and aggravating to some. [Never have any of these changes been a real "game-breaker" anyone that claims such is exaggerating]\n9. Support is okay but is not stellar. Often long wait times experienced.\n10. Some item/skill/quest descriptions are not properly translated to English when a new patch is released, and sometimes [uncommonly to rarely] you will still encounter Kanji characters.\n\n\nMy personal summary: The game is a great game, one of the best in the free-to-play MMORPG genre and honestly one of the better MMORPGs I have played [EverQuest, EQ2, WoW, Perfect World, Jade Dynasty, Diablo, AD&D, Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star Online]. I also honestly feel the majority of gripes you hear -- on forums and in game -- come from people that poured $1000+ into a toon and when a new expansion came out something cooler was available and someone else beat them to it so they rage quit the game -- or did not invest the time to learn the game. When you consider the thousands that play [active] and the fact you seen the same 20 names in world chat complaining about things is a testament that few are truly complaining just making a spectacle of themselves. The majority of these complaints tend to be unsubstantiated.\n\nI feel most people aren't giving this game a fair chance when they are rating it. Here is an honest review [pros and cons] with 4 years experience backing it.","May 22, 2014","true","493.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's by far one of the greatest games I've ever played. Building up your character is fun, but the compeition is huge. The PvP system is throughout the whole map, except in specific safezones. You fight with hundreds of other people to get legendary drops each week, managed by only the top guilds of the server. You can fight in a competitive arena, getting high tier gear as rewards for your skill. There are flying bosses in the skies, but be prepared for a challenge, fighting aside your friends, to take those bosses from your enemy guilds. If you're interested in raids, there are guild raids and plenty of instance throughout the game.\n\nIf you want to become a legend within the game, you have to work on your mechanics, gear, and grind until you're the ultimate player. This game is where you'll be challenged on all fronts of PvE and PvP, but don't be afraid. You'll always have friends to help you through the thickest of wars.\n\nBased on previous experience, I would recommend for all of you to entake on this wonderful adventure.\n\nBalance: 8\nGraphics: 10\nMusic: 8\nCinematics: 10\nStory: 7\nContent: 10\nControls: 8\nGameplay: 8\nOverall: 8.6","December 2, 2011","true","627.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story's pretty engaging for an MMO (as in, I actually care about it enough to read the quest stuff), and despite there being very limitted customizability I find I am having a fun time coming up with new tactics and ways to achieve my objectives and fight.\n\nI'm a level 21 Vampire as of this writing, and I've only been playing for about 6 hours or so... the progression rate is pretty solid. I have yet to feel like I'm really *grinding* or missing anything from not being the next level up. I have to pry myself away from the computer and put that "well, just one more quest..." voice to bed in order to be able to stop playing. That's a good sign.\n\nThe community in the game is really good. I've yet to come across people who are unhelpful, mean, or trollish and, in fact, everyone is willing to help. It feels like... well, a community. To be honest, I haven't gotten into party dynamics and how all of that works, yet, though.","June 22, 2011","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The begining levels and missions will get boring of course because it's showing everything to you. After level 20+ It gets really fun. But there is a thing you get when you reach a certain level. It allows you to automatically farm for exp. You get scrolls that give alot of exp. You just set it to auto and it starts auto attacking things in an area for you. People can join in the party and gain free exp. This is what I liked about the game the most back in the day when I played it. The guilds are very nice as well.

It was the first game I ever played that required me to gain experience through quests (I had quit Runescape before playing this game, and if anyone has ever played it, you know you gained experience from killing. Glad I finally quit that game, though. Hasn't been the same since 2009)\n\nAnyways, so I had finally discovered a game where you increased your level the more quests you did. The quests were pretty fun, and overall it was very challenging. It took me months just to get to level 65. I haven't reached the max level because I was confused with some of the items in game. I wasn't really aware of embedding gems into your armor to increase your level and the Dyos and Nyos branches confused me all the same.\n\nIt's also a 'cash shop', in which you probably can't get to the max level and "beat the game" without investing some real-world money into the Eyrda Shop (Not sure if that was what it was called, I haven't played it in a bit)\n\nOveral, it's a vry fun game. The races/classes are absolutely amazing. The instances, such as God's Trials and Nightmare Carnival, are really fun,I looked forward to playing those and other instances.\nI believe I'd recommend this to any friend who enjoys a fun, challenging MMORPG.","February 9, 2014","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Altogether, it's pretty highly recommended, though I'm by no means a fan of MMOs.\n\nIt plays a lot like Perfect World, with some serious improvements. The graphics, environments, quests, and dialogue are all beyond PW. It's just generally more engrossing - where PW was a foot-dragger after about lvl 24, Forsaken World still had a fair amount of interesting things to do up until lvl 30 (about my lvl). There are daily quests that yield solid amounts of EXP, but they get repetitive after a while - the longer you play, the more sparse the story-ish quests become.  Enter "kill x amount of x" ad infinitum, I guess. It's probably more fun when you can do Instances with friends.\n\nI've been thinking of playing it again recently since my hiatus, though.  I'm on Storm server, world (or whatever) 8, usually.  I main a Kindred Vampire, though I have a Bard I want to raise, too.","June 14, 2011","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can safely say that this game can be played without having payed a dime. That said, it's overtly hard to do so, and that's only the first of quite a bit of critique I've got for this game.\n\nSo let's begin this with a list of cons:\n-scrapped down content compared to chinese version.\n-Jobs tend to feel way too drawn out.\n-Some races only get a single class choice. seems like a minor thing but really... with all those races?\nSome cross over could be intresting.\n-Lack of story and plot that actually involve the players. The game has a tendency to basically feel like you've arrived late for all the good stuff and then have to deal with all the normal duties.\n-Daily System. It ends up becoming a chore to get them done because doing so earns you points for various things, including some stuff that would normally be cash shop only.\n\n\nAnd now for the pros:\n+Crafting system is quite vast.\n+Classes are rather customizable.\n+Graphics are beautiful and detailed.\n+Actual Auction House.\n+Some classes limited to one race. Didn't I put that in con? yes. But it also means that the classes that are exclusive are more specialized and fit the classes better.\n+Boobs. Primitive, but the outfits for females follow the classic "More skimpy = Better armor" recipe, which... is not a bad thing.\n+Daily system. Literally tons of things to do every single day if you can be bothered. That said, it can be quite trivial and boring at times.\n+Guild bases. Floating fortresses of fun... if only they were more customizable.\n+The FW world as a whole.\n+Free Botting. A double edged sword really.\n\nNow, going by this list, you can tell my feelings are a bit mixed... However, when boiling it all down - I still cherish the time I've spent in the game, and if you have the patience and stamina for it, I can highly reccommend it.\n\n68/100 score.

The story's pretty engaging for an MMO (as in, I actually care about it enough to read the quest stuff), and despite there being very limitted customizability I find I am having a fun time coming up with new tactics and ways to achieve my objectives and fight.\n\nI'm a level 21 Vampire as of this writing, and I've only been playing for about 6 hours or so... the progression rate is pretty solid. I have yet to feel like I'm really *grinding* or missing anything from not being the next level up. I have to pry myself away from the computer and put that "well, just one more quest..." voice to bed in order to be able to stop playing. That's a good sign.\n\nThe community in the game is really good. I've yet to come across people who are unhelpful, mean, or trollish and, in fact, everyone is willing to help. It feels like... well, a community. To be honest, I haven't gotten into party dynamics and how all of that works, yet, though.","June 22, 2011","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could just be server updates that make it run faster than before.  Whatever the case, this game is for a niche market, and that niche is occasional gamers.  Not casual, occasional.  Want to level by grinding? Fast respawn times allow it, but that comes at the cost of not being to farm mobs beyond ten levels of you.  Missions are your primary source of EXP.  Don't want to be railroaded? Stick around in Freedom Harbor and do the dailies; got my bard up level 15, 20-ish just from those quests.  The classes are mostly good examples of top-down design (vampire damage abilities depend on their HP, and they have a sort of blood frenzy analog, while bards attacks chain into songs), but also have some clichéd archetypes, which is to be expected.

The game itself would be absolutely fantastic if this game wasn't so heavily reliant on long grinding times and "cheap" ways of advancement. To start off, the community itself is not friendly to beginners in the slightest. You'll have a hard time trying to figure out why you're starting to die and not be up-to-par with other more "well informed" people around your level when you reach your 50s and 60s. If you're used to the traditional way of getting a new piece of gear and having that hold you over, i'll be the first to inform you that you're going to be expected to enhance your gear to be anywhere near where you need to be stat-wise once you hit these levels. The enhancement chances are extremely low after a few tries, but don't worry, you can spend your real hard earned money to increase those chances slightly.\n\nThe PvP system in this game is a joke. I've heard of guilds dominating PvP in other games, but this game will make you a god for more of your hard earned money if you're willing to take the time to open up the cash shop and browse their selections of stat-enhancements for your gear. Whoever has the bigger wallet wins the draw here folks.\n\nWell, i've talked stats for a while. How about those of us out there who like lore in their games? Well, the lore is semi-interesting if you take the time to read it. It's nothing amazing, we're talking about a F2P game here after all. However, you don't have to waste your time finding the lore itself in the game at all. Most of the lore that i've found to be in the cards that drop that you can claim as a sort of "achievement" if you will can be bought and sold through the in-game auction house. The rarer cards that are harder to find are farmed off of world bosses that spawn at random times of the day by the bigger guilds of each server. They're nigh impossible to obtain through regular means if you're not a part of the group who aggros the boss and kills it. So if you're looking for lore, open up those wallets again.\n\nAnd finally, let's talk about cosmetics. The game itself is beautiful for a F2P game. The graphics are a bit dated, but the game itself isn't exactly new. The cash shop does have a wide variety of different outfits you can purchase (promptly named "fashion" here) and they're all very interesting. Zones are varied and different when you travel, as well as the look of the mobs of the area. The world itself is fun to explore when you have time to just look around and wander a bit off course, it's certainly not boring. The skills look interesting at times, there are a few that look a bit odd, but for the most part, they're rather flashy, befitting a JMMORPG.\n\nOverall, the game has "some" interesting mechanics that aren't listed here, but they're things that you can find in other MMOs with much more credibility with their companies than PWE, so I didn't bother to list them. I've played the game for two years on and off, trying to force myself to look past all of the gaming design flaws that PWE has brought upon it, but I simply cannot overlook some of the major concerns I have with it listed here. Most people will agree with me that this game is another F2P with a formula set up for P2W in a nutshell, it just has a nice coat of paint to get people looking at it and interested. To close this up, if you're looking for a game that has casual playstyle so much to the point where you can quite literally AFK in dungeons and run them and want to spend money to make your character look good and kick ♥♥♥ in PvP, by all means, play this, it's perfect for you. But if you're looking for a game who can do all of these things without the mindless gameplay in mind, pay this one no mind.","January 30, 2015","false","134.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no immediate deletion, you haveto wait a certin amount of time for the character to actually be deleted but its not minutes or hours. It's DAYS, you have to wait DAYS for the character to delete. The point-to-move feature is also annoying in my opinion but that isnt very big of an issue. Still a very good game and would reccomend if you like tab-targeting MMORPG games.","June 26, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the first game I ever played that required me to gain experience through quests (I had quit Runescape before playing this game, and if anyone has ever played it, you know you gained experience from killing. Glad I finally quit that game, though. Hasn't been the same since 2009)\n\nAnyways, so I had finally discovered a game where you increased your level the more quests you did. The quests were pretty fun, and overall it was very challenging. It took me months just to get to level 65. I haven't reached the max level because I was confused with some of the items in game. I wasn't really aware of embedding gems into your armor to increase your level and the Dyos and Nyos branches confused me all the same.\n\nIt's also a 'cash shop', in which you probably can't get to the max level and "beat the game" without investing some real-world money into the Eyrda Shop (Not sure if that was what it was called, I haven't played it in a bit)\n\nOveral, it's a vry fun game. The races/classes are absolutely amazing. The instances, such as God's Trials and Nightmare Carnival, are really fun,I looked forward to playing those and other instances.\nI believe I'd recommend this to any friend who enjoys a fun, challenging MMORPG.","February 9, 2014","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's by far one of the greatest games I've ever played. Building up your character is fun, but the compeition is huge. The PvP system is throughout the whole map, except in specific safezones. You fight with hundreds of other people to get legendary drops each week, managed by only the top guilds of the server. You can fight in a competitive arena, getting high tier gear as rewards for your skill. There are flying bosses in the skies, but be prepared for a challenge, fighting aside your friends, to take those bosses from your enemy guilds. If you're interested in raids, there are guild raids and plenty of instance throughout the game.\n\nIf you want to become a legend within the game, you have to work on your mechanics, gear, and grind until you're the ultimate player. This game is where you'll be challenged on all fronts of PvE and PvP, but don't be afraid. You'll always have friends to help you through the thickest of wars.\n\nBased on previous experience, I would recommend for all of you to entake on this wonderful adventure.\n\nBalance: 8\nGraphics: 10\nMusic: 8\nCinematics: 10\nStory: 7\nContent: 10\nControls: 8\nGameplay: 8\nOverall: 8.6","December 2, 2011","true","627.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the controls are bad, no one is going to want to sink 100's of hours into the game.\n\nThe game defaults to both keyboard movement and click-to-move. Ask what the player wants up front and provide a better control scheme for the chosen option.\nEven with click-to-move off, left clicking will auto-move to clicked targets.\nLeft click dragging does not rotate the camera.\nRight click does not activate auto-attack, instead it must be used as an action button.\nYou cannot move during auto-attacks. The auto-attack animation will be interrupted and no damage will go through.\nCollision is all sorts of messed up. Something you should easily be able to jump over has collision and prevents you from jumping over it. They expect everyone to just use the auto-pathing.\nAuto-pathing uses a sequential waypoint system. Did you go past a waypoint? Better backtrack so that you can stand directly over the waypoint before proceeding. Could you get to your destination by going straight? Well the laid out waypoints weren't designed for that path, so you better go get on the prebuilt waypoint way off to the side and take a more conviluted path.\nAdditionally, the game does not let you scale the UI. If you have a large resolution, 1440p+, expect to not be able to use your minimap.","April 20","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
