Grab your joysticks and unleash the fire! I liked Comanche 3 better, but 4 is good too. Great controls, interesting missions, challenging, fun and in-depth.\n\nWarning: it is OLD and it shows.

Graphics in this game are just great and enjoyable for its time of release (2001). Gameplay combines simulation with arcade controls, missions participate on many locations were action is both on ground and air and voice acting is realistic as gameplay, which is just incredible and amazing.\nFor me 10/10 for this nice classic sim.\n\nThis is Griffon 2-6.

It is an old game, yes, but personnaly I find it very amusing and nice to play! I used to play it when I was younger and now that I refound it I am so happy. You can play alone or multiplayers. It is better playing with a joystick. You actually can do everything you want with your helicopter : you can follow the mission but you can also .... get crazy! and kill your allies, destroye trucks, trains, gasoline tanks etc... . When you fight the enemy, it can be against another helicopter or against ground units. As well, you have several types of missile, rocket etc.. . Most people will dislike it because it is old and there are nowadays better helicopter games, yes but well you have to try Commanche 4 which is epic!\n\n\n69 / 100","January 6","true","2.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It really does. But for a 2001 game, it is to be expected! Still, I had fun playing this helicopter simulation. The game is quite challenging as if you get destroyed, you have to restart the whole mission. Thankfully (or not), the missions aren't very long and you can beat the game under 4 hours, sadly.\n\nPROS:\n+Interesting missions.\n+Tight controls (plays very well with Keyboard and Mouse).\n+Gameplay is great!\n+Authentic and very accessible (easy learning curve).\n+Game works without a hitch on modern systems.\n\nCONS:\n-Graphics are indeed dated for modern gaming but I'd guess it wasn't that great looking back in 2001. Also, knowing Novalogic, that never were their strong suite anyway.\n-Might not appeal to the hard-core sim fans.\n-Very short campaign mode (can be beaten under 4 hours).\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo any and all fan of military helicopter simulation, I'd say give this game a whirl!\n\nRATING:\n7.5 / 10","December 30, 2013","true","3.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Max resolution is kind of low, but overall graphics are still running fine.\n\nComanche 4 is an enjoyable mix of fun and realism - realism to an extent that you can jump in, figure things out quickly, then play a few missions. There is no flight model, so there's really no steep learning curve. The only thing a player needs to practice is detecting anti-air and learning how to use cover to engage.\n\nI miss Novalogic, and I wish they would give some of these older games some TL&C. Comanche 4, along with Armored Fist are gem's of the past - unfortunately Armored Fist doesnt run - but bring back some great nostaglia.","October 12, 2014","true","14.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

I have a modest computer which should have no trouble running a game this old, and yet every 5-10 seconds there would be a frame rate stutter that would last around a second. Very annoying, and i do not know if it is my computer's problem or wether it is just not optimized... or something like that.\n\nActually there was one thing i didn't like about the gameplay. I get it, Comanche is a fast stealth helicopter with powerful weapons, and the game is not supposed to be very easy, but alot of the enemies (in later missions) all have these super powerful anti air missiles that takes just 3 seconds to lock onto you and not even the Flares will save you. but actually this is probably just my problem for wanting to go in guns blazing vs modern military force because it worked so well against Pirates with terrible weapons.","March 13","false","2.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cossack-hd/recommended/32750/","cossack-hd","Cossack-HD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cossack-hd/","79 products in account","I first played a demo of this game which came with a GeForce 4 graphics card. I thought it was fun back then in 2002 and I kept playing it occasionally even in 2008. Now, 13 years later, I remembered this thing existed and found full version of Comanche 4 on Steam.\n\nPros:\n1. Militaristic feel to the game. Still somewhat immersive.\n2. Explosions looking good.\n3. Distant explosion sound travels across levels, that means you don't hear explosions instantly when they happen a mile away.\n4. Elevation toggle control and stuff, pretty solid controls.\n5. Diverse missions.\n\nCons:\n1. Only few 4:3 resolution presets. No custom resolutions support, not even using .ini tweaking. This is fatal. I can stand dated graphics, but playing 4:3 on a relatively small 16:9 screen never feels good. I could use scaling though, but I doubt I can accept stretched visuals nowadays.\n2. You can't see much beneath you and can't shot what you don't see (unless you've locked on a target, but you need to see it in order to lock on). This is not how helicopter cannons work, m8. They should point atleast 45 down, but in this game it's limited by tilt and vertical FOV. This forces you to fly on low altitudes which is not what I'd expect from a game like this.\n3. All intense fighting equals "rapidly clicking right mouse button to lock on targets and shooting down the targets with the corresponding weapon".\n\nWill I recommend this game? If you are OK with playing on 4:3 resolutions and not afraid of ♥♥♥♥ ripping hardcore missions, this might be waht you seek. Otherwise, it's a thumb down.","December 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It controls more like your standard WASD shooter, with the addition of ascend/descend keys to replace jumping/crouching. This simplified flight model is very easy to get into if you find realistic controls overwhelming, however it also lacks a lot of piloting depth that more demanding players may prefer.","July 16, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
