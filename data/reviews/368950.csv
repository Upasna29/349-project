Decent controls but average to dull bullet and enemy patterns. Could be good as a time killer for some, but as a shmup veteran and old Cave/Raizing fanboy, I felt like there wasn't much of interest here and it felt more like your run of the mill first shmup by a new doujin circle than anything special. Better to just play proper Touhou, or Crimzon Clover if you prefer to stay on Steam.\n\nBut it's free, so why are you even reading this? Just play it for yourself. No F2P shenanigans from what I could see. I'm giving it a thumbs up, but that's only because there's nothing intbetween a thumbs up and down and the game isn't terrible, despite what I said above. It's just painfully average.\n\n(I played the non-Steam version and just launched it on Steam so I could write this review.)","May 12, 2015","true","0.1"," 54 of 74 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","54","74","6","2"

Everything looks like Touhou, the enemy Health bar, the first character, and the spellcards are pretty similar. That's not a bad point.\n\nBUT (So many Buts, pun intended), it fails at creating a real atmosphere. You just have a background (like fog, space etc), and you're shooting enemies familiar to the elements (example : Aliens or Robots in space). Of course, the main goal on a game like this is to score a maximum of points, but it looks generic.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the same as Touhou or eXceed, you can graze (you have to if you wanna score anyway), you can bullet cancel with bomb, you also can cancel your death with bombs. You have a focus button to slow down and make your hitpoint visible.\n\nThe problem with the game, is the optimization. Sometimes it's full of colorful effects and the game runs at 60 fps. Sometimes, just because of the moving background, the game runs at 45/50 fps, creating a feeling of playing into the Matrix. Looks really weird.\n\nMusic-wise, it's good, not great. It's good because I heard some Dubmood in it, but like I said, it fails at delivering an atmosphere. Think of Touhou (very traditional music) or eXceed (more action = more agressive music). Jigoku offers good music, but that kinda feels off for this type of game. Musics don't fit that well to stages/bosses.\n\n\nFINAL : It's free, so why not give it a try ? I still recommend it, but if you wanna play something more serious, go for Touhou, eXceed, Ikaruga or even Alltynex Second.","May 12, 2015","true","0.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","2"

Onwards.\n\nTL:DR\n-Good art and difficulties\n-Patterns dry, menu and HUD need more graphics\n-but its FREE\n-TOUHOU\n\nBasically, yes, this is basically like Touhou, so that's automatically good. I really like the art style (mugshots) but I do feel it has a wee part of fanservice, so yeah. I'm indifferent on the sprites, but visuals are good, except for the HUD and menu. They both could get MUCH better if more was added than just text. Same goes with the backgrounds. I also STRONGLY suggest that you add much more bullet types, since Circles and Ovals are usually the only types there are from enemies.\n\nMusic, as usual, can't be matched with ZUN's, but the music is OKAY. I mean, I do listen to chiptune here and there, but I don't think it can really fit in with this game.\n\nIf you want some good things from me, I like that you put in stuff in Extras instead of just Start. I was also interested in there being 6 characters, even though I didn't unlock any yet. The Danmaku fits correctly for each difficulty, so I applaud you on that, but the patterns are... Dry. There isn't really THAT much variety, if you know what I mean. I feel it's just fancy-styled patterns, but whatever, it's still hard.\n\nSo yeah, although the game has its ups and downs, but I still reccommend it for Touhou fans to try out. It's free, anyway, so that is already a great boost to the rating. I'm hoping to see more!","June 3, 2015","true","3.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

I only went back recently to record and document how well I could finish the game. Obviously when it's been a couple of months I got out of practice and had to play a little bit more.\n\nThere is a training room in this bullet hell, some others in the genre have it as well. It's very good for learning where enemies spawn into the screen, their patterns, and the bullets. Like many other in the genre, memorization will help. To be honest however, if you're trying to get into this game don't be put off by that. Memory will help, but it's not needed. You can play this game on reaction alone, although some practice will be needed as well.\n\nOne thing that I notice some newer players struggling with, in part because it's never said in the game dialogue wise, but it might be in the game somewhere (options menu perhaps?). The use of holding down SHIFT creates a dot on your character that you are playing. Your character also moves slower that normal with a tighter shot spread depending on your character. Since there are 6 characters, with a secret character they all have different uses of holding down shift. I've called it "Focus Mode" because I remember another bullet hell game that used the name/function, and it really does make you focus in on your character. Most of the time you will be looking at your own character and not what you're shooting at.\n\nThe game has a level progression during your run, that can go up to 5 (That's the power meter). I've made a small basics video that went over some of the game, but there are some other details that I left out. Bosses have a number of phases and it's even possible to get pass them by waiting out their timer, in the top right. Because of that its entirely possible to do a run without killing anything (Pacifist achievement).\n\nI'm not exactly sure why I enjoy this game as much as I did. The difficulty was hard at first, I was getting frustrated with some of the levels. In time however I realized that I wasn't upset with the game, but with myself - how could I get hit right there? I didn't save my lives by expending an aura blast or bomb, etc. Getting better at the game was its own little achievement for me, even if it took a few restarts. I started demanding better runs from myself until I got the no-hit run and I'm guessing Pacifist is out of reach for me. I'm still not that great at the game, I'm only decent enough to beat Normal/Easy and I'm not as interested in practicing some more for Hard and onwards. Players that enjoy a decent challenge, I'd recommend this game - it's free for one thing, so just trying it won't hurt that much. I'm not sure how it stands up to other bullet hells, I'm fairly new to the genre but it isn't very difficult. Pass some time with Jigoku it's free.\n\nAnd yeah here's my Normal practice runs.\n\nVideo","September 26, 2015","true","35.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

And since this was free, why not give it a try?\n\nOverall I would recommend it since it is free and it is pretty interesting to see how different spellcards of Touhou got combined together (Seriously, I was laughing non-stop through the game. The bosses' attacks are.... fun in a sense.). It has almost the same mechanics as Touhou so if you know the basics you're good to go.\n\nI have only completed the first character upon this review (Tenshi, 1cc Normal first try) so it will be mostly based on this one experience.\n\nThe normal difficulty for first 2 stages are harder than most other bullet hell games. Mostly due to unexpected patterns when you think it is safe to go to auto-collection point.\n\nAnd the more I play, the more it become a 'Try-to-guess-the-original' game. I was thinking of "Ah, hi Satori, your lasers look good today. Oh? Suddenly Byakuren graced this occasion. How gracious. Mokou, please do not sudden leapt at me like that!"\n\nThat happened in just a spellcard for a boss.\n\nThe monsters pattern are also strikingly similar to QB shooting and exCeed (Touhou is already a given). Stage 3, it is almost the same as QB Shooting's 5th stage, barring rockets flying alongside you.\n\nThe music is almost the same for all stages (at least that was the impression I had while playing). It feels like the music is there for the sake of it, and does not fit the characters / their danmaku style. Not a single sound track has a lasting impression on me.\n\nAnd Tenshi is just Reimu in disguise.\n\n====================================\n\nUpdate after finishing Easy/Normal with all characters and losing Hard at last spell card :\n\nThere... isn't any story.Yes, you do know a little more about the characters, but there is no story to be seen. You could look at the bios for more backstory but...\n\nThe difficulty range, to be honest, is pretty narrow. For the stage battles,  I do not feel much difference between easy and normal (except for more bullets) and between normal and hard (much more bullets but still easy enough to dodge). Spellcard battles on the other hand have nice difficulty increase.\n\nThe playable characters (excluding the hidden characters) have attacks all exactly the same as Touhou's characters. Youmu's short range attack, Marisa's laser, Aya's spread attack, Reimu's homing, Yukari's hold position. Personally I prefer to use homing / laser. The laser girl has movement speed that is ridiculously slow (which is actually good in spellcard battle) and limited range of attack (straight above her), but her damage output is way beyond what others can dish out (other than perhaps the hidden hidden character, or the hidden character if you placed your position correctly)\n\nEven after repeated playthroughs, the music still does not leave much of an impression on me, except perhaps some of the different last stage bosses.\n\nAnd I am not sure if I am glad that there is no lasers in this game, or am agonized that a straight chain of bullets are replacement for lasers. Either way, curving lasers are sin. (Wait, there are lasers.... and I hate Shou's (of Touhou) laser spellcards. Alien girl is my achillies heel.)","May 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","23","32","5","1"

The gameplay is much like Touhou.  However, the thing that makes it so charming is it's Scott Pilgrim X The Anime Bullet Hell. From the time I hit play I was enhanted, musically delighted, and the challenge even on easy is truly worthy of the phrase bullet hell. The element of gameplay beyond that is each "boss" becomes playable after you've defeated them.  The dialogue has very humorous elements albeit much like any game of this genre plot holes the size of mars.  It's nice to see the overlaps from the various points of view in the banter between characters.  It could stand a little bit more of a backdrop to the plot; however, again for a 100% free game. It's worth every dime I didn't pay for it and then some!  A+ design. Little tweaking you'd have marketable sequels for future Jigoku Kisetsukan games for absolute sure.  I'm amazed.

I'm judging and recommending it by the amount of time I've put in to the game to essentially complete it to the fullest, not the amount of money (Or lack there of) I've spent.\n\nJigoku Kisetsukan is a Bullet Hell curtain fire game that is heavily based on the Touhou project[en.touhouwiki.net] (I will be making A LOT of comparisons later on between the two) about a girl named Tenshi having a strange feeling and uncovering what's causing it. Could this game become a new predecessor for the Touhou franchise, or a complete dud? Well, here's my opinion:\n\nGameplay 6/10: You get to play up to seven different characters, each with their own unique shot type or trait along with a unique final boss, which is actually pretty interesting and I don't see that happen often in games. You can also perform a special attack that clears the screen while dealing a little bit of damage to the boss (You can store up to 2 at a time) depending on how much aura you have. My only real issue about the mechanics is that I find it VERY difficult to recover from dying in later stages.\n\nBut since it feels a lot like your traditional bullet Hell game, for me to say I hate the gameplay for this game is like me saying I hate the gameplay for the bullet Hell genre (I don't). The new mechanics make me feel that the game is trying to be something else, and I can see that but is it really?\n\nVisuals 7/10: I actually really enjoy them and are probably my favorite aspect of the game. They remind me a lot of Cave Story but in a shmup setting. Although some sprites do look a little off, a majority of them are well done. The artwork for the characters do feel a little uninspired but are still much more appealing to look at compared to early Touhou games.\n\nDifficulty 5/10: No, I don't find the game difficult, I 1cc'd my first run, so my score isn't based on the game being too hard (but that's not saying it's too easy). Once you get the hand of not dying in the first two stages, the next three aren't much harder. The difficulty only ramps up significantly on the Final boss (Let's just say I've managed to die not once, not twice, but five times on the Fear of Past and Future boss). My issue is that because the difficulty doesn't increase enough, the game stays static in a sense and there isn't a challenge outside of actually swapping the difficulty from normal to hard mode or achievement gathering.\n\nSimply put, it's better to have a simplistic Stage 1 and work its way up to a heavily challenging End Stage than a difficult Stage 1 that slightly increases from there.\n\nSound 6/10: I'm not a fan of chip tune. But I DO like a couple of tracks from this game, most notably the third stage and boss' themes. However, I find most songs I might not really listen to on my own time, being more average than fantastic (Not implying that they're actually bad, just... Y'know, average).\n\nStory 3/10: Out of the respect for the developer, I'll be keeping the spoilers tag for those interested in finding out the whole Story for themselves. If you can't finish the game six (let alone once) times, yet want to still know my opinion, by all means:\n\nThis is by far my biggest gripe about Jigoku Kisetsukan because it's the main reason why I played for a long while, the overall plot with each character (there's six, it takes roughly a little more than twenty minutes to beat the game with one, my playtime's reasonable for that). The first four bosses are your typical Anime clichés. You have the level headed protagonist, always-in-a-temper girl, cute nekogirl, an absurdly shy girl (In her defense, she's from another planet, so I'll let it pass), and the girl who wants to snuggle everything. Because the circumstances and their personalities clash, they fight one another when they meet.\n\nYour main protagonist senses something is wrong and eventually gets possessed. The others follow suite soon after before they have to fight the embodiment of their greatest fears. This is pretty much when I stopped enjoying the story. The last boss for character six claims to be the ultimate human fear: death itself. While death is fairly common to fear, a lot of people and cultures identify death as the end of something for a new beginning, which is a very good way to view death. If anything, ultimate human fears would be arachnids or heights/flying (A little ironic when the cast flies).\n\nCall it a nitpick, but when I see a story like in Touhou, I get something that enlightens me a bit whether it be about Japanese folklore or some good fortune cookie logic (Shikieiki Yamaxanadu from Touhou 9 does very good examples of this). With Jigoku Kisetsukan, I feel the story is there for the sake that there's a story while executing this poorly.\n\nOverall, despite it being heavily based on Touhou, I think that's one of Jigoku Kisetsukan's biggest flaws. It's more known to me as a free Touhou-on-Steam rather than something more independent. Ultimately, the game's very standard with some flaws, and that just doesn't make the game too memorable. For that, along with my time feeling wasted by trying to discover the story in its entirety, I can only recommend it to people who can't obtain a schmup in any other way, or to a schmup fan in desperate need of a new game, and that demographic's too low for me to give this a general recommendation.\n\nTouhou didn't start out good either, it took about 6 installments to gain its popularity. I hope Jigoku Kisetsukan will continue to expand and show its independence away from the Touhou Project while gaining the same attention but in its own special way.","May 16, 2015","false","3.6"," 58 of 99 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","58","99","9","1"

No.\nThe game shares many, oh so many, things with touhou it's kinda funny at the beginning, but if you can get past that the game is surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nDifficulty wise, it's pretty fair, when starting you might feel a cheap death or two coming your way, but thats part of these games anyway, you need to replay them to get a feeling for different patterns.\nYou cannot hoard auras (bombs), nor do you recover any after deaths, so it makes for some resource management.\nGaining lives or auras isn't score based, instead it rewards kills and managing to gather the drops, which is imo silly since they have grazing system in the game, which is essentially allowing a bullet to enter your sprite area without it hitting your actual hitbox, effectively giving you no reason to actually do it apart from score attacks if that's your thing.\nBoss patterns vary enough to keep each one interesting and the runs entertaining over multiple plays and best of all, everything on the screen is very clean and simple to keep track of even during chaotic looking attacks.\nOffers a fairly good challenge for anyone seeking such.\n\nThe story is a mess when first starting out, it opens up somewhat after clearing the game with more and more characters... even after that it's still a confusing pile of things to be honest. But it's a shmup so you most likely aren't playing it for the story anyway.\n\nAll the characters bring different play styles with them, some are fun, some not so fun. Each one has their own story, which shares acts from others and mainly differs at the finale. They all were fun in their own way, not that memorable, sadly, but varied enough to make me want to play them all. Also the art in this game is kinda cute.\nYou will need to clear the game once to unlock each normal character to play.\n\nThe soundtrack is chiptune(ish) which is interesting and somewhat weird, but it grows on you. Ofcourse you can always mute it, incase it bothers you alot.\n\n\nTL:DR: Try it. I found it surprisingly entertaining, so you might too. Should please anyone looking for a pretty decent and simple shmup to play, even if just wanting to try the genre.\nFun, varied, colorful and clean patterns and characters, great music and overall a fun challenge. ...Plus it's free.\nPs. It's not a shame to get your feet wet on easy and progressing from there.","May 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

In it you take control of one of the girls or one guy and fight your way through five stages worth of bullets.\n\nThe game can be quite obviously described as "Touhou": cute girls flying around shooting fairies or other girls in the face with lasers. But it's a bit more than that. The game has a unique, pixel / chiptune art style most reminiscent of the older PC-98 Touhou games rather than the modern ones. The graphics are very well-made, with each stage having its own theme, and the music, while kind of repetitive, does set the good mood for every moment of the game and is kind of catchy at times. Besides chiptunes, we are going to hear some metal too, which I personally enjoyed.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's pretty much Touhou: you fly around shooting stuff and dodging hundreds upon hundreds of bullets. Most of the core mechanics are the same, with the only major differences being the very lenient timing on the deathbombs and the fact that your bombs (called "Aura" in this game) do not regenerate if you die. In terms of bullet patterns, some of them I swear were lifted straight from certain spellcards in Touhou, but that might be just me having a few years worth of experience playing those games. The game has more-or-less Touhou level of difficulty when it comes to different difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard and Lunat-I mean Hell. It's fun blasting stuff to bits and getting between bullets, which is what matters the most in this type of game.\n\nThe character arts, while not as rich in details as for example Touhou ones, are pleasant to the eye and nice to look at. It might resemble dA level of drawing a bit, but that's not a bad thing.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that each character as their final boss faces the embodiment of their own personal fear, which usually comes with its own music theme and final attack. Except for the True Final Boss which the sixth character faces, where almost all the other playable characters gather up and go through a sort-of Boss Rush, which is honestly a pretty lazy idea of wrapping up the game.\n\nNow, onto the negatives. The game has crappy controller support, accepting only XInput controllers and being unable to even detect DirectInput ones. Considering most of the PC controllers use DirectInput, that hurts a lot, especially considering that the trial version of the fifteenth Touhou game came out literally two days earlier and doesn't have this issue. I personally suggest using JoyToKey to bypass that (and swapping Focus from Shift to a different button, this button's kind of clunky when it comes to JTK).\n\nOverall, the game may not be perfect, but it's worth playing, especially considering it's free. I recommend it to both Touhou enthusiasts and players new to the genre.","May 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","2"

It's story... well, it doesn't really exist, the art is... okay, but obviously not amazing, the music is good, but you won't have these tunes sticking in your brain. The bullet patterns are very bland, but at least being bland means that they aren't terrible. However, the controls need some work. They feel too floaty, the default movement speed perhaps too fast or the focus speed too slow. In a game like Crimzon Clover, I never once died and blamed the controls. Ever. I die in Crimzon Clover because I suck ♥♥♥♥ at that game. In this game, yes, there are deaths that I can blame very firmly on the controls. Even after getting used to them somewhat, they aren't very satisfying. But the game's free, so I can't ♥♥♥♥♥ altogether that much about it.\n\nOh, but one interesting thing: At the bottom of the screen during boss fights is a marker that follows the boss' horizontal location on the screen and displays their health. I don't know if this has ever been done before. If so, it's been in games that I haven't played or I just didn't notice it. But, man, this is such a brilliant little addition, allowing you to pay attention to dodging bullets while still knowing where to move in order to deal damage to this boss. Seriously.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/secret_bass/recommended/368950/","secret_bass","BrainPalace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/secret_bass/","144 products in account","A freeware bullet hell game that borrows heavily from the Touhou series, Jigoku Kisetsukan is a surpringly delightful little game that perhaps relies a bit too much on its influences. For those unfamiliar with the Touhou games, they are a self published series of vertical shooting games made by one man, ZUN. In them, a group of colorful anime girls do battle with the player, filling the screen with hundreds of projectiles to be dodged and weaved through as you attempt to grasp victory. Against these overwhelming odds, you are given a few advantages; a tiny hitbox that is much smaller than your character sprite, the ability to slow your character and focus fire for pinpoint maneuvering, and liberal lives and bombs to clear the screen and take pressure off.\n\nIt is from this blueprint that Jigoku Kisetsukan takes its design from. A cast of anime inspired characters must blast through 5 stages of increasingly difficult bullet patterns and boss fights, culminating in a final battle that pushes the players skills to the limits. It's in these gameplay setups that the game does particularly well, providing what feels like a solid and fun take on the Touhou games. The game features various characters to unlock, and they all have unique shot types which switch up the feel of the game quite a bit -- one character has a powerful close range attack while another relies on a particularly unconventional homing shot. The mechanics also lean towards punishing the player for deaths, with bombs that rely on killing enemies to be replenished instead of being given with a new life, and a shot power down that has to be earned back. It leads to a focus on proper execution in the face of harder patterns, rather than the war of attrition with lots of bombs that harder shooting game bosses can turn into.\n\nWhile the core gameplay itself is good, the game does falter in its attempt to tell the story. Parts of it are revealed through the game as you play via each of the characters, but it remains confusing and obliquely told, only really making sense with the supplimental material in the game. As you work through the game, the consequences of whats happening remain vague, and the final arc of the game lacks narrative context and feels arbitrary. A person might say "why care about story in a shooting game?", but the developer put quite a bit of time and effort into the one this game has, and it doesn't quite stand on its own legs.\n\nPerhaps the games greatest flaw though, is that it doesn't pull far enough away from the Touhou games to feel like much more than a fangame. One of the things that could have benefitted Jigoku Kisetsukan the most would be a proper scoring system; the game feels painfully basic in that regard, giving a player little to do but dodge and shoot, and the addition of even something as simple as Battle Garegga style medal chaining or Ketsui style point blanking could add a lot of life to the levels, giving more incentives for players to take risks through the game. Without more advanced scoring mechanics, the game feels like it's missing the biggest draw these types of games have. For the rest of the game, it enthusiastically copies the Touhou games in many aspects, and while this is a successful set of ideas to copy from, it makes the game feel like it lacks its own identity.\n\nStill, despite its flaws, it is a great little game. It's completely free. I would go so far as to say that Jigoku Kisetsukan is better than quite a number of paid shooting games on Steam. Having learned that the developer released it as their first game, I am extremely impressed. It is a very promising indie release, and a western game that actually gets bullet hell right. The unlockables are fun to get, the game gives a fair amount of challenge with its patterns, and is completely worth a look at for both newcomers to the genre and fans of the Touhou games.","June 9, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I say "interesting dev" because of the ending to each character. (Play and beat for yourself, because I'm spoiling naught.) It's certainly not something I expected from such a colorful game, and I'm not disappointed in the outcomes in the least. Emad certainly put some thought into it, which is something I can appreciate in and of itself.\nJigoku Kisetsukan: Sense of the Seasons is fun, addicting, and will leave you in a state of "how am I supposed to dodge that?!" if you were new to this genre like I was.\nDo I recommend?  Yes. Definitely. It's a fantastic gateway to newbies and what appears to be a very nice love letter to fans of the Touhou series.\n\n\nTo the dev: Twelve hours of gameplay in a week, and considering it has to be truly enthralling (or hooked-on mindlessness, which this game isn't) to some degree for me to play into it to this extent, that alone is a compliment. But if that isn't enough to-- Y'know what, no. Let me put it this way. I [currently] have 79 cents in my Steam wallet. Despite it not being much, I'd happily give every penny in my...hm...my STEAM pocket to you if I knew of such a way for opening a door to a brutal, exciting, and glorious new world of gaming. Because of this, my enjoyment for gaming has been reignited and I've begun playing the Touhou series starting from the sixth installment. I sincerely thank you for putting such hard work into this game and making it free for those of us who are a bit tight on cash.\n\nDo I have any suggestions or requests for the future? Yes, and only one. Keep going. Build on top of what you have created. Extra levels, characters, soundtracks, whatever. All I ask is that you keep the fire going, because this one will have a special spot in my gaming library for many years to come.","June 9, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of the Touhou games and thought that this was going to be sub-par compared to them but I couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact this game feels almost identical to playing that series but at the same time it has its own uniqueness about it.\n\nI was also worried that there was going to be a catch seeing as its free to play but the best part about this game is that there isn't. No microtransactions, no pay-to-win aspect of it, nothing. Just a free game on steam with no strings attached.\n\nLast point I wanted to bring up is that, as many already said prior, this game is actually easier than a lot of other games in the genre but that's not a bad thing by any means mind you. Even on normal I still get stressed out trying to dodge everything and I have a lot of fun doing it.\n\nOverall if you love the Touhou series, or you want to try an easier game in this genre for the first time, you can't go wrong with this game.","August 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Up to the point that I would say that easy mode is not a lie and hard mode is not 'hell'... No, I am not an asian.\n\nApart from that, this game is very solid, and not too hard. It gave me motivation to try out the touhou series.\n\nActually, if you want to try touhou some time, start with Touhou 6 or 10 if you want a fresh game; or 7 or 13 if you don't mind additional mechanics. Or you know, how about all 4?\n\nSo for the actual stuff...\n\n\nPros + Controls are solid enough 'Graze' very easily\n+ Moderately fun Bosses\n+ Unique Boss for every playable Character\n+ Free\n+ Slight Replayability\n\nCons  - Some boss 'spellcards' are very plain, generic and uninspired.\n- Dying or making a mistake can punish you severely during a later boss.\n\nVerdict:\nIt is a shoot'em up with a touhou inspiration, nice characters, and fare replayability.\nBut it is free.

Disregarding the fact that it's free, this is how I feel about it:\n\nWhen I rate stuff, I rate it on how distracting it is to me. Now let's see how distracting the game is.\n\nThe graphics weren't stunning, but they did what they were supposed to do (if their goal was to do some old school graphics thing, they pulled it off). It felt very simple to me, but at least it wasn't distracting. You know, ugly. At least it wasn't ugly-distracting.\n\nThe music was okay. Not Touhou-tier okay, but at least it did not make me mute the game. When I played for the first time, the only time I actually took note of the music was when there were no enemies to take down. So nope, not distracting at all, in a good way.\n\nDifficulty-wise, the game felt a bit easy in Normal mode. The thing I noticed about the game is that most of the time there's a rain of bullets coming your way. Sure that's bullet hell for you, but I actually would like a bit more of those laser stuff coming at me (like the ones with the bosses). Give me more lasers please.\n\nOne surprising way that this game was made easy as well are the death-bomb mechanics. I don't know how it is in the other modes (if it is any different), but if you can bomb, there's a timer when you get hit. That few seconds is huge. It makes it too easy to death-bomb.\n\nAnother thing to note is that once you die, the aura is kept at your current state. I find this kind of annoying. If you were really bad a certain pattern, have no more bombs left and die (u nid 2 gitgud boi), you probably will die again because you can't bomb.\n\nI think the game is a good start for people looking to get into bullet hells. Easy, lets you learn about death-bombing, limits you with your bombing (2gitgud) and it's free!\n\ntl;dr: game is gud. gitit.","May 17, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These types of Japanese indie games are designed with controllers in mind, so hopefully you have one, but it is still possible to play it with a keyboard, you use won't have as much control over your character.\n\nIf you're just starting out with these types of shumps (aka danmaku,) start on Easy, because it's like a Roguelike/lite, it's going to be hell.\n\nWhat I really like about all danmaku games is their portrayal of bullet "art" and great music.

Additionally, there are 4 difficulty modes, different playable characters, and your performance is graded at the end of each stage, which adds replay value. That said, this game isn't great, its inspirations are obvious and it's inspirations are to the extent that Jigoku is too afraid to take risks and do its own thing. Danmaku Unlimited also has very similar if not the exact same mechanics as Touhou, but Danmaku Unlimited has its own unique theme and style in regards to presentation, which helps it stand out from the crowd. The same just can't be said for Jigoku, what with the somewhat generic chiptune soundtrack and "indie retro" graphics.\n\nBut it's free and it's fun, so who cares right? Might as well just download it for yourself and see if you like it or not.","May 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wish you lots of success and hopefully we will see more of your work in the future!\n\nJigoku Kisetsukan: Sense of Seasons\nA fun little top-down bullet-hell shooter. For those who have played the Touhou series, this game will feel pretty familiar. For those barely delving into the world of bullet-hell shootem'ups, why welcome. Get ready to have bullets rain down on you like...well...rain.\n\nJigoku Kisetsukan features 5 stages, each getting a bit tougher than the last. At the end of each level you fight a boss. The bosses tend to have the most elaborate of bullet patterns and it is your mandate to dodge these patterns and to defeat that boss. Sounds simple, right? Ehehehe well...More often than not it is the bosses that will give you the most "bullet-hell." However the trick to any bullet-hell shooter is not to lose your cool...and not to lose your situational awareness.\n\nThe graphics,excluding background and character cut-ins, are in '8-bit' style which is pretty cool. However the gameplay is fluid and fairly responsive. In terms of general difficulty I found Jigoku Kisetsukan to be fair. The only time I have trouble is when I run out of "bombs" which are a special skill a player has to clear the bullets from the screen. It also destroys any enemies that are on the screen (except bosses). In Touhou or other shmups that i know if you die you get auxillary bombs with each life. The game also clears any bullets from the screen after your death. In Jigoku Kisetsukan you have instead a system where you can accumulate bomb points which add up to 2 bombs maximum. The game does not clear bullets from the screen upon death. Honestly this felt a bit alien to me and had a hard time getting used to it. Also using up your bombs and then dying on a boss can be quite unforgiving, especially when the screen is full of bullets and you are scrambling to find a safespot. This is my only complaint though and on the plus side using bombs does not negatively influence your score (unless you run out of lives and then choose to continue). Also, upon death, you get to keep any remaining bomb points you had so your bombs don't go to waste. So this is a bittersweet deal as you have to learn to become wise about using your bombs. Anyways for those who have played Touhou, the bullet patterns are fairly generic and simple, even if some of them feel inspired by Touhou patterns. There are no gimmicks other than each playable character you unlock having a different "feel" and shot type (you start with one playable character and unlock 6 more as you play through the game). There is a practice mode in this game which allows you to practice individual stages without having to go through any prior stages like in normal gameplay mode, which is very helpful if you find yourself struggling at a certain stage or boss. Finally you also have a soundtrack mode which is nice (the music in this game is very nice!).\n\nAll in all a decent bullet-hell top-down shooter. Just give it a try. The game is free, why not?","December 2, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Why?  Because the game is FREE and fun.  That's good enough, right?  Obviously a game being free alone does not warrant its download -- but if it's a fun game that achieves its gameplay goals, *that* does.\n\nAnyway, as has been said before, "Jigoku Kisetsugan" draws HEAVILY from the "Touhou" series.  It's not IDENTICAL, mind you, but the similarities definitely shine through.  It IS close enough that, were it not free, (and, were it not standard procedure to mimic / rip-off / pay homage to Touhou) it could approach reprehensible.  But... that is not the alternate reality we live in.  As it stands, this is a very fun little shooter by a new(-ish?) developer, with a LOT of promise for the future.\n\nMy only major gripe with the game, so far, is the fact that you seem to get 1 starting "bomb" per CREDIT, not per life -- at least on Normal difficulty.  IMO this is absurd, not because the game is especially difficult, but because it's standard procedure in the genre and combat feels a bit bland without it.  Then again, I am still "learning" the game.\n\nAnyway, it's fun, it's free, and it's *almost* Steam Touhou.

Note I have not. That last remotely even similar I played was in the Gradius Series... Been a long time since then, as I had interest in other games.\n\nPicking this one up, due to it being free; with limited funds these days I have to choose carefully on each next game.\n\nThank you for a lovely game.\n\nDidn't really pay attention to this genre due to hardly knowing it existed, but I can say I love it. Reminds me of lots of games that pushed me to go further.\n\nThis is an arcade style game that was named rightly so "bullet hell", although I usually just call them shooters, as it is the same premises. Just with a few different mechanics in mind.\n\nThe main one being the "bullets" on the screen, and the paterns to each spread with each enemy you run across in the game. Seems like the genre advanced even further since I last played it, and happy that it did. They have come a long way.\n\nSure there are plenty of other games out there, possibly even better ones by some of the more dedicated followers of the genre. However for someone like myself it is just another simple game to focus on in short bursts that can last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour.\n\nGranted I have not, as of this review, gotten very far in the game; at least i see my own progress as I get sometimes further with each try. This is on easy. If you don't have experience in this genre, and don't have much eye hand coordination with a limited amount of memory; then don't let the name fool you, as it may not be as easy the name implies.\n\nThat will vary from person to person and what games they are use to. All I can say is Patience, Practice, and Determination can keep you addicted to this game for a bit if you find it is difficult. Those that don't and find it easy on even the higher difficulties, then you are not missing much.\n\nNow I enjoy the art style, as it is colorful, and easy to keep track of for myself. It may not be for everyone, but since it is free you might as well have a try at it.\n\nI would at least recommend trying this game even if it had a small price tag, which it doesn't. For me I found it worth my time. Enjoyable with each attempt.:)","May 14, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The silly dialogue, bullet patterns, hitboxes and controls will be instantly familiar to anyone who has played those games. Also like Touhou, the difficulty level is such that anyone can 1cc the game in normal difficulty without too much practice.\n\nThe backgrounds are quite dull during the stages, mostly just clouds, so you don't get a sense of place or of being on a journey, but at least they never blend with the bullets, which is the main thing. The music is a collection of generic chiptunes, lacking any ambition or thematic coherence. I found them quite annoying to be honest and the worst part of the game.\n\nThere are 7 playable characters, with some weird balance issues, like the character with a focused laser beam being the slowest of them all, or several of the bosses' patterns timing out because your character doesn't do enough damage, but they are all usable -in the normal difficulty at least, which is what I've played so far.\n\nIt doesn't reach the quality of the originals but it is a very competent effort overall.","May 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It all feels very charming and indie. The bullet shapes and colors are almost exactly like Touhou's, which makes for some very pretty patterns.\n\nSound - Chiptune soundtrack with some names that might be familiar if you're into the chiptune scene (I personally recognize Zabutom). The tracks are energetic and distinctive, though it sometimes feels like something is missing. Also, the sound effects are well done, with clear cues for everything necessary in a bullet hell shooter. There are no harsh sounds, like Touhou's infamous chimes and bells.\n\nGameplay - Stages are well-paced, though the enemies may come through a bit faster than you're used to. The bosses present a variety of challenges to overcome, and there are even some attacks inspired by Touhou spell cards. The normal difficulty feels easy enough for those curious about the bullet hell genre, while Hard and Hell modes are sure to provide a great challenge for veterans. Plus, there's six different playable characters with their own shot type, dialogue, and unique final boss.\n\nOverall, there's a whole lot to be enjoyed in this FREE game, and it definitely ranks well among the other bullet hells on Steam, such as Danmaku Unlimited and ExCeed. There's no catch, no microtransactions. If you're even a little curious about bullet hell shmups, DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW.","May 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BurnLifesHouseDown/recommended/368950/","BurnLifesHouseDown","CombustibleLemons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BurnLifesHouseDown/","235 products in account","Let's start with the review. The game is a Danmaku style, most popularized in the west by Touhou, so the two games feel very much alike. They are not the same game, as each has its own differences. Jigoku Kisetsukan is slightly harder then most Tohuou games, resting at about Touhou 11's or 12's level of difficulty. Early on the game consists of a lot of what i call panic spells, attacks that look scary, until you sit back and notice the pattern, then they become rather easy. Later on, about stage 4, the game changes into actually difficult attacks that don't rely on panic spells to kill you.\n\nMy pros for the game are as follows.\n\nLarge cast of playable characters, 5 main and 1 unlockable\nInteresting characters and designs that don't feel overly sexualized for the sake of "because"\nBoss Attacks that both look and feel unique\nInteresting take on the spare life counter and interesting ways of collecting lives and bombs\nBoss attacks are genuinly challenging and require skill to complete\nStage practice mode for all characters and difficulties\nCharacter dialog. say you are playing as Tenshi and reach stage 4 and you fight Fumin, then you play as Fumin and reach stage 4 and fight tenshi, the dialog will be the same. Tenshi will say the same lines if you are playing as her, or as Fumin and same with the other Characters. A little thing, but one that I liked as it made the different characters all feel like they are in the same general time zone. Plus if you are playing as Nibiiro, you can see what she is thinking during her periods of silence from the other character's perspective.\nParts of the OST, stage 3, stage 4, stage 5 and several of the boss fight 5s come to mind when I think of the good songs in the game.\nDepending on which character you pick, you will get a different final boss. All the final bosses share 3(I think) attacks, but the rest are unique to that boss\nThe bars on the side of the screen that house the HUD are slightly transperant so I can see where enemies are coming from, before they start firing so I can prepare to kill them off quickly.I may add to this as I play the game more.\n\nMy cons for the game and reasons why are as follows\nThe HUD for it is a little... not good. The life, power, and bomb bar are cramed down in the bottom left, rather far away from where you focus on causing something like checking how many bombs you have can mean opening yourself to get killed. Plus the actual number amount of lives and bombs is a bit small, making it harder to see, and thus adding to the first reason.\nThe stage 5 attacks have a very sudden jump in difficulty, they feel a bit too hard all of the sudden. Though I suppose that will go away with time and practice.\nCharacter's don't handle the best. this is more of a personal con, but everyone except Nibiiro moves around a bit too fast, where as Nibiiro moves a little too slowly. I did end up adapting to Nibiiro's slow speed and massive power and she is my current favorite, but the other cahracters all have the same move speed which is just a bit too fast for me to really play well.\nSome of the shot types are rather unfair. Another personal Con, but Eiko, Mizuiro and Fumin all have weird shot types that just feel so akward, especially Eiko with her TD focused Youmu-esque short range blade cuts.\nThe chiptune OST at times, while there are some good songs in the game, some bad ones that give me a bit of a headache. Plus if you take too long killing the midboss and the stage song runs out, it doens't loop meaning you have no song playing until you reach the boss.\nThe location of the enemy names bothered me a bit, simmilar to my HUD con, they are kinda out of the way and you don't notice them much so I have been having trouble learning the names of the characters.\nYou don't get bombs back after death, making it so that if you run out of power due to constant death during a boss fight, you are screwed unless you are willing to use a continue.\nDuring boss fights, loosing power to dying often is hard to come back from. Clearing a boss attack doesn't give enough power to make up for losing 1-3 points of power\nThe plot is... hoping to be there. The gist of Tenshi's story is understandable somewhat, if not a little bland. however the other character's stories are nearly non-exsistant. Not to mention The last unlockable character, ??? or  TenSHI  has no plot, and actually conflicts with something else in the game's story.

The game doesn't restock your bombs when you die and you lose a net 0.65 power points every time you do--- dying twice in succession to a boss leads to you being totally unable to kill them in a timely manner as the shottype ramps up so drastically, and the HP values are very obviously balanced towards fighting enemies with 5.00 power. The end result is being forced to take on bosses for the whole extent of their countdown durations hoping not to get hit and lose even more power. In addition, there needs to be an initial hit SFX or more obvious visual so it doesn't feel like you died from out of nowhere at times. Play the game, but be aware that to get very far endgame you might need to play perfectly.","May 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is a Danmaku style, most popularized in the west by Touhou, so the two games feel very much alike. They are not the same game, as each has its own differences. Jigoku Kisetsukan is slightly harder then most Tohuou games, resting at about Touhou 11's or 12's level of difficulty. Early on the game consists of a lot of what i call panic spells, attacks that look scary, until you sit back and notice the pattern, then they become rather easy. Later on, about stage 4, the game changes into actually difficult attacks that don't rely on panic spells to kill you.\n\nMy pros for the game are as follows.\n\nLarge cast of playable characters, 5 main and 1 unlockable\nInteresting characters and designs that don't feel overly sexualized for the sake of "because"\nBoss Attacks that both look and feel unique\nInteresting take on the spare life counter and interesting ways of collecting lives and bombs\nBoss attacks are genuinly challenging and require skill to complete\nStage practice mode for all characters and difficulties\nCharacter dialog. say you are playing as Tenshi and reach stage 4 and you fight Fumin, then you play as Fumin and reach stage 4 and fight tenshi, the dialog will be the same. Tenshi will say the same lines if you are playing as her, or as Fumin and same with the other Characters. A little thing, but one that I liked as it made the different characters all feel like they are in the same general time zone. Plus if you are playing as Nibiiro, you can see what she is thinking during her periods of silence from the other character's perspective.\nParts of the OST, stage 3, stage 4, stage 5 and several of the boss fight 5s come to mind when I think of the good songs in the game.\nDepending on which character you pick, you will get a different final boss. All the final bosses share 3(I think) attacks, but the rest are unique to that boss\nThe bars on the side of the screen that house the HUD are slightly transperant so I can see where enemies are coming from, before they start firing so I can prepare to kill them off quickly.I may add to this as I play the game more.\n\nMy cons for the game and reasons why are as follows\nThe HUD for it is a little... not good. The life, power, and bomb bar are cramed down in the bottom left, rather far away from where you focus on causing something like checking how many bombs you have can mean opening yourself to get killed. Plus the actual number amount of lives and bombs is a bit small, making it harder to see, and thus adding to the first reason.\nThe stage 5 attacks have a very sudden jump in difficulty, they feel a bit too hard all of the sudden. Though I suppose that will go away with time and practice.\nCharacter's don't handle the best. this is more of a personal con, but everyone except Nibiiro moves around a bit too fast, where as Nibiiro moves a little too slowly. I did end up adapting to Nibiiro's slow speed and massive power and she is my current favorite, but the other cahracters all have the same move speed which is just a bit too fast for me to really play well.\nSome of the shot types are rather unfair. Another personal Con, but Eiko, Mizuiro and Fumin all have weird shot types that just feel so akward, especially Eiko with her TD focused Youmu-esque short range blade cuts.\nThe chiptune OST at times, while there are some good songs in the game, some bad ones that give me a bit of a headache. Plus if you take too long killing the midboss and the stage song runs out, it doens't loop meaning you have no song playing until you reach the boss.\nThe location of the enemy names bothered me a bit, simmilar to my HUD con, they are kinda out of the way and you don't notice them much so I have been having trouble learning the names of the characters.\nYou don't get bombs back after death, making it so that if you run out of power due to constant death during a boss fight, you are screwed unless you are willing to use a continue.\nDuring boss fights, loosing power to dying often is hard to come back from. Clearing a boss attack doesn't give enough power to make up for losing 1-3 points of power\nThe plot is... hoping to be there. The gist of Tenshi's story is understandable somewhat, if not a little bland. however the other character's stories are nearly non-exsistant. Not to mention The last unlockable character, ??? or  TenSHI  has no plot, and actually conflicts with something else in the game's story.  You play as tenSHI, who is Thanatos, the embodiment of the fear of death who stole the body of Tenshi, yet you fight Tenshi as the final boss. How can you play as TenSHI, yet fight tenshi? . While it does feel like there is indeed different stories all going on at the same time with how each character fights Tenshi where you would fight them if you were playing Tenshi, it still feels like there is no plot to the game, and the little plot of Tenshi's story isn't well ended.\nA continuation of the last one, what about Muzuiro? Her search for the Druid that helped her as a child was an interersting idea that I wish we could see more of. does she ever actually find the druid?\nThose were the cons, and here are a few things that don't fit in either con, or pro, but that I want to mention, mostly to the dev.\nMidbosses, like the stage 4 one I think. Negadev was it?  I want to know more about it but there is nothing about it, same with the other midbosses like the pilots of Nibiiro's space ship, or Mizurio's dragon thing in her stage and bombs. Plus why did Nibiiro blow her own ship up and then cry about how it is gone now.\nI feel like Eiko, at least as tenshi, wasn't explained well enough. I didn't really get that it was a curse giving her the ears until after I beat her, which at that point I was too busy getting into the game to realize it until I played through Tenshi's story again to 1CC it.\nNibiiro's ball things also confused me, what exactly are they? The eye things I mean. Playing as her, they act as her fammilars to fire her lasers, but I don't see them in her boss fight, or her ever think about them. I assume they are her weapons?\nI would like it a lot of there were volume controls, like to make the sound effects louder, but not change the volume of the music. Also a Music library like the Touhou games has would be nice.\nThere is an issue with the achivements, not sure if this was intended, but I can unlock ???/TenSHI  by unlocking Dev, then just going back and playing another character for a second time, instead of beating Dev's story. Plus I could get achievments by playing on easy and using continues. Lastly playing as ???/TenSHI  lets you get the "immortal" achievment by simply playing the character as you should.

Game plays very similar to Touhou games in terms of visuals, gameplay, and mechanics. Based on my experience with Normal mode, the game doesn't seem to be extremely difficult, but it still presents a decent challenge to those who are experienced with bullet hells to a limited degree.\n\nThe gameplay of most bullet hells is very similar, so I'll just point out some finer details. You have 2 bombs in this game that recharge by killing enemies/clearing boss phases. Ultimately, these bombs don't recharge very quickly, maybe at a rate of 1-2 per level? When you have both bombs charged, you get like a 5 second window to last bomb. These bombs do not recover when you die.\nI feel like normal enemies take a relatively long time to kill in this game while bosses are generally pretty weak, only getting off one pattern cycle of shots per phase.\nHitbox leniency, bullet effects, boss patterns, enemy patterns, story, art, and musical emphasis are all very similar to Touhou, making this a great way to get started on the bullet hell genre or a fun diversion for some more experienced players. Another interesting thing is that the game makes great use of the left and right sides of the screen by showing enemies that are approaching from outside of the tiny playing field.\n\nOne minor gripe I had was that I don't feel like I have that much control with the keyboard, and yet the game doesn't recognize any of the controllers I have connected to my computer.\n\nTL;DR:\nPRETTY MUCH A TOUHOU GAME. HAVEN'T TRIED HARDEST DIFFICULTY YET, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HARD THIS GAME GETS. FOR THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE SMASH BROS SCENE, THIS IS THE PROJECT M TO TOUHOU'S MELEE.","May 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though it's only the genre that's similar, apart from the Japanese theme, this game reminds me a lot of the Touhou franchise.\n\nAnyway, Jigoku Kisetsukan: Sense of the Seasons, thrusts you into an immersive, rage inducing, addicting experience that will leave you craving more. The game has a difficulty adjuster (thank goodness) so you can get immersed even if you are a newcomer to the genre.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple: Move around the screen killing enemies and collecting point cards without getting hit. If you get hit once, you die. you get three lives and three continues.\n\nThe bosses are actually characters that, once you defeat them in combat, become unlocked and playable. Each one has their own unique attacks that change as their power level goes up. some characters are slower than others, some are faster than others, so there is a bit of an option there if you like faster or slower moving characters.\n\nOverall, not a bad game.

I recommend this to anyone who is already a bullet hell fan, or to anyone looking for a challenge. I think most actual Touhou fans will probably just stick with "real" Touhou though.

The music feels slightly ill-fitting too. Were there audio control settings, I'd lower the volume to still hear the firing, but there isn't so I just keep the volume off.\nLooks like a GameMaker game, which is not a problem of looks, I love Risk of Rain, but the poor optimization drops the game to sub-60fps with pretty little enemies and bullets on the screen, slowing it down.

It's a wonderful way to get into Bullet Hells without breaking the bank to import a Touhou game.\n2) For the Shmup veteran, a 'Pre-death' countdown begins to let you know just how much time you have left to use a bomb to save yourself. Trust me, in this game, that makes a huge difference.\n3) Wonderful 16-bit feel with well-drawn artwork.\n\n-Cons\n1) And this is nit-picking: You don't revive with any bombs. Sure, the game is grateous enough to constantly provide them (at least one per stage) but it may throw the veteran player off for the first few runs.\n2) The patterns, while beautiful, feel ripped from Touhou at times. One may notice Cirno's Perfect Freeze and a few from Meiling's repitoire for example. Because of this, spells can feel a little random at times as for one moment, you have an Alice-based card, and then the next, you're being shot with a Patchouli-styled laser card. As such, you can't really expect a flow between spells, and again, it may trip up veteran players.\n\nWhile a few things can be polished, and a little more originality could have been used, for a free game, this is really well done. And, while my review may seem a little harsh, don't take my words to heart. This game deserves at least some of your time, and, I hope if you enjoy this, then you find the games that this was based on to be just as enjoyable.\n\nOverall, a 9/10.","October 25, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have some experience in the genre, go ahead and give it a try. It's free, eats almost no space on your HDD and an old 10+ years old toaster, like mine can run it.\n\nHowever, if you are totally new to the genre, I'd recommend Crimson Clover instead. Reason: Jigoku Kisetsukan is HARD. Just look at the trailer video. Those aren't extraordinary fights, no, that's pretty much the difficulty level across the board. Your screen is going to be filled with projectiles pretty much all the time, not just during bossfights. Add to the fact, that you have 3 lives, and two continues (if you've used up all of your lives) and that's it. If you run out, you have to reset the entire progress, not just the level. So if you run out of continues on the last level, you have start the entire game all over again. So if you're new to this, chances are that you won't even make it to the end of the second level on your first try. On easy. On hard, you probably won't live long enough to even see the first boss. So only try this if you have some experience with the genre, or you have the patience of a saint.","May 15, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or a character where her projectiles have an amazingly small DPS and at the same time miss more than half the time forcing you to depend on the countdown considering how it would kill the boss faster than you can.

The story in this is pretty much the usual where 5 girls meet each other and then they meets your character's biggest fear and death and fear somethings.\n\nThe art style is pretty nice though, the characters are anime styled which is the only thing I think is different from Touhou and damn I'm glad one of the gurls is kawaii as heck (Nibiiro pls). The music is some Chiptune's which I guess was there to give the 8-bit feel to the character, personally I think it could've used some better music or I'm just way too accustommed to Touhou's music, can't really tell.\n\nIf we're talking this only as a fangame of Touhou, this is actually really good (because characters art style plzzz) but I can't really say the same if we're gonna be comparing this with Touhou or any other popular bullet hell as an independent game.\n\nOverall I would play this to see Nibiiro and play as her only because she's sooo kawaii and it's still a really nice bullet hell.\n\n....Might be too biased with Touhou here, I'll probably change this after I tried more bullet hell that's not Touhou...","October 17, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have some experience in the genre, go ahead and give it a try. It's free, eats almost no space on your HDD and an old 10+ years old toaster, like mine can run it.\n\nHowever, if you are totally new to the genre, I'd recommend Crimson Clover instead. Reason: Jigoku Kisetsukan is HARD. Just look at the trailer video. Those aren't extraordinary fights, no, that's pretty much the difficulty level across the board. Your screen is going to be filled with projectiles pretty much all the time, not just during bossfights. Add to the fact, that you have 3 lives, and two continues (if you've used up all of your lives) and that's it. If you run out, you have to reset the entire progress, not just the level. So if you run out of continues on the last level, you have start the entire game all over again. So if you're new to this, chances are that you won't even make it to the end of the second level on your first try. On easy. On hard, you probably won't live long enough to even see the first boss. So only try this if you have some experience with the genre, or you have the patience of a saint.","May 15, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite fun and the music prompts you to head-bob to it as you go.\nIt's a pleasant experience.\nNow, I'm a fan of the Touhou series of games, so I've had my fair share of standing-in-the-rain-and-not-getting-wet gameplay, and I'd say the difficulty of this game is enjoyable. Easy on the first levels, and butt-kicking on the later ones (on normal anyways)\nIn fact, the one and only thing I dislike about this game is the one character, Eiko.\nPlaying as her is pretty difficult. She moves really fast, which is nice, but her attacks don't even connect with the boss unless you hang around the very top of the screen, which will normally kill you, since A: That's where the enemies are, you can run into them and die, B: You're given .25 seconds reaction time to bullets, and C: Bullets will sometimes literally spawn on you during boss attacks and kill you. (I was able to complete the game on normal with tenshi my first time, no continues, but with Eiko, I ran through all my continues by stage 4)\nI recommend this game, it's really fun overall. aside from my minor complaint.","May 16, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Too big/weirdly placed) Makes scratching almost impossible.\n-When using focus (shift) the character is really, I mean REALLY slow and when you switch back to normal mode the character goes really fast.-> You'll die to next bullet even you tried to pass it\n-Fanbase. Even It's not a thing in-game it's annoying to see people whining that this is a cheap Touhou copy.\n\nStory; 4/5  Playability; 3/5  Characters; 5/5  Musics; 6/5  It's awesome to see a good bullet hell in Steam! :)","August 23, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game you pick a female protagonist and proceed to destroy lots of other faeries and other anime-centric characters.  At the end of each stage is a boss which has multiple phases that you have defeat to move on to the next stage.\n\nAs you progress through the stages you unlock new characters to play.  Each character has a unique mechanic separating the character from other characters, whether it is varying movement speed or shot patterns.  These characters give the game a certain amount of depth and replay-ability.\n\nHonestly there isn't much reason NOT to get this game.  Not only is it free, but it's actually a quality game without any transactions.  It's very easy to jump in and play and is very challenging.  The graphics aren't the best by any means; they're worse than a Touhou game but they work for the games intentions.\n\nAs I said, you don't lose anything by playing this game and it has free achievements!","December 31, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes. It's not as good as any Touhou? Absolutely.\n\nIs it completely bad? No. Actually, it's very good for it's "price tag".\n\nIt has quite a few shortcomings gameplay-wise, such as your characters having a gargantuan hitbox, common enemies being annoying, nimble bullet sponges; you getting absolutely roflpwned if you die even once in more intense portions of the game because you don't regenerate bombs (or Aura, in this case, whatever) and you hardly get any considerable amount of power items in boss fights.\n\nStory-wise... Well, let's be honest. Touhou has a ♥♥♥♥ story that is all about an infinite loop of "poorly drawn girl meets another poorly drawn girl > they throw some obscure references to JoJo, Agatha Christie and eventually japanese folklore and pop culture or say some nonsense > they try to kill each other with some bullet hells > you win > your poorly drawn girl meets another one > rinse and repeat". This game does pretty much the same, just with some less JoJo and Agatha Christie and some more anime clichés... A LOT MORE of anime clichés, if I may say. And the dialogues are not as skippable as Touhou's, which can get on your nerves eventually.\n\nThe chiptunes get quite zany at times, but are okay-ish for the most part.\n\nAs for the graphics, the pixel art is very cute and pleasant. The drawn sprites are not perfect but at least the designs aren't as much of unholy abominations as Touhou's. At least this artist can drawn legs and hands, and facial features in their proper places.\n\nAnd I might have got too accostumed to LoLK and some other bullet hell games like Hitogata Happa, but this game is easy (judging by bullet hell standards).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutegoblingirl/recommended/368950/","cutegoblingirl","cute goblin girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutegoblingirl/","486 products in account","The basic setup of Jigoku Kisetsukan will be familiar to most bullet hell players. You have a shoot button, a smart bomb with limited uses, and a "focus" button that shows your character's actual hitbox -- far smaller than the character's size onscreen -- and slows down your movements. While there is some element of aiming and shooting at opponents, for the most part you're intent on dodging intricate mathematical patterns of enemy fire.\n\nJigoku Kisetsukan is very, very Touhou. The main character bears a strong physical resemblance to Reimu, the most common enemies are Christmas-tree-angel fairies, even the danmaku patterns make me think of the middle Touhou games. The major distinction is that Jigoku Kisetsukan is almost a demake; the synthesized orchestral music is replaced by chiptunes, and the game artwork is downgraded and pixelized.\n\nThere's also just overall a lot less ... character. While the designs aren't bad (better, in fact, than some of the early Touhou characters) the characters just don't have as much personality. Their before-battle conversations are utterly humorless, to the point that I wondered why the author bothered. Perhaps there's better dialogue when playing with other characters, but Tenshi just seems generically "good" and not much else.\n\nOn the other hand, the ability to unlock other characters' stories is interesting, and you do get more playable characters than average for the genre. That's a lot of replayability.\n\nWhich, of course, brings us to the price. I'd have been happy with anything up to about $6.99, but the game is being provided free and legally. It also has a slightly easier difficulty curve than most bullet hell games, so it is a good introduction to the genre.","April 21","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want it only for achievements, I don't recommend it as it is extremely hard to get all the achievements.\n\nThis game surprised me, and it is one of my favourite games.

Bullet hell vets might find this game too easy (shorter bosses, shorter stages, simpler patterns), but it's a good introduction for a newcomer to the genre.  The graphics are 16-bit pixels and the music is very chiptuney.  Plot and characters are shallow, as expected.
