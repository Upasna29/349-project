"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winter_Scout/recommended/322330/","Winter_Scout","WinterScout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winter_Scout/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.\n\nStarting off:\nOnce you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless\n\nSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.\n\nWilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.\n\nEndless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a "Jury-Rigged Portal" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the "Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)\n\nOnce you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).\n\nCharacters -\n\nWilson:\n\nPros -\n\nGrows a beard\n\nCons - None.\n\nWilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.\n\nWillow:\n\nPros -\n\nDoesn't Take fire damage\nStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)\n\nCons -\n\nWhen on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires\nCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.\n\nWillow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.\n\nWolfgang:\n\nPros -\n\nGets stronger on a full stomach\nHas more hp\n\nCons -\n\n1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach\nMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach\nLoses more sanity in Night / Afternoon\n\nAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only "Power up" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.\n\nWendy:\n\nPros -\n\nHas a ghost sister\nDoesn't lose much sanity in dark\n\nCons -\n\nDoes -.25% Less damage than all characters\nLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in\n\nWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.\n\nWX78:\n\nPros -\n\nCan eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.\nCan be charged by lightning\nCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.\n\nCons -\n\nTakes Damage in the rain\nStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)\n\nWX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.\n\nWickerbottom:\n\nPro -\n\nStarts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.\nAble to craft her own books\nStarts off with 2 Papyrus.\n\nCons -\n\nCan't Sleep\nTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food\n\nWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.\n\nThe Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.\n\nOver all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

Me and my friend had everything stocked up; tons of bunnies in the chests, two ice boxes filled with food from our farms and drying racks, two crockpots just for those nights that you needed really filling food, two themal stones, enough clothing to keep warmth for a decent distance away from base camp.\n\nHad a wall built with three or so beefalo corralled in so that we could get manure and beefalo wool during the night. Honestly, we had this entire thing down set, winter wasn't going to beat us.\n\nHe said he was going to the bathroom and left me to tend to the fire to keep us through the night. Naturally, I didn't have any problem with that- surely we were set for a night.\n\nAnd then my character heard something in the distance, something that was getting closer increasingly faster. Thinking it was just a wolf, I grabbed my spear and armor, wolves weren't anything to worry about.\n\nExcept the ground shook the closer it came, rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen; giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye, every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it's mouth hole, every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston.\n\nWhen my friend came back from the bathroom, everything was gone. He died instantly, unable to move or defend himself from the Deerclops, a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight. The Deerclops knew how to get me too, chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out, unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend. Blind now in the darkness, all I could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before Charlie bore down on me, snuffling out the last vestiges of health I had before it was all over.\n\nWhat happened?! My friend exclaimed when he came back, incredulous that this much could happen in a span of a few spare minutes, the monochromatic view on his screen the same as the utter failure that was on my own.\n\nIndeed, my friend, what happened?\n\n10/10 Would play again","March 10","true","133.5"," 217 of 230 people (94%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","94","217","230","168","2"

But that is because I played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay. For the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter. I however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version. With no in-game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life. Everything kills you, especially your friends. The pace of the game may feel slow but soon the amount of resources to gather and refine become immense and turn this game into a fast pace race to gather the gear to survive the winter.\n\nIn closing this game has an unforgiving learning curve which is only magnified by the masses of new players who have never tried the single player experience. Prepare to fail many times through your own mistakes and those of others.\n\nHave fun and don't burn the berry bushes. Don't Starve Together is a MUST BUY from Klei Entertainment.\n-12|29|2014 (94 hrs) Vice","December 29, 2014","true","207.2"," 177 of 184 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","177","184","7","0"

On a whim I decided to see if I could hatch it instead of cooking and eating it. What began was a heartwarming tale of raising a bird in this dark world. It took a long time to hatch and there were many difficulties. The dangers of the night and keeping it nice and cozy. When it did hatch it was dark night and I had just began building the walls of our happy home. It began by cowering in the corner. I finished the walls thinking it would try to escape. Instead it began to follow me. But it backed away when I tried to feed it. I soon became fond of my new companion. Unfortunately it became fond of me. It was a dark night when... The hound nation attacked. They broke down my walls and forced their way into my camp. The baby died trying to protect me. I would like to say I avenged it, but I died soon after. R.I.P.

Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger for as long as possible. Craft weapons to fight monsters, cook food to stave starvation, and make sure you always have a fire for nighttime. If the harsh winter, packs of hounds, or dapper walruses don’t get you, something else will. Players can choose from three game modes with different features, including whether to play with complete strangers or friends, or to allow PvP.\n\nDon't Starve Together key features:\n\nHunting and Gathering – collect resources from different biomes and creatures to cook, build, and craft things to survive.\nTeam Play – everyone must survive! Share and support each other in the dark world, because if one player dies, their presence as a ghost will eventually kill you by driving you insane.\n\nYou can play with up to 64 players on a dedicated server!\n\nCrafting – create your own tools, food, items, structures, and clothes to help you survive through the brutal seasons.\nRandomly Generated New Worlds – new maps make each game different and unique. You’ll never find yourself in the same world twice.\n\nGreat Soundtrack and SFX – the music of Don’t Starve Together is refreshing, creepy, and haunting. Each character is voiced by a different instrument, which adds an interesting flavor to the sound dynamic of the game.\n\nThis game is incredibly fun. I sunk about 270 hours into it already. I recommend playing with friends or on a private server because there is known to be griefers, and I know of one instance we ended up restarting many times due to it. That's to be expected with a game like this, and at times can add to the gameplay, especially when PvP is on.\n\n\nThis is the sort of game which tells you "don't starve" as a helpful basic premise and then seems to delight in revealing the sheer volume of other things you shouldn't touch, prod, eat, walk near, or forget to build in case of sudden death.\nIn fact it would be more accurate to have called it "Don't Starve And Also Don't Try To Make Friends With That Tall Bird And Did You Remember To Build A Fire And There Are A Lot More Spiders In That Nest Than You Think And Seriously Please Stop Going Near That Bird".\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering, Webber isn't a spiderperson. He's a child that lives inside the carcass of the spider which tried to eat him. Which is, y'know, quite a bit darker.\n\nIf you like survival games, if you enjoy Tim Burton-esque artwork, or if you’re just looking for an unforgiving challenge of a game, pick up Don’t Starve immediately. Pretty much most of the stuff about this game is fantastic, and you’ll undoubtedly fall in love with it.\n\nUltimately, it’s a game that just keeps giving, even as it tears your life from you.\n\n8.5/10","October 26, 2015","true","423.3"," 96 of 99 people (97%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","97","96","99","18","3"

So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.\n\nThe Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.\n\nAs for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.\n\nIf you haven't played the game.

Cons\nthe game goes a bit too fast sometimes. what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month. aswell, food (although still a problem) is nearly non-existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning. this goes for health aswell, as bees seem to be someone's top priority. if you are not dumb, or take something on too tough for you, you will never die. (unless you are WX because rain is so BS)\n\n4.) end result\nthe game is well balanced and fun. there is a dynamic knowledge of what we need to do. you can eventually get to a point where you have "morning routines" like gathering the rabbits from the field, and harvesting honey, without the worry of needing to spend your ENTIRE day doing that, like you do in singleplayer. the game move much faster, and the ability to respawn (if you have nice teammates) makes it much more enjoyable, with the fear of permideath always on your shoulder. i would reccomend this game to those that did not enjoy the super-stress of the singleplayer, but likes the overall gameplay, or just because they want to play with friends. this, however, is a short burning flame. the game does not last long, as server hosts need to leave, ending the game for everyone. in the end, however, i give it a good review. it is great gameplay with a slight gameplay twist, that ends up turning it into what seems as an entirely new game by the devs. 8/10; brb going to go play it again.","December 20, 2014","true","121.2"," 96 of 102 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","96","102","2","1"

Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers.\n\nCommunication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.\n\nOn top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.\n\nAll of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.","December 16, 2014","true","34.4"," 103 of 118 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","103","118","2","1"

DST adds an increasing level of difficulty due to the rebalancing of the game, playing the game solo is not recomended due to enemies having an increased amount of health. The rebalancing in the game is fair as long as you have friends to help you out. DST is still in beta so not everything has been added to the game yet, but Klei is hard at work adding more and more to the game.

Playing Co-operatively, you have to know what you are doing if you want to live and thrive, you must plan for times ahead and it gets fun from there, however, playing free for all is something much more scary as players are unpredictable, they might help you or they might try to kill you.\n\nAlthough much still isn't in the game, it is fun when you succeed but can also be very stressful to play for some. I can only reccommend to veterans of Don't Starve as it's not very beginner friendly and you'll be looking at the wiki a whole lot.

So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...\n\nIf you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).\n\nMost of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.\n\nGood luck!","December 18, 2015","true","933.7"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","64","70","13","3"

You would think with the lack of caves and reign of giants it would be super boring, but boy was i wrong.\nSo let's get into the pro's and con's shall we?\n\nPro's:\n+ You can host servers almost instantly from in game which you can customize the world and other option on if you are the host. (No portforwarding required!)\n+ Different emotes to give your character different facial expressions and or do different actions.\n+ Exclusive stuff planned (and a little bit added) that will only be coming out for DST. (I guess this could be a con depending on how you look at it).\n+ Few bugs for still being in beta\n+ Free for all don't starve owners! (Unless you want to get the beta early.)\n+ Is Don't starve! Except multiplayer!\nCon's\n- Things may be unbalanced but this will most likely change once the full game is out.\n- Not a whole lot of content in it for the moment.\n\nSo the summary for this short review would be that it is worth a try unless you wan't the full experience at once and not spoil the small things already added or just experiencing an unfinished game.

The roaring fire glistens in your eyeballs, and a warmth encompasses you. Not only physically, but mentally. You've made it through the hard part, after all- right? Those silly spiders and frogs couldn't keep you down! Then you hear it, feintly echoing over the empty plains: barking. "What's that?" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.\n\nExcept you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.\n\n==================\nA new day... a new chance?\n\nYou push through the first 29 days in this hell. You've made quite the home for yourself! And look at that! Not even the fire-dogs could stop you now! "Another victory!" you yell, as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all. You revel in the moonlight, basking in the greatness that you're all responsible for. A bird cage? Farms? Bushes? Fridges?? You're advanced now! You're self-sufficient! Proud survivors! Everything is brilliant! Not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you're all feeling.\n\nBut then, as you sit to enjoy a moments peace, the serenity is disturbed. A tremor. A single shake in the ground, followed by a monstrous roar. The team pause, confused. Suddenly, before you know it, another is unleashed. You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.\n\nYou observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes. You close your eyes, drop your clothing, and assume the necessary position for what is to follow.\n\nYou don't quite survive that winter.\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","47.4"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","94","58","62","60","1"

Amazing fun can be had with friends on this, working together to survive winters, fight off hound attacks, explore further into the wilderness, etc.\n\nA major plus is also the mod support. The person hosting the server subscribes to a mod, sometimes the players have to as well, and there are very few issues (and the issues are usually related to a single mod instead of compatibility issues).\n\nMy only complaint with Don't Starve also applies to this - there still is a significant frame rate drop the further you develop your base or whatever. Multiple farms, bee boxes, flowers, bees, butterflies on the screen in a very small vicinity halves the frame rate until you "leave" the area. The way around this though is better management of your base (i.e. building separate areas spread out for each whatever instead of EVERYTHING in a small space).\n\nStill, incredible fun. If they didn't send out beta keys i'd instantly buy multiple copies and send them off to friends.","January 8, 2015","true","34.3"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","0"

Your main goal is to establish a base camp, gather items, and find a way to make your required resources (mainly food and heat) sustainable—all while avoiding the monsters that lurk in the dark. The added element of a sanity meter makes for an intriguing twist in gameplay that often requires the player to make less practical equipment (such as flower crowns) as well as the more obvious items (like farms).\n\nAs someone who's apparently unable to last more than six days without starving (or more likely being eaten by monsters in the dark), I had hoped that being able to play with a buddy might reduce my death count... in truth it's a lot harder to feed two people than it is to feed one! I found myself constantly out in the beefalo fields, gathering fertilizer only to run it back to my partner, eat a few carrots, and then run back out into the fields to gather even more poop while barely surviving.\n\nDon't Starve is a fascinatingly challenging game with rich and diverse settings, an intriguingly vague story, spectacularly crafted sound effects, and a bevy of triumphs and heartaches for the casual player and the expert alike. It's made even more engaging (and difficult) with the addition of multiplayer.\n\nDon't starve alone—starve together!","November 3, 2015","true","2.6"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","44","47","9","0"

Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.\n\n很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过\nOnce a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.\n\n新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员）\nIf you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.\n\n这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别.\nAt last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.\n\n我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”.\nI love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together.\n","March 19","true","171.6"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","56","67","6","7"

However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max\n-This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it? There isnt a reason to own DS if someone buys you DST because you can play offline on DST\n\nThis game is a def buy for your friends or yourself, If you like DS, More than worth the money.","April 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","33","33","0","0"

One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from!\n\nIn this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).\n\nIn don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots? ♥♥♥♥ WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS.\n\nThis game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game. I would also recommend getting some mods for the game as the mods deal with some issues I found with this version of the game.

Its highly addictive and can be quite fun to play if you have the time for it as there is no pause\n\nSo why whould you pay money for this game if you already have it ( single player )\n\nWell if you already have Dont Starve singleplayer then you will recive a free copy of Dont starve together when its releaced and out of beta.\n\nShould you buy this game before its releaced from beta?\n\nI recomend doing it as you get 2 copies of the game in your steam, 1 for you and another to give away which can be perfect for a birthday gift or any ocasion of that sort.\n\nthere is 1 major problem for long time players of the dont starve game..

The multiplayer experience is amazing - especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat. The Don't Starve world translates very nicely to co-operative play, but since I haven't tried PvP I can't comment on what that's like at all.\n\nOut of the three friends I've played with, two ended up finding Don't Starve too stressful. Something about how there's too much to keep track on at once, and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work. In the game's defence, this was during early beta, and they weren't Don't Starve players to begin with, but I think there's something to it. Don't Starve demands that you're quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree. It can get pretty hectic and there's not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts. It's something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options.\n\nMe, I feel like I've found the game for the very first time, all over again. The stuff I loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side. There's a bit lost in atmosphere because you're no longer so devastatingly ALONE, and things are less creepy... but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability. Today, for instance, I was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees. A well-planned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival.","April 22","true","50.8"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","34","37","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficalMcM/recommended/322330/","OfficalMcM","feasega Atreides","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficalMcM/","332 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs I reviewed the single-player version of "Don't Starve" I think this one should have a reivew of it's own because it's VERY different and yet similiar.\nSo, let's begin with the core of the game, the gameplay.\nWhilst most of the stuff remains unchanged or majorly unchanged the DST version feels a bit laggier than the SP (single-player) version, even when hosting your own dedicated server using the built in server hoster and not the external one.\nIt takes about 0.3 seconds for the server to get the command to harvest resources and after these 0.3 seconds it will initiate the picking up sequence. The time used to be smaller but since they introduced the caves to the built-in server hoster the servers have started to lag compared to the older version.\nEnough with that, let's skip to the combat:\nAs with the core gameplay of looting, the combat still remained unchanged though the feel of it is worse.\nRemember what I said about the delay when picking stuff up? It probably won't affect you that much when you ONLY do that, but in combat you will feel it MUCH more. Kiting is 200% harder in DST which I assume is because of the server lag, also the feel of the combat is very different compared to the normal game.\n*I should also point out that if you haven't played the SP version of the game you won't feel like anything is wrong until you do try it, as its the superior version of the game.\nThe game is also MUCH harder, the mobs can absorb much more damage and they inflict more damage aswell, making this game built for a team of players (I'd recommend for people with a group of 3 people and above to play it), the giants got their health doubled and damage aswell, making this game impossible without a group.\nThis version of the game has stuff which the base game doesn't have, for example, Beefalo riding.\nThe feature was added in order to add more fun to the DST version I suppose as it might be fun to ride them with friends, but while I have about 30 hours as of now I have yet to even use this feature.\nThe built in server hoster is excellent, it actually allows you have mods in your server without the hassle of extracting them to a folder, installing them using a mod loader and such, all you have to do is download them from the workshop and enable them in the "Mods" tab and you're good to go.\nThe built-in server hoster also allows you to customize your world like the SP version which is great because you can choose how much of what will appear in the world and also allows you to make the game work as you wish.\nAlso, this version has skins, which, as well as all the other games with skins, are only cosmetic. (I must admit I even bought some).\nDST also comes with the RoG (Reign of Giants) DLC which adds a LOT of features to the game (I can't even think about the game without it), and by purchasing DST you get a free copy, so that's great.\nAll in all, this version is good for a group of people to play (as I said, 3+ should do the trick) while playing it alone is impposible (hence the name together).\nThis game is good if you're already familiar with the game, although I recommend buying the SP version of it as its much better for learning the game if you've never touched it, it offers a smoother experience and it also has the SW (Shipwrecked) DLC which is fun but its still in early access so many features are still being added.\nThis game is great nonetheless, it is by far one of my most favourite games of all time, I recommend you to get the mega-pack as Its worth every dollar you spend on it.","February 25","true","64.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

For those who say "Oh it's not as hard to die if you have another person" think again. You and your friend/friends have to split resources like food or tools in order to survive together and not just die poorly. This game is so far vanilla Don't Starve but with more people, you can still use mods and the controls and lands are the same so far, but that's the way I like it. They did however add a new item called the "Tell-Tale Heart" which takes off 40 health (unless you have armor) and some hunger, but acts as a revive to your friends. Speaking of reviving that also works diffrently, the touchstones now can only be activated if you're a ghost (AKA dead) and while you're a ghost anyone around you will slowly go insane. Overall this game is great for early access and I hope that Reign of Giants soon comes to this for a free addon.","January 24, 2015","true","13.0"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

The whole concept fits so well with the game.  It takes Don't Starve, and makes it so you can play with up to 6 people (I'm told servers can be modded to have even more, and that dedicated servers can have 20, will edit this if/when I find out more).  There are a few differences from Don't Starve however.\n\nIn survival mode, when a player dies they turn into a ghost.  Beyond interacting with the environment in odd ways, there's not a whole lot you can do as a ghost.  However, if a living player can make a Telltale Heart using 1 spider gland and 3 cut grass, once given to the ghost they will be revived.  Be warned that crafting a Telltale Heart damages you and if on low health that could mean your death as well.\n\nIn endless mode, when a player dies they simply respawn from the Jury-Rigged portal where you initially spawn into the game.  You spawn with a decreased amount of health, but hey you're alive at least.\n\nAlso just in general having extra players changes the game entirely.  You now have to cooperate with others (or I suppose you could kind of compete against them or go your own ways as well) to stay alive.  In my personal opinion having other players really makes the game a lot more fun.  Definitely worth playing.","December 17, 2014","true","12.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

All classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another. All depends on your play-style what you want to go with.\n+ I tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game I have seen none of those problems.\n+ Plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred play-style.\n+ The game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character.\n+ Countless hours of fun with your friends\n\nCons:\n- There seems to be no way of tracking your friends. When you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location. I ran around for ages joining my friend's server trying to find him and his camp until I eventually died in the dark. Add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are.\n- The game could use a tutorial. If you only just started playing your only help is checking the key-bindings.\n- Public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders.

Coupled that with various necessities that you have to make and prepare for the upcoming dangers, the multiplayer version of this game starts to make us feels like a chore. There is simply no time to rest, you are either gathering food, or gathering things, which is what this game is supposed to be, in its earnest imo, and may appeal to the more hardcore fans.\n\nHowever, for those who would prefer a more relaxed game, I will suggest getting a mod instead, which is what my friends and I are currently running. With some of the mods available here, you are able to sort-of tweak the game at your own volition (we personally opted for the 50% hunger rate) or whatever you deem fit to be fun and not game-breaking.\n\nPlaying through the game with 3 real life friends, we realized that the most optimal way to survive is to split up and gather things on our own, which is rather ironic considering the title "Don't Starve together". Take it with a grain of salt though as the core components of the game are taken from a single-player game, therefore, the idea of setting up a base together (for many benefits of being together, which there are, in many survival games), does not really fit in this game where you can literally do things alone. Many things are tweaked to enhance multiplayers though (increased boss health and sleeping), which shows consideration being put in place just to make Don't Starve Together work. The game might not be the finest survival game for co-op, however, it certainly was made from one of the best single player survival games out there. 'Klei' however, proves to be providing us with ample updates and the fact that they have an open policy with modding only means that this game will not die just yet, if anything, it will get better.\n\nMy friends and I are currently in our 5th playthrough and just got over 50+ days, I must say that there was never a day that it was boring, so far.","June 12, 2015","true","33.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

As it's very clear, the main objective is not to starve. You not only choose to cook what you want from the endless list of recipes, but also try to survive from bunch of evil creatures. Make your own farm and collect your vegetables, hunt down some animals and gather your meat and also create your own bee hives to gather some honey. Mix them all in a crock pot and Voila! You got yourself a delicious meal for dinner.\n\nEven if the graphics don't look like so, the realistic ambient of the game is awesome. If you get closer to the fire pit, you will burn, you can build a fire going through all the forest and they turn into ashes and coal. If you get closer too much to the sea, the items you drop will fall and disappear. Standing right next to a tree will cover you a little bit from the rain. You know what? That's not all I can tell, you need to get the game and discover more.\n\nActually, survival in this realistic and somehow not realistic atmosphere is a lot fun, surviving together with your friends is even more fun. Everyone takes their roles and you can build your base faster than ever. If you die in this world, it's not the end of the world as long as anyone of your friends could stay alive, but you need to pay the price for it. It is harder to stay alive in this game if you have more friends. A dead body in the map cause all the remaining players to lose their minds. So, it's a lot more fun and also a lot more challenge. Don't just sit and play some boring games in your beautiful chair, try to don't starve!","September 4, 2015","true","132.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Honestly I wasn't that into the original Don't Starve; I found it fun but didn't really have the drive to survive as long as I could (which is the point of the game). With Don't Starve Together, having a friend or two join you makes it not only thrilling but gives the boost I needed into making this my favorite co-op game of all time. Deciding on day to day duties, collaborating on making items that are pertinent to survival, adapting to different climates, and just messing around when the struggles of staying alive becomes too harsh (seriously, causing chaos as a ghost is really fun). I highly recommend this game and my only advice to you is Don't Starve! (or freeze to death, get killed by shadowy figments of your imagination, blow up from a trap, mauled by walking trees, anger mother animals, and anything else Don't Starve Together decides to throw your way)","January 8, 2015","true","59.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

They are there if you absolutely need them though, or you ask. It's hard to play a game that's vanilla without a chest lock mod, but please, just ask.

Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger, collect resources from different biomes and creatures, build and craft required resources such as food, weapons and light! Make sure you always have a fire for nighttime!\n\nEach character has it's own pros and cons, except Wilson, who's a great playable character for newbies. Also each character is voiced by a different instrument, that's what I personally love the most about the game.\n\nDon't Starve Together includes Reign of Giants content. So there are 4 seasons and most people would think that winter is the hardest season to survive. Wait til' summer, darling. And most people don't like autumn in real life, because it's rainy, windy etc. In this game it's holy because it's going to be the only season that's going to allow you to rest.\n\nI highly recommend it to peeps who enjoy survival that is both realistic and challenging at times but also mixed with creepy elements.

Its $13 for 2 copies (at the moment)\n\nIm 7 hours in (2 days in real life) and its been a blast. Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless!

Is it even I sim, maybe not... Anyways the single-player game got so much hype for multi-player. BOOM! Here it is! Crazy crap can go on at the same time but you can get trolled if you don't have the server on friends only. Adding a person makes the game 10x better! The downside is that you need to worry about another person. Food can run out quickly. Unlike the single-player, food is everywhere! On multi-player, food is no where near you. Heck it can be all gone! Some tips: Find beffolos, grab poop, farm, traps every hole, FOOD! Traps are hard to make too, everyone will take anything. My friend and I cut down a whole green area in 10 mintues. While in single-player it will take some hours or DAYS to do that.

Multiplayer fino a 4 giocatori e mondi personalizzabili possono rendere più facile o più difficile la sopravvivenza.

This is hard to handle. If you ban them with full inventory of stuff the grieffed you lose so much time. There should be an option to enable "drop if banned". Hopefully they add RoG but i know that it will be hard because caves take loading screen and people can't join while world is generation so it would be cool if they would generate with the world and when you go in cave it would have same effect as you go in wormhole. It would teleport you to a location which would be isolated from anything elese and would look like cave. But I went off topic now.\nI like mod support.

This game is a expansion of Don't Starve, but they have a multiplayer feature. They've added new features which makes this game far more entertaining. In this game, you need to survive just like in other games. We've all been waiting for Klei Entertainment to add this feature and now it's finally here. This game is still in development so don't expect it to be perfect.\n\nYou enter a world, with trees, bushes, grass, animals, creatures, biomes with your friends. What do you do? Gather and collect various resources to survive on. Collect objects to craft the tools you need to explore the world, because the world you entered is full of danger. For bonus, you can craft hats and clothes to add to yout character.\n\nIt's simple to survive your first night, gather wood, grass, sticks, berries, carrots etc. Most important thing to survive your first night is fire or a torch. You need some kind of light to see in the dark or the darkness will kill you. If you've collected the right equipment, then you're good as gold. While your exploring, you encounter all sorts of animals and creatures. There are various creatures which you can or cannot see, one of them the Treeguard. They can be found in forests or in specific areas where trees grow. When you're chopping some trees down, you may not see the Treeguard because they camoflage. If you disturb them by chopping down nearby trees, then they will appear to attack and chase you away. If you cannot see, you can always hear their footsteps. One thing that may get you mad is the Gobbler, a berry eating turkey. They go around eating all the berry bushes, that only gets worse once you are starving. There are four seasons, summer, winter, spring and autumn. Keep warm and toasty for winter, and try not to freeze to death.\n\nOnce you've mastered on how to survive and fight the on-going creatures, you're a survivalist.\n\nI really love this game, it's more entertaining with the multiplayer feature. I recommend this game to all people who love to play survival games.\n\n9/10\n\nMORE REVIEWS ON OUR CURATOR PAGE","August 7, 2015","true","13.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","2"

With my friend playing Wickerbottom recipes are a breeze and we establish a small dwelling of berry bushes, crockpots and a small birdcage.

One of my friends had died to an elephant so to stop his eccentric hauntings my other friend went about gathering the necessary tools to revive our fallen friend.\n\nI however remain around camp tinkering with recipes and trying to raise my sanity to stable levels when i am attacked by shadows.

This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.\n\nOriginal Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well.\n\nOther than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it.\n\nKlei delivers, and I personally can't wait until this game has Adventure mode me and my friends can play, as well as ALL the characters from Reign of Giants.

Joining random servers is fun too but don't get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies. (Doesn't matter if you are online or not)\n\nThe developers are very passionate, shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you won't get bored easily :P\n\nI highly recommend this game, even without sales it's worth the money!","May 21","true","98.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

This, all this takes is a click of a button and you have a server where all you're friends can join and screw around (and as far as I can tell, it's lag-free).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PopsicleJuice/recommended/322330/","PopsicleJuice","Capri Sun Orange Juice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PopsicleJuice/","109 products in account","I love this game, it's incredibly fun to play with my friends when their online. But recently i've been community banned from arses who falsely reported my content. Here's a list of why this community is hell.\n\n#1: Furries\nThese "people" upload as much furry content to the workshop as they can. I would say at least 50% of characters uploaded the Steam Workshop are animals. These people are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ignorant in the game as well, if they join a server that has custom characters they will ALWAYS pick the animal that "ohmygodddd it looks so hooooot XDDDDD". Say anything that these neglected people don't like or agree on, and they'll introduce you to their fast typing skills of "stfu" or the  "you just cant appreciat the fury cummintee". Also to add on to topic, I posted this picture:\n\nhttp://www.quickmeme.com/meme/366zzf (The furries everywhere)\n\nIt was banned from the community, and with the magic of coding and source I figured that I was banned for "Offensive content, Spamming". Neither of which make sense whatsoever. Most of the Fur-♥♥♥♥ had the nerves to go on my profile and report a bunch of my other content.\n(I'm also community banned now, thanks Fur-♥♥♥♥)\n\n#2: Kids\nI'm fine with kids playing games, i'm going to clear that up right now. But when you have 7-9 year olds playing online, always asking you for "flint pls" or spamming "xD" in the chat, you're bound to get a headache. (Thanks the Klei for not adding voice chat I haven't gone insane from these kids.)\n\n#3: Griefers\nYou remember that game nobody gives a damn about anymore? The game called Minecraft? Well, in that game the multiplayer servers had "Griefers". These people would go around and purposly destroy other peoples creations, buildings, or anything that looks player made. But in this, these people will play as the character Willow (I think that's her name...) who starts off with a lighter, then they will go around and set everything on fire making most servers unplayable knowing that all the resources have been destroyed.\n\n#4: Stupid people in general:\nI'm not saying everyone is, but a good majority of people are. From ingame people asking all the time "how 2 I get wood?/", and the community putting useless guides and discussions in the community, it's damn annoying. To start off ingame people are most of the time are really annoying, they can make no sense whatsoever. For example, this one time I found a pig village. I ran about 5 minutes to get to it, I found a lot of berries enough to last me a few days. I then grab the berries and start walking away, the host of the server said to me, and trust me these were just about his exact words "wow you just took my berrys" and guess what? Banned from the server. Why? Because I took "his" berries. And the Steam community is much worse. If you go on the DST Community Hub right now, you'll see many Guides and Discussions made by little kids who don't know what the term "proper english" means. For example there's about two discussions side by side both titled "looking for someone to play with, pls". There's a guide named "characters and their uses". And looking at this post, there is ABSOLUTELY NO CAPITALIZATION. No grammar, no punctuation, nothing. Although this whole grammar thins isn't that bad, it just points out that alot of people on this game probably ask their mother to help them peel an orange.\n\nThere's my rant about why this community is horrible. If your one of the people who don't jerk off to animals, you're over 13, nice on servers, and has actually had an education. You should pat yourself on the back.\n(I'm guessing everyone's going to flag this for "offesive content and spam", right?)","January 24, 2015","false","48.5"," 543 of 983 people (55%) found this review helpful 257 people found this review funny","55","543","983","257","81"

The essentials are the same- sandbox building, collecting, adventuring, and hording everything you come across. But Don't Starve Together, in my opinion, stands out amongst all the other sandbox build-'em-ups out there. It's got charm. I had never experienced legitimate terror until I played this game. I had never experienced true artificial insanity until I played this game. Heck, I had never even built a magic tophat machine until I played this game! Sure, maybe it doesn't have all the content that the original had. But it's got co-op!

There are still some serious network issues and connectivity issues depending on who you are playing with and you will be less efficient with your time due to lag (longer time to gather/pick up items and sometimes being frozen in place while the clients try to reconnect and sometimes disconnection). If you get disconnected you get a free light source so you don't die at night but it might be a pain during winter.\n\nIt's always better to split up and gather resources in different areas of the map for a few days rather than competing for the same resources in one area. If you dislike this then I strongly suggest that you increase the spawns of resources for your game depending on how many friends you have playing with you.\n\nOne more thing is that if you join public games listed it won't start at day 1. You can end up in the middle of winter with nothing on your character so just be prepared for that and hope that the existing players can direct you to where the established base is (it won't always be nearby the portal).\n\nThe only thing missing is probably a Don't Starve Together 6-pack deal or something. I really have no interest in the single-player campaign so they don't need to inculde that.\n\nThe only thing needed now is for Steam to fix up their policy on inter-regional gifting so you can actually gift games to your friends on Steam instead of going over to GoG and getting a code there for them. Hint: some of us don't mind spending more to send a gift (this rant is unrelated to the product).\n\n\n\n","January 7, 2015","true","61.5"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

It is great fun and I often find Don't Starve to be a bit lonely after a few hours of wandering around in fear of what might be ahead; but with DST it makes everything a lot less lonely...but at some cost!\nPlaying with friends is a way around all the major downsides though.\n\nThe game quickly takes a firm grip on you! Losing sanity and finding yourself being attacked by shadows is terrifying! When night catches you off-guard and Charlie strikes I get such an overwhelming panic that it takes me 30 seconds once safe to calm myself down!\n\nYou are driven to explore and find things, discover the world, to work as a team to do menial tasks quicker (such as one shaving the beefalo, the other picking up the hair. or one chopping trees and the other digging the stumps). To work together to kill the things you need a hand with! It is so much more satisfying to share the tasks of the game.\n\nDown sides:\nFirstly, the community is noobie. You do have morons join, very often, who make things annoying for you! If I'm host I tend to be quick to kick/ban people such as this. But your sanity drops with a dead player in the lobby and if you are struggling it can make it just that bit too much!\n\nJoining a server or lobby which is later in the game (Day 30+) can be very difficult even for experienced players. The nearby area will have been picked clean by that time. Everyone is naturally unhelpful to the new person who just joined (because most aren't worth your time and effort to fully equip...or they leave with all your stuff anyway) so I tend to find myself becoming the annoying noob who dies from starvation before even arriving at camp. Despite actually being half decent at the game.\n\nBut this can be solved by using one of two possible mods to allow the map to regenerate. Or to plant a few berry bushes around the portal you spawn in from. But most don't bother with either.\n\nYou also get people who like to destroy EVERYTHING then run off with all your nightmare fuel and marble and gears!\n\nYou can spend hours and hours collecting and planting perfect lines of berry bushes, grass and saplings in your base, only for some pyromaniac to join and burn it all to ash! Annoying! But there is a save feature which you can set as daily and you can leave and reload but you lose all the people from your game...and all the stuff they were carrying (unless they rejoin)! As well as the in game days progress.\n\n\n\n\nPro's:\n\n-easy to get gripped\n-looks good (esp. when going insane)\n-fun to work as a team\n-less lonely after longer time playing\n-many awesome mods to help make things easier/quicker/avoid issues with multiplayer aspect\n\nCon's:\n\n-People join and ruin your game (burn, steal and leave, die and haunt you)\n-Not full DS game content available yet\n-chat is annoyingly slow to use and leaves you vulnerable\n-loading a pervious save of that lobby kicks people out\n-stuff people were carrying gets lost when they leave\n-noobs join and are a drain on your food/health/sanity\n\nThings to improve:\n\n-Make mods official tested solutions to common problems (allow chests to be locked to certain people, when people leave your lobby the items they carry spawn back close to a road or at base, spawn with axe, pick, shovel and food to survive a couple of days due to depleted environment, regenerate chessmen)\n-easy to use chat system\n-ranking system so decent players don't get mistaken for noobs (based on deaths, kills, resources collected, time played, days survived, health lost:animals killed, etc...)\n\nThings to help make you better players:\n\n-If you get hit when killing spiders/treeguards then let somebody else do it\n-If you have a lag or occasionally suffer a latency to a host then be careful when attacking, or leave it to someone else\n-Be helpful and ask what needs doing. Carry your weight.\n-DROP EVERYTHING WHEN YOU LEAVE (besides axe, shovel, pickaxe)\n-Learn to cook, or don't cook at all!\n-Prepare for night while it's day\n-Have FUN!!!\n\nSo overall I would rate this beta 7/10. And I do recommend it despite the flaws!\n\nHopefully you found my review helpful!","June 5, 2015","true","143.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

Don’t Starve Together is the multi-player version of  Don’t Starve game.\nDon't Starve together is a wilderness survival/roguelike game, and the premise is simple enough - you're dumped in the middle of a harsh, unforgiving world and you need to figure out how to stay alive.\nSo you start off by choosing your character from a selection of 5 very different personalities each with there own benefits and downsides.\nAfter the character selection you will be warped through a portal into the dark nightmare themed landscape surrounded by trees, plants and animals. From here you will collect resources to craft your first basic tools to allow access to even more exotic resources. Not only have you got to look for these initial tool parts but you also very quickly start to learn that your hunger levels drop quickly and you need to be on a constant look out for sources of food. Once you have built some basic tools and kept your hunger at bay you need to then look around for harder materials to build better weapons and armor. Within a few days of in game time you are sure to bump into some not so friendly animals that will quickly make a meal of you.\nAs a roguelike, death is permanent and this might leave some people feeling fed up after a couple of tries, because you lose everything upon death and must start from scratch again, and it can be quite difficult and time-consuming to build up a good base as is. However, for players that like a challenge, every death brings you a little more experience and gives you a better idea of what your goals should be, and how to be more efficient in the next gam.\n\nDon't Starve together is a unique take on the popular survival genre, and is a deceptively hard game that can leave some players discouraged with its difficulty and lack of instructions. But for those that enjoy the survival genre in general and like a good challenge, you'll find yourself losing hours in this game as you figure out how to survive its harsh, unforgiving world.","May 30, 2015","true","66.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It may be considered a part of the atmosphere - your character is stranded in a hostile environment, after all. But still, it became tiresome after some time.\nNow, you can invite a friend to share the game world. Delegate tasks, feed each other, support your companion in battle with nature and elements, or suddenly leave your friend to be devoured by hounds while you escape! Instant fun!\nIt's a bit tough that you can't pause the game, though. Don't starve is a time-consuming game, and when you play in company, someone is bound to be distracted from the game at some point. Would be nice to have a sort of "vote to pause" system, or a server admin pause switch.","January 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You have a bit until night to at least get a fire started so you don't get attacked by the shadows lurking in the dark, and if you're out there you are most likely going to die. Dying will cause your friends trouble, they start to lose their sanity from one of the others who are stranded there die and it haunts them. No fear though, you can easily craft yourself a TellTale Heart. You go up to your friend who has turned into a ghost and stick a new heart into them giving them life again, or you can go haunt a touch stone which will also bring you back to life. Be careful though (I think) it chips away at your max health (last time I played with my friend I had to revive them quite a bit and their max health was lowered).\nOn the other hand the game play is great the graphics are simple and great, plus you don't have to unlock the characters. You can get more fanmade characters off the DST website or the steam workshop which is also fun, but the one issue with it is when this happened (to me). When my friend who downloaded the same mods, but off the steam store (when I got it off the official DST website) would not work.

After being nearly 100 hours in this game i thought its best that i give it a review, so here it is! This is what a true survival game is all about - this is THE game that got me into this genre in the first place. I will say the game had a few minior annoying problems in the vanilla version; no way to find your team mates on the map if you go your own way finding resources, and a little hard to find food or other stuff you may  need in default settings of the map sometimes.\n\nBut these can be easily fixed with workshop mods so theres really nothing bad to say about this game. To me this was a very refreshing and new game from the useal BOOM BOOM KILL EM' ALL types of games that i useally play. No zombies, gore, medieval stuff, dragons, nudity, or guns - just pure adventure fighting to stay alive. in real life i wouldnt last 1 day in the world of Dont starve togther...id miss my internet and stuffed crust pizza too much :3","May 24","true","101.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","7","7","4","1"

And one thing i dont understand is, why people put the server public if they kick u away immediately when entered the server. So, that's why  i recommend that u play on dedicated servers if you're on public.\n\nSome of the Beginner tips :\n\nCharacter matters ( Most of the characters are balanced which means, they have a positive talent/skill but also have a negative one. For example Wolfgang can become strong which grants you increase attack and health when your stomach is full. However if u dont eat enough you will become weak. Check the game's Wiki to know more about characters. Also choose wisely your character when u enter a server/ or host. You can't change it anymore in-game. You just have to wait until all dies and reset the server ( Survival mode ).\n\nSeasons ( I Wouldn't join a game which is on early winter, you'll freeze in no time if there isn't any ppl around and also refuse to communicate, lol, Winter starts at day 20 ).\n\nResources ( Gather anything in sight, twigs, grass, flowers, carrot, flint.. then make a axe and chop down trees and don't forget to mine some gold to progress, which can be indentified by the veins in the rocks.\nAnd cut down those birch trees which are white and have some black stripes on it, then u can sometimes get birchnut to be cooked and eat.)\n\nSanity ( Picking flowers raises your sanity, eatin cooked food etc. etc. or make a flower ''hat'' with 12 flower pedals to maintain your sanity. )\n\nWell, that's some of the tips i got through with my 10 h gameplay and experience, guess you have to find out the rest yourself.\n\nOh, do i recommend this game ? Yes i absolutely recommend this game and HIGHLY recommend that you play with friend(s).

Trying to survive feels more meaningful when someone is depending on you, and you're depending on them. You split your resources and cooperate to stay alive, and lack of cooperation ends abruptly with death. You'll end up learning new strategies and things about the game from the other person and everything feels much less lonely. This version of the game is also a great learning tool for those who are new to Don't Starve as you can have another person directly guide you through it. I recommend playing Don't Starve Together wholeheartedly, it's an amazing experience. I can't wait till development is finished and my favourite lumberjack gets added!\n\nEdit: He's been added.

Halp.\nDay 235: Killed by werepigs. GG.\n\nFor an early access game, Don't Starve Together (DST) is well put together by the developers. The game mechanics are simple and easy for players to get into and the concept - being able to survive (together) for as long as possible within the randomly generated world - is simple. Unlike Dont Starve, utilising the resources given  is not the only challenge in DST. The main challenge, I believe, is cooperation between the players in order to survive. Without this cooperation, survival is less likely to be achieved. On the other hand, like Don't Starve (DS), the basics of the original game are integrated into DST. Game controls and the characters from DS are all integrated into DST aside from the Reign of Giants DLC. Hopefully Reign of Giants will be integrated into multiplayer soon.\n\nAs I continue to play DST, I will continue to edit my posts and note down the glitches that I have come across as well as suggestions that may improve the game in the future. Feel free to leave comments regarding this.\n\nGLITCHES:\n• Every time a dapper vest is dropped, the vest cannot be picked up. (FIXED)\n• Items that have been dropped near drying racks are sometimes extremely difficult for the player to pick up.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n• Being able to name chests would help a lot when sorting out resources.\n• Ability to build rooves for houses/structures.\n• Mini maps - could be a craftable item so that players have the choice whether to have it on their screen or not.\n• Waypoints.\n• Buildable teleporters.\n\nEDIT:\n- The recent changes on Willow, though it's a stopgap, is ridiculous. The trademark of Willow being the much-loved firestarter has been lost.","December 27, 2014","true","90.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have owned Don't Starve for a long time yet I had never really bothered to play it. For some reason when I saw Don't Starve Together I figured I would go ahead and give it a shot. I don't remember my first few attempts of not starving together; although I do remember wanting to cry the first time a batch of hounds came through camp. Let's not forget the one time I thought I had truly bonded with the Beefulo however, I was not warned about mating season. Just figured they had rashes or something.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, you will fail. A lot. More than what you ever thought was possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/recommended/322330/","jojocscs","Jelour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/","222 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDon't Starve Together contains the highly requested feature of multiplayer to Don't Starve. On June 3, 2015, Don't Starve Together was released for free to owners of Don't Starve on Steam. For those who are not, Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together can be bought individually or as a bundle. It was originally scheduled to come out in Summer 2014.\n\nStarting December 15, 2014, Don't Starve Together Beta was in Steam Early Access, which closed when the game was released just under 6 months later.\n\n--Features--\nDon't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: local, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. Game mode and PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference. A type of server called "Friends Only" allows a server to be created whereby the only people who can join have to be on your steam friends list. Many console commands have changed or been removed for DST.\n\n--Game modes--\nThere are three game modes, with additional modes that can be added by mods. Survival is the default mode, intended to be a cooperative, more difficult mode, in which dead players become ghosts that drain the sanity of living players by 3.3/min (up to 10/min total). When all players are dead in Survival, a timer starts, and if no players are revived in that time, the world is reset. Endless mode is intended to be a more relaxed mode that doesn't force players to cooperate. In Endless, the world never resets, and players may resurrect themselves at the spawn portal. Wilderness is intended to be more like other survival games. Players spawn in random locations across the map, there are no ghosts, and players who die are returned to character select wiping their map and respawning them in a new random location. No resurrection items exist, including touchstones (although their set pieces with pig heads will still be generated).\n\nRate: 10/10","June 23, 2015","true","92.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

What's not to love?\nThe excitement, the memories and more can now be shared with your friends, enemies or strangers.\n\nTo anyone thinking on getting it and playing with a friend, here are some tips to help you out.\n-Birchnut trees are a quick and safe way of getting food. Make sure to cut the trees with two branches at the top.\n-Be careful on what character you choose as they all have flaws but the best to start with is Wilson.\n-Always have some extra food on you. You'll never know when someone desperatly needs food.\n-Green Mushrooms are very good if you are low on sanity. Make sure too cook them though!\n-The best area to put a base in is near Beefalo  and a road for quick travel.\n-You do not have to fight spiders to get their silk/glands. Simply lure them into a trap and you get the resources trouble free!\n-Another say way of getting meat is by going near Moles, putting rocks/flint on the floor and waiting til they go out. Then attack them and you get a morsel without risk!\n-Treeguards can be be calmed by planting saplings of their trees near them.\n-Be careful when choosing Webber, as pigs will attack you on sight and you have lower sanity.\n\nThat's all i can think off the top of my head.

You could say the game was made easier, but it wasn't in some cases, if you are new to playing Don't Starve, losing your friend can be one of the most traumatic experiences in games. The selection of characters can make a game interesting, trying to find out the gimmicks of them and such. The sound of the game can really make you feel creeped out, the pig screams and tallbirds made the game very creepy, and adds to the atmosphere. Overall, it's just as spine chilling as the original, but much more fun due to having a friend/s alongside you.","December 21, 2014","true","8.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pan_azej/recommended/322330/","pan_azej","<default>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pan_azej/","68 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've got almost 1500 hours in this game while writing this review, so I have some experience and can share my thoughts about current Don't Starve Together.\n\nThe bad:\n- Rubberbanding. Having 40 ping in this game renders it unplayable. It's the biggest thing that makes it more of a chore than fun.\nYou can disable it with a console command, though.\nBecause of that you get godawful controls, mind you, but that's still better than game lying in your face about where you currently are.\n\n- Summer. There's 4 seasons in this game, and if you're playing on standard settings, the Summer comes last. There's not much to do during that season. If you host a server with caves, good for you - go spelunking. If you don't have caves, then, well... Prepare to get bored and annoyed.\n\n- Public servers. There's almost no reason to go and play with random people on the public servers. Why? Because anybody can join. And that means little Timmy who will die repeatedly and haunt everything out of spite will make this game infuriating for you. Or a sad, basement-dwelling troll Olaf from Russia who will come with his butt-buddy and burn your base down.\n\n\nThe good:\n- It's Don't Starve: Reign of Giants with improved mechanics and new content, made multiplayer. There's a lot of stuff to learn and to discover. This game can bring you hundreds of hours of enjoyment before it gets stale.\n\n- Workshop support. There's only so much developers can do. What if I wanted to play as some dumb cartoon character with wacky weapons? What if I wanted the game to tell me how much damage my weapon does?\nWorkshop is the answer. There's so many great mods out there that will alter or better your experience in some way.\n\nOverall, if you consider buying this game to play with your friend/loved one, go for it. It's a pretty good survival game. Still, it's a roguelike (but way more forgiving than the original), so watch out, because everything wants to kill you. And you'll need to kill to eat. Don't starve, and have fun.","April 5","true","613.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/recommended/322330/","VinceRowe","Vince","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n========================================\n\nVince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time!\n\n[YouTube Link]   [Curation Link]\n\n========================================\n\n\n9/10 - It's Multiplayer Don't Starve.\n\nBasically, if you liked the original Don't Starve then you'll like this a lot. It's essentially the same game bar a few minor changes that up the difficulty slightly but ultimately removes Perma-Death.\n\nNow, I'm going to talk about features specific to Don't Starve Together or else I'll be repeating myself, check out my Don't Starve for this instead.\n\nThe main thing it introduces into this game is multiplayer, now Perma-Death doesn't really bode well in multiplayer games because someone's going to end up sitting dead, waiting for his friends to die off one by one. Instead, this game removes the whole idea of Perma-Death from the Don't Starve series, yes, reviving your team-mate is bad for you but still, he doesn't die off 100% and you don't have to restart the game.\n\nWith all that being said, it doesn't make the game harder, as an individual you will starve faster, monsters are relatively harder to kill - meaning you'll need to gang up on them - damage and armour has been reduced and it's very difficult to kite mobs now because of the slight lag you'll most likely end up getting. Basically, kiting doesn't work.\n\nThe expansion itself doesn't really add in anything new, you get a few new items related to the now present lack of Perma-Death but that's really it. Don't expect this to be a whole new game - it's not. However, it does definitely feel like a whole new game. Unfortunately, a lot is missing from the game at the moment, there's no story mode, or the ability to make a new map. Caves aren't in the game yet, and have no determinate date of when they will actually appear, they did say they will include them in the game. The same applies to Reign of Giants, very few features of Reign of Giants is included and there is no determinate date for when the whole expansion will be included in Don't Starve Together (I also have no idea how they are going to deal with Reign of Giants - being an expansion of an entirely different game). They also say that they will introduce Modding Support - when this finally becomes the case I HIGHLY recommend that you check out a mod called "Up and Away" by a Collab of modders (It's basically like Aether was to Minecraft), check it out for the original game as well.\n\nPvP is just terrible... It's like fighting the pigs in the ordinary game if you catch my drift, it's basically whoever has the best gear wins - "Minecraft PvP". Unless you're a mundane gorm then I'd just avoid the PvP if I were you, not to mention that you can just run for ever while Benny Hill plays in the background.\n\nBeing very involved in the Beta of the Vanilla game I can say they Devs seem to be much more distant from the community for Don't Starve Together, perhaps because they aren't really making a new game now, they are just updating it, but whatever, I thought it was worth mentioning none-the-less.\n\nThat's pretty much all I can really say about Don't Starve Together, like I said, it's based on the Vanilla version so here I have only spoken about things specific to the Standalone Multiplayer mod. Nothing much has changed really except you can play with others. If you want an in-depth review on the actual Gameplay/Sound/Story/Graphics and all that crap then check out my actual Don't Starve Vanilla review which also contains a section on the Reign of Giants mod.\n\n- Vince\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","December 18, 2014","true","44.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Can you run like hell? Then you might be the right person to survive this madness, cause heroes will find certain death...\n\nThis is a hardcore survival exploration game. It has a charming pencil drawn horror comic look, but you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. You will have to care about hunger, health and sanity.  There's a lot of exploration to do, collecting stuff and crafting items and structures. But beware, almost every creature you meet is a threat and every map section brings new surprises and new dangers. Many strange creatures live in these lands, like the Beefalos or the Moose Goose, the Tallbird and of course the Werepigs. Strange plants like the Living Trees or the Swamp Tentacles are just as dangerous as any creature you could meet. Forget all those creatures and plants, cause the real threat are the seasons. You freeze to death in winter and die of heat in summer. The raining seasons spring and autumn will make you go crazy or you might just be hit by a thunderbolt. You think that's where the developpers stopped? Wrong! They added events to keep you busy, like frog-rain, hound pack attacs, raging giants or meteor showers. You think frog-rain can't be that bad? Well, you clearly haven' met a don't-starve-frog yet. Nasty little bast?!#s. By the way, I hope you love meatballs more than anything, cause you're going to eat a lot of them.\n\nAlthough still in beta, DST seems to be even better than don't starve single player. What a cute little game, two thumbs up.","October 3, 2015","true","147.0"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","16","27","3","2"

One of the best survival games I have ever played. If you do buy consider the Mega Pack version because of more content. 9/10 for the games great gameplay and unique graphics and coloring, -1 point for the fact that the food spoils WAY to quickly and items that fall behnd other items you might miss unless you move your camera. Another problem is if you plant berry bushes next to each other they spaz out sometimes because the game is deciding which plant to show in front and the other in back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/invadersean300/recommended/322330/","invadersean300","Royial20 [TURBO]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/invadersean300/","579 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQsDus53AE\n\nDon’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety. Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.\n\nBut, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.\n\nSo as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.\n\nMy only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap.\n\nI personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!\n\nTL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together!\n\n-Double Thumbs Up from Royial","June 25, 2015","true","42.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","3"

Wow.\nIt's awesomely fun.\n\nCharacters are in-depth, experiences are all different... Man.\n\nTo truly explain why I enjoy this game, here's a little story:\n\nSo my friend, I'll just say X, had been playing for, eh, an hour or two. We never got passed day 4 since we suck.\nSo X dies on day 1. For fun, I decided to continue playing. After 4 rough days of survival, things were going alright...\nUntil I forgot to build a fire fast enough.\n\nSuddenly, I get smacked three times. Due to my characters low HP, one more smack would destroy me. I quickly equipped a torch. Due to my damage taken at night, I had now lost all sanity.\n\nThings got spooky. Like really spooky.\n\nI somehow survived for three more days with one HP and low sanity... But the last day was when I died on purpose out of pure fear.\n\nAs night descended, I quickly built a fire and waited there. Eyes were blinking all over the shadows. I had done this twice, so I didn't think it could get worse. But boy was I was wrong.\n\nSuddenly, creepy music began playing, like something from an old music box. This shadowy hand then extended itself from the shadows, reached over to my campfire, and suddenly my fire went out. Daytime then arrived.\n\nLiterally super scared, I found a shadow monster and let it kill me to end the terror.\n\nI'm now super determined to never go insane just because of that. Was... spooky for sure.","December 5, 2015","true","26.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","6","8","4","2"

Ive played Don't Starve and since day one Ive enjoyed the unique survival approach to the genre, now that it has multiplayer its even more fun because we all know its better to die together then alone. My thanks go to the developers for allowing every owner of Don't starve free access to Don't Starve together once it left closed Beta. From what Ive seen the developers care for their fan base and also care for the game they've created, with regular updates theres always something new for even the most experienced of players to be challenged with. Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a hardcore survival type game and who enjoys it with others even better.","July 11, 2015","true","31.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even I hosted!\n-I haven't stopped having fun yet\n-99% of people are really friendly\n-Pvp is toggleable\n-Your world can still be customized in every way just like regular :D\n-Super Easy to join friends\nCONS (rated from 1-10 on a scale of how critical it is, 1 barely an issue/10 gamebreaking):\n-Public servers can have griefers, only one server had this for me, some random a-hole came in and teleported everyone randomly but was quickly banned (3)\n-No tooltip to tell you that the means to revive your friends costs 40 hp... I've killed myself twice before realising this (4)\n-Haunting doesn't tell you what it does, I accidentally made a werepig thinking I could control a pig (2)\n-Dead allies drain sanity REDICULOUSLY fast and revival barely recovers any at all, 2-3 players suffer the most due to inability to reliably obtain spider glands (4)\n\nAll in all, I love the challenge, even the heavy insanity drain which is why I give it only a 4 rating out of 10...

Draft of this game is so amazing, graphics, all crafting mechanisms, seasons and items - they are not too OP but worth it. Every world is randomly generated, making each save original (I really like exploring uncharted coasts). This game is every time trying to beat you. It is sometimes funny, but sometimes, it makes me VERY angry. Also a community is super. Almost every 3 days someone creates extraordinary mod - character, item, dish, animation, etc.\nFor some people, it may be really hard, but that is also the reason, why is it in MULTIPLAYER (if you have got minimally one friend to play with, you will spend much time by playing DST).\nI actually find one think, which tricks me off: When you pause the game, playing just one (without any friend), it will NOT be paused, it will be still resumed instead. I also hope, Shipwrecked will be on DST soon (in DS, you can buy R.o.G and SW DLC and switch between them), but in DST is permanently R.o.G. on.\nFINAL RESULT sounds: Thanks god (eventually to Klei) for this game.\n...Keep on mind, it is still a BETA.\nPS: For newbies is every tip important, so I will maybe create a page, where will be everyone able to write anything about this freaking awesome game.","February 24","true","125.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What might seem easy as first can quickly begin to seem like an enormous task as the burdens of living in the harsh land snowball onto your character and you can't keep up.\n\nThe perma-death feature of the game can make death a traumatizing experience as the character you've so lovingly built up and kept alive for so long has now found it's way to a lonely grave, at the same time it leaves your mind whirring as the cog's and gizmos in your head try to learn from your last play through so that you can survive longer in your next.\n\nThe re-playability is huge, there's always something to learn or do better the next time through. On top of that if you decide you'd prefer things a bit different from time to time there's always a huge selection of mods available for the game that offer a wide selection of features. Things as simple as adding in a new playable character based on the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 or changing the rules of how the game work can really spice up the gameplay.\n\nSo, really give this game a go if you're into moody, strategic, action packed games that leave you twitching at every movement on the screen.

You'd better find your best friend and burn down his stuff before he looks better then you." Thus Don't Starve together was born!\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Don't starve was based on surviving long enough to escape the world you had been put into, now the enemy has a more familiar face... You can work with your friends to try to survive, or you can burn down their base.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396194576\n\nGame Play: There are three game modes each with different type of play: Survival, Endless and Wilderness. Each has a different style of play, Survival is the default game play mode and is meant to be more difficult once everyone dies the world resets. In Endless you can play more relaxed and respawn at the portal if you die (unthinkable!), in Wilderness you spawn in random locations in the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506515345\n\nAchievements: None that are steam linked, but you do get bragging rights if you're good at Don't Starve, you can show your friends that if you were sent into a survival situation you would survive by making an axe out of grass and sticks.\n\nPrice: Don't Starve Together's standard price is $19.99, if you already like Don't Starve, this game is a no brainier, I can't speak high enough of how awesome the Don't Starve series is. If you can't afford it wait for the game to get out of Early Access mode and get it on sale.\n\nConclusion: What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said?

It's Miss Rowdy ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspegasus/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe gameplay may seem simple, but it's in that simplicity that it holds its charm. What might seem easy as first can quickly begin to seem like an enormous task as the burdens of living in the harsh land snowball onto your character and you can't keep up.\n\nThe perma-death feature of the game can make death a traumatizing experience as the character you've so lovingly built up and kept alive for so long has now found it's way to a lonely grave, at the same time it leaves your mind whirring as the cog's and gizmos in your head try to learn from your last play through so that you can survive longer in your next.\n\nThe re-playability is huge, there's always something to learn or do better the next time through. On top of that if you decide you'd prefer things a bit different from time to time there's always a huge selection of mods available for the game that offer a wide selection of features. Things as simple as adding in a new playable character based on the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 or changing the rules of how the game work can really spice up the gameplay.\n\nSo, really give this game a go if you're into moody, strategic, action packed games that leave you twitching at every movement on the screen. It's my top pick of the year!","January 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's really great fun. The style, the game play ideas, the humor, it's all there.\n\nWhy won't i reccommend it though? Because the community at the moment is bad. Most servers are filled with begging newbies, who can't find food (which isn't all that hard to begin with!). Sooner or later they'll just steal whatever is in your crates and fridge. You have NO WAY to prevent them from taking it besides pretty much carrying everything with you. Which is pretty annoying, as your carrying potential is pretty limited.\n\nWhen winter comes, most of those players die from freezing. Then they'll bug you to revive them, so they can eat up the rest of your savings... Just abyssmal.\n\nIf you only play on a private server with friends, go for it! It's still a great game after all! If you plan to play online with random people, be prepared to be annoyed a lot by incooperative and incompetent players ruining your game.","June 3, 2015","false","71.2"," 149 of 287 people (52%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","52","149","287","20","20"

Most noticeable aspects of this game is it's artstyle which is unique. You need to keep yourself alive by being fed, sane and warm in a crazy world. Also have a light in the dark. This essentially the same game, only with other people and that completely removed a barrier for me and other people who couldn't get in to this game as much as they wanted because it was singleplayer.

I recomend this game to people who have friends to play with and people that have no friends(sry about that) because there are tons of servers you can join at anytime.

I was lucky enough to get a beta key and I played before you could buy it. And I got to say, unless you have friends.... DON'T PLAY THIS VERSION. It seems everything is a little harder like enemies for instance. Then again playing with friends doesn't really help. It probably makes it harder until you get the hang of it. If this so far seems like a negative, it isn't. I actually love this game. The fact that Don't Starve could only add multiplayer to make it better is amazing.

It has a very Tim Burton-esque vibe for those who are a fan of things that are a mix of creepy, cute, and full of depth. My boyfriend, who is a much more frequent gamer than me (I haven't really played many video games in the past 10 years), bought this game for me. It's easy enough that I could get into it, but difficult enough that its about equally challenging for the both of us. I would definitely reccomend this game for friends who want to play a game together, but have different experience levels when it comes to gaming, and definitely to couples who want to play a casual game together. Don't be surprised, however, when this game has you stressing out all over the place, trying to get through the harsh winters and nights. There will always be new things that can kill you. It's still a lot of fun though, as long as you're up for a challenge. Happy camping!","December 22, 2015","true","67.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!\n\nDon't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, "The hounds are baying!" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)\n\nPros~\nCharacter Variety(Workshop Aswell)\nArt style\nVoices are instruments\nNever ending\nLaughs and scares for all X3\nA fun coop game\n\nCons~\nCan be very difficult at times\nHackers do exist\nFurries on Workshop\nEverything will kill\n\nTo sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :D\nAnd the game gets better and better after each update :)\n\nBuy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play.

If you don't work together, chances are you won't survive once autumn ends. If you're not ready for each season, you won't last the full cycle. Each season has a different problem of their own, whether it'd be frostbites, wetness, or extreme heat. The availability of mobs also changes with each season, giving some variety of items and mobs to work with.

This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to "observe" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to "pull their weight," because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.\n\nIf all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).\n\nEven though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve.","January 27, 2015","true","148.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Meing there's either gonna be friendly co-op, or just being a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone. The goal here is to surivive as many days as possible with other players/friends. To me, co-op is the most strongest element in this game. Sure, you can surivive by yourself, but where's the fun in that? That, and you'll get kicked.... At random.\n\nBut, I've litterally played this game ALL DAY. And after that, my eyes kinda hurt.

Even in Early Access, you can tell that the transition from SP to MP is nearly flawless. The game plays just as well, and even though things like caves and various events aren't included yet, it's just as fun.\n\nThe only downside to the game is the people who seem to take a liking to ruining your world. I.E., a person playing as Willow has to be watched carefully, lest he/she burn your berry bushes, forests and various other items down before you even notice it.\n\nThat however, brings me to my favorite part; the mods. DST has one of the most closely-knitted mod community of any game I currently own, including a mod that makes it difficult for Willow players to light things on fire. Other mods include adding additional items, characters, etc. My current favorite is "Renewable World", where every item in the game respawns at some point, so you never exhaust a map of it's resources. The best part is that you can set the speed at which they respawn, so you can tailor it to your own preferences. They're all genuinely exciting, and can enhance your DST experience an endless amount of times over.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who's interested in a quirky, detailed survival experience.

It takes survival and resource gathering to a new level, and there are a variety of ways one can go about playing this game. Add that with the large number of high quality mods in the Steam Workshop, there are many tweaks and changes one can do to make every newly generated world unique.\n\nWith Cave Content and skin customization on the horizon, this game will definitely excel to new heights and become an even better game than it is now.","June 8, 2015","true","575.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Don't Starve or even people that just like good survival games. If I were to have any complaints, it would only be that the living conditions during the Summer Season ingame is a tad too harsh (EX: losing 1 HP per second when not in shade...). Overall, A very enjoyable game and good for anyone looking for fun times.","February 12","true","61.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
