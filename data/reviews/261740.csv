From the very first moments you run this game you can see it's high production value. In this horizontal shoot-em up, you control a spacecraft equipped with several offensive and defencive upgradeable systems,  fighting your way through various well designed levels. The controls are responsive and sharp with no momentum (thank god!), the graphics are detailed and colourful and the sound effects are also very good. The difficulty can be adjusted in the beginning of the game to suit the skill of each player. Highly recommended shmup and a must-have, especially for the fans of the genre.","January 16, 2014","true","10.8"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","55","68","0","6"

The ability to unleash a turret adds depth and uniqueness that allows the game to not just be another blah game.

I've read some bad review comment about this game which is COMPLICATED?? CONFUSING?? , i dont see anything so confusing or complicated. If you want simple NO BRAIN or PLAIN Shump with only shoot to kill using 1-2 button with just pick up upgrades in space, then this game is not for you. Just play a simple game like Raiden etc. For me that kind of simple game is just waste of money which you can complete in short time.\n\nPROS\n- Multiple upgrade systems\n- Ability to shoot using difference way and weapon combination\n- Some mission require some weapon skill (just like Megaman X)\n- Close to reality (the ammo or energy is not infinity)\n- Not a plain boring simple Shmup with simple pick up upgrades or just shoot to kill.\n- Great graphic, music and gameplay\n\nCONS\n- no SPEED/BOOST upgrade found yet since the ship move quite slow\n(basically the upgrades is not better than Jets n Guns)\n- quite slow Shmup\n- Not easy to earn money for upgrades\n\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS.","August 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Not to mention the third and fourth levels just kind of ended abruptly, I thought I failed the missions.\n\nIf you love high adrenaline shoot em ups and have a 360, check out Strania instead. Or Einhander on the PS1. Or even either of the Geometry Wars. Not so much this. It's not bad but it's not good either.","January 23, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

A game that kills me ten times in a row on easiest mode before even getting halfway through the game.\n\nThere might be people having fun with this, but I'm disappointed.

To be fair, it's got a few interesting aspects that are recognizably mutated from mechanics in other genre entries.\n\nBut the ship is so infuriatingly slow at the start that I'm really not inclined to keep playing. Sure, it's just the beginning, and I'm not expecting a fully upgraded Atomic Emu up front. Something on the level of the free starter ship from JnG, maybe, but I suspect this thing might actually handle worse than JnG's space race pirate ship, possibly even the unupgraded cargo ship. I feel like a Predator pilot yelling "CLIMB YOU PIG" moments before the engine cuts out and the drone just falls out of the sky.\n\nIt's not a great feeling.","June 29, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diglyd/recommended/261740/","diglyd","DiglyD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diglyd/","672 products in account","This is one of the best games I have played in recent years and is now one of my favorite games in my Steam library and I have over 500 games. This is a true side scrolling shoot em up similar to R-Type that harkens to the glorious golden age of NES and SNES shooters. The game has a  great soundtrack and really good graphics. This game punishes you and requires the same old school mechanics that made some of the classic games so memorable. I prefer this game to Sine Mora and Syder Arcade which I just found boring. This game requires almost perfect positioning as well as patient timing and really works your brain. You have to pay attention and know what you are going to do to survive a level. Getting the golden eggs while you are getting shot from every direction and the level is scrolling gives you seconds to figure out the patten and move accordingly. The leve ldesign is great imho. I was acutally very suprised at the low scores at Metacritic and the 1 lame user review. It just shows how lazy game reviewers have become where if a game requires you to memorize or learn something via trial and error or practice like in the goold old days its not good in their eyes. This is an amazing game. The first time I fired it up I played for 2+ hours straight on "hard" and it was amazing. I just kept saying "this game!!" everytine I died but kept coming back for more. I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. Really solid side scrolling arcade game that requires you to  learn the mechanics, positioning, and item placement. Replaying the levels is not bad as there are many of them that you have access to via branching paths and each is challenging enough not to get boring even during repetitive playthroughs. Each level also ends relatively quickly as you solve or move past the obstacle never forcing you to reply too much of it from the beginning. You do only get one life and in some areas it starts you from the beginning while others from the middle of the level but it does not take long to get to where you were. You can go back to the galaxy map and store at any time if you can't make progress and try other combinations of weapons and upgrades. I have had no problems going through the first 8 stages with just using the 2 basic guns and an armor upgrade and this is on hard. If you loved old school side scrolling shooters like R-Type and wished that modern devs made a game as equally challening and fun as what we used to have that does not hold your hand this is the game for you. This game is affordable and beautiful to play through. This is one of the best purhcases that I made in 2014 and a welcome addition to my library. I have almost every Shmup and arcade game available on Steam and this is now one of my most favorites. Don't listen to the lazy reviews, give this game a shot. Even if you play it for a few hours its exciting, and really fun as it really makes you pay attention and requires you to improve your skills to succeed.","January 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I could pick the absolute hardest game I have ever played and it would still be less hard and less frustrating than this game. It does not take long before each level has a staggering amount of undodgeable fire coming from every conceivable direction. It really is as cheap as it gets. I do not like having to replay a stage 15+ times to beat something. This is not fun-hard, it is just pure frustration at its worst. This games difficulty reminds me exactly of Silver Surfer on NES: undodgeable fire making the game nearly impossible. I actually think Silver Surfer might be easier than this game. Oh and you can also run out of ammo. A ♥♥♥♥ing space shooter where you can run out of ammo. What were these idiots thinking? And that your ship has a life bar is a joke. What good does having a life bar do me when I am going to get slammed up the ♥♥♥ in every direction anyway?\n\nOh and never, ever alt+tab out of it. Yes it is that type of game with lazy programming that crashes when you alt+tab. Not right away, but if I let it sit alt+tabbed for like five minutes, the game will just close without even giving me a error. It just closes.\n\nWhat a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.
