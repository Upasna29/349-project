The latest fix (May, 16th, 2016) somewhat helped with that issue and made the thing understandable. However, it is still far away from a good translation or an enjoyable reading experience as there is still a "automated translation" kind of feeling to the whole thing and lots of lines are just vaguely making sense, more often than not through context alone.\n\nStill, I decided to finally check it out after not being able to progress deeper than the first couple of screens with the original translation. And to be frank, what is in here really isn't worth anyones time or money. The novel starts off with a weird dream sequence, establishes a somewhat dystopian future of people making better versions of themselves and others, has a whole bunch of pretentious, philosophical bits thrown in that feel entirely out of place and (depending on wether you go that route) entirely changes focus and tone in one particular sequence, just to end abruptly no matter what choices you make.\n\nI liked how the author established the "Cyber City", but ultimately he or she is not doing anything with it. There is no real story, just a bunch of scenes loosely connected to one another and it all feels rather pointless - there is some build-up, but never a satisfying conclusion. Maybe the subtleties that make this a good story are still lost in translation - but I highly doubt it. And maybe I am missing something here, but getting to an ending never took me longer than 20 minutes - that is not exactly a "novel" as far as I am concerned, more like a short story if anything.\n\nOne thing stands out though, this "game" is quite atmospheric - the sounds and colors are pretty cool and the music is downright amazing. I just wished it would go anywhere, have some meaning and not be random scenes/monologues/dialogues cobbled together.\n\nStill not recommending this, for I am now believing that even if the translation was flawless the actual "story" is a complete mess. Shame about the excellent music getting wasted like this.","May 6","false","1.5"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","37","48","0","9"

You'll follow him from his dream before he wakes up all the way until something happens to him based on the choices you make. I found the story somewhat hard to understand, partially due to the build I played having some absolutely horrendous English. Some fixes have been made to it since then but there is still a lot of broken English littered throughout.\n\nThe graphics can sometimes be hard on the eyes while reading, especially if they're trying to move at the same time. The sounds are nothing to write home about, and I often found myself wondering if I had heard them somewhere before.\n\nEven if the English gets completely fixed, I have a hard time recommending this game. The story is all over the place, and the current state of the English doesn't help, nor do the sometimes harsh on your eyes graphics.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key by the publisher for review purposes.","May 4","false","5.4"," 38 of 63 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","38","63","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/recommended/454690/","KafroHudrep","Kafro Hudrep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/","352 products in account","This visual novel has a ton of plot threads across multiple branches, and none of them, including the hook that begins the game, get resolved. It includes themes such as the creation of holographic AI copies of humans called "Molds", endless urbanization to the point where new locations appear without anyone noticing or caring, apathy to the point of confusing strangers for acquaintances, and a sun that, after an unexplained "incident", changes color by rotating in sections throughout the sky instead of setting; none of these ideas are ever fully expounded upon. The few characters that exist never have their arcs finished — sometimes their endings leave more questions than answers. Indeed, several of the story paths conclude on an "End of Side A" screen; if there is a Side B forthcoming, I've seen no evidence of that.\n\nCoupled with photographs intentionally dithered to look like they're being displayed on an old computer monitor, as well as the English script that only barely rises above the cusp of Google Translated legibility, you'd think Cyber City 2157 could only be a project by people who spilled their stream of consciousness into an esoteric project to intentionally fleece and / or baffle anyone who stumbled across it. A quintessential Bad Game masquerading as Art.\n\nYet, even if that is actually the case, Cyber City 2157 somehow all comes together to create an experience that is strangely pleasing to read — and I use the word 'read' very loosely, as a lot of my amusement came from deciphering what the narrative was trying to communicate in words either too many or too few. The eccentric cast members, while most show up only for one scene, are genuinely compelling, and the eclectic soundtrack fits the journey perfectly. I wouldn't recommend Cyber City 2157 at the normal price, but if you can get it for cheap or free it is a truly unique excursion that I suspect a few of you may end up defining as your ~aesthetic~.\n\nIn conclusion, haha, what, okay, cool","June 3","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I sat and spoke with the statue of Lady Alanis for the entire duration and then it just ended with us looking at the moon with a very vague story. I thought I would be able to proceed after our discussion but no, this was not the case. The verbiage is clearly written by a foreigner as  a lot the writing required decyphering.","May 8","true","1.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Стилизировать под ретро - это надо еще уметь и разработчики прекрасно с этим справились, на мой взгляд. В общем рекомендовано любителям жанра.","May 6","true","7.6"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"
