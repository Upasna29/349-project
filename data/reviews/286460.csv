I really got into the character whilst playing this game.\n+ Voice acting is not dull, and actually pretty good.\n+ Character can die, making it different from most point and click games. Remember to save your progress. I think this is a positive personally.\n+ You can tell a lot of work has gone into this game, and it shows in the quality.\n\nNegatives:\n- As point and click as it gets. If you don't like point and click games, you should probably step away from this. If you're not sure if you like them or not, then I still think this is a worthwhile and fun purchase.\n- Although the tabs state that this is a 'horror', it isn't really. More of a mystery, without the typical detective characters.","September 27, 2014","true","20.2"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

A feature that should be mandatory for any point and click adventure game. This feature alone eliminates a lot of frustration\n\n+ Scroll through your inventory using your middle mouse wheel makes it very easy to see which inventory items work with different hotspot areas within each location.\n\n+ The traditional point and click puzzles are really well done if not a bit on the easy side but fit nicely with the overall theme of the game.\n\n+ Revisiting old locations from the first Black Mirror 1 is really cool, even better is that you see these locations from a different camera angle which offers a fresh new perspective on something familiar.\n\n+Soundtrack\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nYou really need to play Black Mirror 1 to appreciate this game. Although it is by no means a requirement to play this game, it becomes harder to care about the story or characters if you never played the first. The game starts off fairly slow and takes a long while to pick up and get going but it gets more and more interesting the more you play.\n\n\nCertain static puzzles (slider puzzles, combination lock puzzles etc)  could have used better clues to solve them. This only become a problem near the end of the game.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nI hated the main character. I hated his accent, I hated the way he looks, I hated the way he spoke to other characters, I hated everything about him. Luckily I could skip his dialogue which helped me immensely.\n\nSadly I experienced hard freezes in the early parts of the game. Nothing but a hard reset from my computer would fix the problem. It got so bad that I was thinking of quitting the game all together. Luckily it was only happening in the beginning of the game and I was able to get through it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI gave the first Black Mirror a negative review, this game however fixes a lot of the problems I had with the first game and is a MUCH better experience overall. This turned out to be a very good game the more I played it and was pleasantly surprised how engrossing the story became the further I went along given the slow start. I don't think I would have appreciated the game had I not played the first but sometimes you have to tolerate the bad before you get to the good.\n","October 12, 2015","true","12.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I'm glad I finally gave it a chance when it came to Steam though, as it felt like a VAST improvement.\n\nA MUCH more likable protagonist, a better paced story which still manages to be mostly ambiguous as to whether there's anything supernatural going on or not, more logical puzzles...there's a lot here which is much improved over the first game. It's a good length too but the variety of locations with a minimum of backtracking helps keep it interesting.\n\nThe voice acting is still mostly terrible, but that's pretty much to be expected of adventure games of it's time. It also has possibly one of the most ridiculously abrupt cliffhanger endings I've seen (from what I gather it runs directly into the third and final game) but overall...yeah. I liked it.\n\nFour cases of hereditary brain-madness out of five.","April 19, 2014","true","12.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

The music, ambientation and graphics are very great. The voice acting is pretty good too. There are many characters who are complete and well created, and the game really feels, in many ways, quite realistic.\n\nDarren's sarcasm is quite amusing and refreshing, although occasionally it gets a little annoying!\n\nThe best part about the game is that it is very long (many hours of gameplay), and the story really catches your attention, making you want to progress more and more. There are many things you need to do, ranging from the mundane to the mysterious. Many of the puzzles are inventory based, but there are also other kinds of very interesting puzzles.\n\nDespite being a "horror" game, it is really not horror. It has an eerie atmosphere, like in the first Black Mirror.\n\nThe only critique I have is that, like most of these games, the ending was a little unsatisfying. But then, it immediately left me wanting to play Black Mirror III, which was probably the point.\n\nVerdict: I highly recommend this game! But go ahead and buy Black Mirror III as well, because when you finish 2, you'll want to play it!\n\n\nAnálise em Português:\n\nBlack Mirror II é realmente um dos melhores jogos de aventura que eu joguei. A música, ambientação e os gráficos são excelentes. A dublagem é muito boa também. Há muitos personagens bem feitos e o jogo realmente parece, em muitos aspectos, bastante realista.\n\nO sarcasmo de Darren é bastante divertido e eficaz, embora algumas vezes ele seja um pouco irritante!\n\nA melhor parte sobre o game é que ele é bem longo (muitas horas de gameplay), e a história realmente prende sua atenção, fazendo você querer progredir mais e mais. Há muitas coisas que você precisa fazer, que vão desde coisas mundanas até tarefas sobrenaturais. Muitos dos puzzles são baseados no inventário, mas também existem outros tipos de quebra-cabeças bem interessantes.\n\nApesar de ser um jogo "de terror", ele realmente não é. Ele possui uma atmosfera sinistra e misteriosa, assim como no primeiro Black Mirror.\n\nA única crítica que tenho é que, como a maioria desses jogos, o final é um pouco insatisfatório. No entanto, ele imediatamente me deixou querendo jogar Black Mirror III, o que provavelmente é o objetivo desse final.\n\nVeredito: Eu recomendo muito esse game! Eu aconselho comprar também Black Mirror III, porque quando você terminar o 2, você vai querer jogá-lo!","February 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bio-326/recommended/286460/","bio-326","Bioraye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bio-326/","25 products in account","Black Mirror 2 (BM 2), is the second title in a series of 3 (Black Mirror, Black Mirror 2 & Black Mirror 3).\n\nThe story started out interestingly in BM 1, and took a weird spin in BM 2 (but was somehow exciting). I have mixed feelings about it. It doesn't completely feel like a plausible sequel.\n\nSome of the parts felt fun to play, while other parts felt rather drab.\n\nIn BM 2, there are some remnants of the "stiff" feeling during gameplay - as experienced in Black Mirror (especially, as the main character walks).\n\nWhen examining certain items along the way, there's a tendency for the character to turn around, take a few steps, only to move back to where he initially moved from.\n\nThis feels really annoying at first, but it's not a major issue and really a matter of getting used to.\n\nA fun fact, is that the character actually changes clothes (i.e. sleeveless jacket/coat) - at some point - depending on the weather. I found that very pleasing, because it adds a layer of realism to the game.\n\nAnd just as in BM, the graphical textures & designs are splendid (e.g. beautiful animated clouds, water, reflections, impeccably furnished spaces). There's something very elegant & charming about it (which for me, added quite a bit of value).\n\nI also found the protagonist (aka Darren Michaels) absolutely lovable, thanks to a well developed personality (i.e. witty/dry sense of humour, humanitarian spirit, realistic mindset, rebellious attitude but dignified at the same time).\n\nAnd because of his intellectual background (= Physics major + lover of poetry/literature), some of the puzzles felt believable for him to solve, even though I deemed them dreadful & repetitive (luckily there's an option which allows to skip puzzles).\n\nI felt a bit unsatisfied and preferred the puzzles in BM (which were not too complicated, not too tedious, not too repetitive).\n\nI loved the interactive map (which allows the player to instantly travel from one explored place to another), and looks like an in-game postcard.\n\nSo, what happens is, when you want to move from one area to another (within the same town), you select the postcard in the inventory, which then becomes magnified on screen, and has images from all across town printed on it.\n\nThe images within the postcard (corresponding to the different areas in town), then just need to be clicked according to where you need to go and voila! - Darren goes off.\n\nI thought that was brilliant & creative.\n\nOn a final note, I believe it's important to keep an open mind when playing this game. Some parts just feel "off" & "fuzzy". I found the supernatural parts not blending well with the realistic elements. And at times, I found the reactions and responses of the subcharacters awkward, and anything but natural.\n\nRegardless of this matter, I still enjoyed the game, thanks to the amount of background info regarding the main character's lineage :). I just wished the creators had added more new content (story-wise), because the game does feel repetitive as is.\n\nStill a classy game nonetheless!","January 22","true","29.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This is my 2nd play through of the game, i had the original retail copy back in the day. The story is about a decade or so after the events of the first one, while you do not need to play the first one, i do recommend it to tie up loose ends. This is a good port, so it should work well. It does ask you to install Microsoft C++ Redistribute, but you can skip that if you have a later version from other games.\n\nRemember to right click objects, you may need to trigger some scenes first and then come back to said object for Darren to pick it up. Occasionally i have had to click things two to three times to get it in my inventory.\n\nI do recommend following or referring to a guide on your first playthrough.\n\nThis is a nice, spooky tale and great if you like games such as The Lost Crown, Darkfall, Myst, etc.","January 12, 2015","true","20.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/khatoblepas/recommended/286460/","khatoblepas","Khatoblepas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/khatoblepas/","240 products in account","A captivating, incredibly detailed adventure game that builds upon the shreds of mythos presented in the first game and weaves a tale that will keep you hooked from beginning to end.\n\nI must admit, I began this game with some reservations, having suffered through the tedium of the first game and it's bland presentation. But as soon as the game began, it dropped twists, turns and plot bombshells, and never relented until the very end, keeping me on the edge of my seat while presenting an expanded world with deep characters and a merciless deconstruction of the Black Mirror Mythos. All questions brought up by the first game are answered, and more questions are posed that kept me guessing until the very end.\n\nThe puzzle design in this game is top notch, with enjoyable puzzles that make sense, and the protagonist's exhaustive notes and little flairs of genius don't feel like they come out from the void, but rather from his own character. Each solution feels natural and like it is part of a believable progression of his character arc. I particularily enjoyed the non-item based puzzles, as they were often layered and presented with a code to break before the mechanical part of the puzzle even began. Richness of puzzles like this are incredibly rare, and should be valued. The puzzles, also, felt well rooted in the world, and even the most arbitrary sliding puzzle becomes a charming character trait for one of the many well-developed characters.\n\nThe game's aesthetic is a huge step up from the previous game, creating lively and deep locales to explore that straddle the line between photorealistic and oil painting. The lighting effects, in particular, are fantastic, lending an authentic spookiness to what could otherwise be a bland set. The effects are simple, often just a alpha channeled overlay or a translucent image, but the game does marvels with what it has.\n\nMy only criticism of the game's aesthetic would be the relatively stiff and mannequin like character models. Though an improvement from the last game, a lot of the models seem to look rather dull and lifeless, especially when viewed from close up. There isn't much in the way of expression, though the game goes out of it's way to find alternate means to portray the characters, such as novel camera angles, good cinematography, and dramatic body movements that don't rely on facial expressions. In all it wasn't distracting.\n\nThe game's writing is fantastic, though suffers from occasional translation weirdness, as the characters refer to things in esoteric or crude ways that a native speaker would not do (such as referring to thermite as "welding powder", which, while accurate, is not the way a native english speaker would refer to it). Mostly, the voice acting covers for the minor typographical errors in the text, but this is not really a problem.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game enough, though in order to fully appreciate it, you'd need to play the prequel, Black Mirror. Black Mirror II relies on a lot of callbacks, and references to gameplay mechanics, and story elements that would be sorely missed if you didn't play Black Mirror. So if you can suffer through the original game, you will be rewarded immeasurably by this sequel. That alone is worth the price of entry.","November 27, 2014","true","22.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I would go so far as to say, story wise I prefer Black Mirror to even the mighty Broken Sword; it's a very beautiful game to look at, and very clever. It feels as though it had mighty production values, which is probably a result of the above average artwork and score.\n\nIn my review of Black Mirror, I recommended beginning the trilogy by playing the games out of their chronological order, on the basis that two II and III are a batter introduction to the overall story, and tonally different enough to the first that if you played part one and didn't enjoy it, you would be making a mistake not playing the sequels. it is difficult to stand by this decision having played through all three games recently, as there are a number of recurring characters and locations you will appreciate more having played the first game, but I stand by my comments.\n\nBlack Mirror II introduces us to a new protagonist, Darren Michaels (significantly more contemporary and relatable than Samuel), and begins in the good ole' US of A. The backdrops are drawn beautifully, and the characters all come to life in their own little ways, in a similar manner to the first game. The locations are rich and detailed, and it isn't long before things begin to get a little strange. There are hints of sinister goings on in Fuller's store (Fuller being Darren's incredibly seedy boss) and before you know it, the infamous Willow Creek and Black Mirror castle finds it's way into the story, and it's here that the game really comes into it's own.\n\nHow the game references the first, is an absolute work of genius. From Gordon's Palace (a refurbished mental asylum referenced much and visited in the first game) to the museum depicting the terrible murders which took place some twelve years prior, the Black Mirror games represent a complete and well woven story, which truly feels like a meticulously planned trilogy, from beginning to end. Locations from the former game are revisited to satisfying effect. We meet old faces again, and all the while the game manages to maintain a tone of mystery and unease, drawing you into the sleepy yet sinister little town of Creek.\n\nIt is to review the game without giving too much away, and it's worth playing knowing as little about the story as possible. There are, however, some cons to , chiefly:\n\n- The voice acting. Some of the characters are just awful for some reason, in particular Tom. How they managed to do such a bad job of his accent is truly a thing to behold.\n- The final section of the game goes a bit puzzle crazy. At the one time you want nothing more than to move the story forward, you're hammered with contrived puzzles left right and centre, and frankly it all gets a bit much.\n- The BM games are famously dialogue heavy. This one isn't as bad as the first, but by god some characters do like to yappity yap.\n\nHeartily recommended overall though. There aren't many games like this out there, and if you can put up with a couple of dodgy accents and a whole lot of chatter, it's an experience you will never forget.","August 2, 2015","true","13.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But this (second part of trilogy) is different. Another team of developers worked on that part and i want to tell you about it, because they continued a good story from first part and did pretty good correction work, which led too edition of great quest.\n\nAt first,  there is diary, where Darren will write all key moments and achievements. It means, that after a long break you can read notes in diary and refresh your memory. It is really helpful and you shouldnt watch in solution, when you lost lane, because you cant remember where you stopped or just missed some little item/dialogue.\n\nAt second, dialogues there are good and post scoring much more lively, then in first part. Plus, I liked, that there I interacted not only with residents of the village, but also with urban people and you can notice that contrast.\nGraphics. There is striking difference. Locations, where developers wants startle us looks really creepy, unlike in first part, where that scenes looks like cheap trash.\n\nGameplay is mostly tied to combining items in your inventory. There is almost no poor puzzles like barley-break, if they are - you can solve it just in 7-10 minuts. But working with your inventory was really interesting and hard sometimes.\n\nSo, I guess, its all, I just wanted to say, that if you didnt like first part of Black mirror, and therefore you dont want to play second and third part, in my opinion, you MUST, if you enjoy quest-genre. Unlike first part, it is very good quest with beautiful world and nice tasks.","June 12, 2015","true","17.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Also most of the flaws in the first game are fixed. You can still die but thanks to autosave slot it's just mildy frustrating. I'm used to that too often main characters in p&c are ♥♥♥♥♥ing moaners, but in BM2 every second NPC is an a-hole without reason. Especially why customer servers are the most infuriating lowlifes and bimbos?

This is maybe the strongest point of it. Typical to adventure games, the game progresses by you carefully combing through all the points of interest.  Sometimes you have to look at a thing later again that you had already looked at. Sometimes you can collect junk when you don't know what its for, and at other times the character only accepts to pick something up after there's a need for it. I resorted to the 'aargh I'll just try any item on any other item or hotspot' to solve problems at least a few times to try to get the game to move on. The puzzles are mostly easy, of the familiar (say 'sliding puzzle') variety and for the others the answer is typically written somewhere nearby, or the main character helpfully narrates what you should try next. This eery precognition, the main characters tendency to jump into conclusions, and the fact that the storyline progresses in an unplausible manner, gave me a continuous feeling of disbelief. At many occasions I stared slack-jawed at what just happened. Such things might be okay in a fantasy world, but the game supposedly portrays contemporary (albeit magical) realism where its unlikely people would behave like they do in the game.\n\nI'd give it 7/10 ('ok but flawed'). As Steam allows only recommended or not, its a no.","January 2","false","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really liked the first two chapters, where you are slowly getting into the game by 'living' the main character rather instead of clicking on everything on the screen. You solve puzzles without even noticing they are puzzles. These are just things to do.\nAs the game progresses and the plot thickens the game changes into a more classic point&click adventures with symbol-searching puzzles, music puzzle, collecting elements puzzles, make your escape puzzles and so on. Thanks to the ability to highlight interactive points the game does not transform into a pixel hunt.\nThe story is really good, even if the twists are more or less predictable. It's nice to see some locations and characters from the Black Mirror I.\nAnimation of characters while interacting with environmnet is clumsy. I also did not like the few real-time action situations - they were unnatural, and a bit incoherent (going into action mode in some cases meant you will die after 2 seconds if you don't do anything; in other you could run forever in a room without any progress of the situation). Some of the character's reactions were not credible, as were the dialogue lines (something between implausible rudeness and Asperger's honesty in interactions with other people).\nGraphics were quite ok, music was standing out too much - in such games/movies you should not really notice it to get more immersed in the atmosphere.\nOverall a very good adventure game. To be played after the first part of the trilogy, if you want the full experience.\n","January 24","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's cliche and predictable. There is virtually no horror, just some silly occult themes. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple and if you get stuck in the game it's likely due to some object hidden on the screen (pixel hunting). The protagonist is also difficult to like, his snarky attitude wore thin pretty quickly. I did enjoy the rain effect and especially the storm effects towards the end.\n\nOh, and the game ends on a cliffhanger and, from what I've seen of the third, it looks like they just chopped one game in half.

I had played all three parts of the Black Mirror series couple of years back and when I saw them now on Steam, I just had to buy them. The whole trilogy of Black Mirror is an absolute must for every adventure games' fan, and I am more than sure that the old school players are all well aware of it. Therefore, I am writing this review for all of you who read about that title for the first time.\n\nThe series can stand proudly among the Monkey Island and the Broken Sword series and I simply do not understand why it is not just as famous as the abovementioned titles. However,  there is something special about the second instalment of the series. Contrary to Black Mirror I where the atmosphere is somewhat frenetic from the very beginning, the second story evolves at a slower pace, but allows the player to better identify with a 'fin du siecle' type of character that Darren is. In contrast to Samuel from part one who was scared all the time, Daniel does not give a rat's ♥♥♥ but is rather reluctantly intertwined in the events that are taking place. Darren gives the game a unique atmosphere: there is a balance between solving the mystery and having a relaxed (and very often sarcastic) attitude towards everything. That is why he reminds me of George Stobbart from the Broken Sword so much.\n\nThe puzzles are well balanced, perhaps sometimes a bit simple (the option to show all the interactive elements on the screen makes everything significantly easier - though you do not have to use it when you do not want to), but do not think that the game does not pose a challenge at all. There is a fascinating story behind all of this and I just find myself playing it once more just for the sake of the story. Voice acting was done in an exquisite fashion - every character is believable and makes the whole experience comparable to watching a good film. The graphics has aged really well and you can immerse yourself in the game just as well as a few years back. Last but not least, the game is an amazing commentary on the modern world and for that specific reason everybody can find something for themselves in the story that is told. That is the very reason I want to play one more time. I sincerely recommend it - your money will be well spent.","January 17","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see the hotpots and skip the minigames if you choose. On the other hand the death scenarios have been changed to split second decisions, heck sometimes a few of them in a row.
