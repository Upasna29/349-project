"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frubbus/recommended/219800/","Frubbus","cereal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frubbus/","167 products in account","Having played previous Pro Cycling Manager games I was always going to buy the latest instalment. This year's edition improved on past years components and added a fair amount of new features.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the new home screen at the beginning, not a huge difference but it looks nice and makes it easy to navigate and find game modes as such. Multiplayer (Armdada) has been improved as well; A track mode has been added (For Armada) and you can now play stage races with your own teams which was missing from last year's game. The career mode as well has been altered. This year if you are to build a custom team you have a virtually unlimited budget but your team's level (UCI World Tour, Pro Continental or Continental) is determined by how much you spend. You are also allowed unlimited reports on youth riders but this comes at a financial cost.\n\nWhen you are into the career you will notice that there has been a change in how you receive money in the game. Usually you earn money from winning races in prize money however this year you get money from nailing targets your sponsors give you. This can be frustrating as they may give you tasks which are unrealistic. An example: I had a continental team and was asked to win Omloop Het Niewsblad. Not only did I have no strong classics riders, but I was facing up against Cancellara and Boonen and worst of all, I couldn't even get an entry into the event through a wild card! Even though you can ask to scale down these assignments to aim to achieve a top 10 ranking or so but the amount of money you gain is heavily cut.\n\nIn the actual races there has been a graphical overhaul, the shirt quality of the riders has been improved (you can make out the writing and sponsors easily) and there have many new items added (useful for stage building). Some licenses are missing (BMC shirt & Sky and OPQS names) however these can be addressed via the community made databases - the most notable and impressive one being from PCMdaily.\n\nThe in-game mechanics have also changed, breakaways are now more likely to stay away which makes the game more challenging and in some cases more realistic. It is still feasible to chase back an escape although it will require more man power and help from the rest of the peleton. In my opinion though, the best changes have been those to the animations and accelerations of the riders. In previous years riders would look the same no matter their speed. The new animations have made the game seem more realistic as you can see when other riders are struggling or putting in a higher effort. Also, the acceleration stat now does mean acceleration and will determine how quickly your sprinter or climber attacks.\n\nFinally, I must add that this game is not really for non cycling fans who are are unaware of what lies beyond and before the Tour de France however a tutorial could address this problem.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPROS\n- Strong animations\n- Graphical Overhaul\n- Armada improved\n- In game mechanics improved\n\nCONS\n- Career mode can be frustrating\n- Still bugs in places","December 10, 2013","true","156.7"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","56","61","0","0"

I fall into the latter category. I've never played any management game so it was a steep learning curve trying to grasp the plethora of elements in PCM2013. As most games you would think there would be a tutorial mode, or some sort of introductory gameplay that eases you into each facet of the game one by one. There is none of that and you're literally dumped into an ocean of numbers. After investing many painstaking hours into career mode I still couldn't juggle all the variables it presented and left me quite frustrated. It has been said before, but the game is not targeted toward mainstream gamers and i feel even if you do perservere and climb past that very long and difficult learning curve, it isn't rewarding unless you truly are a fan of this particular genre and/or cycling.","March 8, 2014","false","6.4"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","29","52","0","0"

The game looked good, and it is very good, I'm having a lot of fun with it. The races are great, they feel dynamic and there's a lot of strategy there (at least to a novice like me). The management part is not quite as good as the racing, but it is enjoyable.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it has an absolutely God-awful interface. Whoever put that crap together needs to be replaced - I haven't seen anything like it since the 90's. You can't do ANYTHING in one screen. Setting goals for each rider, which you have to do every year, is a nightmare because from the screen you use to do this, you can't see the riders capabilites or details about the races. You have to click back and forth constantly or write stuff down. The whole game is like this. Things that you can click in one list can't be clicked in another, similar list. You can't set up custom views like you can in OOTP or FM. It's atrocious. The way the way the game presents stats and sets up tasks make PCM seem much harder than it really is, and probably put a lot of people off.\n\nI don't know if more recent iterations are better in this regard - I hope so. If not, the devs need to hire some front end guys and really think about the design of their game. Because if they sort this out, this is an 'A' list quality management sim. It's unfair that this series gets such lukewarm feedback over an issue that could be sorted without too much effort.\n\nAll that said, the gameplay itself is so good that PCM 2013 is still worth it for $10.","March 22","true","46.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Picture a rougher-round-the-edges version of Football Manager, handling training, team and rider objectives and contracts etc.  Then jump into the races (hundreds of different races in Career mode, most with real courses) in 3D and direct the riders - it's unusual and great; it's been described as a sports RTS.\n\nLoads of different challenges, big teams with the better riders will push for the top positions in maybe the great classic one day races or the epic challenge of winning the overall in the bigger tours, smaller teams will fight for victory in minor races or just go for lesser objectives in big races (e.g. win one stage, wear the points or mountain jersey etc).\n\nThe game is supported by a superb community who produce great content and improve it no-end and help newcomers, as there are lots of aspects which need explanation!\n\nUnder-rated and brilliant.

It does have a bit of a learning curve, but I wouldn't concider it too much of a hastle. The only problem I've had is that the game tends to crash more frequently then one would expect, it's not a huge problem but it can get really annoying when you're almost at the end of a stage.

For example, you want to set up the calender for each individual; you need to remember (or write down, so much paper on my desk) which races your sponsors want you to enter, what skills your cyclist has and what they mean (alot of the skills mean nothing unless you dig through other pages to find their meanings), what does your cyclist want to do.\n\nIt's just a constant back and forward to find things that may be important.

Once you press "start", you are literally plummeted into a sea of numbers and dates.

And nothing happens. So you click more random things, and eventually there is a race, in which you click random things. Or not. Then random things happen. Or perhaps they don't. Rider needs objectives? Choose one totally at random as there is no way to see what you are adding until you have added it. Remove one of his original objectives? Good luck trying to get it back. Rider complains races are unsuitable? But the only way to know if a random race from a huge list is suitable is by performing a dark satanic ritual sacrificing the blood of 17 virgins; sadly I failed to find even one.\n\nSearch online for a tutorial (frankly I have better things to do, but I did have a little look) and find a couple of indecipherable videos. There were are few in langages I don't speak; perhaps I should have tried those.\n\nI did find a review which explained the game perfectly though, and I suggest you read it.\nhttp://pixelsordeath.com/features/snore-simulator-a-review-of-pro-cycling-manager-2013\nTLDR? Click random things so that random things may happen. Or not.\n\nSo I quit and loaded a nice simple Paradox grand strategy more suitable for my obvious gaming shortcomings.\n\nAvoid unless you have already memorized every cycling abbreviation and the details of every cycling race planetwide prior to playing, or looking up such things sounds appealing to you, in which case please make yourself known to me in order that I may sacrifice you.","March 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","44","7","16","8","0"
