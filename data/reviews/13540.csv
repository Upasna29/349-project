Rainbow Six Vegas has a very entertaining story. Near the end of the first mission I was hooked; I grew quite attached to the main character Logan he was enjoyable to play as. I found myself constantly changing my loadout for the mission, no gun is without purpose.

The only downside is that this means Ubisoft is the sole publisher/developer of the title; boy do they love console ports.\n\nRainbow Six is an anti-terrorism organization who tries to stop threats before they become the front page news. With this, you lead a team with 2 other squad mates to tackle challenges that take place in close quarter building environments and city streets.\n\nBy commanding your squad mates, you progress through the challenges in the cohesive story. The single player story is about 10 hours’ worth of content, which allows you to get to know characters and game mechanics well. As with many other Tom Clancy games, there is always a sci-fi twist that doesn't seem "out of this world".\n\nWith your squad mates, you can clear rooms, rappel down the sides of buildings, and coordinate to take enemies out. If one of the squad mates manages to go down, the other can be ordered to revive them. In the more likely event that both squad mates go down, you revive them with a "hypo". While there is an "infinite" health system in place, you will still find yourself dying quite a bit.\n\nBiggest issues out of the game? Let's start with checkpoints, checkpoints, checkpoints... The worst thing known to humanity continues and was a "feature" back in the day. Rainbow Six doesn't escape this, and it will make you rage. People still arguge about checkpoints somehow defeating "save cheating" (the "art" or plain intelegence to save before big battles). This is simply untrue due to the fact that consoles simply couldn't save that much data back then. It was a technical reason (and poor one) that has infected modern games.\n\nThe "blur" or what seems to be some horrible pain effect isn't good at all. Because it's a console port, the memory and cpu usage had to be kept down and this horrible awful effect does its job. It is also strangely not optimized that well, so systems on the edge of requirements will suffer frame issues when effect kicks in.\n\nMultiplayer, while it does exist, requires an Uplay account, and then a small chance of someone playing multiplayer as well. There are no dedicated servers it seems, so a peer-2-peer system is in place. Only good thing that seems to come from multiplayer is the very precise customization options, it even surprised me in fact.\n\nUsing an older version of the Unreal engine, AI has issues following and getting into positions sometimes. Once you play enough, you will get used to it. I came in knowing that, and automatically accounted for it. Your experiences will vary in this regard with high certainty.\n\nKeys are places in odd spots on your keyboard, and there's quite a few to remember. Left alt for instance changes squad engagement rules and then pressing and holding r shows the gun equipment radial menu. V, B, and N are for room entering commands which change based on engagement rule set.\n\n\nBeyond these aspects, I had fun playing the title. It was unique, yet required some chasing to get it to work on Windows 7.","January 17, 2015","true","14.0"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/13540/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Rainbow Six Vegas was an effective and divisive reboot of the Rainbow Six series. It took the previously slow and tactical shooter series into a much more modern cover shooter direction. I say divisive because Rainbow Six Vegas caused a split in the fanbase between people who wanted a faster cover shooter and people who wanted a slower game where you plan your movements before executing.\n\nRainbow Six Vegas largely takes place in the titular city of Las Vegas. You play as "Logan" an operative for the titular "Rainbow" special forces team who enters the city to combat a terrorist threat. The storytelling is a bit muddled and you generally don't pay attention to it that much. It mostly serves to get you from point A to Point B and shoot some baddies.\n\nWhat Rainbow Six Vegas is most well known for it's cover shooter gameplay. While it is faster than all of the previous Rainbow Six games it's noticeably slower than say, Call of Duty or Gears of War. The game is built around using your squadmates to move to different positions so you can flank or take enemies out from a distance. It's much more forgiving as well since it has regenerating health and the enemy AI is fairly dumb. Since you die very quickly the game doesn't devolve into run and gun but it still feels much slower than it should.\n\nBesides the campaign, Rainbow Six Vegas also has multiplayer and Terrorist Hunt. The latter is where the game excels in my opinion. In Terrorist Hunt, you and a few friends can team up to take out AI enemies in a series of multiplayer maps. It's very enjoyable and replayable and is where the bulk of the time you spend playing the game will end up. Deathmatch is also available but good luck finding a game for it.\n\nIt's hard to really describe the original Rainbow Six Vegas without describing how much better it's sequel was. While I do recommend the game if you're a fan of modern shooters and desire something that requires slightly more thought behind it, the sequel comes generally more recommended.","May 25","true","9.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

There is no tactical planning or waypoint setting, but a map can be overlaid in real time to show enemy/friendly positions and objectives.\nDuring the game different approaches to reach objectives can be made which may involve fast roping, abseiling or ladder use to traverse drops and climbs. Your team of two non-player characters can be sent to any location within view (but not separately) and are reasonably reactive to incoming fire taking cover and returning fire when required. The range of weapons and customisation is vast and picking the correct weapons for the scenario is vital for success. My favourite action is being able to sneak view under doors and tag enemies for the NPC's to attack before door entry is made. Onto the health system, there is no health bar in this game. Instead when you are shot your vision becomes blurry. This means you have to take cover and rest until the blurriness has gone. It may not be a realistic health system but it adds to the intenseness of firefights and works very well.\nThere are a ton of weapons to play around with. Sub machine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, shield. All of these are tweak able with different scopes, magazines, laser sights etc.\n","January 9","true","7.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","0"

This and it's sequel are the only Rainbow Six games I've played, so I can't say that the original ones are better or anything like that. What I can say is that if your preference for games is Call of Duty and you don't want to expand your horizons, then stay far away from this game. But.. if you want a challenge with a gripping story line, lots of replay value (I've done the campaign three times now, and about 70 hours of terrorist hunt). It is a step between your run of the mill shooters and super stealth games (like Splinter Cell). You can run and gun and make it.. but it is very difficult.. but by the same token, you don't have to wait for minutes studying patrols movements. Bottom line.. I'm anxiously awaiting the next Rainbow Six installment (if it ever comes out), because I enjoyed this game so much.","December 16, 2013","true","61.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's pretty clear that Rainbow Six: Vegas is an accomplished action shooter. The story is presented via briefings and overheard terrorist conversations. All of the voice-overs are well done here so it's a pretty decently presented plot. Once again the pc people seem to have been sacrificed to make the console gamers play. Default key positions are pretty strange in some cases, but it seems to me that this was one of the first games i can remember that W A S D became the default forward, left, right back controls (these however can be made to any of your choices) The whole cover system is brilliant as as soon as you go into 'cover' the camera changes from first to 3rd person view, allowing you to see enemies and therefore plan your attack.\n\nThe weaponry seems to be accurate to the original weapons and from what i can tell the friendly AI is actually quite stupid, as is  the enemy AI (shooting through walls to name one)\n\nR6:Vegas on older systems is a serious system hog, but on a 2012 machine the graphics are ramped up to the maximum and it doesnt twitch which has got to be a good thing\n\nRecommended for a quick pickup and play when theres nothing else on","December 24, 2015","true","31.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

This makes the gameplay allot richer because most of the time you will spend playing it will be against bots. The guns are great, and have a nice kick to them, making rifles feel like LMG's and LMG's feel like rockets, making the gun feel more like a weapon then a pea shooter.

The graphics are great (once you adjust brightness to around 4-5, which makes the contrast much nicer and the game look less bland) and it seriously beats out its sequel, Vegas 2. Interesting level designs, believable and awesome attention to detail- from the wrecked slums of a Mexican ghetto, to the wealth driven Vegas strip with poker chips flying out of slot machines, it's truly a wonderful achievement for a 2006 game. The shooting is wonderful, with a great cover system that, while not entirely realistic, is great for a tactical title. The AI shout commands at eachother, exclaim words of disbelief as their comrades perish, and your allies are not brick stupid like in Vegas 2. It is not without flaws, though. The AI will ocassionally spazz out, this is easily fixed by ordering them to move somewhere, and the game has not been updated since 07, its highest resolution setting makes the Xbox One giggle- this is easily fixed with an auto-patcher (http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/103-tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-resolution-patcher/) and brings the game up to date. The game lacks a lot of graphics options, which were supposedly included via a launcher the CD version came with.\n\nThe story is wonderful, very compelling and intriguing- very Tom Clancy-ish. You can tell they actually cared when making this game, as opposed to its rushed out, still-the-same-graphics and models, sequel.\nIf you want my honest truth, this game is everything Vegas 2 should have been. The customization is the same, the music is better, the audio is better, the settings are much better and the characters are not utterly stupid. The ending to this game is far more rewarding than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they threw in with the sequel, not to mention the plot twists actually make sense and will make you go "oh" as opposed to make you giggle like a rampant meth addict like it will in the sequel.\n\nIf you want a serious, interesting co-op experience...buy this. If you want a game with same-same guns and a decent unlock system, with the same graphics as its predecessor (06 vs 08, same ♥♥♥♥ing graphics and models, gg) you'll want to buy that POS named Vegas 2.\n\nSorry for the run on sentences, written at 2 AM.","March 4","true","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

And it does live upto your expectations. The story is good and so is the twist. It has a good choice of weapons, the assault rifles being the best ones. As a FPS game, you get to shoot a lot of enemies and thus, you won't be disappointed at all. The only problem that i felt was that you get too less health, just a bullet or two and you are dead.

Just like Ghost Recon, you can command your squad members to take cover, take care of a personal objective (hacking and placing charges), and even handle door situations like (flash & clear, open & clear, breach & clear, and grenade & clear for examples.)\n\nAll in all if you're into first person shooter (and it only goes into third person shooter mode when you're taking cover), then I highly recommend you guys or ladies to play this game. It's awesome and a lot of fun! Some missions on this game are challenging but it feels pretty good once you overcome and beat it! :)","March 19","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/13540/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Rainbow Six Vegas is yet another part of Rainbow Six series, tactical-themed FPS. This time around there are no more planning and you control only two other squad member. Yet it's all good fun. It came out in 2006 and was made by Ubisoft. Also, it was made for X360 first, so it came into PC territory like a proud direct port, lacking slightly in options and not optimized very goodly. At least it got patched up since then.\n\nIt also came out for X360, PS3 and PSP. The first two should be similar, but PSP is different game. You play solo in that one. It doesn't interest me not in the slightest this way, I am here to see squad members work along with me. You are supposedly saving those two squad members, being lone wolf.\n\nTechnically, well, yea. Port from Xbox 360. Used to be unoptimized, but I am sure that computers nowdays can easily just power through it. It still however rarely freezes for half-minute. Steam Overlay doesn't work either, have fun alt-tabbing.\n\nEven worse, PC version did not support widescreen monitors at release! And while they patched widescreen in later, it still doesn't every wide resolution and even worse, the HUD is still designed for 4:3 monitor. So do some full-screen graphics. Like "to be continued" screen. Oh, yea, cliffhanger alert.\nBut I am pretty sure that there are fan patches to fix those.\n\nMultiplayer servers were supposedly shutted down, but it actually still works, just requires UPlay account, at least now. Yep, new players will have to fancy around with email adress as nickname, from what I understood. Well, at least it works.\n\nCommunity seems to be kinda there. One times I tried there were no servers, other times there were 5 of them, with players. Seems like people only play Cooperative modes only nowadays, you will not find any Competetive players vs players. Sadly, they all seems to be quite protective, as all the servers I encountered were password protected, so I didn't get to check out multiplayer in these few days.\n\nAnd well, what can I say. It sure was made as a show off for Xbox 360, showing off itself with Unreal Engine 3, while trying to be accessiable to new players. Though, to be honest, I really dislike graphics in this part. That's because while they are cool on technical side, the art style is just awful. Or, rather, it feels like developers applied a really bad brown hue blur effect all over the screen. Music also isn't hot, being urgent but not very awesome. Shame that Rainbow Six main theme is gone.\nOh well, at least Vegas setting is kinda cool.\n\nAlso, yep, this Rainbow Six is now all about telling a good story and having fun. Not more planning before mission, head into action, main hero. Take on them with your regenerative health, until you get instakilled by sniper shot and realize that you can't just charge on even on Normal. Nope, it's still tactical, somewhat, sorry Doomguys.\n\nIt also got cover system implented, where you hold a button and go into third person mode, as Logan hides behind a wall. You are supposed to spend most of your time in this mode, but personally, I kept forgetting that I can do it and instead kept crouching behind corners, aiming and shooting from the first person mode. Ha. But hey, here is a cool feature that you can do a blind fire from behind cover. Enemies can do it too, also. Gotta snipe those hands.\n\nAnd thankfully, you aren't alone either, for you can still command to your other teammates. Or more exactly single squad. Made of one explosive ♥♥♥♥♥ and one haxor chinese guy, because yay Hollywood must-haves. No offence there, just stereotypical. Yep, just two people who you can't command separately, only to both at same time. To be honest, I am dissapointed that there are so little, I was expecting to get the second such squad and never recieved such. Rainbow Six Lite, gentlemen.\n\nBut thankfully, they still beat their Rainbow Six Lockdown rivals into jaws, as these two people actually have good enough AI to follow you fast and be reliable at clearing the rooms. And while levels are linear, you get few options on how to enter. For example, you pretty much always have two doors, you can tell them to bang and clear one set while going through another. Or you can also peek under door with snake-cam and call out two priority targets and just tell them to open door, they take out priority targets very fast and accurately while breaching. And I gotta say, I love hostage situations in this game, even if they are scripted.\nAlso, fallen teammates can be saved and made alive again, while you can't. Knowing this, you can guess how this team works. Answer: Like a horrible friends.\n\nBut yes, thanks to this small squad being reliable and easy to control, I like this game a lot. After all, the reason why I liked single-player tactical shooter is because of working together with friendly AI and making tactical choices and this one more or less provides it, while being accesable tojust launch and have fun. I think that I would take it over Rainbow Six Raven Six, for I don't care about 1-shot-kills so much and AI of teammates in that game acted too dumb. As well as I like ability to be able to order more or less good during gameplay.\n\nBut with promise that they bring back planning someday or let us play with more squads at the same time.\n\nStill would rather take SWAT 4 though.\nBut oh well, this one is fun too.\n\nOh, and there is terrorist mode. In single-player you play solo, so I wasn't so interested. It's quite hard and enemies will try to storm your positions just fine.\n\nOh, yea, and there is multiplayer. I didn't get to try it. I know that it has unlockables. But most of stuff you got to play in single-player is there too, easy to access.\n\nBut yep, pretty fun shooter where you get to order around to two squadmates and do some job.

That may indeed be the case, but it's fun and quite replayable, especially in co-op mode.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of Gears of War, except you're in first-person mode when not in cover, and you can issue basic tactical orders to your teammates. You'll probably never actually do any fighting from first-person mode, however, because your ability to take damage is very limited even on Normal difficulty, making it almost impossible to win a gunfight without using cover (which puts you into third person view, and lets you blind-fire if you want which is pretty cool).\n\nA few of the basic tactical options like the ability to change the weapon rate-of-fire and attach suppressors are present, which is much welcome. You usually have a choice between going all Rambo into the next area, or playing it safe by going in stealthily and taking everyone by surprise with a few well-placed stun grenades. You also get to feel like a badass in some sequences, rappelling down the side of a building then crashing through the window and saving the hostages.\n\nThe game can be hard at times, but in a way that feels justified and encourages you to rethink your strategy instead of yelling at the screen. It can get frustrating when you fail a mission because an AI teammate went down, but that's not too common because the AI is quite smart and is often capable of clearing a room without your help.\n\nCo-op is where this game really shines. It's essential to coordinate the attack plan before opening the next door, and that makes for particularly satisfying breach moments, as you mercilessly pick off those terrorist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then yell "Clear!".\n\nAs is typical with Ubisoft, the game wasn't well optimized and had many performance issues at launch. In 2015, that's no longer a problem with any modern PC able to nail this 2006 game, but there are still a few annoyances that show how little the devs cared about the PC. You can't use the steam overlay. You can't bind controls to mouse thumb buttons. Your choice of screen resolutions is limited unless you edit the ini file. The graphics options are quite limited.\n\nIf you want a fun co-op shooter that does a decent job simulating tactical special ops behaviour without being too hardcore, get this game (and an extra copy or two for your friends).","September 18, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Enemies will no-scope you from cover from 200 feet away with a shotgun and insta-kill you *SOMETIMES* or maybe do barely any damage to you.  This inconsistency makes the game feel like bipolar mess which can either make you feel like breezing through it, or smashing your keyboard in rage because of being one-shotted by some ♥♥♥-hat hiding behind something you should clearly be able to shoot through, only to reload the checkpoints.  And yet, I still found myself wanting to push onward and beat the annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt combines a beyond simplified interface compared to previous Rainbow Six games with no pre-planning, but offers reasonable weapon customization.  You can freely add a silencer to almost any assault rifle or pistol, and it gives you the option of using the shield which I found worked and sometimes it didn't.  The AI is reasonably smart, and will try and flash bang you, use lethal grenades when you're using the shield a lot, and I found that they can lose track of you during a fire-fight.  Silencers appear useless at first because of the linearity of the game, but I found it helps keep the AI guessing where you are, so that they won't always be able to find where the fire is coming from during combat, or right before, so it's less about finishing objectives undetected and more about utilizing stealth as a way to ambush.\n\nThe objectives are quite visually appealing with lots of interesting design choices in the environment, and enemies don't just instantly ragdoll when you kill them, as you'll see a mix of ragdoll with the physics of where you shot them plus an animation based on where you shot them, which makes kills very satisfying.  Overall, Rainbow Six is no longer the tactical shooter it was.  It is now a Cover-shooter, with tactical elements.  I suppose the change was evident from Raven Shield to Lockdown, but it seems they've done what Lockdown couldn't, which was making the game interesting for the player.\n\nP.S. For some reason, Vegas 1 looks better than Vegas 2, and plays better than Vegas 2 as well.","May 9","true","9.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Rainbow Six is my favorite book, and this certainly does it justice. Sure it's a first person shooter, a genre that is almost sucked dry by the industry, but this is a fresh take on the "absorb bullets and mow down anything that moves". You go out of cover, you're dead in three shots, maybe less, since enemies can and will headshot you. This may seem like a turn off, but honestly, it feels so good in firefights because the guy that you're shooting at isn't just a faceless enemy in a room full of bad guys, he's the one who could potentially kill you. The checkpoints could be better, but I guess it's saying "Stop being a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. You can't stand out in the open in this game." Also, your teammates...they're another layer of strategy. You have to constantly manage your team, citing whether they should shoot first or return fire, put suppressors on, follow you, or breach doors. They're definitely not invicible, and sending them across the room to mow down the enemies while you take cover could bite you in the ♥♥♥ later when they're both down and pretty far away, and you have to revive them whilst getting shot at.

While Vegas has the console feel but still it a great game on the PC.\n\nThe play commands Logan Keller the new team leader of Rainbow, a international anti-terrorist organization, sent to a Mexican border town to capture Irena Morales who is a terrorist ringleader. Failing to capture Irena, Keller is ordered to head to Las Vegas to handle a new crisis there. The story is on par with any Tom Clancy book or game so it filled with action and a couple plot twists but overall its not memorable.\n\nGameplay takes on new features from previous installments. One is the cover system much like Kill.switch and Gears Of War players can take cover against almost anything and either blind fire to give covering fire or pop up and shoot. Another add in is a regenerative health system that is much like any other game that has one. In previous Rainbow Six games before each mission but with the going more console centric that went away and was replaced a simple order giving control scheme which in Vegas was refined and is pretty simple to give your team members orders to breach, grenade, flash, clear, etc.\n\nSound FX do sound great in the case of the weapon fire and other general FX's and the voice work is good and fit the game well and while the soundtrack is good and fits the game its just the same orchestral work like most games.\n\nOverall the game is a great game to experience for fans of the Rainbow Six series.\n\n7/10","November 30, 2014","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's some cool stuff about this game.\nThe environments are lush, bright and somewhat colorful. Also the game is littered with advertisements for Axe body spray XD\nFor a Tom Clancy game it still does have that tactical shootery thing going for it, but they've butchered the ordering system. Instead of being able to give orders to individual members or different squads you just have the one squad. You can control your character independently of the other two guys under your lead, which you cannot give independent orders to. It feels a little awkward being that this whole ordering system was executed pretty well in previous games.\nThe checkpoint system is in full swing and it is annoying. This isn't one of those games that rewards tactics so much as being very twitchy and knowing where the enemy will come from before hand. Vertical coverage is not an advantage. The only tactic I found that worked with the mechanics implemented in the game is continuously pulling feints and flanks on the AI which seems to be continually distracted. The AI also doesn't implement some tools really well. They'll sometimes just throw a smoke grenade your way and all you can say is "Thanks for that," but that doesn't help you when the AI can somehow see through the smoke in many places in the game.\n\nIs it fun? Somewhat? I played it to the end and it's not something I'd subject myself to again unless I had a few friends along for the ride. It just doesn't appeal to me on the basis that I like to plan things out and it's hard to do that in one go, with the obvious advantages of cover and gaining height on targets, when the enemy can spawn in behind you and your men are plain disobeying orders left and right.","August 20, 2014","false","14.9"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

My friend and I both agreed about these differences in comparison. As a matter of fact, this game was so bad that it left a stale taste in our mouths as we tried to play Vegas 2. It was hard to take that game seriously after playing this one.

The multiplayer is thoroughly dead (yeah I actually logged in with UPlay credentials). The game has not aged so well. The campaign is short and ends abruptly with a "to be continued" screen. The guns feel stiff and plastic, and there's no obvious reason to ever pick the ones with subpar stats. The graphics are not the best even for 2006, and strikingly bad when you're in a helicopter over Vegas. Environments have no interaction aside from ladders, ropes, and the occasional exploding barrel. The story is pretty worthless. The level design is decent with lots of cover and alternate paths, though ultimately each mission is linear. The best part of the game is giving commands to your squadmates, who actually do have decent AI and only occasionally forget to shoot the badguy right in front of them. Unfortunately once you get the hang of sending them ahead to do most of the work then the game becomes fairly easy. I can't even recommend it much for the squad combat because the same kind of system was absorbed into far better games like Mass Effect.","April 7, 2014","false","11.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Great game, but this stuff pisses me off.\n\nI'm not saying the game is bad. It can be real fun but these things just won't let me enjoy the game at its full. I need the overlay because that's a useful way to communicate with my friends in-game. I've already asked for Ubisoft support. What happens is this: Usually the exes of Steam games are modified so that they HAVE to detect Steam and the license prior to run. Here, Ubisoft went lazy and made a runme.exe (search your binary folder) that reads a runme.data Inside runme.data is specified the name of the exe (in this case R6Vegas_Launcher.exe) that will en up being executed. The runme.exe is the one that holds the Steam license validation... Yes, Ubisoft didn't modify the actual game exe to be compatible with steam, it created another one with the validations that calls the retail one. So if you run the game from Binaries folder Steam won't track your game time. Is it really THAT hard to modify the game exe so it can be fully compatible with steam?\n\nOkay the game is old, forget the resolution, (there is patch that changes the congif file online that does the job) give me the overlay with tracking and I'll be able to recommend it.","June 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Really, the game is just simply put, average.\n\nThe plot is a straight out of a generic action-thriller movie that involves a WMD in the middle of the Vegas Strip, and only you and your squad can save Sin City and all its morally-questionable fun. This plain jane story is presented through some of the cheesiest voice-acting I've ever heard; foul-mouthed terrorists and an overly 'Murican protagonist are the first things your auditory senses will register. Your squadmates are no better either, although Jun has to be the less obnoxious of the two since he has the decency to not spout off 80's era catchphrases and one-liners every 15 seconds.\n\nGameplay is as I've mentioned before, mediocre and not notable in a market that's got more shooters than rounds fired in the average round of Battlefield. The only real variety that Vegas has to seperate itself is a cover mechanic and a few contextual commands for your squad (such as breaching a door). While this may be a step above something like Call of Duty, compared to older Rainbow six games, such as the legendary Rainbow six 3, the oversimplified mechanic is a major letdown. Regardless, the cover mechanic is helpful in combating the hordes of profanity spewing bad guys who seems to have more ammunition than braincells. Once again, your squadmates aren't all that smarter, but they do make a handy distraction when the brown hits the fan and can do a decent amount of damage if you set them up in a good spot where they can rain down lead.\n\nWhile we're discussing "raining down lead", Vegas 1 does offer a reasonable selection of weapons, but sabotoges itself with some odd, clunky, and pointless mechanics. Firstly, you are given infinite ammunition for your pistol which detracts from the realism and practically turns your other two weapons into dead weight. If you pair this up with the Shield, you get invincibilty against all frontal attacks, an endless supply of rounds, and a defenstration of any and all realism; the same realism that Tom Clancy games often attempt to emulate. As for your two-handed firearms, you are offered Assault rifles, Submachine guns, shotguns, light machine guns, and sniper rifles. You will find the most use out of Assault Rifles and SMGs since every other weapon is overly crippled in some way shape or form.\nShotguns will knock down a goon in one satisfying shot, but have limited range, low rate-of-fire, and slow-reload (we'll discuss this later)\nLight Machine guns may offer you a chance to live your fantasy of being rambo, but that gets cut short when the fact that it can't hit the broadside of a barn leaves your staring at the sky with your blood-splattered eyes.\nSniper Rifles, like shotguns, can take out enemy mooks with a single bullet (headshot not required) but since most of this game takes place indoors...I'll let you figure that one out.\n\nAs promised, now we discuss the worst part of this game and the source of it's fake difficulty: reloading. Once you press the "R" key, your character will, beyond all odds, defying all sense of self-preservation, adamantly reload his weapon or die trying. The saving grace is that reloading is manual-only, but when your primary is a shotgun or light machine gun and a hostile decides to come over and see why you aren't lighting him up, you're a goner as there is no way to stop the animation. You can't switch weapons, can't throw grenades, can't order your squad around, all you can do is watch your character get helplessly riddled with bullets because of an idiotic design flaw.\n\nIn Terrorist Hunt, which is this game's version of Gears of War Horde Mode, all you do is clear out 15~60 terrorists from the multiplayer maps all on your own. Easier said than done as the game enjoys spawning badguys behind you and into rooms you've just cleared making for some cheap deaths and even more fake difficulty. I know flanking around or behind your target is a tactic used in reality, but Counter-Terrorist teams also don't send you into firefights alone in reality either. As annoying as Jun and Micheal can be in the campaign, you'll start to wish they were there to watch your back.\n\nTo conclude, if you are a hardcore first-person shooter warrior then you may find Rainbow six Vegas to be enjoyable, but if not, don't waste your cash on this game. It's not good enough to be fun and competitive; it's not bad enough to laugh at. It's plain average.","May 3, 2014","false","14.4"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","0"

I found myself literally pixel hunting in some of the levels to try to distinguish the enemy AI from the background. It doesn't help that the hostiles can shoot you through surfaces that are transparent to them but opaque to you (including foliage and lattices)\n- hostiles spawn regardless of your approach; stealth is not rewarded. Blitzkreig through an area and find 5 hostiles round the corner expecting you, reload the area and sneakily kill everyone without alerting anyone, you will still find those 5 hostiles expecting you\n- checkpoints are few and far between. Ostensibly clear an area, complete the objectives, get 1-hit by a hostile standing across the map behind a hedge, tough **** you're gonna have to do it all again.\n\nAll these factors make it a frustrating experience to play.","June 2","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics aren't bad, some could say they're fantastic for the release. I enjoy ragdolls in action games and this delivers. I used to run a slow computer and this game literally ran as smooth as anything. It doesn't require a buffed computer which is nice. The weapons aren't too varied, but there's still a decent selection [don't worry though, they've got every type of weapons excluding RPGs]. On top of that, the physics are pretty nice and if you're not satisfied you can set them to realistic [you die way quicker and AIs are more difficult]. You won't see someone die from one shot unless the weapon is buffed or you get a headshot. That's also nice, unlike other games, you actually kill them one shot if it's critical. A warning to any choir-boys out there though, this game has some intense language. You'll hear racial slurs, vulgar language, and words you've probably never heard before. As for the story, it's pretty well written with nice maps. If you ever get bored you've got the classic terrorist hunts which are a good practice lol.","June 2","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The themed casinos really feel alive. There's a lot to just wander around and marvel at.\n+ Music and ambient sound effects double down on the immersion.\n+ Large range of weapons to choose from.\n+ Satisfying cover based combat.\n+ LAN multiplayer is lots of fun.\n+ Terrorist's voices add a touch of comedy. "Should I just run into the bullets?"\n+ 360 gamepad support.\n\n- Getting insta-killed from nowhere sucks. Especially since the checkpoints are few between.\n- Hard to make out enemies sometimes from the environment.\n- Enemies can see through things you can't, like foliage.\n- Didn't think much to the story. It was kinda weak. It feels tacked on.\n- You won't bother with half the weapons. SInce they are too poor to be useful.\n- Dull and uninspiring first couple of missions. Game doesn't excite until you get to Vegas.\n- Tactical gameplay lacks depth. Essentially is just moving your team upto doors and getting them to go in first.\n- Lack of resolution options. Had to choose 1920x1080 and get my TV to downscale to 1360x768.","June 4","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
