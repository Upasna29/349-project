Maybe a Bedtime Mode, where you have to get the baby back to bed without waking the mom.

Baby saw the forks, and they were good.\n\nOn the fourth and final day (Because Baby cannot count), Baby created Daddy. A slave for Baby, so that he could sit back and relax whilst Daddy did all the work. However Daddy became sentient, and enslaved Baby instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallyveil/recommended/427730/","Mallyveil","Mally","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallyveil/","452 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat started out as a joke on Funnyjunk.com from a despised, sad cat man, turned into the family friendly game of the year. "Who's Your Daddy" is the sleeper hit of 2015, the brain child of Thehumanidiot, turning decades of volunteer dad work into a full hands on simulated experience.\n\nThe goal of 'Who's your daddy' is to make sure that your spawnling doesn't remove himself from the gene pool too quickly (High School is the most appropriate time for this.) You do this by making sure that the baby can't eat dozens of batteries, stick forks into electrical sockets, and drinking blue juice under the sink. Alternatively, if you are playing as the baby character, it's your job to be as much of a little ♥♥♥♥ as humanly possible. This is more choice than a Telltale video game.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about. The dad is a heteronormative cis white male, with the baby able to change its appearance based on what actions it has undertaken. It's possible to turn the baby into Shrek if you eat too much blue juice, for example.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of one song that constantly loops. It is actually the newest hit single by young money rapper Drake, where he dances like a complete bozo on film. The song plays in the main menu, and from the in game radio, a statement of how every single song on the radio is exactly the same. Not only are we treated to a parent trainer, we also have a strong message about the media today.\n\nAll in all, 'Who's your Daddy' is an ideal game for anyone that wants to have a nice friendly game. The price is cheap, the graphics inducing nostalgia, and the gameplay is simple yet effective. I fully anticipate when we're treated with 'Who's your Daddy' at EVO 2016.","December 23, 2015","true","4.0"," 194 of 231 people (84%) found this review helpful 130 people found this review funny","84","194","231","130","21"

Seemed like a goofy game to mess around with.\nIt is, actually.\nFor maybe a round or two.\nWhen we first got it, it had issues, but hey, it's early access, right? Well, as each update came out, it seemed like there were more and more issues. Weird lag, objects not working, getting stuck, random people joining our password protected custom game, etc.\nThen, out of nowhere, it's 'released'. I'm sorry, but this game is NOT ready for release.\nNot sure where to begin.\nHow about performance? Pretty abysmal. Can be running smooth, but then the framerate just plummets, mouse movement is all jerky, and it just feels rough.\nGraphics-Quite poor. I'm not one to judge a game by it's graphics by any means, but overall, the game just looks bad. Looks like the devs just slapped it together and called it good. Character models are atrocious (hats and glasses are humorous though), textures are all over the place. Some look fine, but others don't make any sense. Go outside and look at the achievement room. The room is flat, but the 'bricks' taper off. Good example of it being slapped together.\nControls-Serviceable I suppose, although picking up items and using them is a major chore.\nBalance-absolutely ridiculous. It's not a matter of who is going to win? The baby or the daddy? It's a matter of if the baby dies in one minute or two. The daddy has only a couple things he can do to stave off the baby's death, but there are sooo many options for the baby to off itself, it quickly turns into a race to see just how fast the baby can kill itself, especially with warping through vents.\nIdea/concept-brilliant. Actually a really good idea for a game, but there are so many issues right now, I'd stay away. We'll probably keep playing it off and on for a while to see if things improve, but it's quickly becoming tiresome.\nOne thing I forgot about, and just remembered. The soundtrack. One of the most annoying and grating soundtracks I've ever heard.","May 13","false","3.3"," 225 of 283 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","225","283","14","7"

I've never found any glitches, and the main mechanics for the game are already in place and hilarious.\n\nThe game is simple, one player is a suicidal baby, trying to find any means of ending its life. Where the other player is the panic-stricken dad trying to keep the baby safe until mum comes home.\nEvery time a round starts, object locations are randomized, allowing for some pretty good replay value. The baby can end its existence in a multitude of ways. E.g: Stick a fork in an outlet, drown itself in the sink or cook itself in the oven.\nAs the dad, you have the ability to take objects out of the baby's hands directly and put them on higher up counters out of its reach. You may also lock certain cabinets if you find a padlock, or turn off faucets.\n\nAt the moment, the game is relatively well balanced, although I feel like the dad might be a bit overpowered if the player chooses to follow the baby constantly.\nRight now, you can complete a chore by throwing all of the baby's toys into the toybox, and then obtain a random powerup like the ability to see items through walls or be invisible to the baby.\nThis chore is completely optional though.\nI feel like the chore(s) should be mandatory, so they must be complete as well as the baby survive until mum comes home. It might sound a bit tough for the Dad, but it's the only method I can think of to prevent the dad from just preying on the baby constantly. Besides, he can force pull objects out of the baby's hand. Perhaps the baby could respawn in a random spot instead? Those are just a few suggestions.\n\nOverall, I can't wait until more death opportunities arrive, and more house rooms are created. It's a really funny base for a game, and genuinely well executed. (Perhaps also a game mode where the baby needs to run away from the dad, because it can be picked up and thrown into the toilet or oven?) Did I say that out loud?\n\nRecommended!","December 29, 2015","true","1.9"," 108 of 122 people (89%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","89","108","122","44","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/427730/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Quick Review-\nWho's Your Daddy is genre I'd like people to start using called "Creepy Simulator", on par with the games: "What's under your blanket !?" and "Shower With Your Dad".\nIf we're speaking specifically, it's a competitive, co-op game between a baby and father, the person controlling the baby is trying to kill himself or herself, while the father frantically runs around trying to keep the baby from death's grip.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory There's not much to say about the game's story, however *I* have a number of stories from playing the game. I purchased this game to play it with my younger brother, and then laughed until I cried at all the hilarious events that took place.\nTo all of my friends who sent me messages saying "oh god, that game"; instead of judging me from afar, you should have joined my twitch stream and laughed along with me (because my brother is so much more funnier then me).\nFrom setting myself on fire as a baby, predicting what my brother was going to do, and hearing his frustrated screams of "don't give me those pills! Keep that apple away from me!", it really was a hilarious stream.\n\nGameplay: WARNING!!!! I'm not going to spoiler tag my whole review, but lets say this game is way more fun when you don't know very much about the mechanics of the game. Grab two copies of this game, grab a friend, skype, and enjoy.   Read on if you don't mind having basic gameplay spoiled.\n\nI have already explained the gist of the game. If you're the father: you try to keep your child alive by moving dangerous objects away, and giving pills and fruit to your child to keep them healthy until mom gets home! As the baby your objective is to get yourself killed in one of the very many MANY ways of doing so, drowning, freezing, burning, poison, power outlets, and more that are still being added (03/07/16) as the game updates.\n\nSome may criticize the game on it's graphics, or glitches that may happen while playing. Naturally in most games this would be a negative quality, but there's a hilarious novelty about the game, and it's not over priced for the entertainment.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements at this time. This is a game which would be fun to have "dumb achievements", just so achievers can grab an easy 100%, since the game at this time is purely 1v1 co-op, an achievement for each death would be very easy to teach people the various ways you can die, or power ups you can unlock as the father.\n\nPrice: Who's Your Daddy is priced at $4.99, now I normally grade games by 1 dollar for every hour played, but for this game I make an exception. The quality of laughter and company of my brother over ruled the standard rule.\nAt this time I've spent two and a half hours playing the game. I have no doubt as the game is updated we will continue to play it occasionally, so even in price and hour the game will probably make it!\n\nConclusion: There's not much else to say about the game, the developer has already made a great game, and we can all look forward to seeing what other madness will be added to the game, and hopefully the developers don't get picked up by child support services before the game comes out of Early Access.\nI recommend this game for anyone to play with another friend (if you have a funny friend, it's even better), if you're generally a solo gamer this is a skip for you.","March 7","true","3.1"," 120 of 142 people (85%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","85","120","142","33","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Prototype_A1/recommended/427730/","Prototype_A1","James The MiG-21bis Pilot Skunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Prototype_A1/","187 products in account","NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE EARLY ACCESS VERSION AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS VERSIONS ARE RELEASED.\n\n(Written as of....Alpha V0.3.0. Can't wait for the update this friday!)\n\nThe game right now is fun but has issues. The gameplay is rather simple. One player is a baby who must die before time runs out (I think it's 4 minutes.) while the dad must keep him safe.\n\nNow while the gameplay has evolved over the versions (Pills used to heal baby too and were infinite.) the game has some serious balance issues. I was able to play for about an hour as baby (I'd leave and make a new lobby each time so I'm always baby.) and was able to win every time, often before the first 30 seconds. Forks spawn near the crib and you can easily jump up, grab it, and use it on an outlet to die instantanously. If a hammer is on the TV stand you can smash the coffee table and eat the glass to die quick too.\n\nDaddy gameplay is fun too but it seems very easy to shut baby away from harm if you know where to look. (Put knives and forks on sofa, etc.)\n\nThe main ways to die as Baby are either electrocution by outlet or poisoning (Glass works the fastest.) drowning or cooking yourself in the oven takes too long and can be easily stopped by Daddy, which should be made faster.\n\nThe game also has technical flaws. Often the countdown before a match starts glitches and I have to alt F4, but it's rare. (I get it often enough I'll complain on the review though.)\n\nThe house has alot of rooms locked (WIP stuff not added yet.) so I can't say for the finished state yet. It might be more balanced and fair if more rooms are involved (there's literally no reason to go upstairs currently. Nothing dangerous spawns up there aside from power outlets you can use to zap yourself, and there's no falling damage. There is a funny ♥♥♥♥♥ hidden in the bedroom though.) but it's hard to say. I know the next update adds ventilation shafts and more chores Daddy can do.\n\nSpeaking of the chores, they're not easy. Putting all toys away takes a good deal of time and by the time you're distracted doing that Baby often offs himself. Finding the smoke detector battery is iffy. Sometimes I swear it doesn't spawn at all, which might be a glitch. (Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough.) The next update adds more chores and daddy powers. Doing the chores gives you daddy powers like being able to see Baby through walls or see objects through walls, or be invisible to baby.\n\nNow for the main question, is it worth the 5 dollars? Honestly, yes. The game has serious potential to be amazing with more features which are coming soon.\n\n\nEDIT: It's been a long time since I came back, but here I am! This section was written after the outside update was released.\n\nThe game was expanded. Baby's crib was moved to the bedroom, then it was moved to the baby's room which was previously locked upstairs.\n\nNew rooms include a garage where you can blow yourself up with a car or set yourself on fire with gasoline, an office room upstairs, a shower upstairs with chemicals for baby to drink or burn in the shower, a laundry room with a washer and dryer for baby to die in, and an outside area with a pool.\n\nThey added weapons for the baby and daddy like a taser or a ball blaster, etc. You can now drop the toaster in water and get electrocuted, or blow up a fork in the microwave. New chores include cooking for the baby, washing him, etc.\n\nFamily Gathering mode was added, which allows 8 players. You now have achievements and can get hats for doing them.\n\n\nHowever, the game is now out of early access. They added music which many people have complained about, but I actually like the music just fine.\n\nI have one major issue. The game wasn't ready for release yet! With the newest update, the game is broken! After Baby kills himself, the game doesn't seem to recognize it. You're forced to spectate until time runs out, and Daddy basically wins by default after time runs out.\n\nAlso, some achievements are broken. I swear I've spent an entire match just playing with the piano and the achievement didn't pop.\n\nIs the game still worth the money? Maybe. But the developer needs to get his act together and fix these bugs! How did this pass playtesting? The "Game doesn't recognize Baby dying." bug literally happens every time, and it breaks the game! it's been a few days (At least 3) and the developer didn't release a hotfix or anything!\n\nIt shouldn't have left early access yet.\n\nBuy it if you want, but keep in mind in it's current state it still feels early access, and has game breaking bugs.","January 3","true","26.5"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","64","71","4","1"

I can't wait to see future updates, there are SO much things that can be added into this game, like going outside. I'm either garbage at the game, or that being the Father is hard to win. The baby can teleport through vents, taze their father, eat batteries quickly, and such, while the father can barely do anything. There should be a buff for the Dad.\n\nAT THE MOMENT (Feb. 1st 2016):\n\nPro's:\n-Online\n-Supports controller usage\n-Wide range of platforms (PC, Mac, etc)\n-Good concept, future updates can hold alot of potential\n-Time killer\n\nCon's:\n-Dad is useless (like I said, it could just be me. I only played for 10 minutes.)\n-Repetitive\n-Not much to do\n-Should add voicechat\n-No single player (should be able to verse bots)\n-If you have no friends, your screwed. Online people are not too fun to play with at times, and usually rage\n\nThere should be more settings as well, such as more houses, only outdoors, in the garage, etc.\n\nThe possibilites are endless. What I want are different gamemodes. Here are some I came up with:\n\n-Nightmode: Basically the same but it's night. There should be things removed and added for this mode\n-Co-op: 2 babies or 2 Dads working together\n-Store: Your baby is at the store, loose. There also should be stranger interaction. Careful Dad, might not want to foot the bill\n-Park: There should be other babies helping you, or maybe not...8)\n-Amusement Parks: Yes! Rollarcoasters, mini-games, more things to do, and easier to get lost at! *Imagine a baby in bumper cars*\n\nObviously, my modes aren't that creative and not that good, but just some ideas that could turn out well if used properly.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty good, espically since it's in it's early development state. This would probably be a 7/10 at the moment. Like I said before, future updates are probably going to be amazing! Can't wait to see what the developers have to offer!

Most of the time you are stuck waiting on the timer to say daddy wins.\n\nYou probably need 2+ parents just to win against a single baby if that baby is competent (which is a strange sentence to be typing, believe you me).\n\nNo access to menus of any sort in-game, incredibly limited information for daddy regarding baby unless you follow it like a hawk.\n\nI CANNOT recommend this game in its current form, unless you don't mind a very experimental and incredibly unbalanced release. Not to mention the fact that it rarely works properly.\n\nMy hope is that the dev continues to be responsive and polishes this up - it has potential!","May 14","false","1.8"," 77 of 100 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","77","100","5","0"

The game's concept is fairly simple, in which one player plays as a baby and tries to kill themself using a variety of household objects, while the other player controls a dad trying to protect the baby, providing a shockingly realistic portrayal of actual parenthood. There are a variety of ways for the baby to kill themself, like eating batteries or dropping a toaster in the sink, giving the game replayability by challenging yourself to kill yourself in creative ways. The dad gets various objects to try to protect the baby, like a tool to lock drawers and a baby grabbing handle to temporarily pick up the baby, and can also do chores around the house to get powerups like Dad Bod, which allows you to carry heavier things. The game is only in alpha right now, but the developer seems to be fairly diligent in adding regular updates that add new features and ways to die, and at five dollars per copy I think it's a pretty good game to get together with a friend and have a few hours of laughter.","January 23","true","1.0"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","41","44","6","1"

BUT as much as i would like this game, it has more bugs than the Goat simulator, is unballanced as hell, the father walks as fast as a grand grand granpa, the animations of the dad are simply not there at all...\n\nMinor bugs are no problem, but most of the time i can't walk after i wrote something in the ingame chat.\nAfter each game we had to pray that the replay button works... But sometimes was not pressable, or not there at all.\nMost certainly we just had to wait until the time was up, even while the baby was cooked and well done in the oven a long time ago.\n\nThe ballancing is a joke, because the baby wins always.... (except after he used the ingame chat und had to stay in place until mom came home). There are many ways to kill you instantly, or like the bathtube where the baby can start the water ever and ever until it dies.  And since you can't stop the baby from crawling wherever it wants, the pool is the best area to die for sure.\n\nSince the items are placed completely random (which is a good idea!) it isn't even possible to take the kid out of the pool with the holder.... or to find the antidot when it drank poison....\n\nHe walks so awfully slow, you can't even open 4 drawers, and the baby is in the next room smashing the table with a hammer (strong baby, huh?) and eating the glass... now you can't stop it from that, it's a goner.\n\nPlease fix the walking bugs first, the whole internet is filled of complainings.\nThen ballance it properly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDari/recommended/427730/","LegendDari","Legend-Dari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDari/","66 products in account","So, the game was good. If you're looking to get it, don't do it right now. The game is broken and its laggy- Basically incomplete. Hopefully this'll all be fixed soon, but until then, here's my opinion on the release of the game. (V1.3.0)\n\nAfter playing this update it makes me wonder if the developer lost interest in the game. Last month, he said he delayed the game so he doesn't push broken content, but then he suddenly comes out and releases the game with a whole bunch of bugs ranging from a broken Win/Lose System, Pink Screen when you're on Low Quality Shaders, Broken Mirrors, Game Crashes, and Clashing Music between the radio music and the regular music. The regular music is actually a bit annoying too. What is this? The Looney Toons? I was willing to wait for the developer to release the game mostly bug-free with some new content, even if it took a few months. I can't speak for the whole community, but I was willing to wait. I didn't want to end up playing the mess it is right now. Hopefully the developer hasn't lost interest or got tired or annoyed with us or gave up on this game, because it was going in the right direction--and now its going downhill. If the dev did lose interest, then he should put the previous update on a beta/testing branch, so we can just revert to what it was like before release, and just not do anything more unless it was to make things right again. I'm not being too angry about this, because this is the dev's game and he can do what he wants with it, but I don't think the community is liking the direction this game it going (or atleast I'm not liking it). I really hope I can come back to the game sometime and be able to enjoy again.

The videos on this game are more fun then actually playing it. I feel that being the dad is too hard, because the baby is versatile and can move like tiny ♥♥♥♥ing flash, and that the baby is too easy for the previous reason. This is still an Early Access game, so if you don't like it please don't return it because I'm sure alot of the unbalancing features will be fixed in future updates.","January 9","true","1.3"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","40","51","9","0"

Finally I had found one with Who's Your Daddy. While you can only be the father, I still feel like it gets the job done. However, I am very confused on why in a parent simulator you would need to simulate being the baby. I guess it just helps you get the feel being both sides. Man, being a parent is much harder than I thought, whenever I joined a multiplayer lobby, the baby somehow kills itself everytime. I would start doing some chores, and then it would somehow eletricute itself, as if it wanted to die... :/\n\nAfter playing this game, I realized something I am not meant to be a parent. Throughout my childhood, all I wanted to do was become a parent, but after playing this game, I realize how terrible of a parent I am.

You cannot deny that, and thankfully it IS labelled as an early access game. Saying that it isnt complete.\n\nFor the price tag of about 5$ CAD I literally can't reccomend this game enough. UNLESS the developers don't do anything with it. Great potential to be an even better game but this will only be possible with great developer support and many updates to come. Hopefully they don't get money hungry without doing anything and just leave the game as it is.\n\nPros:\n-Great 1v1 exerience\n-Short matches, good for small bursts of random fun\n-Background music is catchy, even for one song\n-Interesting concept\n\nCons:\n-It turns your computer into space heater, almost as much as Crysis 3 on max settings and gets really hot (which makes your fans spin like crazy)\n-Background music is catchy. There's one song.\n-Glitchy (its early access this is expected)\n\nSo to conclude, I think that the game is definetly worth ~5$ and the devs made it very reasonably priced which is great.\nWould buy again and recommend to all you readers out there!

The game is just broken. Playing online even with friends barely works, and every game ends in forcing the game to close and making it new again. For some reason if baby wins, you can only press space to spectate and no one can go to menu or do anything after.\n\nAlso for some reason, even if you put on passwords, I've had two games where people just joined anyway, and none of them were my friends. I have no idea how they managed to get in, but i assume its because the game is a buggy mess\n\nI mean from a gameplay perspective it's all right, but it's WAAAAAAAY too easy to win as the baby. There are SO many ways to die. To win as the dad you have to know every single nook and cranny before hand. The baby can teleport through vents for some reason too, which wasnt in game before. I have no idea why they made it even easier to kill yourself\n\nAs the dad, you can do chores to get power ups, but there is seriously no time to do it if your baby is even kind of trying to kill itself.\n\nbut the worst of it all is that the game just does not work. It's a completely buggy mess. I got it for 1.69 on humble, and I guess it was fun for an hour, but even with friends the constant crashes and freezes on everyone's side strains the fun.\n\nI mean hey if the game is free, try it out, but I wouldn't pay for a broken game at any price","May 15","false","1.0"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","44","61","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radshyguy/recommended/427730/","Radshyguy","Radshyguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radshyguy/","64 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only game where you counter a baby drowning its self in the toilet by constantly flushing it.\n\n\n\n\nAyy! It's who yo daddeh! You know that random game you found online because you were bored? Now it's (almost) finished! This review is done as of 2/27/16, so, they probably fixed a lot of problems I have with it... Don't yell at me, pls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros +\n\n- Tons of viriaty, baby can die in many different ways, shockwave, fork in outlet, drowning, cooking in oven, hypethermia, etc. Also, fun fact, if you can get in the freezer on the top of the fridge, you freeze like seven times faster! But, it's really freaking hard to get to.\n- Pretty balanced, actually. Daddy may be hard to learn, but once you know what to do, you can lockdown that baby. Then again, you have to plan a lot. You also have to keep track of the baby, feed him, give him pills, etc. The baby  can also use three fast travel vents, so it's hard to keep track of.\n- This is related to balancing, but, even when things seem bleak, you can still win! As baby in one game, it was like in the last minute of the match, and I thought I was going to lose. He put the hammer on top of the table, I knocked over a chair, climbed on top, grabbed the hammer, ran into the vent, smashed the table, ate the glass, and died.\n- Addicting. Not only is it addicting and fun, you can always make your own stupid challenges and win. As baby, I try not to die in the same way twice in a row.\n- Weapons(?) for some dumb fun, my favorite goes to the "Baby Disably".\n- Evil Box? This joke will make no sense when they patch that out.\n- Chat without cancer.\n\nIndifferent ~\n\n- Items are randomized, I put this here because while it DOES help, I have lost as Dad a few times because the Cabniet Locks were in a freaking miserable place.\n- Baby can use blocks to climb into... less than desired areas.\n- Repetitive music.\n- A certain easteregg.\n\nCons -\n\n- Whoever hosts the game is automaticailly Dad. This sucks because people ALWAYS QUIT AFTER ONE MATCH!! AGGHGHH!!!\n- Even though I lowered my shaders, playing as Baby (not Daddy) on other people's servers is REALLY laggy.\n- Dad powers are randomized (except the godly cook power, which is always set to when you cook food on the oven using the frying pan). Why is this bad? Shouldn't this be in indifferent? Well, all of them are good! EXCEPT, ONE! Dad-bod lets you pick up the very few objects you can't pick up. While this can help block doors and such, it's still rather easy to counter and so much worst than something like Peak-a-boo. You can't even pick up ALL objects, which is pretty lame.\n- Graphics aren't the best. Now, you should NEVER hate a game for graphics alone. Maybe if you can't deal with it, I understand. But hating a game alone on that is NOT okay. But, things like Daddy's crouch animation is lazy. Again, will probably be fixed when game is fully released, but, whatever.\n- Bugs, glitches, bugs, and MORE bugs. I know this game is early access, if they fix most of them, then ignore this lol. Also, I'm not talking about the glitch through map glitches and stuff, I'm talking about ones that ruin the expirience. Like, how if water isn't there in the first place (like with the bath), water WON'T spawn. Or how the cabniets DON'T OPEN PROPERLY in the Bathroom and you have to do some VERY percise crouching + grabbing through it. The gane's physics are awkward, I've ran into quite a few graphical errors, sometimes items (like the Baby Restrainy) just DON'T spawn. You get the point.\n\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY THIS NOT ON SALE: yes, if you want it. It's cheap-af. I could find the money for this on the streat. If it's on sale, than the deal is even better.\n\n\nOverall, game is good. They'll probably fix my problems when it's fully released, and (hopefully), they'll keep adding when the game is finished, and add more gamemodes or something.

One can not simply grasp how awesome it is, in less than 2 hours of play time.\n\nThere are so many creative ways to kill yourself, and all these cool tricks to help you be random and have fun.\n\nThere are also so many glitches that will wet your whistle when the standard gameplay bores you. Example: as the baby grab the piano, get on top of it, then  move and jump. You will legit fly. If you go under tables, you can make the table fly. I made table fly, 12/11 would play again.\n\nTable flying action is a much relief to when drinking bleach, drowning yourself, and electrifying yourself become a bore.\n\nThis game is also possibly the only situation when you would ever say "Oh crap, I drowned myself too quickly. Ahhh, I am not cooking in the oven.*\n\nThis game also tinkles the tastebuds of aspiring house husbands and masterchefs, with the addition of the cooking chore.\n\n12/10 recommend.","January 12","true","12.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","17","19","14","0"

It shows a lot of promise, but should still stay as early access.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm receiving complaints that somehow this is all on my end, when there are multiple reports of bugs and errors on the forums with people with setups like mine.

However with Who's Your Daddy, you switch places each round, playing as the baby or the daddy then vice versa. This way it helps to mix up the game play!\n\n♥ Playing this was so entertaining.\n\nDuring the short time that I played, it cracked me up to no end. I love how dark the game is yet how amusing it is at the same time. I appreciate games that know not to take themselves seriously. For sure a must play if you're having a bad day or want to have some silly fun with a friend.\n\n✘ The number one problem with this game is my motion sickness.\n\nWhen I played with my friend, I felt horrendously sick and have been unable to play it again. This is far from the dev team's fault however I thought to include it in my review for others who suffer from motion sickness. If you do, be warned that this game may be hard on you.\n\n✘ The graphics could be better.\n\nIt doesn't matter that much to me - it's a game to have fun in, not a game to be impressed by the graphics, or spend time staring at how realistic the floor looks. I do think that the baby looks terribly creepy...I'll let him get into the cleaner, LOL. Of course I'm not serious about that.\n\n✘ It isn't a game to play with your friend if you aren't going to use your mics.\n\nI played this game while skyping with my friend. If you were going to spend time texting/messaging, there would be no way - you either play the game or chat! By using your mics, you can still chat and have fun.\n\nOverall I absolutely suggest this game for people looking for fun co-op/multiplayer games!!","May 27","true","0.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

You either play as the dad or play as the tiny baby. The dad's gotta stop the baby from killing itself in the most painful and/or stupidest ways there is. The baby...You just gotta kill yourself.\n\nWell, this game is quite fun. It's quite glitchy, and you're almost guaranteed to face a glitch on the first 10 minutes of gampeplay. Nothing game breaking so far, but quite a few odd things that make the dad look like a monster, for example. Sadly, this game gets old rather quick, specially if you play with pubs. But if you play with friends during a voice chat, it's pretty amazing.\n\nBut I can't play this game though! There's a part of me who suffers each time something happens to the tiny, tiny cute (And creepy) baby! Seriously, I hate to see such a small infant green thanks to drinking all kinds of chemicals, or charred thanks to setting itself on fire. I hate the way it screams, it breaks my heart. Stupid motherly instinct.\n\nI'd recommend getting this on a sale, I mean, I doubt it's going to entertain you for long. It's just a cool novelty toy that gets old rather fast.","March 13","true","1.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Update after update, the game has progressively become worse update after update.  For an early access game, bugs are tolerable. But as an official release? No, just no.\n\nThere are a lot of issues with movement. I am constantly clipping through walls and getting stuck inside things.\nAnimations aren not even finished. When the dad crouches, all he does is have half of his body move downwards, clipping through the other half of his body. A lot of the bugs are gamebreaking too. I tried playing with a friend and if we wanted to play a game together, we had to restart the game and make another lobby. A lot of objects need a reseign, especially the shape of the house. The model of the house is very unnatural looking and looks like it was made from a young child. The outside of the house is empty and needs more "outdoor stuff" to make it look better. Something like a variety of plants and objects that a middle class family would have in their backyard like a slide or sandbox.\n\nBut despite the game being broken, there are a lot of cool mechanics that make this game very fun. Stuff such as\nthe microwave is fully functional and putting metal objects inside it causes an explosion or plugging a toaster and putting it into water to electrocute a baby.\n\nTheHumanIdiot, I love the idea of your game, but please address these issues.\n\n","May 14","false","2.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

It was a huge disappointment even when it was out. It didn't add as much as either me or my best friend were expecting, and it's super buggy.

At this point you can play with your friends for 30 minutes before it gets boring. With basically more than half the map "locked" and extremely glitchy the game looks like it was pushed out for the Chrismas season just to see how many people would buy it for the lols. If you want to burn 5 bucks for some laughs, go ahead. This concept is AMAZING, yet the execution at this point is pretty terrible. At once point while playing the baby my view was locked straight forward, so I could no longer turn at all, making the game impossible.\n\nThis game needs more work. If the devs keep working this has the potential of being a fantastic game, however, it is so early access it hurts.

The feeling, indescribable. I have concluded that there is absolutely no better game than "Who's Your Daddy" in the whole of human history. I had bee searching for the best game for many years but could never find something deserving of that title; this was gifted to me by a friend. I put on my Fedora and combed my beard in anticipation as I booted up the game and when the title screen appeared I came buckets. The Graphics are real-life-tier and the story motives are better written than Shakespeare's Hamlet and Homer's Odyssey combined. The gameplay mirrors exactly what being a father is all about. I wept pure hot tears. This game made me abandon Atheism, for when I played it, I was convinced that there was a god. Pure Euphoria rushed through my veins as I drank bleach and stuck forks in electrical sockets. I quit my job, left my wife, and abandoned my kids to play this game non-stop. Even in the event that my house catches on fire or I collapse of a heart attack,  the cure for cancer is found, civilization collapses, Jesus returns to the earth, the eventual heat-death of the universe occurs, etc, nothing could convince me to stop playing this game.\nEvery once in a while you get the chance to play a game that sets the bar for everything else. This game will forever be the one by which all others are measured. I've considered on several occasions cryogenically freezing myself, because absolutely nothing else in this modern world could possibly top the experience I had while playing what will come to be known as the ultimate masterpiece of human intelligence. I am 100% fully convinced that I can say with absolute certainty that this is the peak of everything in human history and that everything else you will ever do will only be a complete and utter disappointment in comparison.","December 23, 2015","true","2.2"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","57","17","30","24","1"

Now There is more stuff due to the game going out of early acess so now its a bit better because there is a outside area.\n\nGraphics: As far as the unity engine goes it doesn't look too bad ,but not good ever because the babies eyes look so creepy and the models for the dad and baby are under detailed.\nNow they added an outside area which is good.\n\nSound: The sound isn't too bad and some of the footstep sounds are delayed to. Now there is new music so now its gone from horrible to a bit less horrible.\n\nCommunity: I can't talk about this cause there is no community because there is hardly anyone. Your even lucky to find a non laggy match.\n\nAnimations: The animations for the baby and daddy is crap because it looks like the dad is a toy robot or something and the baby crawls like a baby that is constipated.\n\nScore:\nGameplay: 4.5/10\nSound: 4/10\nCommunity: 1/10\nAnimations 2/10\nGraphics 6/10\nOverall: 3/10\nWho's Your Daddy I know you were in early acess ,but now I think you should step up and make this game good","May 14","false","2.2"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","20","36","2","0"

One could say babies capabilities to kill itself is OP. Sometimes it's true, sometimes not.\n\nReview: The game is 1v1, Online-only Dad Vs Suicidal Baby. Items randomly position themselves everytime in select locations that are meant for the dad, or for the baby. Things ranging from a Padlock for the dad to lock cupboards so the baby has harder time accessing poison and dangerous objects, but also things like the Baby Key which can unlock the cupboards if found and used. Other items may range from Fruit, or meat in the fridge which can heal the baby if 'wounded'.\n\nThe point is to keep your baby alive obviously, or to die if you're the baby, it's fun whether with a stranger or with a friend.\n\nI make Let's Plays in my spare time and I've currently made 3 videos. The first is my first experience with the game and the troubles of settling in. The 2nd was me showing off my 'Skill as the Dad' and the 3rd and most recent at the time of writing this was me being the most miserable little ♥♥♥♥ as possible as a baby. A link to the gameplay videos will be below for those who wish to help me and view gameplay to learn the ins and outs of the game! :>\n\nMy only wish is that the game of course, continues to be updated, not only will there be new rooms in the future and fixes to the game already, but I hope later from there we'll receive different areas like Outside, a Park, a backyard, or a new house layout to continue expanding the game. :D\n\nMy only Cons about the game is that after 1-3 hours, you may already be done the game. I don't see this being a Long-term issue though as long as new layouts, levels, obtsacles and items continue being made though. I'd love to see more ideas/games like this in the future to appease my sadistic nature :>\n\nLink to the playlist of my videos/review/gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYi1nszpvIA&list=PLROcDxcjtMQyWAr8FtbNTiGSt9feJDOPn","January 13","true","13.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","12","21","6","0"

In order to do so he must stop his suicidal baby (gender unknown) from killing itself. His journey is that of true hardship. He must keep his dimented baby from killing itself until 4:00 PM, which is when Mom comes home. We know nothing about Mom, but we can assume that she is the mastermind behind this entire scenario.\n\nCharacter 2: Baby\nBaby's goal is to destroy itself by any means necesary. Any household appliance is just a new way for Baby to kill itself. However, Daddy is going to be howling over him like a police officer howls over an African American male walking down the street. There's a time limit. Mom comes home at 4:00 PM, so Baby must kill itself before that time using anything it can.\n\ntl; dr:\nIf you're Daddy, protect the Baby.\nIf you're Baby, ♥♥♥♥ing KILL YOURSELF.\n\nOverall I give this game 4:00 PM/10 would light babies on fire again.","May 16","true","2.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","15","27","15","0"

It's SO fun.\nOkay, here we go.\nWho's Your Daddy is a game where you either take the role of a father or son. The son tries to kill himself in many different horribly scarring ways. The father tries to stop him. One of the problems I have with it, though, is that the game is biased WAY towards the baby. The dad can just get lucky, and he can't go through vents or anything. The baby has so many different ways to kill himself, and the only way he can really be stopped is by getting really lucky and trapping him until 4:00 rolls around.\nI really shouldn't care, it's a game about a suicidal infant who can douse himself in gasoline and light himself on fire.\nBut still, there are some issues with that.

Do I reccomend it? For $4.99? Sure! It's really not much, but that's also with the expectation of more content to come. If this game ceased production right now and stayed exactly the same, it would only be a game with about 20 minutes worth of content.\n\nThis is a great game idea with terrible character animations, buggy controls and a ridiculous premise. The game does support split screen controller gameplay, however, so if you're just looking for some entertainment with some friends for the price of a large coffee then go for it! Don't expect to want to put 20 hours into it or anything.

The game is goofy and funny, and so are the graphics. They are your average mediocre (did I misspell that? :P) game graphics, but in this game, they are fine. The baby looks like a idiot. PERFECT. 8.5/10\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe real point of any game, the gameplay.  It is...strange, but it is really fun. The fact 0.9.5 introduced like 5 new rooms and new items is AWESOME, as well as the relocation of the baby, so the dad can't clearly see the baby immediately. Yes, he can use the baby cam by turning on the TV, but it is not as clear as how it used to be at seeing the baby from the start. However, the baby is never at an advantage from the start: there are many items the father can use to protect the baby. By far my favorite death, though....it MUST be the exploding toaster. Look it up :P. 9.3/10\n\nThe Price\nFive bucks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYUS10/10\n\nThe Story\n\nWhile it doesen't matter much, you are a clueless father who is trying to protect your kid. 9.5/10 for realism.\n\nThe Freak-ing GLITCHES\n\nAGH! This is the only problem with the game. Tons of things are glitched, and otehrs are just broken. I'm sorry...5.5/10\n\nThe OTHER\n\nThat's really it.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nA really great game, but it is so glitchy.

It is very fun but i think it needs to have an update that fixes the bugs and incomplete parts of the game. Also you can only spectate as the baby when you die, and i thought it was with family gathering but i think it happened with original. You can't escape either as dad when the baby dies. When i joined  a server it would stay on the wierd thing showing the rooms and i couldn't press escape.\n\nSo my overall review for this is= It's a great game but it needs to be fixed, I love the graphics because that makes the game what it is, and if the developer fixed them, then it wouldnt be as funny. Please fix this game, though. But i'm not going to rush the dev because he's just released the full game and i imagine that was rushed, Thankyou for reading this.","May 16","true","11.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Well I guess I'll say that there is a certain thing about this game that makes me want to play it, probably all the stuff that you can discover or the fact that it's fun (I do not play this game because I like to kill babies). It's good if you find a stranger to play the game but it's better with friends because you actually get to discover the map, find glitches and discover new ways to die. Though it isn't a game for everyone especially people who find certain things inappropriate (like the strange object you can find upstairs) I think 5 dollars is a reasonable amount for the amount of replayability and the updates adding new things. 8 and a half out of 10. One last thing to add is that it is quite a buggy game so if you prefer games that have minimal bugs you better steer clear for now\nEDIT: I explored around a bit and right now I'd say that you should wait for a bug fix before buying.","May 13","true","14.0"," 43 of 83 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","43","83","13","2"

I'd wait to play it unless you can find friends to play a private match with.  And right now, the baby can't win even when it successfullly kills itself.  Maybe not ready to be called a full fledged game yet, but it's getting there and judging from the people I've seen play the earlier versions on youtube, this is gonna be a BLAST when it is finished.  Patience for now my friends.

The game is dad vs. baby and it's as rediculous as it sounds, the game looks like a colerful peice of plastic, but if you ignore that the game is extremly fun. plus it's in early alpha so most of the bad things like the graphics will hopefully be changed although the baby looks ♥♥♥♥ing halarious.

Both sides have an equal chance of winning, as the dad has to be smart while the baby has to be quick.\n\nThe items can definetely spice things up, as the taser can give you that competetive edge while the baby key really helps if your opponent is really quick and locking everything up.\n\nI've played a few rounds with someone I met on this game and it's quite fun, because even an experienced player such as myself can slip up, and then it's game over baby (pun intended)\n\nAs of now 9.5 out of 10, just because it still feels like it needs a bit more.","January 27","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the models of the dad and the baby are nightmare inducing: lifeless animations, creepy faces and an exorcist-like crouching movement for the dad make you wonder if it was all intentional just to make the game more fun. If that was the developer's intention, he succeeded.\n\nGAMEPLAYRight now there are only one map and game mode. There are two players: a baby who's trying to kill himself, and his dad who must keep that from happening. As the baby, you have a moltitude of ways to suicide: drowning in the bathtub, drinking bleach to poison yourself, putting a fork in an electricity socket, cooking yourself in the oven... As the dad, you can pick up the object the kid is carrying, give him food and pills to heal him, use items to lock cabinets... There are many possibilities for both characters, and the randomly generated position of the objects makes every round fun and entertaining. However, the lack of variety starts to settle in after 30 minutes of playtime.\n\nCHALLENGEIt all depends on the players: a good baby knows the fastest ways to die, and a good dad knows which objects to use and what to do to avoid your son's death.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are pretty standard, but the music is really, REALLY annoying, with the same cheerful tune going on an endless loop for the entire time!!\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe short lenght of rounds and different ways to die will make you play "one more round" many times. Plus, more rooms and characters will be added in the final release.\n\nOverall, this is a fun little multiplayer game that can also be played locally. The concept is interesting and the execution is fairly good (even though a bit unpolished on the technical side). Plus, you will see a baby die. What more could you want?\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 6.5\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 5\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 24","true","2.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

Do I reccomend this game?\nHonestly, yes.\n\nWell, first of all it's a $5.00 game, and it's not finished yet, so sure it may have bad graphics (although I like them) and sure there are some stuff wrong with it, but for $5 and knowing the fact its going to be updated and probably fixed, this game is pretty cool.\n\nYou play as the dad or the baby. The baby's job is to kill itself in many different ways around the house. There are going to be different gamemodes so that's not necessarily all you have to do.\nThe dads job is to stop the baby from killing itself until 4 PM when the mom gets home.\nThere is many different ways in which you could kill yourself as a baby! Some are easy and require one step. (i.e drinking bleach, eating soap bar, etc.) and some require a couple of steps. (Grab a hammer, break the table/windows and eat the glass, grab a fork or a knife and put it in the outlet, etc)\nAnother thing I like about this is....\nthe fact that you can stab your dad, use a laser to make him blind and tazer him. 10/10\nBut seriously, I do recommend this game if you like goat simulator or just plain fun and funny multiplayer games!","January 23","true","17.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is... interesting, to say the least.\n\n\nPROs -\nYou get to say 'Who's your daddy?!' over and over to your partner / child.\nTwo characters to play as - the baby and the daddy.\nTwo ways to play - be a daddy with a big family, or a daddy with but one baby.\nDaddy is strong, and can pick up chairs and stuff, to keep the baby from dying.\nA full house, for the baby to play in.\nThe ability to moniter the baby's health, in case they drink window cleaner, or eat batteries.\nReplay-ability.

I find it more fun trying to find ways to kill myself as the baby but trying to save the baby is really fun and funny too. The only problem I could find was most likely from my connection but it took awhile to find a game that I could join but when I did I had so many laughs trying to kill myself and trying to save the baby. Overall I really reconmend this game is you're looking to have a good time playing with a friend or with someone randomly on a public server. If you're looking for a serious game or to have a serious multiplayer stratigie game you're not going to find it here. At times it can be easy to lose the baby and then the baby dies without you having a chance if the baby knows how to sneak pass the Dad like going through the air vents. I feel like this game might be forgoten over time but who knows.

However, this game gets boring fast because most of the players on this game are absolutely (and I cannot stress this enough), absolutely horrible at playing video games. They are beyond the point of incompetent! It is as though they themselves are the age of the baby and do not understand what they are even looking at. When the baby (me in this case) turns on the burner or turns on the water, you simply turn it off. Apparently, that is incorrect and the best thing to do is run for pills are do other unpredictable acts instead of stopping the death of the baby. I mean really... REALLY, they literally let me, as the baby, run around with a knife, stab them and grab a hammer and smash stuff without an effort to stop me. And you have to love it when they just immeadiately run to pick up all the toys and cleaning products first instead of all of the dangerous forks and knives... Nor do they look for the locks, which, in most cases, are out in plain sight, to prevent me from getting to the more serious stuff. I guess they did not care about their baby enough to prevent it from dying from a SINGLE battery. I do not even have to try to win as the baby most of the time. And by most, I mean about 95-98% of the games I played.\nThat alone was just me being the baby and them being the father. It is far worse when they are the baby because it takes much longer to end. They hide without poisoning themselves, half the time, they do not go through the vents, only hunt for the ball shooter, and drink and eat what left over chemicals they have left after randomly doing nothing and me having locked and cleaned everything.\nDon't get me wrong though, this is an incredible game and that is why I am recommending it but, the only way this will be fun is with friends and those rare few experts that play here and then. Other than that, you will get absolutely horrible players with horrible internet that let you kill yourself or, as the baby,  sit around like an actual baby does. At least they make the game more realistic...","January 13","true","44.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is... interesting, to say the least.\n\n\nPROs -\nYou get to say 'Who's your daddy?!' over and over to your partner / child.\nTwo characters to play as - the baby and the daddy.\nTwo ways to play - be a daddy with a big family, or a daddy with but one baby.\nDaddy is strong, and can pick up chairs and stuff, to keep the baby from dying.\nA full house, for the baby to play in.\nThe ability to moniter the baby's health, in case they drink window cleaner, or eat batteries.\nReplay-ability. It's set in stone that one day I will return to this game and have some more daddy / baby action.\nMany ways for the baby to die, and many ways for daddy to stop it from happening.\nLoads of items, for both baby and daddy to use to their advantage\nRandom places for things to spawn - you cannot memorise the map, because sometimes items move from one place to another.\n\nCONs -\nThere is an object named 'Strange Rubber Object'. 'Nuff said.\nDaddy's crouch position just puts his torso inside his legs, and makes him smaller.\nDaddy cannot taser the baby???!!11\nOnly one house, and only one daddy ;)))))\n\n\n\nI can imagine the game will get even better after it fully releases, but so far, I r8 8/8 m8.","April 3","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Do I reccomend this game?\nHonestly, yes.\n\nWell, first of all it's a $5.00 game, and it's not finished yet, so sure it may have bad graphics (although I like them) and sure there are some stuff wrong with it, but for $5 and knowing the fact its going to be updated and probably fixed, this game is pretty cool.\n\nYou play as the dad or the baby. The baby's job is to kill itself in many different ways around the house. There are going to be different gamemodes so that's not necessarily all you have to do.\nThe dads job is to stop the baby from killing itself until 4 PM when the mom gets home.\nThere is many different ways in which you could kill yourself as a baby! Some are easy and require one step. (i.e drinking bleach, eating soap bar, etc.) and some require a couple of steps. (Grab a hammer, break the table/windows and eat the glass, grab a fork or a knife and put it in the outlet, etc)\nAnother thing I like about this is....\nthe fact that you can stab your dad, use a laser to make him blind and tazer him. 10/10\nBut seriously, I do recommend this game if you like goat simulator or just plain fun and funny multiplayer games!","January 23","true","17.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can't play normally and expect to have a good time unless your settings are turned down and your the baby.\n\nAnd now ya'll have made it run even worse than it was adding more music to it.

The baby won (obviously, since the balance of the game is way off in my opinion, but that's not really a complaint of mine), and we found that there were no options given once the baby won beyond entering spectator mode. Once in spectator mode, the menu could not be entered, and the only way to do anything with the game was exiting.\nAdditionally, if one waits long enough, the Daddy will actually win, as time keeps going until 4'o'clock.\n\nNumerous physics issues, particularly once you pick up the pool skimmer. That thing knocks furniture everywhere, including dozens of feet into the sky and over the fence. Which is arguably one of the more fun parts of the update, but it does cause a number of issues (such as babies getting stuck behind furniture, and not in a baby-proof way).\nAnother worth mentioning is the vent in the achievement room causes one to be stuck in the shower head/wall/wherever you come from.\n\nAll that said, the new things added in the full release are preeeetty sweet. The yard, the pool, the achievement room and its vent, all dope. I still love this game, I just don't consider it complete yet.","May 14","false","5.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Conceptually, it is hilarious. It is really easy to be drawn into the competitiveness of trying to kill your baby self in the most hilarious way possible, or trying to stop your babies from dying. Personally, I think Family Gathering mode is best. The more players, the better, in my opinion. It makes the game more competitive and a lot more fun. Unfortunately, as of right now, Family Gathering has come with the most bugs for me and my gamer circle of friends. But hopefully these will soon be resolved, but keep the bugs in mind when deciding whether the game is worth the $5.00.\n\nI think the game can lose its replay value rather quickly. There are a limited number of ways for the baby to die, and it becomes relatively predictable. There are only a few randomly generated items on the map (things that disably the baby). I think this could be fixed if the developers eventually were able to create multiple maps.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is entertaining. In the purest of ways, it is fun to play, and that should be the ultimate goal for all games. So, yeah it's a little buggy and it is still in the works, but I think this game is worth it.","May 21","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But they've overfilled the game with unneeded updates that make the game more and more unfair, just so that youtubers will be attacked by their fans to explore the "completely unique and fun additions" added in the "update", in a desperate attempt to keep the game alive, so that it doesn't fall behind in the rat-race like so many others.\n\nThe gameplay is so heavily weighed in the babys favour that playing as the dad sometimes just isn't even worth it. Want to hide the dangerous chemicals that can kill your baby up on a shelf? where the baby can't reach? Too bad! With the addition of the vents, the baby can teleport through the map, onto the shelf like he's goku or something. I wish that they just focused on bugfixes and minor additions to the game that don't make youtubers have to resort to things like roleplaying in their videos to make the video slightly entertaining.

Very rough and glitchy (Adds to comedic effect, I suppose?)\n\n3. Only a few ways for the player to die, with putting something in a socket being the easiest. It gets very repetitive very fast.\n\n4. No Steam integration. Meaning you can't see who you play with, if you happened to like them. Completely and utterly anonymous.\n\nIf it was $.50, then maybe it'd be worth it. It's not BAD game, but even with a friend on voice chat the game was boring after 2 or 3 rounds (about 5 minutes.) Seriously wouldn't recommend for $5\n\nEdit: I don't know why this review is so poorly recieved. The game is fun for a little bit but it's so heavily weighed in the baby's favor it's not fun. By the time you can almost finish taking one preventive measure, the baby is already dying or dead.\n\nExample: Game starts, I immediately start covering wall sockets with protective covers. I *almost finish* the living room. The baby finds a fork from somewhere and jabs it into a socket somewhere else I didn't have time to get to. Dies instantly.\n\nUnless the baby is idling, you don't really have time to do much.","February 7","false","1.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","2"

When he came back, he had severe ptsd, and he is always in a flashback. After a night of drinking, Tyrone wanted to escape zimbabwe and head to Egypt instead.

I know this game will probably improve gameplay-wise over time, but this for people who are considering buying it RIGHT NOW.)\n\nIt may be my lack of game time, but I feel like this is just not worth the money at all. This game is simply a novelty, and that's it. It's not worth 5 dollars at all. Maybe for a dollar I could like this game, but for 5? Anyway, let me explain why I just didn't find this game all that appealing.\n\nAs you can see, I have very little game time for this game. Want to know why? Because I experienced everything this game had to offer in less than this time. I even found the strategy for beating the baby as the dad. Yeah, it was that quick. (the strategy btw is literally just get the child locks and lock everything down then remove all stepping stools then hide the cleaning stuff in the closet and find the key ((which isn't hard to find)) and just watch the child. All he can do is stick something in the outlet, and just either take the knife everytime he gets it or plug up all the circuits. Boom, you win everytime)\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game is funny. Really funny. For the first 3 times. After that, you've pretty much experienced everything that is "humorous" with the game. And most of the humor comes from the terrible Unity graphics and awful animations. After you've done all this, it gets really repetitive and boring quick.\n\nOverall, I'd only get this game if it's on sale for really cheap. Other than that, just save your money and get a decent meal with it. You'll have a way better time that way. If you got it for a dollar, and you have a friend who plays it, it can be fun if you're drunk and just feel like doing stupid stuff for a couple hours. But if you're sober and have no friends to play with, or even if you do have friends to play with, it gets really boring fast. Once the game develops and more rooms/features are added (random spawns of bleach would be nice instead of cleaning supplies spawning in the same spots), I'll consider picking it up again.","January 21","false","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"
