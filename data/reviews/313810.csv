These sort of kid like platforming games is what pc honestly needs.\n\n+ Great graphical update from the original\n\n+ Combat is great among most hack & slash games, its pretty solid on all levels\n\n+ Platforming is fun and brings you back to when platformers weren't only 2d indie hardcore platformers\n\n+ The sound is a huge bump up in quality, although I did experience a few very minor odd sound placements but I won't detract any points from it\n\n+ Runs great on a 1080p monitor and at 60 fps, so all the resolution problems people are talking about are foreign to me\n\n+ Beautiful levels\n\n+/- Quests are what you'd expect from games like this, fetch whatever to do whatever or activate some thing, personally I had never thought of this as a problem but you be the judge\n\n+/- Voice acting in my opinion is great for me, its the original voices (I believe) and sure while the protraying of the emotion is laughable its far from being unbearable nor does it detract from the feeling of the game at all\n\n+/- The camera needs a bit of work since it feels like its pointing more so to the ground, not really giving you the control of having a full 360 view of the world, so seeing whats ahead of you is a bit of a mystery until it hits you like a boar. Pretty sure this was the same problem with the original so I don't hugely mind but if this can be addressed i'd say it'd be pretty welcome.\n\n+/- This is my own personal gripe on two points, unskipable dialouge and the UI. With the original dialouge you could just skip past boring tutorials an other small quick conversations. The original UI, while not styleized in its sort of Chinese style with paintbrushed texts and scrolls and whatnot it feels too bare. The way it was in the original was even more akin to a Chinese style with having a Jade stone background where the health and items were so i'm not sure why they changed it\nhttp://s.pro-gmedia.com/videogamer/media/images/ps2/legend_of_kay/screens/legend_of_kay_30.jpg\n\nQuick comment about the weapons and armor if anyone is curious and hasn't ever played this, you can get 3 types of weapons with around 2 upgrades each (If I remember right) if you exclude the base weapon which changes the apperance quite a bit and of course the damage outputs. The 3 main types are the sword, claws and the hammer. There are also 3 different types of armor, Jade, Red colored armor and cool looking black armor.\n\nThis game is in every way a must buy if you want to relieve your past of 3d platforming, I don't wholey remember how long it took me to beat the game, since as a kid I had the IQ level of a bug, but i'd say its safe to assume you'd clock in at least around 7 hours, give or take. It all entirely depends how fast you rush through but this game should honestly be taken at a steady pace, it just feels so good to play it.\n\nEdit: Looking at my current time this game will probably take you longer than 7 hours to beat\nThey also say b*stard twice for an E rated game, if I was a kid I would feel so edgy right now","July 28, 2015","true","17.4"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","33","35","5","0"

Now, we have a new chance to enjoy this game, here, in steam. This title could never compete with the Ratchets and the Jaks of its era, but it's still a very solid game.\n\nThe platforming is very fluid, the combat is challenging and fun at the same time. Of course, we have a lot of other things to do, like unlock extras, races, exploration... a bit of everything, just like games were back in the day.\n\nIt is also a funny game, as you are a cat and you fight using martial arts and several weapons (swords, hammers...). Also, you can't swim for a long time, your enemies are the rats and your friends are communist pandas.\n\nThis anniversary version is perfect. HD textures and models, a great optimization, 1080P and 60 fps no scope. Shout-out to the OST, it has some great tracks too.\n\nThe only downside is the voice acting. It could be better, yes, but doesn't really matter for a game of this kind.\n\nA cult classic. Now in Steam. You like platforms?

I think it is honestly worth a look if you are a fan of the action platforming genre, but it does little more than bring a somewhat unpolished entry into the steam library. "Unpolished?" Yes, there are fetch quests in abundance with multiple legs of "find x item" that distract from the main quest.\n\nThe combat is engaging and elegant, but beware: complex combos that lock you into a string of animations that you cannot cancel out of. Combos are hard to do even on a controller, mainly because if you are not swift as almost an immediate press, you will be locked into a different combo than what you were attempting.\n\nThe cutscenes are fully voiceacted, as well as the supporting cast and NPCS. This is a good and bad thing as the voice acting is hit or miss. I personally did not mind it, but my tolerance level is that I can watch some, not all, anime in english dub. Yup, so I don't think I'm a good judge at this category. Another thing that comes up is that cutscenes are inconsistent: some are skippable some are not.\n\nSound design is pleasing, but there are no intros or fades. Still, I would recommend this game for any fans of the genre despite its shortcomings. One final criticism: the only graphical option you have on PC is brightness. No resolution, no scaling of textures, nothing. Just gamma.","July 27, 2015","true","5.3"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","19","30","2","0"

Yes, the voice acting is bad, but it doesn't interrupt the fun parts of the game. This game takes a new spin on combat through its use of the three weapons and offering the player enough choices to conquer each fight.\n\nThe only upsetting aspect of this game was its difficult camera controls. Some times you will have to back away from the action in order to move the camera into the correct position or else run the risk of getting hit. Often, the game tells you where the enemies are, but it would've been nice to see what they were doing as well.\n\nOverall, the combat aspects of this game are incredibly unique and refreshing compared to most hack-and-slash games. I highly enjoyed the challenge of Nightmare difficulty, and I hope that Kaiko develops more games like Legend of Kay.","July 30, 2015","true","23.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

While this remake will appeal mostly to the people who have played it before, if you're a fan of 3D Adventure Platformers then I recommend you give it a try\n\nIt's been done really nicely, it controls well and is identical to the original. My only complaints are the camera, cutscenes and the voice acting; all are a bit janky at times. Unfortunately there are no graphical options but it does run at the same resolution as your monitor, in full screen and very smoothly. Try not to tab out, it doesn't like this.\n\nCutscenes seem to be out of time to the voice acting but matches perfectly in-game, just a warning.\n\nOverall I recommend you give it a try, especially if you've played it before. There aren't enough 3D Platormers that take me back to the days of Sly and Ratchet and Clank. There's nothing quite like replaying a great old game you thought everyone had forgotten about.

The game progresses linearly in levels of zones, and has many puzzles, most of which are optional.\n\nThe game was originally relased for the Playstation 2 in 2005 and is based on the artstyle of 3D JRPGs at the time, (but its not really that weeby).\n\nThe games strong points:\n+ Superbly optimised\n+ Updated graphics\n+ Audio touchups (Removal of compression static, but not an overhaul)\n+ Very good PC controls\n+ At least 8 hours of well structured, rewarding gameplay\n+ If you've seen a cutscene before, you can skip it\n+ Steam Achievements\n+ Newly added difficulty levels\n+ Taught 8 year old me 12+ games could have strong swear words\n+ No frame rate Cap\n\nThe games weak points:\n- It's been highly touched up, but this is exactly wat it says it is, an Anniversary Edition, not a complete remaster.\n- The voice acting is the same, it was quite low budget, but its ok\n- Unskipable Self dialogue eg. THIS DOORS LOCKED, I NEED A KEY TO OPEN THIS DOOR\n- No lip syncing, just mouth animations\n- Gorillas\n- AI is a little exploitable, but its good it you dont try to\n- Furrys\n\nOverall, I'd give the game 8/10, it's not a complete from-the-ground-up overhaul, it's an Anniversary Touch-Up with higher mesh & texture quality, lighting quality is improved, but not to everbody's likings.

With that being said, this game has an endearing storyline about liberty and over reaching government, a story that is valid in any era. This game say's never give up liberty for safety, an idea that Barak Obama could learn from.

The visuals and audio do not match up if you leave the game on screen, with fragmented audio following the comic book style. You only get fluent audio in the cutscenes if you minimize the game to your task tray, forcing the game to catch back up after you open the game again. Not to mention that at the end of the cut scene, your game will crash, which forces you back to your last save point to have to try to get through it again. Yes there's an option in the scarce options menu to get rid of the cut scenes, but for those of us interested in the story, those character interactions are important. I'm sorry to say that while I loved Kay on the PS2, this doesn't hold up to the quality of even that system, much less a PC.","July 31, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","0"

Super fun game, just don't expect Nolan North-tier voice acting.\n\nIn terms of graphics, looks great for the PS2 game improved for the PC. I'm playing with a PS4 controller and it really makes it that much better.\n\nIn the end, fun game all around.

The gameplay is really fun and entertaining, the story is interesting even though the voice acting is pretty weak. It will never compare to big action platformers like Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Daxter but it's really good to play a good action after such a long time. It might not the best game out there but if you're looking for fun I recommend this game.","April 26","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
