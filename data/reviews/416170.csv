There's the framework of a half decent game here, yes, but when you actually take the time to play it you're sent off to a world of outright frustration.\n\nHotLead is a buggy, nigh unplayable mess which in a matter of 20 minutes took me from mild-mannered bloke killing a Friday evening alone to a burning ball of outright anger. Enemies glitching through walls, foes sticking to your feet in a tango of death, and a 'slide' which straight up doesn't work half the time are just some of the fun activities you can expect when playing HotLead.\n\nIt should also be noted that the trailer and screenshots have been expertly taken in a way which belies the game beneath. Do not take HotLead at face value. Instead, view HotLead as an example of why quality control and the art of making a game that works should be praised a great deal more than they currently are.","November 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 170 of 183 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","170","183","12","4"

Well...\nFirstly, the control system is *extremely* finicky, particularly the wall-running mechanic. Sometimes it would work okay, the majority of the time my character randomly jumped and flipped around the screen like a dying flippy thing. I haven't even been able to get past the very beginning of the game as a result. I'm not the worlds best gamer by any means, but I'd rather fail at a game because I'm rubbish, not because it is broken.\nSecondly, as has been pointed out before, due to some wierd clipping errors, enemies can shoot at you through 'solid' walls, sometimes, and also wierdly, doors above or below your level open because they think you are near them. Again, being killed because I'm rubbish I can live with. being killed because the game basically cheats, on the other hand...\nGraphics-wise, it's okay, nothing amazing, but they serve their purpose. I've seen worse. if I was able to get further into the game I'd probably be able to comment better. However, I haven't experienced frame rate drops, and no crashed to desktopn either and/or freezes, so at least that's something.\nOn the plus side, the developers are at least trying to engage with the community in fixing the bugs, and acknowledge that it is broken and are trying to fix it, which is better than some AAA companies I could mention. Unfortunately, the buggy, glitchy mess I experienced isn't the sort of thing that can be fixed by patches. Nothing short of a total rebuild from the ground up would resolve this. Which is a shame, as it has potential. Somewhere under there, there is a nice concept, but buried beneath the glitch controls and other issues I have experienced, I really cannot recommend this. if you have 79p burning a hole in your wallet, buy a chocolate bar, it will bring much more joy, and will probably last longer as well.","April 6","false","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unless it's an early access sort of thing. In which case I HOPE it gets patched together enough to resemble a game. I wouldn't mind the graphic glitches that contort the player's model in some... interesting... ways, unless  something  else was working\n\nIt's based around an interesting concept, at least... Automated bases full of deadly robots gone haywire and posing a threat or something. It has some interesting elements like (somewhat) parkour, special attacks with fists and (surprisingly) the pistol. Graphics aren't all that awful, all things considered.\n\nBut damn isn't it a bugfest - hell, I didn't get further than the first level because the damn game is impossible to play. The audio... Oh GOD the audio! It is loud. TOO loud. You start the game and you're immediately blasted with music so loud it'll make you regret being born with ears. Then, there's no way to tweak the volume in-game. Audio files also have an annoying tendency of bugging out, with audio effects looping over and over, or completely disappearing. It doesn't seem like a lot of work went into that - or any - part of the game.\n\nThe controls are too clunky and un-intuitive to use. The mouse sensitivity is set to zero and the camera is inverted by default. I wouldn't mind the inverted camera, but why on Earth is the mouse effectively turned off by default, while NO OTHER WAY to manipulate the camera exists? But I have to say that this was the least annoing part of the absolute fiasco that the control scheme is.\n\nWhat really makes the game absurdly hard is the parkour system - which isn't functioning. There's not even an effort to explain how it works, unless you count the "Run against the wall to climb it" and doing that doesn't work, which essentially means that what appears to be an essential way of navigating levels is NOT functioning properly. Really, the only way I've found that allowed me to jump high enough to grab ledges, was to use the special attack  for "fists" which, even without any energy (or whatever is that resource) at all, somehow manages to propell the character upwards, as if being yanked upwards by some sort of crane.\n\nPlus, there's a lag when switching weapons. It switches to the fists THEN to the selected weapon. Were you to press "fire" during that time and you automatically switch to fists. It wasn't a problem at the first level, but I can imagine it being pretty lethal if things were a bit more hectic.\n\nReally, nothing seems to work in the hot mess.","May 13","false","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I gave it a shot and tried hard, my expectations were not very high. It took half an hour to get annoyed enough to ragequit this game.\n\nTo the developer: You need some serious beta-testing, mate. Invite your friends, bring in some junk food and make them play for hour or two. Sit back, shut up and watch them playing, make notes where they struggle and what is not clear to them. Fix it, and repeat the process. If you dont have friends, find some, it's easy when you are game dev to find nerd friends. Its cool to be game dev. Without beta-testing, you won't get far.\nAnother thing: don't apologize for your work,  just warn everyone that its not finished, respect for respect man  Feed us with regular updates. I want to see this game finished, and i will play again as soon as you remove that hilarious jump sound.\n\nPositive ( i really try hard):\n-graphics look decent for 1-man-made indie game, nice intro\n-clear interface, standard controlls\n-decent camera, i dunno why you complain so much, it is 3pp all the way.\n-awesome ammo crate concept, interactive as ... ammo crate can be at its finest ;)\n\nNegative:\n-Main character movements, and general physics. Weird things happen if you fight opponents h2h\n-Protagonist moaning at every jump - for God's sake, my ears are bleeding\n-Environment sounds\n-Feeling of shooting\n-At the edges of map you can see through walls\n-Tutorial. It should be child-easy, and it isn't.\n\nTL:DR\n\nGame is in fact early acces beta. It needs serious debugging and polishing. For Supporting the developer, by all means you should buy it.  Otherwise, as for now, stay away. Its not Mass Effect+Prince of Persia blend, but it has potential to become one.","November 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/416170/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Doing what I do I tend to check the latest Steam releases daily for anything that might be of interest, if I see something interesting I ask for it and I’m always grateful when a developer says yes. This was very much the case with HotLead, there weren’t even reviews on steam when I asked the developer for review code and I didn’t hear anything back. Thats also not unusual as I’m no IGN or Gamespot sized website. You expect it and move on, so when an email hit my inbox late last week with my review code I was a little surprised this long after.\nSurprises are a funny things aren’t they, sometimes their nice and sometimes there not. . . Can you see where I’m going with this?\nNow my review process is as follows, I normally play the game fully and complete it in games that have a clear ending. Then I like to play again making choices and doing things I didn’t before and see how it impacts the story/gameplay. Lastly I like to let it simmer for a few days and then revisit it if I still have questions.\nThats the normal way I like to do it, HotLead I have done non of this for. I’ve played the tutorial and the first level, so I might seem rather ill equipped to offer any kind of review for this game. But let me assure you I’ve learned everything I need to know about this game and really don’t need to spend anymore time with it. I’m slightly upset I have to revisit it to do the screen shots for this review.\nSo what is HotLead, well its meant to be a fast paced futuristic third person shooter where your character can use a range of weapons and attacks along with packour to make huge combos devastating your opponents. The reality on the other hand is entirely different. . . Well it is in third person! But as far as the fast paced action goes, well if you hold shift the main character does move a touch faster than the standard snails pace he normally would. But I really shouldn’t get your hopes up as the controls are just bad, from basic movement to jumping thats so vital to a game like this having a complete mind of its own nothing works fluidly or accuracy. It’s a total mess and its only compounded by the fact the level design is atrocious with dead ends and no route made clear to the player.\nEven the graphics that from a distance look somewhat interesting loose the polish on closer inspection, there really is little if anything to redeem HotLead and that a shame as the idea behind it has so much potentiol. I’ve always tried to champion Indie games and Indie developers, building some great relationships with some. I love the fact on the PC we have all this raw talent available to us with far less obstacles than other platforms, but I game like this not only damages the indie community as a whole but also goes a long way to show up the issues with steam and this freedom we PC players for the most part enjoy.\nThat’s not to say this game is the sole cause of all the issues with steam and Indie developers, of course thats not the case. But its a great example of the trash we are seeing more and more in the minefield of Indie titles. HotLead isn’t even fit for a alpha release let alone to be released as a finished title which it is, it resembles a school project rather than a game sold for money.\nI understand that no doubt the developer will probably read this and probably be quiet hurt by what I’ve said, but its my job to inform you the consumer not feed any body’s ego. The truth is this game is one of if not the worst I’ve ever played and simply doesn’t deserver its place on Steam let alone your hard earned money, the only fun I had with it was when I found my self laughing uncontrollably at how bad it was. If it didn’t have a steam page I honestly would have thought I was being trolled. You may have noticed I’ve forgone my usual scoring system for this review as I can’t even begin to comprehend a score for this game and even if I could giving it anything more than half a star would seem generous.\n","November 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

While by no means perfect, this shows the dedication of the person behind it, so kudos for that, this is what warrants a positive review in my book.\n\nSome very noticeable improvements:\n- Movement and Control: Way better, now I can control the character and expect it to behave as it should most of the time; also, much easier and natural to replenish ammo now :)\n- UI: Looks much cooler, but more importantly now you can easily see what's going on, much easier to read (health, ammo etc.)\n- Optimization: Almost no framerate drops now, the game is much more stable than before\n- The intro/story screens are something else now, I can't even describe the difference (though this is a minor point for most)\n- The new lightning in the levels really bring the whole game to life (although you are mostly surrounded by metal and robots)\n\nIn conclusion, the price seems rather fair now comparing to what you get... there is still room for more improvements and tweaks, but if the latest experience shows anything is that work on the game continues and we can expect more updates in the future.\n\nTip: Mouse can be erratic at first, make sure to adjust sensitivity from the options menu... this is almost a prerequisite here unlike most games, but by no means a deal breaker once you find a setting confortable for you.","January 8","true","2.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Graphic is nice, but sometimes have glitches. Same goes for sound too, game is crying for another update and final polishing.\n\nOther than that, it is stable and runing pretty fine.\n\nGameplay is fun and have a good variety of enemies, weapons, moves  and a pinch of parkour elements.\n\nPotentional ?! Definetly YES\nSince it has already been bundled, I cant recommend buying it for full price. Wait for a next update and discount.
