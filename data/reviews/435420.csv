The trailer is different from the game itself. The trailer is March- off world recon. which is a game i played before. But the game itself is Operation Matriarchy which is some mindless crap corridor fps shooter and the resolution doesnt even fit the screen for 1080p. Its cut off so you cant see your health/armor at the bottom or the radar up top that shows objectives. Plus the sound is terrible, and the enemies move like they have lag. I requested a refund...\n\nEDIT:\nGot the refund. Before you buy this look at the other 'Thumbs Up' reviews. most of them are less than 50% helpfull. This game is truely trash.","January 30","false","0.4"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","44","55","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamUnderPressure/recommended/435420/","SteamUnderPressure","Air","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamUnderPressure/","1754 products in account","First level was a lot of fun. I never had seen kicking the protagonist in a FPS game, but this game has it.  I really liked how you out of nowhere get swamped by the enemy and have nowhere to take cover,\n\nSecond level was something different, you keep running back and forth without finding the 3rd and final key for this level. You need 3 keys but the 3rd is nowhere to be found, so no progression is to be made.\n\nGraphics are limited by the engine used, seem simplified compared to newer generation FPS games but it seems like the developers did their best to get everything out of what the engine has to offer.\n\nEdit: Will try to find the 3rd key again, hoping to find him on my next expedition.\nEdit: key provided so a review could be written.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/FloatingOnAir\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/dandey","January 29","true","6.6"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","9","39","0","1"
