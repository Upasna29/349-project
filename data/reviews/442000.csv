The game itself granted me a few minutes of actual playtime before refusing to let me interact with a keypad to progress. The flashlight battery change similarly refused to play ball, leaving me to poke the 'Use' key to no avail in the darkness while the game occasionally reminded me of the controls for fruitlessly pushing scenery crates around.\n\nIsn't the point of GameGuru, an engine that mocks your attempts to implement your own scripts, that although any product that comes out of it will be an asset-drowned high school project at best, its sheer simplification of game creation is meant to be stable? This is about as solidly built as a gangrene sufferer and nowhere near as contagious.\n\nWhatever pitiful moments of my life were taken by this disgrace are documented below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35aT2vSuHkc","March 4","false","0.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","25","27","13","0"

And I say "game" because it was created using Game Guru, a drag-and-drop game maker. I froze on the first loading screen and ended up having to use the .exe to even start playing. I was met with laughable level design, Google translate letters, objects that glitched all over the place, a character who casually walks over EVERYTHING (including huge cabinets), and the silliest storyline imaginable. Thankfully it's all over with in just under 45 minutes.\n\nBottom line is this: Don't bother wasting your time or money. Just don't.\n\n(For those who wish to see a 60 second video review I did of the game, see below)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648414801","March 19","false","0.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

Everything, from the visuals, to the setting, the atmosphere, the story, is just awful. And I understand, that not everyone is a native english speaker, but for crying out loud, if you're going to release a game to an international audience, have your spelling and grammar checked by someone who speaks decent english. If this game were free, I'd still request a refund for it.","March 4","false","0.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","2"
