That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.\n\nThis new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.\n\nThe story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ♥♥♥ chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.\n\nTo sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles.","December 2, 2013","true","22.5"," 944 of 1,111 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","944","1","0","26"

The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.\n\nThe graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are “puzzles” to solve (a la classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.\n\nThe game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).\n\nLastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn’t completely dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.\n\nSo, in summary,  Tomb Raider (2013) is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 11, 2015","true","23.2"," 445 of 515 people (86%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","86","445","515","33","10"

Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are ♥♥♥♥ING annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play.\n\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","35.4"," 317 of 358 people (89%) found this review helpful 129 people found this review funny","89","317","358","129","5"

Afterall, you're a Croft"\n\nThis is the reborn, the first story of our favourite adventurous girl in the world.\nThe game has a lot of good and bad aspects, let's review them:\n\n\n✓ Graphics: one of the most visible changes for all the players; a visible GREAT and well-done change with a beautiful enviroment, great lighting and character models. We cannot forget the TressFX mode which allows you to make Lara's hair more realitic and beautiful.\n\n✓ Gameplay: you can jump, run, tumbling, ... everywhere, this allows you to explore the area.\n\n✓ Play time: you have hours of entertaiment in front of you... Did you just finished the game? No problem! Now you can try to earn all the achievements, hidden tombs, upgrade guns till the maximum level, ...\n\n✓ Animations: sometimes I think that I'm playing Mortal Kombat because you can kill the enemies with whatever you want (pickaxe, bow, burning,...) That's sadic... BUT FUN!\n\n✓ Armory: you have tour bow (the coolest gun in the game) but also you can use shotguns, pistols, ... The good thing is that you can upgrade them with the pieces that you find in the game.\n\n✓ Feels: you will fall in love with Lara because you'll see how she changes from an innocent girl to our dear survivor.\n\n✓ Skills: you have a lot of skills in front of you so choose the one that you really want! BUT THINK BEFORE NOTHING! Because there's skills specializedin looting, in kill, ...\n\n✓ Collectables: there's a lot of them! Go and find them!\n\n✓ Map: you've a very big map to explore! Feel free to visit everywhere with the quick travel in the firecamps!\n\n✓ Fans: you got stuck? That's not a problem! In the Tomb Raider community we're a huge family and you'll find a lot of Tomb Raider Steam groups and fans (like me :P)\n\n~ Story: it's not the best story in the videogame history but it's not bad. You can find a lot of interesting things if you collect the collectables.\n\n✖ Resources: I mean, there's alot of things that the game doesn't use well, for example, the hunting: you must find in a mission but you won't hunt again in the rest of the game if you want. It would be great if, for example, you must hunt for resources or you must eat the meat of the animals (because you're a survivor and that survivor's things)\n\n✖ Multiplayer: do not buy this game if you're searching for a multiplayer. It is cool, but it's dead and If you want to find a match you need friends to play with or just enter in a Steam group for it.\n\n✖ ONLY FOR TOMB RAIDER FANS Well, not exactly only for Tomb Raider fans, but if you have ever played a Tomb Raider before this you'll notice it: this game is very easy compared with the others in the saga.\nThat doesn't mean that you cannot get stuck but if you have ever played a Tomb Raider before you would see the game easier.\n\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION:I will buy 100 times because it's my favourite game!\nWell now let's talk seriusly...\n\n✓ I would recomend to BUY IT if you're searching a great adventure game with good graphics, a good/not bad story and a beautiful protagonist\n\n✖ I would recomend to DON'T BUY IT for anyone who's searching for a game with a great multiplayer.\n\nIn conclusion, buy it and enjoy it ;)","July 30, 2015","true","31.5"," 312 of 354 people (88%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","88","312","354","20","20"

It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game.\n\nThe visual effects were stunning.  Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments.  Character animations were realistic and played smoothly.\n\nThe writing was done pretty well for an Origin story.  The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in.  The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier.  The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings.  Voice acting was also very good.  I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes.  The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story.\n\nCombat takes a cover shooter approach.  The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely.  There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival.  There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game.  I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games.  In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little.  The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities.  The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death.\n\nI only had a couple of issues with the game overall...\n\nThere were a few crashes as I played through the game.  Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently.  My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes.  The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying.\n\nFor an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure.  Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones.  Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too "shooty" for my tastes.  I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game.  Boss encounters were also very lacking.  I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means.\n\nOne other minor complaint are the death animations.  I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top.  Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event.\n\nOverall I was very surprised and pleased by this game.  I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality.","March 8, 2014","true","28.1"," 306 of 362 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","306","362","0","14"

The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.\n\nI've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.\n\nI've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.\n\nNow, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.  I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much.  Enough said?\n\nAlso, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair.   I think that speaks for itself.  It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too.  My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise.","July 21, 2014","true","68.3"," 161 of 178 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","161","178","0","3"

It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie.\n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/203160/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Tomb Raider is a action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix and Feral Interactive. This title follows the gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor as she must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island in order to escape its relentless hold. Being quite the cinematic experience from start to finish, this title quickly pulls you into a fantastic adventure and simply will not let go which is what a truly great game is able to accomplish with the right story, eyecatching graphics and edge of the seat action. Along the way you'll also get the opportunity to explore many tombs and solve some challenging puzzles as well. However, during the course of the game this title did make me cringe alot because this young lady manages to take quite the punishment from all manner of falls, injuries and combat yet despite these horrible events it was very inspirational to see her persevere through it all and emerge such a strong and confident female. This is a truly great origin story that will set the pace for what will no doubt be an excellent continuation of the Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nGraphically, this game is such a stunning showcase of visuals. Even though this title came out in 2013, on ultra settings one could easily mistake this for a "next generation" game as it's that gorgeous. The CG and rendering is amazing. The lighting is simply spectacular whether you're scaling the cliffside of some random mountain at high noon or quietly walking around a darkened tomb with a torch. Also, each area of the island is varied and has a uniqueness of it's own. This is definitely not one of those games that uses recycled environments...yes I'm talking to you Dragon Age II. One of my favorite things about the visuals in this title is the fantastic attention to detail and immersion that Crystal Dynamics took. For example, when Lara walks through a forest the shrubbery and foliage moves apart as she trudges through it. You can also hear twigs and leaves snap and rustle as you step on them it's simply brilliant. The game also does a fantastic job of seamlessly blending transition sequences and quick time events into the gameplay. There are no loading screens unless you're entering or exiting the game which is a very nice touch and really shows the amount of polish that Crystal Dynamics put on this title.\n\nThe musical score and sound effects in this game are also exceptionally done. Jason Graves does a fantastic job with the soundtrack appropriately scoring action sequences, tomb raiding as well as dramatic moments of shock and awe which are quite abundant in this game. That "attention to detail" that I mentioned before about the graphics in this title definitely extends to the sound quality as well.\n\nI've been a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise since the very beginning so when the series was due for a reboot I was very excited and rightly so because this is just an amazing title. I originally preordered this game and started playing at release a few years ago but, I'm sorry to say, a few hours into the game I ran into a big problem with the prompts not showing up during the quicktime events which was extremely annoying at the time...I believe I punched two maybe three babies I can't say for sure?! Crystal Dynamics eventually fixed the issue but before that happened I stopped playing and had moved on to something else but I can't believe that it has taken me this long to come back. With its gripping story, dazzling action and added multiplayer I'll no doubt be playing this game time and time again. There are also a multitude of achievements to seek which, if you're a gamer like me who loves to explore and find things, is a welcome addition to the gameplay. This title should be in everyones Steam library...highly recommended!!!","March 5","true","33.9"," 77 of 79 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","77","79","3","9"

In this game however, Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.\n\nTomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.\n\nI strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.\n\n9.5/10","December 30, 2014","true","26.0"," 94 of 106 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","94","106","4","4"

Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.\n\nYou start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many  endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.\n\nWhile you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.\n\nThe enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.\n\nI like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the ("run for your life") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it. The single-player is a  definite must-play for everyone who likes survival, shooting, and gorgeous women. I love this game, and I recommed you check it out, espcially when it goes on sale.","June 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 150 of 194 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","150","194","0","5"

The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.\n\nIf your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not  gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your "to play list". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues.\n\nI have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.\n\nYeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.\n\nAnyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times.","December 21, 2015","true","32.7"," 83 of 97 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","83","97","8","7"

A lot had to do with the core game play being altered quite radically (always online DRM, the monetization of a survival horror franchise that was no longer survival horror and the continued streamlining of a sandbox favorite) did not bode well for the new Tomb Raiders reception. How were the fans going to react to this new vision of a much loved icon from gaming's past when the odds were slowly stacking up against it?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341773935\nIt appears we need not have worried at all. In Crystal Dynamics capable hands they have crafted one of this years most exhilarating and exciting adventures as well as giving the franchise a much needed reboot as it was starting to feel more than a little stale by the time the last adventure had rolled around. Whilst the core game play (puzzle solving tomb raiding) has been radically altered from what we know and expect from a Tomb Raider game, the new Tomb Raider takes Lara Croft back to her roots with an origin story that makes Lara feel alive and human again and thrusts Croft fully into the cinematic action-adventure limelight defined by this generations Uncharted series.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341774262\nYou can see the folks at Crystal Dynamics are very much in awe with the character and world Naughty Dog have created for their hero Nathan Drake (who in many ways was inspired by Lara herself). In fact the resemblances are so close that if you were to remove Lara from the adventure and place Nathan in it instead the game wouldn't look out of place at all in the Uncharted cannon. Where the new Tomb Raider differs slightly from Uncharted is in tone. Uncharted is still firmly rooted in "PG-13" matinee territory whilst the new Tomb Raider maturely branches out into more adult territory with some extreme violence and strong language coupled with a strong story and dialogue. The game is also an absolute stunner for the eyes with all the settings ramped up. The game is utterly gorgeous from a graphical standpoint and coupled with exceptional audio design makes for a truly fantastic experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341774582\nWhilst some gamers are going to feel out of kilter with this new adventure, this new vision also broadens the horizons considerably for the franchise and is without a doubt the most action focused game in the series. By taking it in this new direction Crystal Dynamics have fashioned one of the most exciting games from the 2013 release calendar. This is one of those games that outdoes almost every Hollywood blockbuster out there and those that accept that times have changed are in for one kick-♥♥♥ of a ride.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","April 3, 2014","true","35.8"," 163 of 224 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","163","224","0","8"

The Island is beautiful, featuring a variety of different areas to explore along with tons of hidden unlockables.\n\nTomb Raider feels like a lot of other games combined, mainly Resident Evil 4 mixed with a bit of Uncharted and maybe some Assassin’s Creed style platforming. This meshes together very well into a lengthy and enjoyable action/adventure game.\n\nThe story is somewhat forgettable but the gameplay is solid (although it’s fairly easy). The multiplayer isn't worth mentioning, it's decent but not anything special. You should purchase Tomb Raider to experience the single player.\n\nFor a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax6n6rRbPH4\n\nTomb Raider has also made our list for the top 10 games of the year, if you're interested on where it stacks up, check out: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210725247\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","November 28, 2013","true","3.4"," 196 of 277 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","196","277","0","10"

That said, it offers an interesting storyline for developing who Lara Croft becomes and provides some neat avenues for that to happen.\n\nThe gameplay is reasonably fluid, climbing and navigating have their moments of frustration, but overall it's a positive experience. If you're into the cinema feel, this game is like living in a movie: the cutscenes are impressive, the lighting and textures are gorgeous and the whole feel is immersive. As Lara gets beaten and bruised throughout the game, you'll find yourself wishing for a reprieve for her, because the events just never let up.\n\nAchievement-wise, the collectables offer a little more backstory, and I was able to get them all in the first playthrough before finishing the game, so that earns props from me.\n\nThe important factor, is it fun? Yes, you'll have a great time climbing and fighting throughout the game, but your experience is more limited to being along for the ride in Lara's story, rather than actual feeling like you're influencing anything she's doing.\n\nOverall, it's a solid adventure with a great cinematic feel, just don't expect too much control over it.","December 2, 2013","true","18.8"," 108 of 144 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","108","144","0","1"

The combat feels great, the graphics are excellent, the mouse and keyboard controls are fluid and the game is very optimized. The story is pretty predictable and not that great. Despite being a Tomb Raider game, the tombs are optional and the puzzles are quite easy to solve.\n\nThe platforming has been made much more simplified now that Lara can stick to almost anything she comes near. There is some exploration in the areas but not as much as it should be. You can go back and revisit the areas since the island is "open-world", but there isn't much stuff to do there aside from collecting some boring collectables and the optional tombs.\n\nAll of the weapons in this game feel great. I liked how the guns evolve when you get enough parts. For example, the WW2 submachine gun you start with turns into some sort of AK-47 and your trench shotgun turns into a SPAS-12 combat shotgun. The weapons sound great aswell.\n\nThe game sometimes tries too hard to be cinematic, especially at the beginning of the game which is a scripted QTE fest. Actually, there are too many scripted sequences in the later parts aswell which got dull pretty quickly. The QTEs for keyboard are terrible. They use these stupid icons mainly instead of just showing the actual damn key. Sometimes the game does tell you which key to press but it should have been like that in the first place (I would have preferred no QTEs though).\n\nLara goes from innocent girl to stone-cold killer very early on in the game. When she does her first-kill, she goes like "OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE", then the next thing I'm pulling 360 n0sc0pe headshots with the bow with ease. The survival elements are not very deep at all and feel kinda phoned in. There is hardly any resource management since you can find a ton of ammo on the ground and Lara can regenerate her health.\n\nThe combat is your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last few years, though with a bit of jumping here and there. It's pretty good for the most part.\n\nThe game holds your hand too much, however. The games treats you like an idiot with giving you forced hints while you're doing the (easy) puzzles. Thankfully, the survival instints feature (Which highlights the stuff where you're supposed to go) is optional.\n\nDidn't play much of the multiplayer so can't say much about it but who plays a Tomb Raider game for the multiplayer anyway?\n\nOverall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a decent TPS but not a good Tomb Raider game at all. The game would be a lot better if had more exploration, a bigger focus on tombs, little to no QTEs and scripted mumbo jumbo and less hand-holding. Even with all the flaws in the game, I still enjoyed playing it.\n\n\n","July 18, 2015","true","11.8"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","50","58","2","3"

We've seen them quite a lot from the time the first game of this franchise was released, and "re-boot" of the year 2013 was not the first one. However, it is still a 3rd-person view action/adventure game with female heroine, who knows her ways around archeology and survival in the "Indiana Jones style". And, it is a good game, even if flawed a little, but quite decent overall.\n\nThe pattern has changed seriously this time. Now it is much less a puzzle with "how to get there" problem, but quite ample action with "shoot often, kill many, remorse nothing". It is not bad, but looking too much Uncharted. Which is somehow amusing, as it was Naughty Dog who looked at TR games as an example. But let's not trouble ourselves with the quiz "who's copycat whom better". Much less climbing and jumping and much more shooting for one, damned quick time events on every corner for two, and not-bad, but quite dead multiplayer for three (with many achievements for MP which you'll probably never unlock fairly). Sounds almost enough to nail the coffin, right? But I called TR'13 the good game, despite all those things. Why? 'Cause it's still a fine adventure! And if you're not troubling yourself too much with 100% achievements in every game, I really recommend you to try out this re-rolled Crofty, as there are not so many comparable titles anyway (and Uncharted stays with Sony, without any chance to climb on the PC mountain so far).\n\nThe setout of the Tomb Raider'13 sounds very similar to the one of Far Cry 3 (which was released just a few months earlier to the TR game). Lara and her team crushed occasionally on the distinct island filled with unfriendlies, and need to find a way out. You'll find a bow and will be hunting animals for resources. And, by all means, you'll get guns - and quite enough mean and ugly targets to unload them. Ah, and don't forget semi-open world, where you can search for numerous "artifacts" and other collectables, as well as some small tombs to scavenge... on your way to save your team and yourself.\n\nLet's talk about strong and weak points.\n\nThe engine and visuals - are really good. Especially I enjoyed the visualisation of fire and wind - they are, like, alive - which is good for atmosphere in the game - and for dynamic puzzles, which are (lucky we) not just "push the button, turn the lever". I enjoyed the sightseeing, the climbing and hiking was quite rewarding... if they were not haywired by the not-so-great controls and framerate drops, which happened too many times, especially when I played the game for the first time, right after release. Now the framerate seems fixed (or at least, much more stabile), and I'm get used for controls, more or less. Still, the count of my deaths out of flawed controls (during some tricky jumps usually) and for low framerate during damned QTE (like with AlphaWolf) - really freaked me out so many times.\n\nThe story and characters - another strong point. It's like the "Lost" serial - only with bunch of sane and (pro)active people. Even your enemies are good and solid - in their way. They are not just respawning mobs without any logic or reason. On the contrary, they're all well-placed. I've seen better scenarios, sure, but only in gems like Bioshock or Witcher - which are surely of rare breed.\n\nBattle system - not exactly vivid, but good enough. You sneak, you hide behind the obstacles, you perform silent attacks with bow/pistol, then enemies discovers your location, hell breaks loose, you see the rain of lead, you've got molotovs flying right on your head, your cover breaks after some shots... Yeah, it CAN be fun. I especially liked the bow - it performed much better than in Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 3... or even Skyrim. Much more arcade than in the Mount'n'Blade, of course, but still quite fun. And yeah, brings assosiations with the Hunger Games Katniss tool for some, sure. Never liked that franchise... but I do like bows and prefer them to crossbows (and occasionally to rifles) even in real life.\n\nAs of semi-open world (I call it so for the TR still a narrative-driven game, even if it allows you to return to previous points to collect miscellanious stuff you've might missed earlier)... The tombs are quite optional, and, as much as I've enjoyed puzzles in there, the sequence when Lara complete the challenge in the tomb... is really out of order, with that big chest, wow-hush on the first occasional trinket - and that's all! Take your bonus to supplies and return on your quest! Not really rewarding, if you ask me. On the contrary, the more basic artifacts Lara discovers on her way feels much more suiting her Archeological agenda, as well as adding more colours to the world around. That's great, if only transiently. Yet, overall trinket searches not really providing additional fun, being somewhere on the level with feathers from Assassin's Creed franchise... unless you're really looking for more lore on the Lara Croft's universe, and really reading diary pages - a thing so rare now, when those pages scattered among all games, and so little people actually pays any interest to them anywhere...\n\nAs we're talking pro/contra, I'll repeat about two downsides: the quite-dead multiplayer, with something about 15 out of 50 achievements related to it - which means no fair complete. And bugs, mostly based on the not-so-good optimisation. Some of them were fixed... like the occasional drops of framerate. But in that process of updating, I've got my savefile broken - with the 18th level MP charachter, and 100%-completed story... So I had to repeat all the process, without "Newgame+" and with MP character zeroed...\n\nWith all said, my mark of the game is 7.2/10. It's a neat dramatical adventure, worthy re-work of the title. Yet some of the gamedesign decisions (like the emphasis on QTE or Lara's quick transformation from bookworm to mass-murdering angel of death) - and bugs problems, along with stupid "one slot saves everything" policy, which isn't good even on consoles - all this holding me praising the game higher. Still, a good pick, if discounted, no doubts there.","May 8","true","75.6"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","43","47","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/203160/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","I 100% completed Tomb Raider (2013) today. I'm pretty torn about the game, because there's a great deal of things I liked a lot, and a great deal of things I really hated simultaneously. That's a pretty unusual reaction for me with a game.\n\nThings I liked a lot:\n- Game feel: Movement feels great, shooting enemies with the bow is incredibly satisfying, jumping and climbing is really smooth, the sort of half-sticky half-cover system is really flexible and felt excellent. I can't stress enough how great it is just running around in the game. This has some of the best auto-platforming I've ever played in a game.\n- Visuals: The game is really, really gorgeous. Weather effects are great. Environments are mostly excellent and there's quite a bit of variety given that it takes place on a single island. Lara's model keeps changing throughout the game as she suffers more and more abuse--and they very creatively have plot reasons to clean her up every once in a while only to make her bloody and dirty again.\n- Enemy AI: I generally liked the enemy AI. There are only a few regular enemy types, but they combine them interestingly. I generally felt like I had to move around a bit to avoid getting pincered or my cover shot out or blown up. It felt frenetic and engaging generally.\n- Bar filling: This game is more stuffed full of bars to fill than any game series other than Assassin's Creed. You are collecting scrap. You are collecting experience. You're using experience to upgrade skills and scrap to upgrade weapons. You're collecting weapon parts. You're collecting GPS pickups and relics (like in Uncharted, they have a little 3D Model) + most relics have a hidden thing for you to find if you rotate the model. Every area has something to shoot or burn or find as a per-level sort of thing. There are like 999 combat bonuses for extra experience. For a mostly fairly linear kind of action-shooter, I felt constantly stimulated with tons of stuff to do.\n- Ziplines: I don't think people in the real world use ziplines but I love them in video games.\n- The Puzzle Tombs: The game has optional tomb areas which are basically little mini-puzzle areas. This is good because the main game doesn't have many puzzles. These work great, they're very unique and interesting. Totally totally enjoyed these, wish the game had three times as many.\n- Tension and Release: The game does a great job alternating between high excitement and low excitement periods.\n- Long, substantial: This is a 15+ hour game easily. I took 19 to 100%, but that's including maybe 3 hours of replay because of lost save progress.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- Game feel: All of the guns sucked in comparison to the bow, the grenade launcher is incredibly weak.\n- "Big" enemies: Every single shooting game that features a 10 foot tall enemy that wears tons of armour and takes 999999 bullets and then you have to QTE to kill it and the enemy has lines like "YOUR PUNY WEAPONS WON'T HURT ME" is stupid. There are no 10 foot tall human beings. This is not enjoyable. No one likes this. Tomb Raider has this multiple times, including two separate boss fights.\n- End-game combat: About three quarters of the way through the game, all the enemies start having armour and machine guns and combat takes a nosedive. It's much more frustrating without being more skillful. Bullet sponge crap. The last boss fight is like four QTEs.\n- Setpieces: The game has an enormous number of setpieces where you're in a collapsing building, running from explosions, parachuting through trees, tumbling down a muddy slide, being pushed down rapids, falling large distances and hitting the ground, etc. These suck. They suck in every game that does them. It's not good gameplay, because it's basically an extended low-control QTE. But the worst part is that after the first time, the spectacle wears off. It's just boring and blasé. You see a bridge and you say 'gee whiz, I wonder if the bridge will collapse as I'm walking on it" and then it does.\n\nThings I hated:\n- The intro: The single worst part of the game is the introduction section. How the hell does this happen in so many games? It has forced slow-walking.\n- Lara getting the crap kicked out of her: Lara gets shot, burned, inappropriately touched, beaten, falls, stabbed and impaled, hung upsidedown multiple times, etc. If you lose a QTE, you are going to get brutally dismembered by an enemy or environmental obstacle. The Conan Clueless Gamer review that emphasizes this is right to. The sounds here are really disgusting too. This is the definition of pornographic. The scenes aren't done to provoke any response other than titillation. It's just stupid.\n- Genocide: Lara kills maybe 1000-1200 people during the run of the game. Lara kills more people than Kane and Lynch did combined. This is ridiculous. You can't have a moment in the introduction where the game is like "omg big emotional moment lara has to use violence to defend herself killing people is such a big moral responsibility" and then have her headshot 15 people in a row five minutes later. Either learn to make games with less combat, or stop trying to make it a major plot/character theme. Oh and by the way, the first time you kill someone it's in the context of a group of people burning down a village and killing dozens of innocent civilians and trying to kill you after groping you--there is absolutely, positively no shade of grey here. There's no moral dilemma.\n- The characters, the writing: The characters are awful. You have a team full of awful sidekicks. There's "Grumpy Old Crazy Man", "Wise and Caring Father Figure", "Best Friend", "Big Dumb Muscle Gronk", "Socially Awkward Nerd" (this guy actually wears a t-shirt with an Esc key, it's just a total joke), "Oily Used Car Salesman Jerkoff Who Is Obviously Being Set Up For a Heel Turn Later", "Sassy Black Woman". It's pitiful. They're all terrible. The only character who gets any writing behind him at all is the father figure guy, who keeps telling Lara he believes in her, she can do it, etc etc etc. Which is why it's obvious that he's going to die, but not before he gets to have a dying breath monologue where he tells Lara to be strong. It's all so flat and telegraphed. It's so phoned in. And half the dialogue is cliche stuff. Even the ambient enemy dialogue sucks--the last enemy in the game fired a random audio cue where he said "Hey guys, she's got a gun!" No duh ♥♥♥♥♥, I just laid waste to an entire civilization. I was really tempted to skip most of the cutscenes.\n- The story: Hey, you know the supernatural stuff in every Tomb Raider game? And every Uncharted game? Well, it's here and it's just as stupid here.\n\nThat's a lot of words to say I'd play another one. It's a big dumb mega-budget AAA game. I think in a lot of ways it's one of the better examples of what it's trying to do this generation. Fire the writer for the next one.","March 10, 2014","true","19.6"," 165 of 243 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","165","243","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverside30/recommended/203160/","silverside30","Bernie Flanders","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverside30/","467 products in account","I'm going to go against the grain for a minute.  I realize a lot of people really liked the Tomb Raider reboot, which is why I was really excited to play it, but what you get out of this game will really depend on what you're looking for.\n\nIf you want:\n\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Bow and arrow combat (it's been a "thing" for the last couple years, hasn't it?)\n- To watch a young girl get beaten up, stabbed and shot, and for all of these things to only dirty young Lara's clean visage and not actually slow down her inhuman ability to jump, climb, jumpclimb and shoot her way to victory\n\nyou're going to like this game.\n\nBut if you want:\n\n- An actual story\n- Any character depth\n- Puzzles that make you think\n- Third-person shooter gameplay that isn't like every other third-person action game from the last five years\n\nyou will have a less than stellar time.\n\nTurns out I fell into the second category.  Throughout most of this game, all I could do is think to myself, "Why am I here? What is the purpose of pew-pew arena #36?" And while the island that Lara's ship washes up to is a stunning place to explore, everything is incredibly linear.  This linearity wouldn't be a bad thing if I had any meaningful story pressing me forward, making me want to see what's around the corner.  As it stands, it's just another big, loud, dumb action movie knock-off.\n\nThe game plays fairly well.  You only get four weapons, but they are upgradable with some neat little attachments.  The bow is a nice way to take down guards quietly and lets you shoot and attach ropes across chasms to progress past certain areas.  Speaking of stealth, though, there really is no way to sneak through this game.  It's only possible in a few sections to sneak through.  The rest of the game, while you may take down one or two guys quietly, everyone will eventually notice and start running out at you.  For a game about a young, untrained, unarmored girl, shouldn't Lara be trying to sneak past the heavily armed militia that is all actively searching for her eventually (she goes from murder for the first time, which is tough for her to deal with, to an insatiable thirst for blood a la Rambo within 30 minutes if that gives you any indication what kind of game this is).\n\nAfter  you finish the 10 hour story, the only thing to go back to  is finding collectibles that slightly add to the lore. There is also a multiplayer mode that I haven't tried.  It was pretty universally canned by critics around its release, though I can't comment personally on its quality.  There's really nothing making me want to go back to the game again.\n\nThis game might be worth picking up if it's on sale for $5 again, but unless you really like good graphics or just want a mindless shooter/climber, I'd hold off.  I got it for free with my graphics card, fortunately, but I will be uninstalling it now that it's finished and probably never coming back to it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'm adding my comment from 10/14/14 in response to some of the replies I've gotten.\n\n"Yes, I definitely agree there is more character depth than any previous versions of Tomb Raider (I've only played the original and Underworld, though).  That still doesn't make it GOOD character development, just slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than non-existant.\n\nThe characters are generic as hell, and I disagree with homer redacted's earlier comment that there are "sad deaths of characters they build you up to like." I just personally don't see it.\n\nSkip the DLC for this one, but if you pick it up at the current price ($3.99) I definitely think you'll be getting your money's worth, as it's definitely a fun mindless action game, I just don't think it's worth full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/203160/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","A survivor is born…\n\nIt’s the tagline that’s been attached to every trailer, screenshot, and press release surrounding Crystal Dynamics 2013 reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, but it actually serves as a pretty good summarization of the series as a whole. From the revolutionary first game, through its progressively mediocre sequels, eventual revival with Legend and then repeated downward spiral, it’s not always been the most successful of franchises but nonetheless is one of the most enduring throughout its failures. With Tomb Raider 2013 (hence force just “Tomb Raider” or “TR”) Crystal Dynamics has done away with many of the hallmarks of the series, leaving something behind that some may argue bares little resemblance to its predecessors but in my eyes is the exact incarnation of what Tomb Raider needed to become relevant again.\n\nGone are the lengthy, puzzle riddled tombs, the emphasis on absurd level designs, lackluster combat, and an enormous set of breasts standing in for a protagonist. In their place we find a tightly knit, extremely cinematic, blockbuster action game that completely overhauls what we consider TR to be and turns it into something far more compelling and polished than the series has ever been.\n\nAs an origin story, TR is as much the story of Lara Croft’s ascension from curious but naive archaeologist to the incredibly self sufficient treasure hunter we know her best as, as it is the harrowing account of an expedition gone south as Lara and co become stranded on an island populated by what could most easily be described as the criminally insane. It’s a darker narrative than we’ve ever seen with Lara, with moments that made me legitimately cringe and could very nearly be categorized as horror, but it’s also the deepest and most personal.\n\nLara is a fragile and vulnerable character, but not a helpless one, and in watching her grow and overcome so many trials she becomes an immensely relatable and empathetic character. She keeps your attention from cheap sex appeal, but for the fact she’s a believable and well acted character; flawed and broken by the events around her, but never beaten by them. It’s a shame the others characters didn’t receive nearly the same level of development, though for what they are they provide enough of a narrative hook to be memorable. If I had any issue with the story, it’s that it disappointingly falls back on the series trademark supernatural elements in the latter half, which came off as almost silly in such a realistic and brutal world. But even then, the plot moves at such a quick pace and so much velocity that it remains almost absurdly compelling the entire way through, making it easy to gloss over an occasional lack of exposition to just enjoy the ride.\n\nWhere TR has seen the most growth over past games though, is in the refinement and broadening of its mechanics. Combat is no longer a tedious lock on affair, but made up of brutal, intense encounters that are consistently evolving and requiring you to constantly think on your feet as enemies react and attempt to flank you from all sides. For this the auto cover system works shockingly well, causing you to crouch behind objects when enemies are nearby and easily pop in and out as you pop enemies off. It’s fast and feels incredibly fluid, never once breaking on me as similar systems have in the past, but instead given me one less thing to worry about so I can focus my attention elsewhere.\n\nThis would mean little if the gunplay wasn’t excellent, but to Crystal Dynamics credit they’ve crafted some of the most satisfying third person shooting of any game I’ve played in recent memory. Your arsenal is limited, but it’s composed solely of the weapons you will actually need, chief among them an amazing bow which works brilliantly as both a stealth weapon and a powerful killing machine if you’re spotted. It defines the combat in TR and gives it its own identity that I’ve yet to tire from.\n\nThe other most prominent part of the experience is the Uncharted-esq platforming (I tad ironic considering where that game got most of its roots), which if anything is scaled back from what it used to be but is made up for with how intuitive and fast movement has become. There is no extraneous platforming to be found here, but a focused and dynamic moveset that works with the environment to direct you where to go and gives you no trouble getting there. It really cannot be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the often confusing, terribly imprecise level traversal of even Crystal Dynamics’s prior TR game, Underworld. I never once had to fuss with the camera or controls, which is more than I can say of even most of TR’s contemporaries.\n\nWrapping this altogether is an open world that finds the sweet spot between so large it becomes overwhelming to navigate, and too small you lose all sense of scale. It’s distinct and enjoyable to explore, packed with secrets that actually mean something and are used to flesh out the world past the core plot.\n\nAnd less you somehow forget, this is an absolutely astonishing looking game, with a recognizable art style and some incredible environmental effects. Watching a building be torn apart by violent winds, or fire engulf a ship is jawdropping, even more so when it’s viewed through a wonderfully cinematic camera that escalates even simple scenes into something you can’t look away from. It’s simply gorgeous, and has been scarily well optimized so much so that my mid-range PC barely flinched as I began turning settings up well past what I expected I could.\n\nTomb Raider might not be what you expect, but it’s a game that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. Crystal Dynamics has managed to once again salvage a series and brought it to a height I didn’t think was possible. It’s a stunning adrenaline rush, that does as much for Lara’s character as it does for rejuvenating the franchise, which by the end had left me with a lack of words past a barely audible “wow”.\n\nDisclaimer: this review covers only the single player portion of Tomb Raider.","September 18, 2014","true","19.6"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","35","40","0","4"

What's more is that this game "Overwhelmingly Positive". There's no way that people will read my review objectively.\n\nThis was not a bad game. No crashes, bugs, graphical anomalies, indeed it does look very impressive.\n\nFor me it was the gameplay. It was just a very linear story. You will move from A to B to C. Somewhere in between those you might be able to collect a few Easter eggs -literally, there are eggs you can collect- but they don't serve any purpose.\n\nTo clarify a bit: when I say linear, compare this to two other games that take place on island environments: Just Cause 2 and Far Cry 3. In both of those games the Island is yours to explore and do what you want with. In this game you don't have that option. Often the puzzle you just solved will block the way you came leaving you with one way forward.\n\nThis is where I wish Steam offered an "It's alright" option.

It has its strengths and especially the first half is mostly very enjoyable, but the second half is pretty much just an interactive Hollywood action movie with a teaspoon of adventuring thrown in. You get more adventure pleasure by orders of magnitudes for the same amount of money if you buy some LoK or older TR titles at once.\n\nThe immersion is mostly very good, with gorgeous graphics, well-done level design and a convincing soundscape, sometimes dented by the clichéed characters and story. "Magic" is a pretty lazy deus ex machina, and it's thrown around very liberally here.\n\nThe game seems to have been designed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in mind, because activating Lara's "instinct" negates all need to think about what to do and where to go, and the tombs are mostly a joke. The first three are moderately challenging, the last ones are actually amongst the easiest aprts of the game. Calling them puzzles is an insult to puzzling really. They're really more of an afterthought to justify the title, as the tacky "Tomb raided!" congratulatory text shows.\nLooking for the collectibles provides the main bulk of adventuring challenge, because a minority of them are hidden well, but mostly the way to them is just "complicated" to stall time (run up there, jump down there, slide down there, climb up there) instead of hard. Because of Lara's instinct finding out which is the right way is also a no-brainer. So unless you're very disciplined and never use the instinct function (the hardest difficulty does not deactivate it), this game has next to no adventuring challenge.\n\nThe weapon upgrade system is interesting in the beginning, but overall it's pointless and won't noticeably affect your playstyle or combat success. Upgrading for the sake of upgrading.\n\nAs mentioned before, the first half is mostly adventuring with a bit of fighting, like you're used to from TR games, but in the second half you will have many moments where enemies just constantly pour down on you like you're playing an old school arcade shooter, and some stationary wave-challenges. The last one in the monastery is the biggest and also the most infuriating one. It was actually the last straw that made me decide to write a negative review.","December 11, 2013","false","16.6"," 128 of 207 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","128","207","0","0"

I've never cared about the Tomb Raider franchise or Lara ever before. This game made me feel some empathy for her character and adventure.\n\nThis game, while riddled with problems, is pretty fun for the most part. The story plays out like a bad early 90's movie. The side characters are horribly written and annoying as hell. I crossed my fingers for them to all die. The only good characters are the Crofts. It doesn't really make sense to have these annoying characters since they do nothing in the game and Lara is the main focus. There are action moments that are bordering ridiculous and entertaining. I found myself either laughing at or laughing with the game. You'll know what I mean with you encounter them. The game only fails when the game tries to make take these scenes with a straight face instead of humor.\n\nThe gameply is a mix of boring boring boring faux-exploration and fun firefights. It's similar to the Zelda or Batman Arkham games. It's a linear game with an open world feeling. You'll open new areas depending on the tools/weapons you're carrying. The puzzles can range from overly simplistic to convolutedly difficult. None of these puzzles are at the very least realistic.\n\nTomb Raider steals a lot from multiple games yet it does a lot well. The cross bow is maybe the best cross bow action I've ever played. You pretty much start with the cross bow yet later in the game you'll have access to other weapons and guns. But I mostly stuck with just the cross bow because it was so much fun. The game is at its best when you're in peril. Either horror-esque moments, survivalist-danger moments, or firefight-action moments. There are several jaw-dropping gorgeous scenes that combine great art direction and scenery that I really did not expect. It's kinda amazing these scenes made it into this game.\n\nFor all the similar game design pitfalls that this game duplicates from other franchises, Tomb Raider builds on the action-adventure platform and makes it its own. Lara is finally cool again. But please make the side characters interesting (or non-existant) and stop with the horrible 90's story-line.","May 17","true","99.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Rather then play as Lara Croft on another adventure to discover lost tombs and treasure, you play as Lara when she was in her younger years (early to mid twenty's I think) and she was not the adventurer type as we know her to be back then.\n\nThe game starts off with the you surviving a ship wreck and having to find your crew mates. Along the way you discover hidden tombs random box's containing salvage material and random items throughout the game to collect.\n\nCrystal Dynamics did yet another amazing job creating another Tomb Raider game. The visuals and graphics alone make this game truly amazing looking. Tomb Raider is an adventure game and that offers weapon upgrades as well as skill upgrades.\n\nThe game plays smoothly with the Xbox 360 controller and the default button setup is well placed for play. Although you can't save the game when ever you like there are camp sites that when you rest the game saves.\n\nWhen you pass by an area with placed you could not get into you will eventually make your way back so that you can access those areas with your upgraded weapon and/or new weapon abilities. The camp sites also let you fast travel from camp site to camp site.\n\nThe map screen when you access it will show locations of the hidden items to find in a given area once you locate the treasure map or enough GPS devises for them to show up.\n\nMy first few hours of play of Tomb Raider I have to say have been really good. There are events in the game that require button mashing to be done in order to succeed and although this makes the game more dynamic I don't like it because it distracts me from watching the event by making me focus on what button is about to be reveled that I need to press with in a second.\n\nRight now the Game of The Year edition is $39.99 Canadian and I would wait for a sale when it $12.49 or so before picking it up because the single player is where the game is really enjoyable. Although the price of $39.99 is a steal there isn't much to offer for multiplayer as there isn't many people playing the multiplay side of the game, plus the single player story is what Tomb Raider is really about.\n\nPro's\nVisually amazing game\nNew take on Lara Croft\nGood amount of hidden tombs\nWeapon upgrading\nCon's\nMultiplayer lacks players\nDLC offers immediate unlocks of skills\n\nCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː","October 10, 2014","true","16.9"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","33","45","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmpororPenguin/recommended/203160/","EmpororPenguin","Emporor Penguin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmpororPenguin/","93 products in account","My opinion: Tomb Raider was an pretty good addition to the series, with only a few overlook-able problems.\n\nI picked up this game during the summer sale, so I had a plethora of time to play it. At the time, it was 75% off, so I picked up a normally $60 game for  $12.49. At the time of writing, it is yet again on sale for 75% off. Is it worth it? My answer is that for this price, it's a steal.\n\nI hadn't played a Tomb Raider game in a while, it must have been a few years ago since I played one, so the chance to explore a reboot of the series excited me, especially at this price. At the start, I had a few problems - the game would crash at the introductory cutscene, and since lore is one of my favorite things in games, I restarted the game and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, and I wasted more time. I ended up skipping the intro and going to YouTube, but this was a prevalent problem. It does crash at some points, save points are usually not that far behind but the long loading screen just made it an annoying inconvenience. But if you're willing to look past a few lost immersion points, then you're in for a hell of a game.\n\nTo start off with, the game looks fantastic. I had my graphics on low because of my sub-par computer, and it still looks amazing. Putting them on ultra would be fantastic. The scenery, and sounds, and little touches make this incredibly immersive if not for the third person perspective. The people move fluidly and realistically as well, I'm not exactly sure but I'm betting they used real life actors to animate the scenes.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/203160/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","This game seems to scream gritty, character-driven survival. The intro has Lara getting captured and using fire to escape from her bonds only to be impaled. Then you use a QTE to rip out the debris from her wound and then as the screen fades you have to search frantically for bandages to heal her up. Then as you escape the caves you are handed a bow, a bow that you need to hunt the animals in order to... level up? Well that’s strange, but at least you have to make choices when you craft it... or not really because there are no consequences when you upgrade, so you just grab everything. At least they don't just magically transform your weapon out of nowhere or have characters just hand you a military grade arsenal, thus taking away the weight of all the work you went through upgrading to this point before being handed said arsenal. Actually they do exactly that.\n\nWell at least they are taking narrative seriously because Lara cries her eyes out as she murders her first attacker... but then the next second she starts building up her resume to be in the next Hotline Miami as she brutally kills everyone without a second thought and there is pretty much a whole tree dedicated to killing things brutally to get bonus experience so that you can unlock more brutal ills to get more experience, and that's just a lazy reward system.\n\nSo for all the grit, realism and seriousness the game seems to put out, Tomb Raider is an average action game at its core. All of the world building the game attempts to set up is taken away quickly as the game rushes to reassure players that they are dealing with familiar mechanics: kill whatever and you make yourself and weapons better. The game also failed to mention that Lara Croft was actually an escaped Weapon X subject, because her super-human healing factor is obviously more important than giving the game some stakes, consequence, or consistency. The game's crafting system is less of a survival element and more of a light RPG element. The salvage you find from bodies and boxes just allow you to easily upgrade your weapons in all number of ways (rather than needing specific material) without any choice or drawback, and she goes from vulnerable, survivor to Rambo faster than she probably snaps a neck.\n\nThe setting of Tomb Raider houses very little tombs, but a lot shoddy craftsman ship and decent staged events. The game looks open world, but really it drags you around from one set piece to another, often closing off paths, and then allows you to go back to certain sections to hunt down collectibles that don’t really add much unless you are into antiquing or mildly interested in history with a distaste for film, books, research,  or museums. It’s a formula that works, that people love: climb a thing that’s falling apart, dangle around stuff precariously, escape explosions/debris/fire/all manner of things by an inch because the script says so and now maybe rolling through rapid water can be added to the mix. It’s alright, it’s not broken, but after a few generations of video games, you think we could come up with a way to really up the spectacle or, better yet, let the players keep more agency as they are caught in these crazy situations. Tomb Raider really has a “been there done that” feeling.\n\nThe storytelling of the game is basic. Lara's character is really just summed up by everyone reminding her she is a Croft and super cool. It also seems like there was some sort of board meeting where they decided to make 90% of Lara’s emotional expressions tears. It’s supposed to be a shortcut for us to care about her, but a genuine connection would have been far more rewarding. Instead of showing Lara cry all the time over people we don’t care about, or situations we can’t relate to, why not create an interesting protagonist? Yes, she is going through lots of stress and loss, but I can hardly feel that for her because I am not connected to her or the rest of the cast. Most of the motivations and traits of the characters are told rather than shown (“I secretly love you” “I am your best friend” “I don’t trust you”), which is lazy, but it is enough to make people that this is groundbreaking. I won't spoil the main plot but it goes from some serious murderer/kidnapping stuff to something rather silly. Mostly the story just dragged about and I forgot who I was trying to kill or save pretty early in the game. No one was really memorable, except Lara Croft, because you can’t wade through the corpses of your enemies for more than 10 minutes before someone reminds you about being a Croft.\n\nSo after all of this, why is it recommended? Well first of all the credits assure me that the developers were sincere in making the best game they could, and I both appreciate and believe that: people need to eat, and they could have done a worse job. Also, Steam only has two categories of reviews, and I don't think too many people are as critical as I am about video games. There is an over-reliance on quick time events, gratuitous violence that totally contradicts prior character traits (which are in short supply already), most of the gameplay is a string of set pieces with many movements being small scenes that take away player control, and there is a significant lack of tombs to raid, but it’s not boring. It’s a great looking game with lots of explosions and crumbling sets, and it’s easy to pick up and play. If you can just accept that the game is shallow, it's fun enough so you will probably finish it before you realize it was nothing new or fantastic.\n\n\nThe afterthought-level multiplayer is really just shoehorned in though, like they were forced to put it in at the last minute.","December 18, 2015","true","20.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","21","25","10","0"

The expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. A bloodthirsty, strange cult shows up to the shipwreck and tries to capture and kill the 'outsiders.' Lara soon discovers that the cult is led by a man named Mathias. Lara narrowly escapes capture at the hands of Mathias's men and must track down her friends and escape the island.\nThe gameplay is where the game shines. Throughout the course of the game, Lara comes across a bow, and finds a handgun, machine gun, and shotgun. The weapons can be upgraded with the use of salvage, which you can find in crates, lockers, enemy corpses and animal corpses. You can also upgrade your skills with XP which you gain through story progression, killing enemies and animals, finding collectibles and solving puzzles. The weapons and skills can be upgraded at Campfires, which also allow the player to fast travel back to areas which you have visited before.\nYou have to solve Mini-puzzles to open up a new path. Fire, wind, gravity, and rope arrows are just a few elements that are used throughout the game. Lara can climb rock walls and use valves with the help of a climbing axe, shoot rope arrows to create ziplines and much more.\nThe Enemy AI is smart and will use cover and fire to their advantage. Quicktime events are often used in cases where Lara is captured or attacked by a wolf and they are pretty intuitive. Tombs are also in the game, but they are optional to get XP and salvage bonuses.\nThere is also a multiplayer part. It consists of 4 game modes, Rescue, Team Death Match, Cry for Help and Free For All. Basically in all competitive modes the survivors will fight against the scavengers.\nThe graphics are gorgeous. There is nothing to complain about.\nThe ambient sound is well done.

Overall plot is stupid, the lore and its use are laughable, exploration is non-existant.\n\nWell, visuals are good and it's polished, it's fine while it lasts. Good product in that regard, I guess. But then there is the sequel, and then there is the franchise sprawing endless horde of sequels based around good old formula "more of the same".\n\nAnd that's not even something that really saddens me. What saddens me is the fact, that the genre I loved is dead and this Tomb Raider reboot was the last nail in its coffin. It's success marked the path for its sequels and bland copycats.\n\nWasn't it Tomb Raider, it would've been something else, I guess. Still, overall picture sickens me.\n\n\n---\n\nSorry for my poor english if it somehow alienated you or something.","August 11, 2015","false","28.9"," 123 of 207 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","123","207","10","14"

This one was a quite intersting game. The story takes place on a japanese island called Yamatai whcih was ruled by Himiko. When the Endurance ship came close to the island, it was suddenly attacked by a storm. The survivals of the Endurance crew are fighting for survival just like Lara Croft who becomes a hardened survivor during the gameplay. I found the game graphics very nice. The single player experience was good for me. Some game crashes, bugs and glitches still exists, but not too many game crashes. It includes a wide variety of weapons including bows, assault rifles, shotguns and pistols. During the gameplay at basecamps Lara can upgrade her skills and weapons. Weapons can be upgraded with either salvages or weapon parts that are scattered across Yamatai. For faster skill upgrades you Lara must kill enemys with headsots that gives more XP points than regular kills. The multiplayer experience was worse than the single player. Multiplayer part of the game is full with bugs and crashes. Most of the the time game lags due to P2P connection. 5 maps come with multiplayer as a default. Of course map numbers can be increased, if you buy DLC maps that are either come as a DLC or if you buy the Game of the Year Edition. Weapons and characters can be purchased with salvages which can be collected during the match. There are 2 factions. The Survivors and the Solarii. Both factions have advantages and disadvanatges. In general I found this game very good, however it does not remind me about older Tomb Raider games like Tomb Raider I, II, III. The early Tomb Raider games were much harder than Tomb Raider 2013. Mainly because of solving hard puzzles without help. This game features only a few puzzles which are not hard to solve, cause objects are highlighted if you don't know how to solve it. Game can be finished in a couple of hours. If you are looking for a challenge buy the very early Tomb Raider games, which are the classic ones and takes more time to finish. In general this game worths a try.","September 29, 2015","true","266.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","24","32","8","5"

Note: Prequiste, I have played every single TR release, and this scores second besides Unfinished Business in being the shortest Single Player campaign I have ever played.\n\n(2) Deviates from the traditional puzzle solving mechanic's presented to us from the previous Tomb Raider franchise. Thanks to the survival instinct feature "puzzles"(dare I even call them that), are pretty much a walk in the park.\n\n(3) QTE(aka quick time events), due to these addtional gameplay mechanic's the overall game feels more like Uncharted with simply a female protaganst.\n\n(4) Grindfest - Nothing but killing hoards of enemies, lather, rise, repeat till you eventually reach the next area.  Warning: The ending will leave you thinkng:  "Wth, thats it?"\n\nFinally, overall the game is fantastic on it's shear graphical prowess alone, but due steams not so wonderful rating system being limited to a simple yeah or nay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/recommended/203160/","theevilbob","TheEvilBob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/","438 products in account","Stay clear.\n\nThis isn't a Tomb Raider game. Don't expect to be adventuring or solving puzzles. The only puzzle is who thought this farce was a good idea. There's some good aspects but not enough to call it anything but a glistening turd.\n\nThe graphics are decent, particularly for a console port; I'd complain about a oddly small light-sphere given off by your torch but that's probably just a poor style choice. Croft is also more "realistically" proportioned than you might remember - it wouldn't bother me if she started out this way but is smacks of political correctness which is just another form of censorship.\nIt's got a story too; it won't blow you away but more than you might expect. I'd say about what you'd get from a typical but well-done Hollywood action offering. Of course the story is given partially through items you have to find so if you miss something it wont ruin things but it will limit some of the depth they managed to put together.\n\nThe issues undo any good from the narrative though. Remember those pretty graphics? Remember how it's a console port? Those things don't go together for a reason and the only way this was pulled off was by making this a hallway. There are no wide expanses or open planes, you're confined to a very linear, limited, unimaginative path. There's no zone that feels bigger than 50 cubic meters. Enjoy just pushing forward, there's going to be a lot of it.\nLets not forget audio. The score isn't bad, I'll listen to it by itself and see how it stacks up as music but it's a competent component of the game. The rest of the foley work is questionable at best. Things like the rain sound find, then hooves of a deer running past seem like it must be carrying several ton on its back. The jarring moments aren't often but are distracting when they happen. People always underestimate good sound.\n\nIf quicktime events are the domain of the lazy and stupid then the designers of this game came up with all their ideas in brief moments where they slip out of a coma and draw something with a dull crayon. The game is constantly taking control away from you, often for just a few moments and with no reason, just to show you Croft slightly winded or climbing to the top of a ledge and then, steps later, a quicktime event. It's how half the combat takes place and it's not just a single event either but a chain of button events you must mash, alternate between, or correctly time; getting through these sequences is about as close to a puzzle as you're going to see.\nWhich is the next issue - where the hell are the puzzles? It's a Tomb Raider game but don't expect to have any need to be skilled at jumping. Can you push left and jump at the same time? Maybe hit 'E' to grab on? You're all set! Don't think you're going to have to push things around, place artifacts or spend more than five minutes thinking about how to pull something off, the level isn't big enough to have something so complex! No, you'll just have to look around, maybe press 'Q' which reveals anything important anyway, you'll be out of there in a jiffy!\n\nNor is the AI impressive, but it's probably for the best since you've got almost nowhere to run if you're spotted. Just arrow them in the head and there isn't much of a need to level up your weapons it seems. Oh yeah, levelling up - you slowly get a little better at some things! It adds nothing and doesn't seem to be timed with Croft gaining confidence or anything so literary. Maybe it will start to show later in the game but, as of this writing, I'm about a quarter done and feel nothing but the urge to complete it so that I can see how it unfolds and don't feel like I've totally wasted my money. I'd have felt like ♥♥♥♥ if I'd paid full price for this.\n\nI might update this again if something changes or I think of anything more but, given the [bought?] meta-critic score, it felt like people should be warned. My opinion of this game doesn't even see the light from whatever galaxy this game deserves almost a 90 in. Subtract 60 and you're about right.\n\nEdit: Forgot to update on finishing. Opinion didn't change much but the QT events dropped off at least. Can't understand the love many have given this title, even if this hadn't been called Tomb Raider, which comes with exepctations, I don't think I'd have found it more than middling.","May 10, 2013","false","16.5"," 42 of 65 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","42","65","0","1"

The game offers an immensely immersive gaming experience as it throws you into a game world with an array of visually impressive environments, many cinematic camera angles and an exceptional score composed by Jason Graves. The single player campaign offers a captivating plot (although not the best) with friendly and appealing characters, enthralling combat and gameplay alongside collectables and a point + reward system for Lara’s abilities and salvage to upgrade the weapons she uses.\n\nThe game visually is a treat for the eyes, well optimised and it certainly helps having a decent enough rig to play it at the settings that allow you to experience the graphical fidelity that this game has to offer (I found this game more enjoyable with frame rates 50 and higher). Crystal Dynamics know how to immerse a player (especially me) as Yamatai’s environments had such a fine level of detail I found myself in awe as I ventured into the island. The game constantly has that atmospheric vibe, giving you that sense of adventure wherever you go, whether it be a forest populated with wildlife and foliage, or tombs with skulls strewn across the ground, it is somehow always present.\n\nThe gameplay and combat is enjoyable for the most part, you do realise it becomes somewhat linear half way into the game but it does not hinder the experience in any way. I especially appreciated the creativity and thought that was put into Lara’s combat, stumbling and then flinging dirt into your enemies eyes to immobilise them for just the right amount of time to give them that final blow, or evading an enemy’s melee attack at just the right time to then go on to stab them in the knee with your arrows, allowing you to kill them right then and there if you have the correct abilities unlocked, or giving them a blow to the head with an arrow or bullet.\n\nQuick Time Events or QTE’s are present in this game, and being honest I am not one for QTE’s especially if they are game breaking or not done right. But luckily for us players Crystal Dynamics did a good job at including them. You don’t and won’t find yourself doing a QTE at every possible moment in the game, instead they seem to be wisely placed into parts of the game (mostly coupled with cinematic sequences) and add to the overall immersion and feel that the game manages to radiate.\n\nStealth unfortunately is not seen in Tomb Raider (2013) at all, it is possible to take out enemies silently with the bow, (which is one of 4 weapons in the game excluding Lara’s pick axe) however you’ll most likely be able to take out 2-3 enemies before one of the other npc’s spot you, which some if not most of the time is absurd as to how they even know where you are when you could be in a tall tree or in really good cover.                                                                                                   Also the game mostly puts you in situations where you always find yourself guns blazing, killing a whole brigade of enemies, and I won’t lie it will make you feel like a bad a*s.\n\nI spent most of my time in this game looting bodies and looking for salvage or collectibles which I greatly enjoyed, particularly because it gave me a reason to venture out into the game world and bathe myself in the beauty of Yamatai for a while longer. I found collecting and finding the relics (that require you to do some extensive searching just like the other collectibles) somewhat pleasurable, especially due to the fact of being able to listen to Lara’s presumptions as to what age/period that said relic may be from and what it might of been used for, it just lets you know that Lara knows her sh*t as an archaeologist.\n\nFinding collectibles also give you survivor points which can then be spent on unlocking dozens of abilities for Lara, from 3 different classes/categories. Other ways to earn survivor points can be from Eliminating enemies, Completing received tasks, Finding secrets or Exploring tombs, which I greatly enjoyed as exploring each tomb you will find out that each is unique, and each has a puzzle for you to figure out in order to gain that much wanted loot. There were few tombs in this game so it left me feeling lost after completing them all.\nFinding salvage on the other can be used to upgrade your weapons, from giving your bow an explosive kick, to silencing your rifle, buffing up your shotgun or making your pistol more efficient. Each weapon has 3 modifications that you will gradually find throughout the campaign leaving you with quite the arsenal.\n\nCrystal Dynamics have created some sort of treasure that I feel honoured to have played, seeing our new Lara Croft (voiced by Camilla Luddington) adapt from a frightened and vulnerable survivor, to the Tomb Raider we know and love, is profoundly compelling. The game has such a full-hearted and ardent score that compliments the game so very well. It was so awesome to watch the final clip of the game as ‘The Tomb Raider’ played in the background as Lara says “I’m not going home”, after that I just must hand it to Jason Graves for composing music that was such a pleasure to listen to during my time with the game.\n\nOverall Tomb Raider (2013) is Truly Immersive and Atmospheric, with a Lara Croft that I not just care for, but love. The game after completion has left me feeling empty, so I just hope that Rise of The Tomb Raider coming out later this year manages to be the righteous successor this game deserves.\n\nOpiziite – 9.8","September 16, 2015","true","14.4"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","1"

Crystal Dynamics/Square Enix has done a great job in giving the series a new lease of life. Sure, the puzzles will never have you scratching your head for hours like the classics, but the visuals, atmosphere and effects more than make up for it, giving Lara her first real Hollywood-esque adventure, something that she more than deserves.\n\nThe story sees a young inexperienced Lara thrown into a scary and unforgiving world, as she battles the harsh conditions and even harsher bad guys after she becomes shipwrecked on an Island. The adventure takes her on a brutal journey that will see her flourish into the skilled Tomb Raider that we all think of when we hear the name, Lara Croft.\n\nThe game is very well polished and you can appreciate the minor details because of it. Little things like Lara brushing her hands across walls in tight areas as well as the effortless nature of the climbing and jumping mechanics. The game is honestly one of my favourite third person adventure games to play. It just feels so good to control Lara, even with a K+M. The way she traverses the world, jumps, turns, it all feels amazingly solid and responsive. The sound and voice acting is also of a particular high standard, giving that high budget, Hollywood feel. There are certain elements that some users may not appreciate, scripted QTE's and shaky action camera angles can frustrate and disorientate, but for the most part, any action adventure fan who appreciates an epic Indiana Jones style experience will be right at home.\n\nThere is a nice, although basic, upgrade system where investing the salvage you collect from the island gives you better weapon damage, or upgraded bow, which help reinforce the feel that you are growing and getting more confident as time goes on, much like Lara herself. There is also some basic hunting where you can gain XP, but it's simple, nothing on the level of a Far Cry 4 for example.\n\nMultiplayer is there, although not very active now. It was a fun experience back in 2013 when the community was active; it was certainly up there with Uncharted MP and superior to Metal Gear Online 3. Personally I wouldn't even consider this game if you are thinking about it from a MP perspective.\n\nIf you are playing for the first time in preparation for Rise of the Tomb Raider, it is definitely worth a go. It will help you understand Lara’s character and backstory, and tie in nicely to the sequel.","January 27","true","114.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/203160/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Tomb Raider is an adventure-action third-person shooter released in 2013. Tomb Raider was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game is set in an island within the Dragon's Triangle, which is south of Japan. Tomb Raider is an excellent and extremely entertaining game for any gamer that enjoys adventure games combined within a beautiful and tight environment. You, the player, play as Lara Croft, who is an archaeologist that travels to the Dragon's Triangle on an expedition with several other individuals. This review will cover the campaign, which includes missions, characters and voice acting and the story, features and gameplay, the graphics, sound and performence, and the issues within each category.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is excellent. The campaign is intense and has high-action scenes in a tight environment. A tight environment is essentially a very small environment instead of a wide open space. This fits in with the overall setting and story, as the game is set on an island, so other than the beach there is very minimal open landscapes. So, while travelling to Dragon's Triangle, you end up stranded on the island with Lara having to uncover why and how to overcome it to get off the island. The campaign has plentiful variety in its missions, as each mission is different and accomplishes something different. However, the game is linear with its missions. Despite being linear, the route to complete each objective has alternative routes that take you to places to collect relics, treasuries and learn more about the backstory of the island. Speaking of backstory, the game's side-quests, for instance, collecting journals, add to the story because they provide new insightful information within the island, meaning the side-quests are not filler. These side-quests, which are also in the main missions, have puzzles, which are challenging and fun. I played this game on normal difficulty, which is the middle in easy, normal, and hard. I found it to be relatively decent in difficulty, with it progressively becoming harder. I completed this game in around 9.5 hours.\n\nThe characters are extremely well-done. The characterisation of many characters fit in with the overall stranded on an island storyline. For instance, from the start of the game and progressing through the game one of the members in your crew starts to get crazy and very on edge. Likewise, the characterisation of Lara showcases her toughness and courage. All main characters within the game have a strong sense of purpose and throughout the game add personality elements, which make it easy to invest into their characters - especially the antagonist, Mathias. These characters and their personalities are also accompanied by the brilliant disparate voice acting of all characters. The voice acting fits in perfectly with the variety of atmospheres. For instance, if it is raining and Lara has to yell out to another character you can tell in her higher voice tone, likewise, if she is in extreme pain, you can notice it when she talks.\n\nGameplay/Features:\nThis game utilises a character progression system. You can upgrade your skills and can upgrade your weapons, which prove beneficial. There is three sections in the player upgrade system, which is survivor, hunter, and brawler skills. The hunter and brawler skills prove the most useful and the survivor tree has some nice skills, but mostly is pointless. The survivor tree is not useful because the game is linear, so while you encounter animals, you do not encounter them enough to warrant upgrading those particular skills. The game has plentiful supply of ammo. The climbing is solid. The game is relatively unrealistic in parts. There were cutscenes in which Lara severely hurts herself, but the next day she is miraculously healed. It is somewhat minor, but annoying. The game, as mentioned, has a tight atmosphere, which means the movement can get clunky, slightly disturbing the experience.\n\nGraphics, Sound and Performence:\nI played this game on max settings and what a refreshing experience. The graphics are extremely beautiful. The environment and atmosphere within the game's various weathers are excellent. The game has strong destruction elements that align with the action-packed game. The camera angles within the game are superb. I love the different angles that the game portrays the cutscenes from, which allows for a higher quality gameplay experience. The graphics incorporate very neat and deep touches into the characters. For instance, if Lara falls and slides across rocks, there is grazes and dirt on her body, in amazing detail. Performence is very optimised and I love the fluidity of the game with a constant framerate. I hit a constant 30-45FPS, which had no noticeable performence drops, FPS drops, and the typical stutters when there is a drop in FPS. The sound is beautiful. The light sounds of the wind contrasts the heavy action and it allows for a nice balance.\n\nOverall, this game is superb. I really enjoyed this game and the story within. There were several positives such as the campaign, the content, the graphics, the sound and mostly the gameplay. I did not notice many issues within the game other than what was noted in the gameplay section. This game has a nice length and packs in explosive action. This game is $19.99 and I highly recommend it at full price.\n\nCampaign/Characters: 9.5/10\nGameplay/Features: 8.5/10\nGraphics, Sound and Performence: 9.75/10\nOverall: 9.25/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Just go there, shoot them, get this, do that. Nothing what a "Tomb Raider" game should be. A "Tomb raider" game should be with lots of puzzles, getting stuck somewhere and thinking harder and harder on how to do those puzzle or clear the obstacles. This game just felt normal. Nothing special in it, too simple. Not to mention the "survival instinct" which really throws away the fun of the game. Only parts I liked about the game were the optional tombs.\n\nGraphics were nice, shooting and combat mechanism were nice as well but it doesn't have the "Tomb raider" game feeling. Also the "open world" thing doesn't even matter in this game, if you try to go back you'll find some obstacle blocking the way. So it's mostly story dependant on where to go next.\n\nOverall it was a really nice game but it dissapointed me in many ways.\n\n"Overwhelmingly Positive" my god, kill me please.","December 6, 2015","false","5.1"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","26","38","6","0"

It's a solid game with some stunning visuals and they sure did a good job when modelling and animating Lara, she really looked cool and felt great to control, but that is basically all that stands out. The story is mediocre, at times pretty cheesy, the characters are stereotypes - with Lara being no real exception - and this game is barely anything I remember from my older Tomb Raider times. You fight people mostly, the action is ok but wasn't very challenging on normal difficulty. There is some platforming, but not that much, none of it being really difficult anyway, and the puzzling at it's "heights" requires you only to pull or push a thing or two within a rather easily doable time limit. The optional "tombs" are a joke - slightly bigger caves at best that you can do in a very few minutes only to get some "salvage" you don't really need anyway (see below).\n\nI've heard people call the game a reboot of the series. They are clearly moving away from their roots. That isn't necessarily bad if one can enjoy dozens of quicktime events and narrowly directed gameplay paths and cutscenes in chliché manner (everything Lara climbs breaks, every path she goes soon or later goes up in flames - it's a very predictable manner and was overused in Uncharted as well). I just wish the game had more unique aspects. It felt like a watered down cinematic action title and a very drastic Uncharted clone. Which is kind of funny because Uncharted was called a Tomb Raider clone in the beginning. Funny how things can turn around.\n\nThe game has an XP system and a multiplayer. I don't know. Do they wanted to do it? Is Square Enix pushing them? It doesn't seem very fitting. You upgrade your mostly combat-related skills and weapons through the XP system and through "salvage" which basically serves as money. But if the combat is already easy enough there isn't any need to do that unlike you are a completionist, which I am not by nature. I've only played one multiplayer match thus far, and it looks mediocre too. It's PvP only. Pretty sad. After I was done with Uncharted the online co-op of it made me stick around a lot longer. Tomb Raider lacks that, and since the PvP doesn't look too appealing I will probably not stick around much longer with this game. I'm glad I got it pretty cheap during some sale. And even though I might check out the previous installments - my last one before this reboot title was Tomb Raider 4 - I will be very careful about the next installment in the series.","December 20, 2013","false","29.1"," 154 of 271 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","154","271","0","16"

Even tho there are a couple of the loved and sought after QTE's the story and locations advance fluidly and slowly but surely we see the birth of the survivor.\n\nThe graphics are quite astounding to the point that it gives the island a beauty of nature with the combination of the sound which is also quite well incorporated. As for dialog in the game its quite linear but you are able to talk with the other survivors (also and achieve for it) to get to know them better and learn about them. The voice actors in the game are superb.\n\nThe game offers some DLC but it is mostly maps, weapons and playable multiplayer characters. It's filled with variations of match types and progression systems that you'll see in Call of Duty, Battlefield 3 and other shooter-centric playgrounds. Just so you know, the multiplayer is almost dead. theres a group called Tomb Raider Multiplayer Madness that focuses on the multiplayer and sets dates to play with others.\n\nThe Lara Croft character is very well laid out, the graphics are great, pacing is pulsating (perhaps the best thing about the game) and gameplay is smooth. This is a great prequel, an intense and gritty story of the origins of Lara Croft.\n\n9/10 for this gem of a game.","January 9","true","45.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/203160/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Having never really played any previous game in this franchise, I wasn't really sure what to expect beyond what I had heard second-hand. But apparently this is different - and better - than the past games. I really have no comparison on that point. It reminded me of a cross between Batman Arkham Asylum/City and Assassin's Creed: lots of running around in a big map, getting into a bunch of fights that often require precise timing (QTE's), some platforming/puzzle stuff, and collectibles. Yey.\n\nThe gameplay is good at what it does, and I managed to keep playing it despite my distaste for QTE's and platforming (the former because its boring, the latter because I am bad at it. XD). Story-wise, it is fine, if somewhat predictable (took me about 12 hours to finish the main story). Sadly, some of the characters I like die horribly and the characters I really don't like die horribly to something other than me, so that was a bit of a shame. But aside from that it is a fun little adventure where you go to alot of freaky looking places, fall onto hard surfaces alot, and eventually make it out by doing a crazy run away from danger only to end up in a place similar to where you just left. Pretty sure Lara would have died half a hundred times during the course of this game if it was reality and not a game. But anyone who has played a fair amount of games is probably used to that by now. XD\n\nOverall I thought it was a good game, even if I could do without the QTE's and the sequences where I have to run or slide down a dangerous area dodging and jumping over stuff. Everything aside from that was fine and mostly enjoyable. So if what I have described here sounds like a game that you would enjoy, then go ahead and pick this up. If not, then I guess don't. Enjoy a crazy adventure on a strange island filled with freaky people for you to shoot at! :o","January 7, 2015","true","21.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","12","13","3","0"

However... Tomb Raider has shot itself in the foot on this one. I have not played other games in this franchise but thats not the point. It doesn't matter to me what style of game this franchise used to make, but rather 'is this game fun to play?'    For me: the answer is no. TR is a well made game with lots of strong elements that is utterly banal to slog through.\n\nIn a nut shell: you play Laura Croft, a strong, intelligent woman who can fight and survive the wilds and traverse any landscape on 'the' island. You can explore the entire island, save your friends from bad guys, solve interdimesional portal hazard while doing free lance acheaology in her spare time. But wait. You are too stupid to grab a coat from a fallen enemy even though you are shivering constantly. Your vast island is really a narrow corridor of trees with one exit at the end of it (and a cull-de-sac somewhere to find some meaningless bauble that has no bearing on your plot). Here is a missed opportunity to upgrade gear. Laura Croft is an explorer so finding the loot that upgrades her gear makes perfect sense and would add meaning to the 'Raiding' . Instead Laura Craft would rather spend time at the campfire whittling a +2 celtic knot texture onto her bow while her freinds are captive and suffering.\n\nExploration? Bah! Being a turd in a tunnel still sucks even if the tunnel is pretty. Very linear progression with token exploration.\n\nPuzzles. I like puzzles but I find this trope in the TR franchise boring and imersion-killing. These type of puzzles always leave me asking who spent hours setting all this up? or who lit all these candles, or who thought doing this would be fun for the player. This franchise does not have to remake the same game over and over with better graphics. It could go in a whole new direction but....no wait...I see the exit....trudge on! Also where is the challenge when I can hit 'Detective Mode' and the game shows me the MacGuffin dongle I have to twerk in order to leave the 'Puzzle room of tedious Doom'. If so many players get frustrated and give up (going straight to the hint button) then perhaps the whole idea is not worth it from the get go.\n\nCombat. One of strongest aspects of the game. I enjoyed the combat system and found the fighting smooth and fluid. And then it ends. Very short fights that get me going then leave me hanging.\n\nQuickTime Hell. This trend in lazy game design has got to stop. Period. Here is why.\n\nWhile I am playing through my avatar I feel power and agency. I have skills and I can think of alternative solutions to the problems. I am in control I am a Hero, an Adventurer with freedom and imagination and...    nope, a wolf bit your leg.\nNow I am helpless, on a countdown timer to doing the one very spefic thing the Devs thinks I should do. So: button mash or hit 'E' or maybe 'F' next time. No I mashed too soon: respawn, I shoot the wolf with my really cool pistol that I just upgraded with Wolves-bane ammo....oh I guess I can't do that: die, respawn I run away: not allowed. Ten pointless deaths later I somehow mangle my keyboard to get past this interuption of pacing and flow feeling incompetent and used. Fun stuff!\n\nPacing. I'm playing a cerebral puzzle game, no I watching a quicktime movie, no I playing a cool shooter, no I'm crafting at the campfire. This kills the flow of the game and constanly breaks imersion.\n\nControl. See a theme here. I can't control my character, or the camera or the pace. I feel like I am on a raft being tossed by the waves with no rudder, just current.\n\nTombs. Basically a short passage, a simple puzzle, a Chest-O-Loot. Return by door you entered. Sad...very sad.\n\nPro:\n-Beautiful enviroments and good animations. The  modeling is very good and Laura is statue-perfect avatar who is very easy on the eyes.\n-Fun combat.\n-Decent puzzles.\n\nCon:\n-Lack of pacing and control.\n-Zero meaningfull exploration.\n-Turd in a tunnel. Just being squeezed slowly through.\n-Loot is a tripping hazzard.\n\nIn conclusion. When did skill and reflexes get replaced with button mashing? Don't gamers risk repetative strain disorder already? We need more control with a minimum of button strikes, not the other way around. How can I use memory or imagination to get better at a game when the magic button keeps changing from 'E' to 'F' to 'mash arrows' to jump through invisible hoop. I can never predict the right response and gain ability. Rather, I am made to wait for my cue to act, this way, not that, no...wrong button, sorry you took too long, do it...now using your main finger...this way....ARGH!!!  Just Friggin let go of my hands and let me play the damn game!\n\nWe came here to Play a game , not Watch a cut-scene slide-show.","October 18, 2015","false","5.8"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","1"

Well in comparison to the over-produced Angelina Jolie debacles, any competently produced movie offering would look favorable but what I'm trying to say is that Tomb Raider is one of those AAA games that are incredibly well-made but without any hooks that would constitute a must-buy. As gripping as Story Mode gets, from a game design standpoint you're on a linear path with QTE challenges, scripted non-repeatable enemy encounters and a few puzzles so easily solved they're barely worth mentioning. It's an interactive movie where you are the hero.\n\nYou are Lara Croft and you are fighting for your survival. You can't actually starve to death or catch your death in cold and you regenerate from bullet wounds after a short period of time so in this case "survival" means tons of enemies out to get you and all you have are a bow and arrow. And a pistol. And an axe, a combat shotgun and a machine gun. Kinda undermines the whole point, really. Combat is actually the bees-knees with flawless controls in a cover-and-shoot environment against determined foes out to plant a machete into your skull. Your melee options are rather lacking, leading to tense gameplay where one fights desperately for every inch of personal space against maniacs with firebombs trying to flush you out from cover.\n\nI guess the "hook" of this game is that it's a Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider fans will buy this product sight unseen and call it a shining beacon in the franchise. That's fair, but what about the rest of us? Well if you're like me and you barely touched the series, Tomb Raider is certainly more accessible than any of the previous Playstation installments. It's downright easy, even. The reboot mixes realism and fantasy in equal measures so as to build genuine dread at your desperate plight while still being respectful to the setting established throughout previous Tomb Raider titles.\n\nNeedless to say, Tomb Raider multiplayer is dead in 2016. I tried it, had a nice 15 minute conversation in the lobby then wrote that part of the game off. I cannot recommend this game at full price but I couldn't endorse simply watching a Let's Play either. And because story is such a central part of the product, every scene that you witness prior to play takes away some of the value from your purchase. Price it as you would a blockbuster, with popcorn. I'd like to thank Tonton Mori for the giveaway as I finished this during a long three day weekend and I cannot say that I regret the experience.\n\nFinally, a word needs to be said about the gruesome death scenes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PreussensGloria/recommended/203160/","PreussensGloria","Red Bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PreussensGloria/","192 products in account","A great example of a franchise getting ruined by a Publisher shift.  Under Eidos this franchise was fun and energetic, there was variety in gameplay (the motorcycle level in Legends was more fun than this entire game) and the graphics by 2006 (speaking of TR Legends here ) were better, or at least more colorful and appealing to look at.\nThe characters pre 2010 were humorous and likable, now they all are constantly moaning and having emotional breakdowns.  Lara herself is no longer a smart and attractive adventurer, instead there are frequent cutscenes that try to shove her as this "fragile stronggirl against evil white men".  Speaking of white men, why is there an "evil cult" of insane white men on a Japanese-Chinese island?\nAlso how come I at first sight knew the blonde professor was gonna be a traitor? The only members of your "crew", who consist of your jap college girlfriend, a hawaiian cook, a strong black woman, a nerdy white guy, a scottish captain, your english mentor, the aforementioned blonde professor, that survive are the first three. See a pattern here?\nAlso you shoot not a single tiger,leopard or other endangered animal in this game.\nThe games world is constantly shaking and the keeps falling apart... also theres a lot of quicktime events.\nLook Square Enix, I know you wanted to make this another movie but it just feels like a chore. Also whats with the mechanic of hunting a deer at the beginning but that never being any useful? Why should I loot rabbits or wolves, if I don't even need that?\nWhy does everything looks so grey and dead, it really made me depressed.   The Eidos Tomb Raider games or even the Core games  were never this dull looking .. why didn't you just use that as a reference?   But I guess that wasn't your goal. You wanted to make another Uncharted, but minus all the color and fun that those games had.\nI really am disappointed by this game.  Even the artifacts you find all seem to be uninteresting things like hand fans.  The world in this game looks  a lot like Skyrim, but at least in Skyrim the world was vast and not as linear as this. In that game I actually felt interested to explore caves - in this I just ran past them.  Even looking at Lara's ♥♥♥ isn't great because she comes off as a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that hates men. It's like looking at the ♥♥♥ of a feminist.\nMaybe its the fact that these characters are just so unlikable that I wanted to get this over with.   Just stop pushing down emotions and telling me how to feel about these characters.  Unlike intended, the only one I cared about was that blonde professor who was discarded in a brutal fashion - but maybe just because he was so comical and unrealistic.\n\nVerdict:\nOnly buy this game if you want to play a forgettable, grey movie-like 3rd person shooter with bad characters and tons of quicktime events and SJW "strong independent woman" stuff .\nIf you are interested about the Tomb Raider franchise I say you should pick up Tomb Raider: Anniversary or any of the older games, you will have much more enjoyment with those.\n","October 20, 2015","false","8.7"," 57 of 97 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","57","97","4","6"

The game to which I could not wait. It is the only part of the series "Tomb Raider," which to me curious and I finished it 2 times. Graphically the game delighted my eyes, and the appearance of Lara was simply brilliant! The game has multiple locations, the mass of enemies to defeat, weapons that can be upgraded, character development options, a lot of things to find, tombs to visit, all kinds of challenges and really great epic end. In short, the famous archaeologist Lara Croft as a result of the tragedy that happened on the ship wakes up on an island called Yamatai. Desperately trying to find friends, at a time when fight for your live, experiencing a lot of pain and suffering, she trying to get to know about the history Queen Himiko and solve the mystery of the island.  The game has the characteristics of survival, allows you to fight against different enemies, starting with animals and ending with the warriors armed to the teeth with guns and other things like that. As for me, the game is too wonderful, when I played it felt as if it was a dream because the game was too beautiful for me, was in her everything for I expected. My rating for this game is 1000-10.

This game also seems to play itself, rather than having US play it... for example, it expects you to use your wits to solve puzzles, to look around the environment for clues on how you should proceed, yet holding down 'Q' makes all of your 'clues' light up in bright yellow. Not only are puzzles solved for you, but your path is also pre-determined. The world is conveniently built to accomodate for your climbing needs, and while Assassin's Creed is notorious for that, at least it has a huge and enthralling world to discover. Tomb Raider just punishes you with death if you try to take a shortcut or make a jump that the game didn't intend.\n\nThe game also attempts to convince you that survival is a key aspect of this experience, although there are little to no elements of it. You don't need to feed Lara, you don't need to build shelters to protect her against the harsh climate of the island, and her well-being isn't affected by anything other than gunshots. Think of how much better this game could've been had they actually respected the criteria of a TRUE survival experience. Unfortunately, this is merely another generic third-person shooter with a fancy coat of paint. I felt less competent for every minute I spent playing this game, which is a real shame because this game had great potential.\n\nAll-in-all, I can't say that I recommend this game. I can see why some would enjoy it, but it just didn't make the cut for me.","July 28, 2013","false","16.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

So  I decided to review TR's Multiplayer instead.\nLet's start with matchmaking itself... To say the truth, I've seen way better. Although there are several matches running, the game sometimes seems to be unable to find any matches, but when you try to join a session your friend is in, there's no problem to join. When you finaly start joining a game, it MAY happen to you, that nothing will happen... I mean literally nothing. You see just loading screen with beginner tips'n'tricks for hours if you don't quit your game (Via ctrl+alt+del,.... or sometimes helps if you try to join your friends game through steam library)\nWell, take in mind that above described things just might happen, it does not happen every time :)\nSo now you are in game, what od you have there?\nMaps\nThere are five basic (and 7 DLC) maps, which are all very beautiful with many great details... Still after 250 hours in-game I sometimes discover some things i had no idea there were. Each of the basic maps has a small special feature, like sand-storm revealing your enemies' positions, submarine's auto-destruct system, which sets remaining time to two minutes and starts destruction of the entire map granting kills to whoever triggered it,... There are also many sweet traps you can prepare for your enemies, starting with snare trap and ending with making a barbecue of them. The maximum number of players per match is 8, that is also the ideal number of players for map, because the maps were made for 8 players. However quite often you end up in a game with 4 players and it takes forever to find somone.\nCharacters:\nLet's get through this quickly. There are two teams: The Solari and Survivors, both with about 4 starting charcters for you to select and many others that unlock as you level up. There are also 4 DLC characters. Then there are "Zac" and "Scavenger Archer" characters which are xbox exclusive, however sometimes you discover someone playing with them on PC.\nNow, let's shoot some guns.\nLike I mentioned that characters are divided to Solari and Survivors, the same goes for guns. Both groups have unique weaponry. For your characters you create loadouts which consist of primary weapon, secondary weapon, special weapon, survival skill and offensive skill. Weapons, skills and more loadouts unlock as you level up.\nIn primary weapons you can find bows, which serve as sniper rifles in this game, assault rifles and shotguns. In secondary weapons are hanguns, submachine gun (yep,.... just one) and a neat sawed-off shotgun. In specials you can find stuff like grenades, flashbangs, napalm, land mines,... Survival skills allow you to take less damage from a certain weapon type. Offensive skill on the other side should help you stalk others.\nAll primary and secondary weapons can be uprgaded in a certain way. Eg. greater clip size for 1911 or shorter draw time for your bow. There are also 6 DLC weapons.\nWell, now... What's the worst about multiplayer? The community!\nWhen I started with this game, there were many players... Now there are just very few left. And why is that? Again the community! New players simply stop playng this game because of the old ones. More and more I just find matches with a team of maxed out players camping in front of the enemy spawn, while in the other team there are new players (max lvl 20) who get slaughtered whenever they try to leave. C'mon! If this happend to me when I tried MP for the first time I would probably just give up any atempts of trying it ever again. So. match is over, new players surprisingly still here, game forms new teams, Fair teams. What do maxed out players do? They form the same team they had in the last match! Why? Really?! What's so funny about standing on one place waiting for a head to appear? These players sometimes even complain that you are camping on your spawn! No. This is just nonsence. They kill you whenever you leave it and than are surprised you don't want to leave... Best thing about that is that usually one uf them uses a bow for instant kills, another has a grenade launcher in case you decided to move WHOLE 5 M away from the spawn, third one has the overpowerd Silverballer with rapid fire and the last one picked up a Super Weapon (yeah, there are super weapons- Competition bow and minigun), and not to forget mines at every single exit.\nWell, let's end this. The Multiplayer has great maps, many great characters, even more awesome weapons and... players.\nIn the end, my review must be positive, because creators of this game are not responsible for its players. If you are new to this game, I definitely recommend starting with singleplayer and when you decide to test multiplayer, don't get discouraged by the behaviour of some players, there are still some players with sence of fair play. Well, good luck, Tomb Raiders!","April 15, 2015","true","260.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Crystal Dynamics latest entry is simply called Tomb Raider, placing a very young Lara Croft in the spotlight. This is not the seasoned veteran with short-shorts and dual pistols. This is a fragile girl on her first big adventure. In the introduction, she makes a decision to head into the dangerous waters known as the Dragon’s Triangle, and her entire crew is shipwrecked on an island, fighting for their very survival.\n\nTomb Raider twists and turns through its narrative with an array of emotions. Lara starts off soft and caring - even apologetic - to enemies and animals when she first kills them. Over time though, she hardens and becomes more comfortable with what she has to do. This is where I felt things become disconnected. Lara never enjoys the mass murder she is committing, in fact she still acts hesitant until the end, but it never stops her from mowing down entire camps of enemies. It is a weird dichotomy that I only overcame by suspending my disbelief.\n\nOutside of that, the story is told exceptionally well. I actually cared what happened to Lara, and her journey became my own. I felt that her growth over the course of the game was well told, though I wish the same narrative care were extended to the other characters. The central villain started off well, but was never fleshed out, and Lara’s crew was forgettable outside of Jonah, the ship’s cook, who I couldn’t help but really like.\n\nWhat makes Tomb Raider so special is that it nails the most important part of gaming, the actual gameplay. Everything feels exactly the way it should. The combat is pure bliss; better than almost any other third-person shooter on the market. The platforming feels great, and I never had trouble traversing across chasms or up the side of cliffs. The controls simply fall into place on every level. Crystal Dynamics has fine-tuned every aspect of the game to feel just right, and their work has paid off.\n\nThe mixture of combat, platforming and puzzle solving has definitely shifted for this entry in the series. In previous installments, it was always more about exploration and platforming, but now the combat takes the driver’s seat. It is a bit disappointing that there aren’t more sequences of actual “tomb raiding”, but since the combat is so satisfying, it is hard to complain about it.\n\nAside from the combat, Lara has quite a few tricks up her sleeve. The bow and arrow are used to kill animals and defend against enemies. Outside of the tutorial, I found little use for hunting animals besides harvesting salvage and XP. Lara has a “survival instinct” enabled by tapping the left bumper to turn the screen monochrome, while also highlighting enemies, animals and items in the environment. It’s similar in application to Batman’s “detective vision.” Once upgraded, this makes finding collectibles almost too easy, removing some of the fun of stumbling across them.\n\nWhat I did love was the Metroid-style progression the game delivers. Progression through the story unlocks additional gear that opens up new ways to explore the environment. For example, the rope arrow is used on specific wooden posts, creating pathways across chasms and into new areas. This continues throughout the duration of the game, and constantly drove my sense of exploration and excitement for new equipment.\n\nLara also now levels with a traditional XP and skill point system. Skill points can be used to purchase new abilities in three areas. The first is survival, and consists of letting you earn more XP and salvage from enemies and animals, as well as being able to see items using your survival vision. The second set of upgrades involves things like increased ammunition carrying capacity, while the last one focuses on combat and finishing moves. There are some truly brutal finishers Lara can execute.\n\nThe main game is a solid eight to ten hours if you skip out on a large portion of the collectibles, but there is certainly plenty that kept me coming back. The amount of collectibles in the game borders on excessive. Each area has a specific challenge like lighting statues or burning posters, and completion translates into XP. There are also GPS stashes, documents that detail the island’s history and, of course, relics.\n\nTomb Raider is one of those games that I couldn’t help but enjoy. It does so much so well, that I found myself completely immersed. It is only when I stepped back and looked at it from a logical standpoint that the cracks began to show. As I mentioned, the excessive killing feels contradictory to the Lara’s character. She frequently expresses remorse, even after slamming her pickaxe into an aggressor’s skull. The game is also linear, despite Crystal Dynamics’ efforts to evoke the feeling of open-world design.\n\nA lot has been said about the fact that this Tomb Raider comes packaged with an online multiplayer mode, which is a first for the series. I want to stress that even if you never touch it, the game is still worth owning. The competitive modes are merely serviceable. There are traditional loadouts and perks like any other third-person online offering. The selection of maps is decent, and the fantastic shooting from the single player carries over. I just don’t see myself ever playing this online again.\n\nTomb Raider visuals are undeniably impressive.  The game looks fabulous running on high settings. The textures on the characters look amazing, and the frame rate is rock solid nearly all the time. The new TressFX that creates realistic hair is cool to look at, but it created some truly awkward looks on Lara from time to time.This is certainly one amazing looking game, but it also sounds great. The score is brilliant, delivering that big-budget orchestral sound that accompanies a lot of Hollywood movies. Camilla Luddington does an outstanding job voicing Lara, and the rest of the cast compliments her extremely well. The effects are also top-notch when listened to through a solid setup.\n\nTomb Raider is an exceptionally well-made game that delivers yet another rebirth of a beloved series this year. It is always exciting to see old franchises that feel new again, and Crystal Dynamics has truly made Lara and her adventures their own. I am excited to see where they go from here, and hope they flesh out the survival aspect a bit more in the sequel. I would also love to see them bring back more of the unique puzzle designs featured in past games, but as a starting point, Tomb Raider is easily one of my favorite games of the year so far, and one I think deserves to be experienced by everyone. If you have a love for the series or third-person adventure games, this is a must play. Lara is back and better than ever.","April 1, 2014","true","145.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doppledumb/recommended/203160/","Doppledumb","Doppledumb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doppledumb/","245 products in account","So the game has an "Overwhelmingly Positive" rate on the store and the choice to write a "negative" review is mostly due to the fact you can choose a neutral review.\n\nAs a "fan" of the firsts Tomb Raider games, a remake could have been a really good thing to give to Lara's character a new developpement and more depth. the problem is that this game fails to give us that.\n\nIn term of quality, yes the game is aesthetically beautiful, yes the BGM is of a certain quality but a game is not good because its form is, there is more to it, here some of the reasons I don't give this game a positive review :\n\n1) Writting (both Scenario and Character Developpement)\n\nSo in this one Lara is a young girl that goes on a archeological expedition to became a true archeologist, she is still trapped in the shadow of her father reputation and it's said that this is her first adventure.\nNot long after this their boat shipwreck and the whole group end up on Yamatai Island. Lara is soon captured by a stranger and took away in a cave where she is attached to the roof of the cavern by her feet. And it's exactly there after 10 minutes of Gameplay that everything goes wrong. It's her first adventure ever but Lara is going to survive EVERYTHING, during the whole game she got injured almost at every chapter, fall from very High places but survive, fall into waterfall but survive, stand near explosions but survive, almost bleed to death but survive by burning her skin with an arrow, etc. If the whole point of the story wasn't sum up by "an adventurer is born" I wouldn't mind notice that, but here it's just not appropriate for the character developpement.\nThe story in itself can be divide in two parts, the first is surviving the terrible island and find your friend, the second take revenge on the main antagonist. It's really short and can be done with most of the secondary "quest" in about 10h.\nAlso some character are really annoying, some scene ridiculous, some death are really bad written and unecessary (like really there is a scene where both character could have survive but to give it some dramatic momemts, they choose to just unecessary kill a character)\n\n2) The gameplay\n\nOkay so this is for me the most important bad point of this game. First of all instead of being a cool adventure game mixing puzzles, platforming with cool exploration and just what you need of gun action, this game is just a basic shooter. Seriously it's 90% of the time killing people and it's wrong because when she first kill someone, Lara say she is really bad about it, she has a conscience but the rest of the game is build like a 3rd person shooter and the only obstacle on your way are hundreds of ennemy to kill.\nAlso the game is saying they give you the chance to "hunt" to "survive", this is bulshit, if you kill a rabbit it gives you gears and metal part to updgrade your gun to kill even more human.\nAdd to this a really high number of QTE and without spoil a really annoying final boss using those two aspects makes it really boring.\nAlso puzzles exist in this game but they are really simple and short and are just part of a secondary quest.\n\n3)Multiplayer\n\nSeriously it's boring and not interesting, don't waste your money on those DLC\n\n\nOverall :\n\nThe game is correct, the problem is that RebootLara is poorly written, her devellopement is clearly dammage by the choice of gameplay and the fact all secondary character are one dimensional and annoying doesn't help. The fact they want to show how a women evolve to survive and give her a morality that you can't follow due to gameplay limitation or the fact that she got constantly injured but can still do crazy things like jump, climb with only a pickaxe and the strengh of her arms just ruin the whole thing.\nIt's not a "tomb raider" really, for the simple fact you just raid absolutly no tomb and you just explore vestige related to the main quest with nothing to raid in it.\nI think the second part of the game is a bit better for that but the final boss ruin the thing once again.\nSo for a 3rd person shooter game, it's not that bad, for a Tomb raider game, it's quite bad but you should try it, it's worth your 5 or 8 euro when it's on sale !","January 1","false","17.8"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

I completed it within 15 hours, with 92% completion.\n\nThe story is fantastic and engaging, if a little far-fetched, but with the Lara Croft franchise this is kind of to be expected. The mechanics and movement and exploration of the overworld is incredibly intuitive and fun and easy, with very very few "environment screwed me over" moments. It's incredibly well designed.\n\nI didn't touch the multiplayer, as I'm not interested in it, so I wont comment on that. I will say, however, that I am looking forward to any upcoming DLC which is released, as it'd be interesting to see where they take this already great story.\n\nAs a downnote, however, the game is a little too "easy", in particular ammo seems to be everywhere. I played the game on "Hard" from the very start (hardest difficulty) and found only three 5 minute encounters which made me die and re-do the encounter. It seemed to me the difficulty affected only the enemy AI and the amounts of enemies, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nOtherwise though, a fantastic game which I'd recommend thoroughly.\n\nNilesy","March 17, 2013","true","15.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?\n\nTomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island.\n\nTo begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.\n\nNow I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nThe story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs.\n\nThe game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too.\n\nGraphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played.  Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.\n\nThe optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy.\n\nBoss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.\n\nThe entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it.\n\nIn the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Worth Checking out\n\nIf you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 15, 2015","true","9.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/203160/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","This game reminded me that this whole series was part of my childhood.\n\nThe last game I played was Legend, and after that, I completely ignored the series for whatever reason. After seeing this during the Autumn Sale, I decided that I would pick this game up to pass the time until the next (and hopefully better) sale. However, I was blown away that I regret not buying this earlier.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics impressed me for nearly the whole game. I have exactly 100 screenshots in 12 hours of gameplay. Almost everything to it looks beautiful. However, at times, I feel like the characters (or more specifically Lara Croft) looked lazily done and the textures looked awful. But, like I said, 100 screenshots in 12 hours. Can't remember when I last took 100 with a game like this. The environments looked beautiful the whole way through, regardless of how bad Lara looked at times. Actually, this game was a nominee for the "Best Graphics" award for my blog, but it didn't win.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is very smooth and the difficulty is relatively fair. The switch between stealth and shooter gameplay mixes well and switching from one to the other is a smooth, flawless transition. The game is somewhat open world, but you won't do much post-game unless you're a completionist. The bow was my personal favorite weapon and using it was a blast. All the weapons share a purpose so you'll use them all in different situations. But, as much as I enjoy the gameplay, I did find a few flaws. One thing is that if you want to buy this game for multiplayer, don't. It's dead. Another issue I had is that hunting is pointless in the game, all it really does is give you some XP to level up. The third flaw I had wih the game was that the QTEs are really unfair. Sometimes, no matter how much you mash that button, the game says you failed the QTE. This is especially annoying with the water scenes, where you're sliding down a waterfall and you have to shoot barricades and use the slow controls to dodge all the spikes so you don't get impaled. Other times, when you have to hit a certain button, they don't reveal that button until the very last second, and by the time you realize it, you're dead. They really need to be fixed. But other than those issues, I was very impressed with the gameplay.\n\nStory\nLara Croft's origin story is pretty intense the whole way through. After the ship she was on crashed on an island, she tried to look for a way out and also had to rescue her friend Sam. Although the whole "save your friend/family/etc" thing is very cliché, Tomb Raider does this right. The whole journey keeps you hooked, until the rescue mission finally comes. After that, then you'll learn that the game is "just getting started," and from that point on, the last few parts of the game really drag on. First you waste your time killing some members of a cult, then you go find a samurai and the antagonist's real plan, then you have to go rescue Sam again. Instead of this part of the story being thrilling, I nearly fell asleep. However, the "final boss" the Oni was a pretty crazy fight. Other than the really draggy final part of the game, I'm happy with the dark, gritty origin tale of a legendary video game character.\n\nAudio\nI did some research, and realized the composer of Tomb Raider's soundtrack is Jason Graves, who is known for composing the Dead Space series' soundtrack. That being said, you can expect that the songs sound more creepy than intense. Because of this, the themes had trouble matching and so I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack. But, the voice acting was amazing, especially Lara Croft and Roth (Camilla Luddington and Robin Atkin Downes respectively) who really give the characters personality. Overall, the music needs work but I enjoy the voice acting.\n\nReplayability\nThe game lacks replayability mostly, and at least 14-15 hours is needed to 100% the game. Plus, the multiplayer is dead.

I don't play through the entire campaign of many games anymore but this one is definitely worth it.  My playtime is just of the base storyline on "Tomb Raider" difficulty (normal), there's lots of side areas to explore that I'm sure I missed and lots to collect.\n\nYou play as a young Lara Croft still wet behind the ears when it comes to adventuring.  I love their take on Lara.  She can be strong, but also very vulnerable.  A human being with actual feelings, fears, and hopes.  Strengths and weaknesses.  Still though, she is very capable.  The amount of punishment she endures is at times almost heartbreaking.  She always manages to come out on top though, and everything she goes through helps her grow to become the woman and adventurer we know she is capable of being.\n\nThe story is great.  The voice acting is superb.  It has a pretty soundtrack.  Graphically it is quite beautiful.  My only complaint is that it seems like it might not be too well optimized.  After beating this one I just started the new one (Rise of the Tomb Raider) which is even more impressive to look at, and gets better FPS.\n\nStill though, this game is amazing.  The combat is fun.  Navigating the terrain is fun.  The puzzles are fun.  It's just a fun, exciting experience.  And if you're the kind of person that likes to hunt down all the collectibles and find all the secrets along the way, this is a great game for you.  It has something for everyone.\n\n10/10 would play again.","January 29","true","10.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Granted, this is not the original Tomb Raider and rather a recent reboot, they held back nothing and gave an absolutely outstanding reboot, probably one of the best ones out there.\n\nThe game is very cinematic, containing many cutscenes here and there, but it doesn't take away from the atmosphere of the game like what sometimes happens. Along with the cinematic feel, it has some amazing narritives throughout the game itself, allowing the several documents/journals you pick up to be read to you in a voice that displays emotion and feeling, which is always a perk compared to having to just read it all yourself in my opinion.\n\nIt gives you an island to explore, full with tombs here and there. The story flows very well. Sure, you backtrack some, technically, but something has usually changed and, not only do you take different routes to get there, you are usually able to explore more with the upgraded tools you now have.\n\nOverall, I absolutely LOVE Tomb Raider. I played through the game in 10 hours in one sitting (two if you count that i had to get something to eat) and expect to play it more to raid more of the tombs i passed over and explore more of the island that i havent yet. If you don't have Tomb Raider yet, do yourself a favor and get it. You won't regret it.","January 25, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There are many moments where her surrounding is falling apart while you are traversing it and this provides many tense moments in the game. Since this game is a reboot of the franchise, Lara Croft is reimagined as a young adventurer who gets trapped in an island full of dangerous cultists and throughout her journey she evolved from an innocent girl to a full fledged survivor who has no qualms about killing others for the sake of surviving and protecting her friends.\n\nThis game does include a cast of likeable and interesting side characters to compliment Lara Croft in this game. From the main antagonist who is willing to do anything to escape from the island to Lara Croft best friend Samantha who has a link to the island they are trapped in. Throughout Lara's journey you can see her changed visually as well, since her character model would looked more damaged as the game progresses such as her clothes slowly ripping off and the increasing number of injuries on her. The weapons in this game does evolved visually and stats wise as every upgrade you add into your weapons does reflect on the weapons itself. I have to complement them for these great attention to details!\n\nFor those who like collecting things, this game does have various collectables such as relics, gps caches and notes hidden throughout various levels. These collectables does give the player insights about the background and history of the island which is interesting and make the collection more worth the effort.\n\nThere is also multiplayer in this game, where you can play as a cast of different characters from the story. There are also different weapons and gadgets that you can use for this mode. However, there are barely anybody playing multiplayer at the time of this review. So the multiplayer in this game is pretty much dead. However the main catch of this game is in it's story mode which I found to be fantastic! I give this game a 9/10 and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great action adventure game and it is good to have more female protagonist in the male dominated protagonist scene.","April 1","true","24.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

When the Endurance is grounded on the shores of an island while on an archaeological expedition, young Lara Croft must face the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the isle in order to save her friends while discovering the mystery that has been causing shipwrecks and airplane crashes for centuries.\n\nPros: This reboot of the franchise takes the game in a whole new direction where your young and naive character learns to survive against the harsh weather and homicidal community, all the while exploring the island. You train your skills with the experience points you amass from battle and from uncovering tombs and dozens of hidden collectibles, including relics and journals left from the earlier Yamatai Empire and other people who ended up on the island through the centuries. You also collect salvage and parts with which to craft and upgrade your various weapons. The story is pretty interesting in itself, you'll feel halfway between Lost and Indiana Jones through most of it. The platforming and environmental puzzle solving is optimized for a game controller, and the rest of the gameplay is ducking and shooting which seems pulled right out of the Uncharted series.\n\nCons: The interaction with the environment can break the immersion in subtle ways, from the climbable cliff sides that are exclusively located at way too convenient locations, to the fact that there usually is only one specific pre-determined way to solve puzzles or reach specific areas. Ammo is also too convenient: loot an enemy who was attacking you with a bow, and it just happens that the only ammo he has is the one for that machine gun you haven't reached full ammo capacity, yet. The more cinematic scenes are often resolved by a quicktime event involving timed or repetitive button pressing. A mere handful of side characters get any development, and there's nothing you can do to save those that will face a story-determined death.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nThis game is much better than I expected it to be. It might not be genre-changing, but it's a franchise-changing success that convinced me to get my hands on Rise of the Tomb Raider. If any of you never cared for the franchise before, you really should reconsider and give Tomb Raider a try!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","June 4","true","32.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'll say that having not played a Tomb Raider in a very long time, I was impressed. Of course times have changed and there is much less emphasis on puzzles and hidden acrobatic moves than past installments. In keeping with a more modern approach, there is a heavy influence on gunplay and quick storyline progression, and that's ok! I quite enjoyed seeing Lara take on hordes of bad guys, bullets and explosions flying! Variation between Easy and Hard is quite noticeable. The savegame is intuitive and often, allowing for extensive upgrading of your four main weapons and fast travel that is required if backtracking to seek achievements of which there are plenty.\n\nThat being said, there are indeed plenty of puzzles hidden behind ledges, in rooms barred by obstacles, and most importantly tombs. Special locations dotted throughout the terrain hold entrances to tombs which hold a centrally designed puzzle that rewards the player with a less than gratuitous bit of salvage and experience. The rewards are truly in the game play, though upgrading to a silenced pistol is always nice.\n\nThe storyline is excellent, cinematic, and fluid with cutscenes progressing in and out of the gameplay at appropriate times without annoying or overdoing it. I have no experience with multiplayer. The story was completed casually at about 21 hours, leaving room for at least half that to run around and finishing up achievemnents and tombs. (Some are multiplayer only).\n\nLara is younger in this game, and as such her attitude and demeanor are different than what some might expect. As the campaign progresses she is hardened into a Croft. This title felt AAA all the way and I will make a special mention to FERAL who made this port possible for Linux gamers, thank you!\n\nUbuntu 16.04 stock.\n10/10\n\n\nedit: Someone should have said I spelled her name wrong.

Both graphically, and in style, the game is very, very pretty. Particle effects are everywhere, water looks like its really flowing, and the long draw distances create landscapes so beautiful that you will consider just stopping and staring at it for awhile. This game will definitely be a definitive graphical benchmark for the next year or two.\n\nThe gameplay is familiar enough; a traditional third person cover shooter. You eventually develop a standard arsenal of firearms, any of which you can pull out of your ♥♥♥ at any time.  Occasionally you will run into a physics puzzle, but these are rarer than I would've liked. Most of them are genuinely interesting and clever, and the game doesn't seem to be aware of that. The shooting is good enough, but this is not the draw of the game.\n\nFirefights only make up a small portion of the approximately 20 hours playtime of Tomb Raider's single player. Most of the time is spent traversing  Crystal Dynamics' well-designed environments. There are plenty of secret tomb areas (they serve as some kind of collectible) that a player could completely bypass, and discovering all of these areas significantly extends playtime. Lara acquires skills over the course of the game, allowing her to climb cliffsides, jump up walls, and slide down ziplines to access new areas. In addition to skills, Lara also upgrades her weapons and tools throughout the game through the use of scrap metal that she finds across the game world.\n\nIf none of this sounds especially new or original, that's because it's not. But everything is Tomb Raider is so polished that it stands above all the other games it borrows mechanics from (including its predecessors).\n\nMy only big problem with Tomb Raider is its convoluted story. Lara's journey starts out simple enough; an archeaology expedition finds themselves in the middle of a storm and is washed ashore a mysterious island. Lara wakes up captured by...someone...and escapes to save her friends and get off the island. Some mysterious forces prevent her from doing so, and then the story takes some weird directions. No spoilers, but I don't think the story really goes anywhere meaningful, even though its main story points could've been put together into an epic tale. It instead comes off as kind of all over the place. The whole game has a very self serious tone, but the story gets so ridiculous that nothing really fits together. The voice acting and dialogue is passable, but nothing noteworthy.\n\nI didn't touch the multiplayer modes. I didn't hear very good things and the one time I tried them the servers were abandoned.\n\nTomb Raider took me around 20 hours to beat, and for a $20 AAA title that is routinely on sale for <$10, I highly recommend it.\n\nThere is no need to purchase the GOTY version or any of the DLC, as it is all multiplayer skins/weapons that cannot be used in single player.","November 1, 2014","true","41.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This game is essentially a reboot to the highly successful series and tells the tale of how Lara Croft came to be.\n\nWhile this game has plenty of action, I've found that instead of being focused on the action, it's based more on the drama of the game's plot and Lara's character development as well as those around her.\n\nGoing back to when Lara was basically just a kid in college, you will experience Lara before she became the warrior that gamers recognize all too well. In this story, she has alot of emotion, her heart is vulnerable and with your help she has to learn everything from how to shoot a gun properly to surviving in a harsh envrionment filled with dangerous animals and bad guys.\n\nThe game is linear as there is a path to follow for the sake of advancing the story in an orderly fashion but you can tackle each level by using stealth or guns blazing. If you've played any of the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you'll know just what to expect from Tomb Raider.\n\nCharacter progression is a nice touch in Tomb Raider, you will gain new abilities as Lara levels up and you can even upgrade your weapons with new parts as Lara rests at a small nearby camp. It's nice to see Lara's character development and makes you care more for her more.\n\nThe balance of gameplay seems to be done very well and there is some cinematic story moments to break up the action. Although, this game isn't so much about raiding tombs as it is about watching a meek, gullible and scared girl grow into a powerful and fierce warrior. Th game runs decent and I  have not noticed any bugs. I recommend you play this game with a controller, if you play with a keyboard and mouse then you may have trouble with the quick time events (qte's) in the game as theu may not display the key you must hit correctly and it may get frustrating.\n\nThis game was provided to me free from AMD and my review is based on the game's current state.","January 17","true","6.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

First and foremost, rebooting the franchise into an 80% on-rails TPS filled with filthy quick-time events and forgetting almost completely the exploration aspect, it's horribly wrong in my book;\nin addition, the commercial strategy to sell the product to the largest audience as possible (eventually including trained circus monkeys) , opened up the path to plot inconsistencies, half-baked mechanics, dumb IA, and genarally to the unpleasant feeling of being underestimated all-around as a player and human being.\nThe end-game felt much better,funny and open though: but way too late !\nThis ,the neat save feature, a perfect pacing that keeps the adventure always funny, and the all-around spectacular scenography and visual appealing, save the game from the complete failure.\nStill, Crystal Dynamics and the Square marketing department are guilty for underestimating players brains and preceding business strategies to the final quality of the game. Unfortunately the sequel seems to be almost the same, but i'll investigate.\nIn the end Tomb Raider Is a waste of great potential: a missed oppurtunity to create a masterpiece out of this technically impressive powerhouse, big budget, and undeniable developping abilities.\nA guilt that cannot be forgiven.","February 1","false","19.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Unfortunately this new installment of Tomb Raider continued to disappoint with so many elements that could have been carried out by the developers flawlessly yet were jammed with things like cut scenes or run-and-gun situations that broke the flow of the game almost around every corner. Very pretty structures that would’ve been very fun to explore were instead bombed out and on fire everywhere - Which would make sense on an island that was once a World War 2 base but what was really disappointing is the huge oriental-Japanese styled buildings ( this - http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/28148/kl_city1193.jpg ) were in perfect condition for about 5 minutes before they catch fire and start blowing up, keeping you from actually exploring any of it on your own without running into flaming debris in the middle of the hallway. There were plenty of moments that made me say “this is a very cool and somewhat original level!” that made up for a lot of what this game didn’t deliver on.

Imagine my surprise once I found out, that this is one of most linear, on-rail, dumbed-down, scripted and QTE-driven pieces of garbage I have ever laid my hands on! You're not the player/adventurer/puzzle solver - you're a spectator of a cheap action flick. Press "W" to run forward, tap "Space" to jump across obsticles, shoot bad guys and occasionally solve a "mind-bending" puzzle which involves shooting rope arrows or burning something with a torch. The only survival element is hunting. You hunt critters and larger game and collect SALVAGE. Then you use salvage to upgrade your weapons. Makes sense, doesn't it? Oh, I forgot a few more elements: Lara gets cold and hungry. One cutscene of Lara making a fire and cooking and that's taken care of for the rest of the game. One of the most useful weapons is the bow. Wouldn't it be great to craft your own arrows and conserve ammo, taking time to plan an attack and effectively applying a more stealthy approach, since we're like... surviving? Yeah, would be great, but sadly, large amounts of ammo crates and arrows are placed on every step of your linear path. Cranking the difficulty up to Hard doesn't help at all. The only times you die is when you fail to "press "random button" not to die". Lara runs, jumps, shoots, taunts her enemies while everything around bursts into flames in slow motion. If that's your idea of an adventure / survival / open-world game - flip off. Pros: Graphics and bouncing Lara's breasts. Cons: Pretty much everything. I remember myself playing the original Tomb Raider  on PlayStation - now that was a great and challenging experience. Somewhere along the line the evolution of games came to a complete stop. 4/10","November 19, 2013","false","15.2"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

I can definatly say after playing 9 hours of this game, i've gotten a good opinion of the game. Avoid it like the plague. Seriously, this game is just so, so bad. I don't understand why their is much praise around this game, it makes no sense. The games storyline is so bland, i had no interest in anything what so ever. Lara's character is pathetic, her emotions feel extremely forced and fake. There's no character development what so ever, so whenever a character dies, you don't really give a ♥♥♥♥, and neither does lara. Like serisouly, one of her friends gets killed, and all she does is go "NOOOO!!!". then thats it. No mention of the charcter, no remorse, nothing. She also has no problem gunning down tons of bandits, but has a hard time killing a rabbit.\n\nOkay, now for game play.\nAs the name of the game suggests, you're expecting tombs and puzzles right? NOPE. there are rarely any puzzles in the game, and when they are they take like 2 minutes to figure out. The "Tombs" in the game are optional, and are usually 1 easy puzzle. Combat is awful, most of the time the game just throws enemies at you from every angle, because they didn't have anything else to do. There's really nothing special about this game, its extremely generic. I don't plan on beating the game either, its just so ♥♥♥♥ing awful.

Treasure has little value, the puzzles are easy and just take a long time when puzzles are actually there, multiplayer is tacked on, and almost every action I took was a quicktime event.\n\n\nThe game itself is... okay.

I have come full circle and finally brought the game to completion in regards to the side challenges, which prompted me to write a review for this wonderful game.\n\nA doughnut who mainly enjoys multiplayer games and seldom singleplayer adventures, I was blown away by Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider grappled me with interest, quite literally, from the get-go and I was sold. If you take a look through my gallery of screenshots, it is quite apparent that the game started out beautifully and evolved into one-heck of a diamond mine by the end of the tale. I remember quite a few times in the game just standing and looking around spamming [F12] while Solarii soldiers made quick work, attacking me in my transfixed state.\n\nAlthough Tomb Raider's scenery is fantastic, that is not the only area where this game shines. You are  Lara Croft. Immersed into a vast world of assassin-like game play, you must use your survival instincts and various weapons to progress throughout the story and attempt to conquer the zealot by the name of Mathias. With pristine and seemingly realistic graphics, you will venture through a mesmeric experience with puzzles, obstacles, parkour, fights, take-downs, and more.\n\nI snagged the GOTY edition during the Summer Sale, but this game is worth the full price. Prove your survival prowess and step onto the ominous island of Yamatai.\n\nFinal Ratings\nGameplay: 9/10 - Challenges are a bit onerous.\n\nStoryline: 8.5/10 - Not the best final boss fight.\n\nCombat: 10/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, and extremely fun with variance in take-downs.\n\nScary? Nope, more so eerie.\n\nPop-Ups: None\n\nGraphics: 10/10\n\n100% Achievements: Not easy. 16/50 achievements are multiplayer based and are tedious. Hidden achievement (Called Chatterbox, look it up before you begin).\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10 This game was created for singleplayer.\n\nReplayability: One and done sort of campaign. I do not see myself replaying the singleplayer.\n\nMultiplayer: 3/10 - Not a game that excels in multiplayer.

Yeah, 2013 game, finnished in 22.07.2015, oh well. You don't need a lot of time to finnish it, tho'. Approximative 8-9 hours of storytime (without many checkpoint restarts), but without all the collectables available on the map (although, 72% completion from the first try).\n\nAnyway, I don't even know from where to start this review. This is the best action game I had played so far. Just go on and make your bags, you'll go on a feels trip more or less, as soon as you start the game. My review doesn't contain any spoiler, so it's safe to read.\n\nThis game has it all: action, stealth, killing enemies in full Lara Croft style (with your bow), EPIC AND TOUCHY STORYLINE (although it's on the SF side, it's awesome, touchy and emotional), graphics and Lara Croft in HD :D.\n- Going over the storyline, there isn't many things I could say without spoiling stuff. It's well made, although it's linear, meaning you can't make any decisions, you just go as it was developed. Environment and map movement is nearly the same, you can't really make any mistakes missing the main quest or getting lost around. It has many emotional moments, cutscenes and brings up in first place, beside the main reason of the storyline, Lara's transformation (play the game and you'll see :P).\n- Mechanics are well made, and beside two times when I pressed 'W' to jump up on a ledge, and Lara decided it might be a better idea to jump towards the right, right off the mountain and die, there's nothing more to say. There are hardly any bugs around, and it's all well made. You can either be one with the shadows, and stealthy go and kill people with your bow, or just go full rambo. You choose.\n- Graphics are nice and detailed, played it maxed out on 1080p, on my GTX760. That TressFX hair effect makes Lara Croft look even more real than it already is.\n\nOverall, Tomb Raider 2013, is an amazing experience, and it sure is a great revival of the series (which to be honest, I didn't played, only watched on YouTube). So, you can say it was my first Tomb Raider experience, and sure felt in love with this game. Best ~9hours I spent in singleplayer gaming so far.\n\nAnd let's face it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ben_superman/recommended/203160/","ben_superman","StAidan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ben_superman/","278 products in account","I’ve played (and enjoyed) a few games in the classic Tomb Raider line, including 1, 2, Angel of Darkness, and Legend. In comparison to all of those, boy, did this game feel different! I would consider myself a passing fan of Tomb Raider as a series, and to be honest, I groaned inwardly when the “gritty reboot” was announced. I never intended to play it at all, but ended up impulse buying it over this past summer sale  -- and I’m so glad I did.\n\nI found the technicals of this game to be amazing. It’s incredibly well-built, and the actual gameplay (in terms of how the character controls) seems nearly flawless. I liked all the weapons, but the bow is especially versatile and fun to bring into battle. The enemy AI often leaves a lot to be desired - the enemies are mostly just really stupid - but I don’t think I could claim to have played any games that do it better. Maybe I’m just sheltered. In any case, I was never bored or disappointed by the frequent gunfights, although they weren’t always appropriately challenging. I liked going for the stealth approach, too - it was surprising how well stealth worked at times, though at other times, frustrating how easy it was to remain undetected (again, lame AI).\n\nThe environment design and exploration aspects are really great as well. Exploring and collecting rarely felt like a chore, which was a little surprising considering just how much there is to collect. (I did end up getting the last Previous Inhabitants flag and the last Sun Killer ornament only after looking up their locations in a guide. The flag, in particular, felt really cheaply hidden compared to all of the other challenges in the game.)\n\nFrom an artistic standpoint, the environments are immersive and believable. Beautiful graphics and excellent sound design abound in this game. Quite early on, Lara was standing in a rainstorm with lightning flashes and thunder (I had headphones on), and I was just blown away by the distinct feeling of actually being in that virtual world. The darkness and detail in the various tombs made me feel legitimately eerie and claustrophobic in quite a few instances. The action-oriented set pieces, while silly in terms of gameplay, were appropriately impressive. I particularly liked the escape from the Solarii Fortress after rescuing Sam for the first time.\n\nLooking back over last year’s Tomb Raider OT, I’ve read complaints about the lack of tombs/puzzles, the cliche characters, and the flat story. I’ll address those objections below:\n\nFirst, I understand the issues with the tombs. Each one (of maybe 7 optional tombs, and 2-3 required ones) is basically a single-room puzzle that I was able to solve as easily as if I were playing with a baby’s shape sorter. At the same time, I believe that a high quantity of challenging (or time-consuming) puzzles really tends to kill the replay value of a game, because who wants to go through the motions of redoing puzzles that they’ve already solved in a previous run? Boring. So I’m of two opinions about the whole thing, but sort of favoring the way this reboot treats its tombs - short and simple. I do wish there had been more of them, in any case. My favorite tomb in the game? That would have to be the Flooded Vault.\n\nSecond, yeah - when viewed objectively, the story wasn’t exceptional, and the characters were mostly nothing more than stereotypical devices to deliver predictable plot points. But in the context of being the Tomb Raider origin story, I think it served its purpose just fine, with no bigger problems than any other video game story. That’s not to say it gets a total pass, just that the criticisms were way overblown. One endgame event that I found pretty unbelievable was Whitman’s death at the hands of the Oni. I mean, I know the guy was naive and stupid, but do you really expect me to believe that he spent all that time ”roaming freely” among the Solarii (his words) and never once overheard those thugs talking about how dangerous the Oni are? They wouldn’t shut up about it whenever Lara was sneaking around, I know.\n\nAnyway, the one major disappointment with Tomb Raider in my mind ended up being the final “battle,” if  you could even call it that. The stormguard giant seemed like a nice prelude to a bigger finale, but instead I’m treated to a QTE-fest with Mathias and a simple cutscene in which Lara vanquishes the Sun Queen without my help whatsoever. All the same, I consider that a small objection in the grand scheme of the game as a whole, and I did appreciate the dual-pistol callback at the end there.\n\nMy ultimate conclusion? If this reboot is going to be the new standard for Tomb Raider games, I don’t need the old standard anymore. I’m sure the classics will still be fun and all, but the notion of a Tomb Raider whose content is predominantly puzzle-oriented is an idea that’s ready for retirement. I’ve also decided that Attitude Lara was a fine enough concept back in the ‘90s, when every new mascot was an attitude mascot, but Survivor Lara is a lot more believable as a character - and quite honestly, much easier to build a story around, if we’re still going for stories in games these days (I don’t consider them necessary, but whatever).\n\nGreatly looking forward to the sequel.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","29.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/203160/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","This was a really really fun game. Infuriating at times, but still fun. First the positives. The game is gorgeous. The island is wonderful to explore and the environments are very distinct. It is obvious a lot of love went into creating this island world. While the opening cinematic is a tease, since the rest of the game isn't nearly as photo-realistic, it's enough to hook you into the adventure. Another huge positive is the amount of shinies! There are relics and documents everywhere to flesh out the history of the island. Honestly. I think they could do a DLC off the strength of one of the documented stories. The controls for the most part are very smooth and it is easy to manage Laura over the rough terrain she faces. I loved the blend of adventure and action. You get to solve puzzles and shoot stuff and look for shinies! Something for everybody!\nNow the negatives. While I did love this game, I don't have a blinding love to all things Lara Croft. My first problem: the title. Lara is no tomb raider in this game. She is a young woman trying to survive a shipwreck and save her fellow shipmates from a cursed island. Yes, she does visit tombs, but they are optional tombs, and they are not nearly as elaborate as the tombs from past TR games. More on that later. The emphasis in this game is "you are a Croft, Lara." If anything, this game should have been called "Croft: The Makings of a Tomb Raider" or something like that. This a personal gripe, but I feel that the title does not show the true emphasis of the game. A mixed positive and negative is the almost superhuman pain threshold Lara has. Its truly amazing what she lives through, and she's only wearing a tank top and cargo pants! On the other hand, she is very human. SHe is sometimes daunted by the trials she faces. She even states at one point, "I hate tombs." When she jumps, she doesn't always land perfectly. So, in some ways she is very human. The next moment, I am wondering why she hasn't had gangrene or hypothermia set in. Now the tombs. They are pathetic. As if running across tribal markings wasn't enough, the game feels the need to tell you that a tomb is nearby. All but one of the tombs are optional, and they are small, and usually have only one puzzle to solve it. when Lara opens the treasure chest in the tomb, I get the feeling of Link opening a large chest from Ocarina of Time. It's the same vibe. A game called Tomb Raider should have tombs that aren't optional. So there are my negatives: Lara can't decide if she should be a super hero, the tombs are laughable, and the title does not fit the emphasis of the game.\nA long review for me, but I could talk more about it, but thats what discussions are for. The story is a bit cliche'd in places, but it is so fun to play that it really doesn't matter. As I said, the negatives are really personal. If you don't have a problem with them, then this game is pretty near perfect. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad this is the first TR game I have played and beaten. I would say this is a good intro for those interested in the world of Lara Croft.\n","January 27, 2015","true","45.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/203160/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","The legendary Lara Croft from the legendary Tomb Raider franchise appears to have been reinvented in this 2013 reboot. She doesn’t appear to be sexualized like she was in previous iterations and looks like a woman who is about survival and gets tougher as the narrative progresses. This is the first time I had ever thought that Lara could be ♥♥♥♥♥ by a man who was coming on to her.\nThe plot begins with Lara and her companions being shipwrecked on an island known as Yamatai. You will discover that Yamatai is an island with many perils, including dangerous cultists plenty of wildlife. The game begins with many QTEs (Quick Time Events) that introduce you to the basic gameplay of Tomb Raider. After learning the QTEs, the game opens up and allows you to explore. This game is not as linear as previous Tomb Raider games and this is a great thing. You can explore as much as you want while being mindful of the strict nature of the narrative. Lara looks convincingly vulnerable, but she is very resourceful in trying to survive.\nOnce you have freedom to explore you will notice that Lara needs to eat by hunting wild animals such as deer and birds. She seems to feel bad about killing wildlife in order to survive but she needs to survive. As the plot advances Lara gets used to killing enemies she only gets tougher from killing enemies. The enemies include cultists known as Solarii soldiers and Oni. Solarii and Oni vary in terms of armor, weapons, difficulty.\nWeapons are a very interesting part of Tomb Raider’s gameplay. You begin with a basic bow and arrow that is upgradeable as you find more gear and salvage. The bow can eventually be used to create ropes in order to zipline from one area to another. As the bow continues to be upgraded, you will be able to attach the arrow to ropes in order to break open barriers. The bow is the best weapon that demonstrates Lara’s resourcefulness. Other well-known weapons such as the pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle can be upgraded also. This is where salvage is significant in the game. Salvage can be found on bodies of dead wildlife, Solarii and Oni and needs to be spent on upgrading weapons. Salvage is a pleasant addition to this game. There are also skill points that you earn from killing enemies, skinning animals, and progressing through the story. Skill points give Tomb Raider an RPG feel, although the game overall still feels like an adventure. Salvage and skill points can be spent at the various camps scattered throughout the game. The camps also serve as save points for Lara.\nThe exploration gives the game a non-linear feel, as you find many collectibles such as relics, GPS cache, treasure maps, and tombs for raiding. Most of the collectibles don’t give much XP, but the tombs increase your XP so much that you would feel very encouraged to find/raid all the tombs. All the tombs require some puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not overly difficult to understand and solve. Raiding these tombs is plenty of fun and makes it fall in line with the title of the game Tomb Raider.\nStealth is one of the new features added to this reboot. Lara can sneak up from behind and strangle an unsuspecting soldier to death. The bow can also be used in silent kills by hitting someone in the head with a well-placed arrow. There is a greater reward for headshots with any weapon which is greater XP.\nThe locales around the island really serve as playgrounds not only because of their design, but because of the openness of the gameplay. Previous Tomb Raider games would require you to follow a strict, linear path to reach your objectives. While the storyline itself is linear and predictable, the exploration shows Lara’s interest in archaeology and ancient civilizations. Lara’s companions help flesh out the story. These characters are mixed with people who support Lara and one who’s not so sure about Lara’s ways to get them to survive their unfortunate circumstances on the island.\nThe controls of this game are absolutely accurate, from the platform jumping to pressing the right buttons in QTEs. There is a Q button for those who play with the mouse and keyboard for survival instincts. Pressing the button for survival instincts turns the screen gray and highlights the important objects that you may need to solve puzzles. There is a well-detailed map that makes the game reasonable enough for advancing.\nI think that the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot is the best of the Tomb Raider franchise. It’s probably best not to sexualize Lara Croft and portray her as a tough, courageous survivor. Also, previous Tomb Raiders didn’t provide so many clues to advance and had frustrated many gamers. This Tomb Raider does not frustrate in the gameplay context. I highly recommend this Tomb Raider reboot to anyone.\n","May 17, 2015","true","32.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/recommended/203160/","Sivarg","Siv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/","391 products in account","Foreword\nTomb Raider was released in 2013 by Square Enix and developed by Crystal Dynamics, an action-adventure game with light puzzles. Story is focused on how Lara Croft became the tomb raider she is so famous about in the previous games of the series.\n\nStory\nThe story focuses on Lara Croft in her young days on an expedition by ship to the "Dragon's Triangle", which the island Yamatai is located. The Triangle in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan, known for its violent storms and countless missing ships in the area. As you imagined, Lara and her crew on the ship Endurance, find themselves becoming yet another victim to the Triangle's storm mayhem and strand on the island. But it's quickly discovered that not everything is what it seems, and the island is inhabited by hostile shipwreck survivors, aswell as supernatural weather phenomenon's. The story centers around these events from the very start, to the very end, and it is done pretty well. The story is also one of the first used in a game that I am aware of. The story does at times seem obvious, but overall it is quite good.\n\nGameplay\n\nCharacter ControlThe gameplay is rather easy to get into, and feels smooth, with only minor character turning problems, especially in close quarter area's. When walking over an edge, most times, Lara will grab onto it rather than fall down. This is a 75% case though, I have tried a few times where she simply fell to her doom.\n\nYou always play in thirdperson.\n\nWhen jumping over a free-fall spot and aiming towards a walkable log or plank, you can clearly feel the game force Lara somehow faster towards the thin walkable object, when clearly you could see you wouldn't have made the jump in time. This seems to happen no matter how hard you try to jump to the side of the object and forcefully try to suicide. The game simply forces you onto the object for Lara to stand in a balancing stance.\n\nWhen climbing ropes or walls with your axe, it is done very quickly, making you wonder where Lara gets all the energy from. Sure, she is fit, but there's no way she can climb or move that fast. Obviously this is done for the player's benefit, and not sitting for a minute of rope climbing.\n\nLara can do a low dodge, followed by a second one in the form of a roll, avoiding all current sword swings etc, this doesn't count for bullets though. Instead you are forced to find cover and wait for the blackened screen to turn into a normally coloured one again, indicating your health is low. There are no health pickups. When gaining a skill, you can dodge and attack enemies, either killing them or stabbing them in the knee region with an arrow. This is done by a quick played scene and animation of Lara and the hostile, in which you must then be quick to press a key, which is mainly E or F.\n\nOther scene's Lara is controlled by the computer as you must press certain keys to avoid being killed, examples being rockslides, losing grip after a jump, close fights or other various scenario's with nature or objects.\n\nIf you wish to be in full control of your character at all times, this isn't the game for you.\n\n\nAiming, Focus & WeaponsThe aiming system is decent, and you're given a focus system to highlight certain objects or waypoints to further the game. This can be everything from lootable crates, to challenge items/things, climable walls, ropes you can use and waypoints. Later on in the game a skill will provide better focus for you to find items easier.\n\nYou're given a melee weapon in the form of a mountain climbing axe, the striking animations perhaps abit quick in my opinion, but overall showcase Lara as desperate when fighting close quarter against hostiles.\n\nThroughtout the game you unlock access to more weapons over time, though they aren't many.\nOverall they are mainly four range weapons, the fifth being the melee axe.\nThey are as followed: Pistol, shotgun, smg/assault rifle and bow with arrows.\nAll of these, even the axe, can be upgraded throughout the game by visiting campsites that you discover and using scrap metal parts that you loot from crates, enemies and animals (with a skill, bones).\nAs stated, the smg can be upgraded to give you an assault rifle (ak-47) instead, which seems abit unrealistic.\nThere are plenty of upgrades to be unlocked, and most of them change the appearance of your weapon.\n\nWhen aiming with either of the weapons, you are zoomed in over Lara's shoulder.\n\nTombs, Challenges & Relics\nThroughout the game you pass several optional tombs that can be explored. Most of them when entering, you are forced to go slowly with Lara, while having a lit torch, even being forced to light the torch at the start. Sometimes this is a dragging experience and isn't for the action-craving players. You will never encounter enemies in optional tombs, instead you will encounter puzzles.\nPuzzles aren't difficult to figure out, even Portal puzzles are harder, but should you be confused what to do, open steam browser and look up video's on youtube. Same goes for challenges and relics, all can be found by the help of youtube video guides.\nThe puzzles range from bringing an object to a place at the right moment to get to the end of the tomb, to throwing objects up onto an makeshift elevator to opening up window shutters that keep howling storm wind at bay, and using it at a correct timing to reach the tomb end.\nEach tomb has a campsite that you can use for upgrades and skills, but you can't oddly enough fast travel, forced to go out the slow process that you came in with from the start of the tomb.\nWhen reaching the end, you are rewarded with gear parts, sometimes relics, or a map that will reveal all the collectibles in a zone that the tomb is located in. They also reward EXP.\n\nMost zones have challenges, mainly destroyable things. They range from banners you must burn, to forest mushroom caps that you can (presumably) eat and destroyable tribal fetishes among others.\nAll of these contribute towards the game's progression procent aswell as achievements, and award EXP too.\n\nRelics can be found in each zone, having atleast 3-5 in each one. They are almost always different, having a zone theme going along them, or a set. For an instance, a village might have old handmade fans, or theater masks as a set. Other relic theme's are WWII-era items, like dogtags. All of these relics are always in chests, when opened, appear close up with Lara saying something about their history, some of them being able to be examined closer and more information will be revealed by Lara. You can never use these items ingame and serve only as items to be found. There are even modern day familiy "heirlooms" among the relic theme's and sets.\n\n\nEXP & Skills\nYou can gain EXP from killing any type of animals and enemies, completing challenges and finding relics aswell as tombs.\nFull EXP levels gain you a point to use in skills, which you can access when sitting at a campsite. There are three different categories of skills, some unlockable only after progressing in the game.\nAll affect gameplay in some way, including better hunting wildlife abilities, to attacking hostiles and performing finishers on them and last but not least, your inventory, upgrading yourself to carry more ammo etc.\n\nCharactersAs Lara, you interact alot through cutscene's with other survivors aswell as enemies, and minimal interaction in playmode with friendly characters. This serves as a stand-next-to and press a key to interact with them.\n\nThere aren't alot of outstanding or noticeable characters, they are more down on earth and the game maintains this well thoughout the story progression.\nThe characters are quite detailed, just as the gameworld. Nicely rendered, and looking realistic. If you are a sucker for character details, this game is a must.","August 18, 2015","true","24.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theironictea/recommended/203160/","theironictea","TheIronicTea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theironictea/","155 products in account","I always liked to say that Uncharted by Naughty Dog on the Sony Playstation is what Tomb Raider should've been. Crystal Dynamics decided to take that route with their version of Tomb Raider. It is a great third-person shooter, which contains climbing and puzzle solving as main gameplay elements, just like in Uncharted. Naughty Dog tried to make Uncharted like Tomb Raider, and now Crystal Dynamics tried to make Tomb Raider like Uncharted. Quite ironic. And it works, in many ways better than Uncharted.\n\nThe game has a fairly large "open-world" (if you can say that) with tons of collectables and side-tombs that you can raid (no pun intended), whereas Uncharted was a very linear game. Tomb Raider also has skill system and crafting, but there's only a few weapons available in the game. The lack of weapons works with the survival aspect of the game, but the overload of ammo doesn't. There's ammo around every corner more than you can carry. It takes away from the experience, and even in harder difficulties this major problem isn't fixed. Another thing I found quite irritating were the quicktime events, which takes away from the immersion of the game. Every time you find a collectable you are forced to punch a button repeatedly. I didn't mind it too much however. The overload of enemies is also pretty damn stupid, but it makes for good gameplay, and the AI isn't very smart either. Anyways, the game is superb, and with the cheap price of the -75% sale makes it well worth your time and dosh.\n\n8/10","July 5, 2014","true","13.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","3"

At the beginning I found my heart pumping and my head racing as it would put me in scenarios that felt very real and very exciting. The idea that I was getting my adrenaline pumping from a game that wasn't a multiplayer shooter was quite different from what I was used to. This left me feeling great about completing missions and tasks.\n\nI really enjoyed the crafting and modifying of all the tools and weapons in the game as well. The system they used and the progression at which you were able to add things to a weapon seemed to flow very smoothly as the difficulty of the game increased. Even though these modifications were quite unrealistic I still found myself thinking "Well it's ♥♥♥♥ing Lara Croft. She can do anything on the spot.".\n\nAs far as story line goes it was a little confusing at first with all the gods and how the storms tie in with everything. I found though that this confusion wasn't due to a lack of explanation but was more to immerse the player in the game with Lara as she fights to find out what the island is all about.\n\nI really loved a lot about this game and can't think of many things that I didn't like.\n\n9-10/10","July 1, 2014","true","35.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","10"

No real control:\nThere were several points in the game where I noticed that Lara was on rails and that I had no real control over her. Players that would of done "that action" anyway would not really notice, but if you occasionally let go of the W key, you will notice that she is still going or that there are no other options.\n\nA few examples:\nThere were several caves where I could not look aorund or turn back. The only option was forward.\n\nThere were points in the game where Lara moved to a pre-determined location without me wanting to move her there. The game just said "you got to this point, so we will move Lara here".\n\nWhen you are climbing up a cliff, the game will ocasionally correct your position.\n\n\n2. QTE\nForcing me to press a key to do a certain action like "grab onto something" while falling is perfectly fine. Forcing me to mash a key to do something like "lift" or "push" is acceptable, but forcing me to do several "press this" and "mash this" in a row is not ok. PC gamers should not have to put up with that stuff.\n\nAn example:\nA short cutscene starts. Press F at the right time, press F at the right time again... failed, start again.\nSame cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right... failed, start again.\nSame cutscene, press F, press F again... failed, start again.\nSame cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right, not press E... failed, start again.\nSame cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right... failed, start again.\n\n...at this point you start to really hate this game and the developer that made this scene.\n\n\n3. Not really "Stealth"\nA lot of this touches on what I said in [1], but it is important enough to merit its own section.\n\nYou can't crouch in this game, ever. When you get close to an enemy, the game turns auto-crouch on and after you leave that area or kill all the enemies, auto-crouch is turned off.\n\nBasically, the game is telling you that you are only allowed to be sneaky when it wants you to be sneaky. If you want to sneak up to a rabbit, you can't. If you want to walk up to enemies and say hi, you can't because the game wants you crouched.\n\n\n4. Female body used as marketing\nA bit too many scenes where the game forces you to squeese between two walls, just to give the player another close-up of Lara's curves.\n\nIf you are going to have a female protagonist in your game, don't turn her into a piece of meat. Try selling your game with the use of great gameplay.\n\n\nTo sum it all up:\nThe game took a lot of short-cuts removing things that it decided you did not need, removes or limits your controls, auto-corrects you, and throws QTEs at you, but is still a nice game.\n\nI don't dislike the game and would in fact encourage people to get it when it is on sale, but I feel like it is important to list some of the things that it does very wrong.","September 30, 2015","true","16.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","2"

Experience Lara Croft progressing from just your average girl to ultimate badass, and take a truck load of punishment in the process.\n\nAction sequences & storytelling are exceptional & all blend perfectly with the gameplay. This kept pace pretty much for my entire 20hr playthrough, switching from more puzzle & exploration locations to all out "it's War!" action sets. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult compared to previous Tomb Raider games.\n\nThere are some very clever game design direction too, like subtle commentary to give you guidance, use of selective camera angles & forgiving map design & controls (& check points) minimising those frustrating moments. There are some light RPG elements in skill & weapon upgrades allow you to set Lara up to suit your playstyle. I don't think this RPG element was really needed, but it doesn't hurt the game design.\n\nVisual style is rich, highly detailed & immersive.\n\nLara's overall persona & attitude through her character animations & audio commentary change over the course of her adventure, giving a good depth of emotion & shows a lot of personality. This along with the good story results in you ending up caring for Lara trying to survive the danger strickened island. This improved emphasis on character & story really sets the bar higher for the series & sets it apart from many others in genre.\n\nIf I was picky, more variety in the baddies (AI, skins, voices) so they don't feel like an 80s B-grade action movie re-run, & bit less 'Rambo' levels & more puzzles would have been perfect. Turning Tomb Raider into a 3rd person shooter is just not what these games are about to me. Also to this point, they could have given multiplayer a miss IMHO as it really doesn't fit (nor plays very well).\n\nOther than these minor points, Tomb Raider was an awesomely enjoyable experience, both suited to the fans of the series as well as new comers.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","October 4, 2013","true","30.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The opening gameplay is packed with action and done really well, the game grabs hold of the player and shows all it has to offer in the first twenty minutes, leaving me wanting more. It wasn't just the gameplay which had me hooked. I wanted to know about the mysterious island Lara had become stranded on, I wanted to know more about the dangerous people on this island and why they were so hostile.\n\nThe story goes along at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to be pieced together by an attentive player. Sometimes I felt Lara was a little slow coming to a conclusion I has reached hours ago.\n\nThe gameplay introduces new elements at good times, allowing Lara to become more powerful, or speeding up her adventuring across the island. I felt after around 16 hours of gameplay a slight lull, I wa ready for the story to be wrapped up, and started to be bored by the repetativeness of the combat and exploration. This only lasted a couple of hours, until I felt happy that the game had been stretched as I wanted to play more again.\n\nI finished the game with a 90% overall completion score. I missed picking up a few GPS caches and many of the optional challenges in each zone. I picked up most of the documents and relics as I played the game, going back to pick up the few I had missed before I completed the story. I clocked over 25 hours in completing the game in this way, which is fairly admirable by todays standards, and acceptable for such a game.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be able to run the game as the highest of settings, which was truly a beautiful experience. The island feels very real, and really helped me feel the immersion that I did.\n\nMost of my time playing Tomb Raider was extremely enjoyable, I look forward to the inevitable sequel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BN43/recommended/203160/","BN43","Ezekiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BN43/","149 products in account","Tomb Raider exemplifies much of what I dislike about games nowadays. I believe this series has amazing potential, which was never realized with the older games. Anniversary and Legend were entertaining, though. What they're doing with the series now is just a waste.\n\nThere are too many “cinematic” interruptions and little things that take control away from the player, like forced walking and times when Lara refuses to light and put out torches, saying, “I can’t do that now.” In the first hour of the game, there are few moments in which you’re fully in control.\n\nThe setpieces are ridiculous and artificial feeling in a convenient kind of way. Lara’s luck is amusing. You know that linear path will crumble and explode perfectly around you as you jump from platform to platform or tumble and slide down, you know you’ll swing against that conspicuous climbable wall after that rope you’ll climb across is cut and you know there’s gonna be an “exciting” river ride if you try to cross those raging waters. The quick time events are worse. Setpieces and QTEs usually feel like scenes for actors, that have to be repeated until they’re performed just right, so that they look good to the viewer. It’s not about involving the player. It’s visual. It would have been more fun if they had removed most of the predictable cinematic crap and integrated the fights more naturally into the exploration.\n\nThe transparency of action movie games like Tomb Raider: http://i.imgur.com/G9BKmv0.jpg\n\nIn nearly every fight, you’re crouched on one side of an arena and you have to kill waves of enemies on the other. The fights are too contained. In the bigger areas the enemies always wait in little, widely dispersed groups, conveniently having conversations for you to listen to. I like the fight near the end of the game, where you have to advance through enemies, but there is almost none of that in the game.\n\nI don’t want to hold a button to aim my ranged weapon in a game that’s mainly about shooting. You already know where you want to shoot with the orientation of the camera. It’s an unnecessary strain. Just keep the dot on the center of the screen until I put my gun away. When I first posted this review, I had a mouse whose right button didn’t work that well anymore. I had to put a lot of pressure on it to keep the gun aimed, probably because of games like this. Why is there not a toggle option? I much prefer the gunplay of Max Payne 3, where you can freely aim and holding the right mouse button merely zooms in slightly.\n\nPeople often compliment Tomb Raider’s automatic cover system. It’s alright, but I want to control the character myself. I don’t want to crouch all the time. I want to stand so that I can move faster between cover. I do prefer the cover system over the sticky cover of other games. It's nice that she doesn't press her back to the wall, like other action heroes. But I would have liked the ability to turn the system on and off for more mobility, perhaps with a crouch button.\n\nWhy does nearly every modern game need upgrade systems and other RPG elements? They made the guns much less effective than they should be to validate the XP system. Enemies can take a lot of bullets to kill, and the combat becomes too easy if you explore and collect. I’d rather pick up guns during combat than keep and upgrade them, as I would in real life. My favorite carry system is the one from Max Payne 3, for its realism and efficiency. Max can carry three weapons at once, but once he dual wields, he has to drop his bigger gun, since it doesn't have a sling. Tomb Raider wants to be a more realistic action game, but the carry system contradicts that. How does she carry a shotgun and a rifle on her back without them getting entangled with the bow and quiver? It annoys me that the bow disappears whenever another weapon is used. Even if it’s just the pistol, which, unlike the shotgun, bow and machine gun, you can always see anyway.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me about the bow is that enemies can neither see nor hear arrows whizzing by, which dulls the stealth. They can only hear the impact of it, if it’s nearby.\n\nThey tried to mix the fights up with big fighters, but their sizes made those moments pretty silly and weird. One guy is like 9 feet tall for some odd reason. In an older Tomb Raider, he would have been a monster instead of a human. Some ancient protector.\n\nThe wildlife is an illusion. Only the wolves in the beginning and at one point in the middle are threatening and only at one part in the beginning does Lara need to feed herself. After that, hunting just adds to your XP, which increases in a multitude of other ways. Tomb Raider pretends to be a survival game, but those aspects are pretty bare and quickly forgotten.\n\nThe mechanics are made so that anyone can play the game and that makes exploration boring. A special sense reveals all the secrets in the world and all the jumps are simple. There isn’t even a lot of jumping and climbing, which was the best thing about Tomb Raider: Anniversary. That game combined challenging platforms with puzzles in a way that made surmounting them satisfying. Lara is an archaeologist, an explorer, but in this game she spends almost the whole adventure killing.\n\nWhy does Lara always touch rock walls when she is walking? I think this started with Uncharted. It looks weird there too.\n\nThe journals feel arbitrary. Like the characters wouldn’t actually write them and put them in such convenient locations. Especially the ones written by Lara’s friends.\n\nThe new Lara moans, cries and overacts too much, even after killing dozens of men. Should this not harden her? From the beginning, she is an amazing killer. We're only briefly told through one of her monologues that she did some treks and target practice with her uncle or whoever he is, but we never experience or see it, which makes it harder to take in. She breathes exasperatedly through almost every line. I don’t really like her outfit. A simple shirt worked in the old games because she was supposed to be cool and sexy, but in this grittier game she looks too bare. Why doesn’t she grab a coat off a dead body if she shivers and sniffs? Everybody else on the island is smart enough to wear a jacket. And you would think she’d take off those three earrings with all that tumbling, falling and skidding about. I also find her bland looking. I don’t like the meek expression. She looks too innocent and pretty. It’s funny that they gave her hair the only TressFX effect in the game. I see her as an innocent, pretty, made-up girl who I’m supposed to feel sorry for as she cries, moans, shivers and screams through all the abuse, which makes me dislike her. She seems weak through almost the whole game. I never believed she could kill so many people. The game takes itself too seriously, showing Lara as sensitive and inexperienced in the cutscenes and then letting us dominate groups of armed men. She looks and acts completely inappropriately for this bleak setting. No one told the devs they had to make the game about a beginner. If you wanna tell a grounded origin story, do it convincingly.\n\nThe other characters are worse.\n\nThe music is cheap. I turn it off sometimes. The music often distracts from immersive sound. That’s something the game does well.\n\nI like the Japanese history and the idea of these people being unable to leave because of an ancient curse, although the effect is lessened by how many of these people there are. How many you kill.\n\nSome of the open areas also look pretty and I liked collecting items, even though it was mostly meaningless and Lara seemed more concerned with her predicament than her profession. She hates tombs. But I guess when you make a game about surviving, it’s hard to emphasize discovery. I hope in the sequel she’s there because she wants to be there.","February 16, 2015","false","29.0"," 54 of 98 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","54","98","2","3"

I have too many great memories of wonderful moments of gaming thanks to this series, and those moments definitely allow me to forgive the varying issues one comes across when trekking through Lara's back catalogue.\n\nHowever, 2013's Tomb Raider reboot takes the series to places that even I, as a rabid Lara fan, could never have imagined.\nQuite simply this is a game that will provide you with an experience you won't soon forget. Not only is it technically masterful and gorgeous to view, but the 'new Lara' is someone you will quickly form a deep and lasting affinity with.\nNo punches are pulled here; she is treated brutally and without sanction. The environment alone pushes her thresholds of tolerance to the very limit, let alone the foes she will ultimately face.\n\nThere are a few QuickTime events that may make you think it's one of 'those' games, but have faith that the few games of Simon Says that do occur are are small and are a worthy price to pay for the emotional adventure ride you will be pulled through.\n\nWhether on sale or no, this game is worth the price of admission, and is an experience that all gaming affectionados should list on their gamer cards by default.\n\nRecommended without any doubt.","July 16, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I love almost every part of it. Its a third-person shooter, which involves combat with numerous enemies, but includes stealth and climbing. The game plays a lot like Uncharted, and I think that it is just as good, if not better. You play through a surprisingly lengthy story mode, where you are stranded on island, attempting to escape the dangers that lurk there. You shoot and climb your way though the beatiful landscape, enhaced by astounding graphical performance. Along the way, you can upgrade your weapons and abilities, helping you overcome some of the tougher enemies in the game. The need to upgrade your equipment forces you to explore the vast island. And even though the island is filled with hidden tombs and areas, the story is still pretty linear. You can choose wether you would like to challenge yourself with the difficult puzzles of the hidden tombs, or you can simply play through the main game. Either way you play, your bound to be satisfied. I played through the main campaign, exploring two or three of the tombs, and searching for a a few artifacts here and there.

The game has lots of set-pieces and QTEs though but they're quite enjoyable.\nThe game nicely depicts the conversation of Lara Croft, from a young archeologist to a capable survivor.

A good story with great voice acting, good graphics and decent mechanics. There is little replay value, and multiplayer is dead.\nYou can view the opening of the single player campaign here.\n\nThis is meant to reboot the Lara Croft franchise. Lara's a young lady here, and the theme of this game - “how to survive” - sees her transition from a timid archaeologist to someone with confidence in what she knows. The transition is completely convincing, and makes the story ultimately compelling.\n\nWhich is good, because a number of other factors don't work quite so well. Lara has a near-breakdown after killing her first human, but then proceeds to kill dozens of soldiers without a second thought (more stealth levels would have been great, but stealth only works in a few areas). Tumbling into a dusty vault and finding a body, she at one point declares, “I hate tombs!” (lol wut?!) The ending monologue has her say, “My father was right about so many things,” when her father is barely mentioned in the story.\n\nAnd don't think, because the game is called Tomb Raider, that there is actually relevant loot in the tombs. There isn't. The tombs themselves are a massive disappointment, being platform challenges for no obvious reward. All end with Lara heaving a chest or container open, giving a little gasp of surprise, and putting something in her pocket. We never get to see what. You do get a Salvage reward, but that's it.\n\nIf you were looking for a fresh take on the older Tomb Raider games, well, you won't find it here. Lara only wields her dual .45s for a total of ten seconds. If you can accept Tomb Raider as reboot prequel of a bigger (and hopefully better) game to come, it's a fun shooter. But that's pretty much all it is.\n\nOn DLC:\nThe amount of DLC for this game is frankly ridiculous. $0.99 for the pistol silencer? How about another $0.99 for a burst-round mode? At least there's a GOTY edition that includes everything.","October 22, 2015","true","46.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sometime when you screw up you're subjected to a short, gruesome death scene. Even when you succeed you might find yourself stumbling through caverns strewn with corpses and pools of blood on the floor. Yet if you can stomach it, it ends up adding to the grisly, extraordinary struggle for survival that tries and tempers a young Lara over the course of this game.\n\nThis iteration of Lara is a compelling one. Since this is an origin story, at the beginning we see her unsure of herself at and terrified when things start going all kinds of wrong. At times her compatriots need to encourage her, other times she is driven to fight for their wellbeing and still other times they butt heads with her. Gradually, as she overcomes the challenges she faces, we see her grow in ability and confidence. The actress and writers did a great job of making her feel like a real person. She's more than just a standard action hero killing machine given a female facade.\n\nVoice acting for video games in today's age of mo-cap has become much more of an involved process. Yet Tomb Raider proves that the talent in this industry is greater than ever and up to the challenge. Camilla Luddington as Croft is the obvious star and shows a broad range of believable emotions. Robin Atkin Downes' depiction of the character Conrad Roth exudes a fatherly, gentle confidence that steadies Lara early in her journey. Another highlight for me was the palpable desperation of the ship's mechanic, Reyes (portrayed by Tanya Alexander), to survive and get back home to her daughter.\n\nThe main acting I didn't care for was for the character Samantha (Sam), who oddly has two actresses credited to the character without distinction for who is responsible for what. She came off as a little flat to me. There's also a point where she voices a letter written by one of Sam's ancestors, yet she hardly alters her voice at all. To a lesser degree I also wasn't too enthused with the writing and acting of the character Doctor Whitman. Neither Sam nor Whitman are distractingly bad, they simply fall short of the excellence of the rest of the cast.\n\nCrystal Dynamics has made a game that is visually stunning, living up to its AAA status. One memorable instance was looking out at a deep blue smoke signal rising in the distance that contrasted wonderfully with the tattered reddish-orange banners intermittently placed along my path. All this taking place on craggy, windswept rocks and ruins overlooking a hazy blue-gray sea and sky. Awe inspiring set pieces and soaring vistas abound amidst this chaotic journey.\n\nThe character design is on par with the environments, including Lara who is just a beautiful as ever and with more realistic proportions and clothing to boot. It's worth noting that the graphics option "TressFX"  gives Lara's hair its own exaggerated physics processing, but it is very taxing on computers. The only time my frame rate stuttered was during close-ups of Lara's face during cutscenes, presumably because of TressFX. You may get better mileage by turning it off and increasing several other settings instead.\n\nThis game's third person shooter, cover based combat isn't particularly original but it's polished and largely satisfying. I appreciate that in most cases (but not all), the enemies seem like they plausibly could have been stationed where you encounter them, rather than being spawned in purely for the sake of throwing combatants at you. Melee attacks are limited to single strikes and dodge counters, indicating that you are expected to mostly rely on your weaponry.\n\nYou are able to upgrade those weapons by scavenging scrap, encouraging you to keep an eye out for collectables as you explore. Lara also gains skill points used to unlock new abilities, which combined with the gear upgrades lends a nice sense of progression to the game. Many of the hidden collectibles have a historical significance that makes this island feel truly inhabited. As you seek them out you'll uncover pieces of this island's wondrous past. There are also numerous, optional, puzzle centric tombs to delve into. On the exploration side of the game, I could have done without the "mash E" type quick time events that are used for turning cranks and prying open doors and chests. The QTEs tied to the action do a good job of keeping you engaged during the more scripted parts.\n\nSpeaking broadly about the story, I liked that it kept me guessing on what was real on this island and what was myth. While it is a little predictable in other ways, it was more than adequate to keep things moving and allow the other aspects of this game to shine. The pacing is excellent, never letting you get tired of one aspect of the game. You'll be driven from one fantastical event and locale to another, with time for cutscenes, character building, exploration and shootouts along the way. My first playthrough, which was about a year and a half ago, took 18 hours and included getting all collectibles and achievements.

I have to tell you, given the thought that I bought it for 4,99€ on special's discount, money more than well spent. This game is AWESOME and overall best tomb raider game ever. What more one of best aciont games ever. I mean yes, all games have flaws but this game's flaw (yes, singular), if it has it, you have to really really really try to find it.\n\nOk, now if you're still with me, upthere is true...mostly...Honestly, good this game ofers really puts shadow over bad but there are some anoying stuff with this game hardly worth mentioning. Or to be picky and/or "really really really try to find flaw as said before..here are some..\n\n(some spoiler allert) :\n\n1. Things that Lara survives as assumed green chicky that has never been in this situation before is above SF. Helicopter desinfection scene...yeah right. If it was me (probably died long before that), I would most likely die again before that happend.\nShe could scream bit less, cause, even though justified, it is bit rutheless what dev's are doing to her during gameplay hours.\n\n2. MULTIPLAYER!!!! theese games should NEVER EVER EVER step into waters of multiplayer. what the hell is that? What is that good for EVER? you're not buying this game for multiplayer, if you are you're sane..but fortunately I don't focus my review or grade on this part of game. So ye... I would need 19999999 more words to spit on MP...you get the picture. I'm only playing MP here cause I am an achievement w#0re, and I want every single achievement I can get. Yep, suffering...I know I know, having a disorder is a b1tch.\n\n3. Four years ago, when I first played this game I was running on Athlon 64 X2 3000+, 4 GiG DDR2, and nVidia 8800 GTX. Had a good game experience, but I wished that I could see the game in it's full glory. So having lara's TresFX hair was out of the picture. So was SSAA4x or some of thos nice high end graphics settings. I mean gaming with Lara's fancy hair (where every other enemy or ally have nothing similar...unecessary option if you ask me), you hardly notice difference.. Who does give a S#1t if her every hair behave differently and who has time to notice that, once you've seen it initially?\nPoint on this : Now I have replayed this game on Intel i5, 8 GiG DDR3, nVidia 660 Ti, fairly stronger than before and as i recall i had same settings as before.. so quite of upgrade for nothing? Difference? While before I had poor framerate when running high settings, now game runs fine but my DCII on GPU was louder than my mother in law stepin on a dog's pop in the middle of her living room. Now you don't know the sound of that..but trust me...ANNOYING!!!! I had to turn down graphics settings again to have bareable gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I don't think my config is High End now, but it's quite alright for the time, and I have no problem with other games. I'm just saying they could do bit more effort into fixing this aspect of the game. Game looks very good on lower settings too though.\n\nCan't wait for the sequel. "Rise of the Tomb Raider"\n\nSo everything considered, and I know i did b1tc# a bit about it, I still give this game solid\n\n9.4 out of 10","February 22, 2015","true","82.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

It was just sitting there minding it's own business while observing the waves of the wide ocean and I thought to myself  Should I kill this crab and get the xp for it? Or should I just leave it be and go on my way?   I then came to the conclusion that I needed to kill this crab for the xp that I was in great need of. Right as I let go of the arrow on my bow and it penetrated the crab's outer shell, an achievement popped up saying "Crab Cakes". As I read the description of this achievement I started to feel signs of remorse and fear knowing that I just killed FeeFee the crab (According to the achievement). The almighty FeeFee the crab was dead because of my choice to take his life for my own personal xp. So, to avoid this situation getting any worse, I quickly used my acrobatic skills to reach the top of a tall mountain and jumped off. I knew that the only way to make things better for both me and FeeFee the crab is to take my own life as well. As I was falling, my life flashed before my eyes. I remembered the time I could walk for the first time and all the happy moments I spent with my family and friends, but I knew this all had to come to an end right as I hit the ground. Lara Croft, the terrible crab killer, was no more...\n\n\nUntil I respawned. -.-\n\n\n14/10   Would recommend to anyone who likes third-person shooter/action games.............

The graphics are excellent and realistic (there's a graphics option specifically for the quality of Lara's hair, as you've probably already heard).  Lara's actually a character now, with personality, a realistic body shape, practical clothing, and dirt and wounds from the beatings she's taken, rather than a Barbie doll with guns.  The new combat system is reasonably good.  There's a story that's more than just a brief series of cliches (okay, maybe not that much more, but it's a hell of a lot better than what the original Tomb Raider had to offer).\n\nIt's not all good news, though.  There's a bit of dissonance in the story, for example, where Lara has an emotional breakdown over killing a man, and not long after, guns men down by the dozen without batting an eyelash.  Lara's incredibly slow to figure out a 'twist' that seemed a little too obvious to me.  And... there seems to be something... missing from the gameplay.  What could it be?  Oh, yeah: tombs, and the raiding thereof.  Sure, there are a few 'optional tombs', but they're short and simplistic compared to the puzzles from the old Tomb Raider.  Aside from those few optional areas, the gameplay is even more dumbed down: all exploration and shooting; no puzzles whatsoever.  Maybe from a marketing standpoint, it makes sense to turn Tomb Raider into yet another bloody shooter, but it still comes as a disappointment.  In keeping with the commercialism, they've also sunk resources into a multiplayer mode, but it's buggy and nothing to write home about, and the lobbies are often deserted.  The final nail in that coffin, of course, is all the DLC, some of which is for abilities and weapon mods that can easily be earned in-game, some of which is for multiplayer goodies that aren't much good when hardly anyone plays multiplayer, and some of which is for extra optional tombs (I haven't bought any of those, but if the tombs in the base game are any indication, they're a ripoff).\n\nIn conclusion: by all means, buy this game, but be aware that you're buying a Tomb Raider that has forgotten that it's supposed to be about raiding tombs, and don't bother with the DLC.","December 31, 2014","true","32.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Some of the views thanks to some amazing graphics are completely mind blowing, and the character creation was, in my opinion, not the worst. Problems I have is how Lara Croft is nothing like what you expect. For example, the first time she kills something, she completely regrets it, theres a 2 minute scene (hyperbole) of her 'opening' a deer, then 3 seconds later, she is capable of doing it in like 1 second. I will admit, I have not finished this game, but I feel that the story so far is superb. The main problem that people have with this game is that it isnt traditional to the collection. Tomb Raider used to be all about platforming, not cover shooting and quick time events. The only puzzle elements in this game are in tombs, which are all optional... The game... Is called... Tomb Raider... And they made the tombs optional... Even then the puzzles are so simple they dont feel awarding at the end, especially when all you get is a tiny amount of scrap and 1/3 of a weapon upgrade (sometimes). Furthermore, the dlc... I haven't bought any of it because im not a fan of the online side to this game, but you can but things that can be unlocked by playing the game. I have never approved to this for it completely ruins the game... Furthermore, there is one singleplayer dlc, other than outfits and the upgrades, which is another tomb... I must point out that all of these tombs have no enemies inside them, not even animals, even though their entrances are so obvious, and are indicated everywhere with white paint. I completely understand why people hate this new style of Tomb Raider... But i quite like the combat side of things. The AI isn't as bad as you may think and the upgrade system is great. I for one am a fan of this change, but I completely understand if you hate it. I bought this for £3, though I would have paid alot more, but if your reading this review and the game is cheap, grab it now. If it isn't, go and watch some gameplay and see if you like it. This game is all a matter of personal opinion...\n\nFinished the game now and I feel pretty dissapointed with the amount of tombs. Without even realising, I had completed all of them just by exploring mission locations... I feel tempted to buy the DLC but I feel that it would be a waste. The game still lets you view the missions last area so that you can get all the collectibles you miss. Enemies are still around so things like scrap can be still used to upgrade as well as earning xp easily. I must say, the final missions were absolutely great, all of them looked amazing... The side stuff was just a massive let down. Still worth a play, but maybe worth checking for a low price on ♥♥♥.","October 17, 2014","true","11.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It was challenging with great visuals for that time.\n\nThis Tomb Rider's reboot big change is the focus on the story instead of the actual tombs like the other ones. So it's that bad? Well, I don't think so. Every tomb is optional and very straight forward, every puzzle is a lot easier than the previous game, I personaly like this way as well because this improves the pacing of the story which is (combined with the awesome gameplay) the main focus. The game, like the first three games features great visuals. Great voices action specialy from Lara Croft (Camilla Luddington) and Roth (Robin Atkin Downes). This is the kind of reboot that any game would want to be.

Do you like a lack of choices? With an action/adventure setting. You will love this game. I do not. It is a quick time event on a leash. I hate to say it but even though this game is very polished and seems to have a good story the hand holding and the quick time events make it on my not recommending list.(And one of the least favorite games I have played in a decade.) It breaks any immersion. I will keep playing to see if it gets better. As its not a bad game but for the money I would look else where.\nSo I kept playing, but this game is not getting better. It is very average with no replay value. Are people paid to wright good reviews for this? I mean you don't raid tombs, and you just do quick time events, meshed into cut scenes. I bought this for 3.99 and would rather have my 3.99. I think people are to envolved in how Lara looks to notice the poor attempt at game play. The story is average as well. Seriously the first Tomb Raider wasn't great(get over it, it wasn't) but the fact this is claiming to be the same in the series is just wronge. You would think they would branch out like Tomb Raider 2 did, but no. There are less options on how to do something then back in Laras PSX days. At least there you didn't get "PRESS A!!!!".... PRESS B, oh you're dead. Retry? With visuals better in open world games that can't be why people like it. Maybe it's the story? No... With Bio Shock Infinite proving this is a trash cliche TV movie story. It's not the gameplay. It's just aweful. The only thing I can think of is the SLI/Crossfire scaling, but seriously are you running it at 150+ FPS? So if you like average games that run well, with lazy quick time events. This is for you. I am "Overwellingly Postive" that this game is average at best.\n\nXbox One is getting a timed exclusive on the next game. I say let the One have it and contain this mess. Why? Why?

I don't want to be to harsh on this game as there were certainly enjoyable moments  and some of the gameplay is pretty well done.  With that out of the way...\n\nIn the simplest sense Tomb Raider is a mediocre version of the Unchartered series for play station 3.  The gameplay is in most cases almost identical but the story is worse, the characters are way less memorable and there is flat out way to much gore.  I don't really get the pole through the head thing.  Oh hey I took a wrong turn and died, so let's use this opportunity to show you something incredibly gruesome.  I'm tired of everyone trying to outdo each other with violence for shock value.  Also I would say it was a little heavy on the "hit the Y button at this exact moment or you will die" gimic.  Once or twice is neat, but they wen't back to that well a way too many times.\n\nThat aside, the leveling up system was a neat twist for this style of gameplay.  It was pretty frustrating not being able to punch or hit someone at the beginning but the level up progression was a nice touch.\n\nAnyways the game should have been called "tomb faller".  I would really like someone to play through the game again and count the number of times that Lara falls more than 35 feet.  I would venture it's over 50 times.\n\n","February 9, 2014","false","12.2"," 45 of 82 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","45","82","0","0"

Boy does she have cleavage.\n\ncons: too many scripted events, tedious and immersion-breaking quick time events, wonky camera angles, tombs are either a parkour challenge or a physics puzzle, horrendous stealth section in the beginning - then the gameplay turns into assassin's creed - then goes into a COD 'shoot everything with explosions everywhere'. Multiplayer is imba because those who have played longer have more unlocks. Ive experienced a few crashes/instability. Highest hair animation setting will tank your frames per second (if not using AMD gfxcard)\n\nOverall, if you want a pseudo open world/linear/scripted/QTE high-budget "next gen" title, or you just have a lot of free time and patience, then this game might be for you.\nIf you were expecting a real open world game, challenging puzzles, survival elements, and a skill system with depth, then im sorry to say you will not find that in this game.\n\nTomb of Duty: Raider's Creed - is a hit or miss.","January 3, 2014","false","13.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

More like 'Horde Killer'!\nMost of the time  instead of looting tombs and exploring, you will be killing never ending waves of enemies, as one shoot-out scene is followed by another. And while the graphics are looking great, the shallow gameplay outweighs all the positive aspects of the game.\n\nLong review\nTomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise, taking you back to the very beginning, when Lara Croft wasn't the experienced adventurer we know since 1996.\nFollowing the shipwreck on a Japanese island Lara is fighting for survival, while going through a journey that changes her forever…\n\nAt least that’s the concept on paper. But let’s see how it actually looked!\n\nWhen you first take control of Lara, the first thing you will notice, that how vulnerable you are, and you can’t help to feel empathy for her for being in this desperate struggle for survival. The game starts out great, as your main objective is to regroup with your friends while trying to survive against both nature and hostile survivors. During this section of the game Lara’s tools and weapons are very limited, but as the game progresses and your arsenal grows, the character development suddenly stops. After the infamous attempted rapé scene, where Lara first kills a human being, the game almost instantly turns into a brainless shoot-them-up. Up to that point you tried to sneak upon enemies or evade them, after this point you will be killing them in group of dozens.\n\nIn order to progress you will be FORCED to kill everyone you see, else you will be swarmed. These „horde” sections happen very often and they get increasingly frustrating as the game progresses. By the end of the game Lara transforms from an unexperienced survivor into a battle-hardened killing machine. Seems like somewhere during the game development the Crystal Dynamics guys lost their focus...\nThe swarm events paired with dumbed down puzzles deliver a very shallow gameplay. The platforming sections of the game are great, and very creative but sadly there are not too many of them, and they are simply not enough to compensate the mindless shoot-out sections.\n\nThe graphics wise Tomb Raider is one of the best looking games on PC and it’s fairly well optimized: it provides you with stunning visuals if you have a good rig, but it runs on weaker hardwares too.\nOverall, Tomb Raider 2013 is a mediocre game at best, and I would only recommend it for fans of TPS action/shooting.\nIf you are looking for good adventure game, then play the older Tomb Raider games and avoid this one as far as possible!\n\nPROS:\n-Gorgeous graphics.\n-Environment and level designs are very well done.\n-Platforming sections are very creative and fun, but sadly they are overshadowed by the shootout sections which fill out the majority of the game.\n\nCONS:\n-Handholding gameplay: the „survival instinct” skill shows you everything, including waypoints, object you can interact with and even highlights the enemies for you\n-Puzzles are obnoxiously easy.\n-Barely any tombs to explore. There are around 10 of them in the game, some of them are even DLC content, but most importantly they only require about 5-10 minutes each to complete.\n-Repetitive and extremely frustrating gameplay. While the game starts out great, it soon turns into a mindless shoot-em-up as you will encounter hordes of enemies every 5-10 minutes.","December 24, 2014","false","46.8"," 97 of 182 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","97","182","9","10"

But the game itself doesn't have much respect for you as a player, and everywhere it could be trying something new or bucking a trend, it just doesn't.\n\nIt's loud, it's flashy, and it's completely toothless.  There are countless scenes where you're escaping something exploding or falling apart by the skin of your teeth - except it's not by the skin of the teeth, because you're not actually doing very much; it's, for all intents and purposes, a cutscene with the occasional need to press a button.  Like a very, very easy Dragon's Lair.\n\nNow, certainly this is preferable to a normal Dragon's Lair, where there's absolutely no tolerance for error.  But it feels like the more cinematic a game gets, the less comfortable it is actually being a game, and we wind up turning the clock back to Laserdisc times.\n\nOne of the biggest things that bothered me about this game was how it was a game about being a "survivor", yet it's far more "First Blood Part 2" than "First Blood".  There's one very good scene in the first half hour of the game where Lara is attacked, and winds up killing a guy.  A few minutes before, she tells someone that she'd rather not become a murderer, and there she is, just having killed a man, and she just about throws up.  It's one of the few times I've seen a game actually acknowledge how serious the act of killing is - then she immediately proceeds to brutally kill a dozen more guys without so much as batting an eye.\n\nI feel like if the game really wanted to show Lara's transformation from someone who is scared, battered, and alone into a hardened survivor, it really should have left the mass slaughter out, or at least left it until much later in the game.  Fighting should be hard, supplies should be scarce, and you should be trying to avoid combat as much as possible.  Instead, you're constantly being assailed by guys coming out of the ♥♥♥♥in' walls and having to shoot the hell out them en masse.  If they had maybe saved something like that until the end, to show the raw determination that Lara has, that might work.  But it's so constant that it becomes routine, and lacks any sort of emotional resonance.  The fights are very easy - so there's no tension, no panic, nothing to justify their inclusion beyond "you have an AK so we have to give you something to shoot with it".\n\nAnd the puzzles - the game has great mechanics and clever design to tell you what you can and can't interact with, but it has no faith in its design.  If you get stuck for more than a minute or two, the game will prompt you to go into "Instinct view" where Lara will basically tell you straight out how to solve the puzzle.  Saves you needing to run to GameFAQs when you bang your head against something obvious in retrospect for an hour, but completely excises the revelatory joy of discovering anything on your own.\n\nThe game is enjoyable in a "let it wash over you" kind of way, but it's too timid and conservative to be great.\n\nOh, and when Lara got that chunk of rebar through her side at the beginning of the game? She NEVER GOT THAT TREATED. I'm surprised there's going to be a sequel because that's going to get so infected...","June 28, 2014","false","20.0"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","25","44","0","3"

And so I begin my review.\n\nTomb Raider is an all round terrific game, no doubt. The gameplay is fluent and nearly perfect. It would seem that every aspect of the game has been carefully designed by the developer to be smooth as cream, and bring an experience like no other games to everyone, might they be new to gaming, or skilled and experienced.\nThe parcour system is very good, and easy, although I have encountered a few minor bugs when exploring, like for example, floating in the air without falling back for a few seconds. But this glitch only happened once and I never encountered any bugs or glitches that broke the game or affected the gameplay.\n\nThe story is very decent and well executed. I'll avoid talking about the plot so that it doesn't spoil it, but it's very good and entertaining.\nThe weapons and combat is decently fluent and accurate, and the cover system, although a bit wonky and slightly hard to master at first (I personally expected the usual "press this key to take cover"), is in fact extremely easy to handle, and turns out to be better than most third person games.\nThe bow is a particularly fun weapon to use in this game. As the rest of the game, the mechanics have been well designed and greatly executed. And nothing beats getting a long range silent killer headshot with it.\n\nTomb Raider also features an upgrade and skill levelling system, which greatly adds to the gameplay.\nStarting with only the minimum equipment, you'll soon be learning new skills in all three skill trees, Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler.\nMost every skills will drastically improve your senses, melee attacks, and ability to find salvage... Which brings us to weapons and tools upgrades.\n\nIn Tomb Raider, you will find salvage throughout the game, which will help you upgrade your gear.\nThere are up to 5 upgrades available for every weapon tier, which can then be upgraded again.\nSalvage can be earned in multiple ways. Killing enemies and looting them, and opening crates or boxes are the most common ways to earn it, but finding treasures, completing challenges, and raiding tombs will also earn you that extra bit of salvage that you'll need to survive your journey across the island.\n\nAs for the graphics, need I say anything? It's beautiful.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful game that I recommend anyone (and everyone) to play.\nTry it, it's worth it.","August 13, 2014","true","31.3"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","5"

This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience.\nAnd what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered.\nTomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.","February 7, 2015","true","10.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Like I said before, the last Tomb Raider I played was Underworld when I got my Xbox 360 back in '08 so I was unsure that I would like this. However, it was a lot different to that game. But however it lacks things.\n\nThe story line is fantastic. You're Lara Croft who isn't really experienced with combat and agility (other than climbing mountains and things) unlike the older games in the Tomb Raider Franchise who is on a ship looking artifacts with other crew members, and it crashed by mysterious storms leaving Lara and the team shipwrecked on this strange island. With Lara separated with the rest of the group, she must find shelter and start hunting for food so she can survive the night. Within the island witness danger with a mysterious cult who were men who was also shipwrecked on the island for years and cannot leave due to the mysterious weather conditions that stops rescues from leaving. It's up to Lara to discover the mystery of the island and save herself and the crew into safety.\n\nI like the combat in this. Like I said about Lara, she isn't really experience. She finds a bow and some arrows and starts hunting with it. The bow and arrows are my favorite weapon in the game. I would use over powerful items like the shotgun and assault rifle. It's a very stealthy weapon and it feels fantastic when earning a headshot without someone noticing that his 'brother' got killed. It's rewarding!\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in this game, some are very simple like GPS caches which are very small and well hidden and there are very complex puzzles like the optional tombs that I've mentioned below. They are very rewarding to find these and earning around 5 achievements for them. Although, I didn't collect them all within my playthrough, I decided to continue the post-game which is just the island in free play. I am very thankful the developers did this since I was worried when I got to the last camp site and it said 'No return point' and I will have to replay the game from the start.\n\nThe optional tomb challenges was one of my favorite things in the game. The discovery of them was so interesting and I will always head on in them when I get the chance. The problem is.. they are really small. It takes around 10 minutes. 5 minutes to look around the area and 5 minutes to actually complete the tomb. You get a treasure map for that area and that's it. You leave it. They are around 6 of them and that's it. It's a shame about that. I would loved some more challenges other than the 'Press X to light statue' or 'Press X to pick up egg'.\n\nThe other problem I had with this game was that the enemies was too generic. They were 80% Cult followers men (I'm guessing they were from the same cult since they have the same models) 15% Wolves and 5% Temple Guardsmen which only appeared in two levels and that even had Cult followers in them as well. I didn't see any other dangerous animals other than wolf and man. Well, at least they are no spiders in it! (other than Underworld).\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer yet but I heard from others that it isn't really worth trying it out. I'm unsure if they are anyone who stills plays it.  I mean, I should try it out but nah. Maybe later..\n\nI would still recommend this game. Definitely. I'm not a big Tomb Raider player but I didn't stop playing this game. I would love to play a sequel if It had similar gameplay to this. Thank you Crystal Dynamic and Square Enix for this reboot.","March 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In the case of Tomb Raider, the amount of polish and the presentation is very impressive. It's a very cinematic 3rd person shooter type game with lots of platforming and climbing around environments. It was very well done. Gaining new gadgets and weapons that let you access more areas, including spots of previously completed areas, give the game a slight Metroidvania feel, though it's still linear and backtracking to previous areas is only to collect missed collectibles. If I had a nitpick for the game, it would be that there is entirely too much combat. This mysterious island seems to have hundreds of people living on it (and that's just the guys that you run into!). I highly recommend it if you like cinematic action games.","July 25, 2015","true","13.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The Innocent.\n\nI rather enjoyed exploring the island of the Yamatai with the sexy archaeologist. Before I start of about the game itself though, there are two things worth mentioning: first, as a classicist, I cringed quite a lot at how the virtual artefacts were treated. Secondly, there was a beautiful message at the beginning of the credits about how the developers valued us gamers. I loved that.\n\nThis game is very plot oriented and tries to immerse the gamer in an adventure filled with drama, feelings and action. The gameplay revolves around puzzles, leading to fighting, leading to 'escapes'. There is also a good number of challenges for those perfectionists who like that sort of thing.\nWithin the story, there are only a few characters one can like: Roth, Grim, Lara (stereotypical innocent and humble hero), Sam (damsel in distress) and maybe, just maybe some people can relate to Mathias? I couldn't; too evil. So there is no character development (though they tried) and this part of the plot is not so good.\nThe actual story of the game however, is not so bad. It's quite simple and easy to guess since there are only so many characters involved and there aren't very many parameters to have to decode. Even so, I still enjoyed going through it and there were a couple of pleasant surprises waiting for me even through my somewhat cynical approach to the story.\nThe game mechanics are something I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, controlls are easy and unobtrusive, and the other hand the game was just made easy. Every ledge that I can (have to) hang on to is painted white and the crosshair for the aim is big enough for me to kill every single enemy with a headshot or two. Enemies can be strong but There's only so many of them and there is more than enough cover at all times.\nThe graphics are ok. I rarely ever stopped to say wow, but neither did I stop to look at any glitches or bad textures neither. The music was good as well, but nothing too memorable.\n\nOverall; I only got under 10 hours of gameplay out of this game, even though it was an expensive game when it came out; but it also has to be put into account that I did not stop to complete all the challenges and get every single collectible (at least not in all the districts, overall completion of %77)\n\n\nTL;DR- get this game if it's on sale for under $10.","November 5, 2015","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are many areas that can improve.","August 5, 2014","true","39.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And they were right, there was too much of it compared to the originals.\n\nThis one is even worse in that sense, it doesn’t really have anything in common with the original beside the name. It’s an action game in the vein of Uncharted, and where there were puzzles before there are shootouts here. It doesn’t even have tombs, not really – the optional ones that are there are a complete joke. Unless if, of course, you consider whole Jamatai as one giant tomb. Which isn’t really far from the truth. An old school fan, and I always considered myself as one such, of TR really wouldn’t find much for him here.\n\nI came for tombs and puzzles and got shootouts and set pieces.And I found myself not caring at all, the gameplay was so fun, the graphics were breathtaking, even collecting all the additional crap was fun. As nostalgia is a curious thing, nothing will probably ever beat the likes of San Andreas, Mafia, Allied Assault, Most Wanted, RE4 etc. of my favorite games list, but this is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. And besides, Lara is nice to look at.","February 13","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience.\nAnd what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered.\nTomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.","February 7, 2015","true","10.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Good as in not awesome, but still enjoyable.\n\nIt has great playability, combat is fun and movement is on point.\n\nSadly, it is badly optimized (at least for NVIDIA) and has choppy "hollywood" like over-exaggerated cutscenes with weird placed triggers.\n\nStory is so, so. It had potential at some point, but it is ultimately wasted. Feels like a Sunday "they all die" movie. Ending seems rushed and incomplete, too many loose plot points.\n\nGameplay wise is where the game does shine, although it does have some issues.\nQTE's for explame, are a joke, as if someone said "hey, most action adventure games have QTE nowadays, let's add some".\nThey ultimately add nothing new or fun, and if you add this to choppy cutscenes and lag, it actually hurts the experience.\n\nI arrived late to the TR party so I could not experience mutiplayer games at all. I tried several times and found not a single soul in any of the game modes,  but I must admit they sound like it would be fun, as combat and stealth action is probably the best of this game.\n\nIt took me some time to complete to %100, and achievements are fun if you like to explore the game's bast environments.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you are craving for a "movie like" action adventure with some amazing production values that you can spend some time in, just don't expect to be blown away by it's story or legacy.\n\nHopefully the next one will care to take itself a bit more seriously and expand the story further.","March 20","true","46.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Like I said before, the last Tomb Raider I played was Underworld when I got my Xbox 360 back in '08 so I was unsure that I would like this. However, it was a lot different to that game. But however it lacks things.\n\nThe story line is fantastic. You're Lara Croft who isn't really experienced with combat and agility (other than climbing mountains and things) unlike the older games in the Tomb Raider Franchise who is on a ship looking artifacts with other crew members, and it crashed by mysterious storms leaving Lara and the team shipwrecked on this strange island. With Lara separated with the rest of the group, she must find shelter and start hunting for food so she can survive the night. Within the island witness danger with a mysterious cult who were men who was also shipwrecked on the island for years and cannot leave due to the mysterious weather conditions that stops rescues from leaving. It's up to Lara to discover the mystery of the island and save herself and the crew into safety.\n\nI like the combat in this. Like I said about Lara, she isn't really experience. She finds a bow and some arrows and starts hunting with it. The bow and arrows are my favorite weapon in the game. I would use over powerful items like the shotgun and assault rifle. It's a very stealthy weapon and it feels fantastic when earning a headshot without someone noticing that his 'brother' got killed. It's rewarding!\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in this game, some are very simple like GPS caches which are very small and well hidden and there are very complex puzzles like the optional tombs that I've mentioned below. They are very rewarding to find these and earning around 5 achievements for them. Although, I didn't collect them all within my playthrough, I decided to continue the post-game which is just the island in free play. I am very thankful the developers did this since I was worried when I got to the last camp site and it said 'No return point' and I will have to replay the game from the start.\n\nThe optional tomb challenges was one of my favorite things in the game. The discovery of them was so interesting and I will always head on in them when I get the chance. The problem is.. they are really small. It takes around 10 minutes. 5 minutes to look around the area and 5 minutes to actually complete the tomb. You get a treasure map for that area and that's it. You leave it. They are around 6 of them and that's it. It's a shame about that. I would loved some more challenges other than the 'Press X to light statue' or 'Press X to pick up egg'.\n\nThe other problem I had with this game was that the enemies was too generic. They were 80% Cult followers men (I'm guessing they were from the same cult since they have the same models) 15% Wolves and 5% Temple Guardsmen which only appeared in two levels and that even had Cult followers in them as well. I didn't see any other dangerous animals other than wolf and man. Well, at least they are no spiders in it! (other than Underworld).\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer yet but I heard from others that it isn't really worth trying it out. I'm unsure if they are anyone who stills plays it.  I mean, I should try it out but nah. Maybe later..\n\nI would still recommend this game. Definitely. I'm not a big Tomb Raider player but I didn't stop playing this game. I would love to play a sequel if It had similar gameplay to this. Thank you Crystal Dynamic and Square Enix for this reboot.","March 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

She is very tough indeed, when most people would've given up, she presses on, gets hurt, endures...\n\nThe game takes you into a harsh environment on an island where it seems there is no escape, an ancient mystical force prevents you from leaving or being rescued... as Lara, you play the game in a 3rd-person view, just behind her... when aiming your weapons, you have the option to switch which shoulder you want to look over as she aims, left or right... you have a powerful bow which can be upgraded with various arrows, from normal ones to fire arrows, explosive arrows, rope-lines, etc... you also gain a pistol, a shotgun, and a rifle along the way, all of which can also be upgraded\n\nThe environments, the atmosphere, the visuals are absolutely stunning... looking off into the distance, seeing the sky, the clouds, the sun, the stars, mountains, trees, rivers, it's all quite breathtaking... it almost makes you forget how hard it is to survive at times when taking in the views, very immersive... the locations vary from mountains, to forests, to the beach and ocean, caves, ancient temples, dirty bloody pits and prison, etc...\n\nThe story was not incredibly deep or thought-provoking, but it was entertaining, somewhat predictable, a member of your castaway group is not a very good person, and it's obvious, and most of the time you know what's going on before Lara even says anything about it, but again, it's quite entertaining regardless\n\nThere are plenty of collectables and challenges to complete, if that's your thing... myself, personally, I'm an explorer, a scavenger, I like to find every item I can, and I enjoy achievements... I found every collectable and completed every challenge, and have 100% achievements, it's not a super long game, but I spent about 26 hours on it, and enjoyed every second... 9.5/10","May 26","true","25.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a huge departure from previous TR games that had you control a Barbie Doll with shooters along a fairly linear run. Granted, Lara is still shimmying along ledges and shooting baddies, but large parts of the game have lost their linearity and are now open areas that you can scour for story content and loot. The enemies are better, your own tactical possibilities are better, the physics and the physics puzzles are better, and the storyline is vastly better. This game is an adventure and a shooter and an exploration game, and it does all of these things well. The graphics and physics have improved enormously, and together with the competent voice acting (extraordinary in the case of the German voice for Lara, Nora Tschirner), it all comes together to make a huge immersive experience that took me over 30 hours to complete 100% -- on easy. There was never a boring moment. (Some of the boss fights have something of the old TR, you need to do a special move and then hit him just right, and that three times in a row; also, some of the quick-time-events break immersion, but we're talking minutes out of many hours of gaming.)\n\nI've played different versions of Tomb Raider before, and don't recall ever making it to the end of the first level. This one, I couldn't put it down. If you own it and haven't played it, you don't know what you're missing. Do play at least into "Coastal Forest" (you should get at least to the part with the wolves) and ideally up into "Mountain Village", which is the first really huge level. (You will realize how huge later, when you learn to shoot and traverse ropes.)\n\nIf your computer supports it, do turn on "Tress Effects", which makes Lara's hair appear as single strands. I played with all settings maxed (except for AA) and a resolution of 1280x720 (reduced for framerate) on a 24" monitor, and the game looked gorgeous. But it's not the looks, it's the gameplay that kept me hooked.","April 24, 2014","true","41.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I always had a special fondness for the gameplay - mixing puzzles, platforming, and action adventure.  Just that it had gotten rather stale over the years.  I cannot express my gratitude enough in bringing this newest Tomb Raider to the world.  Excellent gameplay mixed with a very entertaining story honestly makes this shine.  It could have gone bad in so many ways, but it manages to mix the old style of play with a new take without becoming a grind or cheesy.  YES, there are scenes that are super-Rambo inspired, but it's a video game after all.  We all need that bit of escape.\nWell acted, well directed, executed flawlessly, and really very accessible compared to previous games.  Lots of achievements and hidden items to find too.  Love the map!  Normal difficulty might be too easy for battle hardened gamers.  There were not many spots to get stuck on and I'm terrible at shooters.  I love the action button for basic melee combat and it was hard not to use the arrows for everything as it's much better than guns.\n\nNever had so much fun before jumping through the action sequences.  Flaming buildings, exploding bridges, and hordes of undead soldiers, yay!  She's a survivor in more ways than one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyvine/recommended/203160/","ladyvine","Lady Vine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyvine/","74 products in account","It was almost 14 years ago when I first played Tomb Raider 1... I just realised, while typing this review, that that moment was a little more than 14 years ago :)\nSince then I played and finished all the Tomb Raider games (multiple times), so you can say I'm an expert and a big fan of the franchise.\n\nThis remake of Tomb Raider is excellent, and this is why:\n- Gameplay: easy to learn and master (if you played the older TR games, you are as happy as I am with this)\n- Graphics & maps: even on low graphics it looks stunning, but on max graphics/tressFX you'll be blown away. The maps are gorgeous and have lots of detail, beautiful lightning effects etc. (and sometimes the well-know invisible walls ;)\n- Story: it's an engaging story, I didn't want to stop playing. Sometimes a little predictable, but I didn't mind\n- Music & Voice acting: The music and voice acting is great! As a musician/singer I think those elements are also very important in a game.\n- RPG elements: Lara will evolve during the game, you can spend skill points on her, it's a nice change, but it could have been done better. In the end there's only one way to 'build' your Lara character. It's also nice you can upgrade your weapons, but that's also very linear, you can't make your own choices.\n- Secrets/lootable items: I'm a big fan of lootable items in games and acompletionist. I loved searching for all those GPS's caches, relics, documents etc.\n- Multiplayer: It's fun to be able to play as any character in the game, each will say their own line when you start a match or kill someone. Unlocking Lara is tough, you need to get to lvl 60 and it will take a lot of time. Especially with bow-snipers who will one-shot you :) But before you get there you will unlock lots of guns/pistols/bows and will be able to create your own playstyle.\nI can recommend buying the DLC maps and DLC Hitman-guns.\n\nI can't wait until the new Tomb Raider game comes out, I can't imagine it won't be available for PC. We'll see...","January 23, 2015","true","84.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

After 12 hours of great and satisfying gameplay, I have completed the story mode of Tomb Raider and it's a very good game. Get beautiful landscapes shoved into your face with this awesome looking game. From snow to a beach the variety of atmospheres is impressive. The gameplay is VERY satisfying, scoring some headshots with a bow has never been so good. As some of you may know, the new TR includes some interesting elements, like the ability of upgrading Lara's skills and upgrading her weapons at the cost of XP and salvage. I didn't find the story perfect or awesomely written but it's pretty decent and the things that happen will keep you hooked to the screen and making you want to play a little more to find what happens next. I payed 15$ for this great game, and it is worth every single penny I have spent. I give this game a 9.5/10. Why not a 10?

Ever. The gameplay and puzzles are always fresh, and the platforming elements were pristine.\n\nThe transition of gameplay to cutscene back to gameplay was seamless.\n\nThe story is so good, that if it were a book or a movie it would STILL warrent the money spent for the game. It is so gripping and the action constant. Normally when I play games and am looking to take a break for food or sleep or what have you, I always say to myself that "I'll just finish this segment and then quit as soon as the action dies down," but the action NEVER died down. I was constantly compelled to keep moving; one session, i started at 9pm and by the time I felt the need to check the time, it was 6am.\n\nThe voice acting was simply stunning.\n\nThe design of the combat was so good that with it one could make a standalone game in league with the best shooter's available.\n\nApart from my wish that there was a harder difficulty available, the only thing bad about this game is that it ends.","November 10, 2014","true","18.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","8"

I can only be grateful that the story took me 11 hours to finish and not 40+ hours like FF 13 (which also was a horrible game, but at least the story kept me playing).   Besides the occaisonal fight scene the gameplay seemed very boring to me.  I'm not a fan of strict linear gameplay and this was pretty linear in my view.

Dont bother unless you love this game style and/or its on sale for <$2.50. I got it on sale for about $4 and still feel like i want my money back...\n\nDetails:\nif you like games so linear they're on rails, you'll like this. if you like being told 'mash this button' to win a QTE fight, youll like it too. if you like playing games that have duck and cover systems that make you duck when you want to run, and run when you want to duck, you'll love it. if you like your ai dumb enough to run right past you while you shoot it in a firefight, you'll love it. if you want a protagonist so stupid you'll want them to die, this is your game. If however you like to play a game and not watch a booring interactive and WAY too long movie, look elsewhere\n\n+ves\nruns well, nice graphics. Managed to find just one major bug (dropped off a zipline earlier than the game wanted me to and all the enemies i was dropping in on disapeared) but still didn't break the game, so no biggie.\n\n-ves\nai\noh, the ai. Unrealistically fantastic shots, their guns have 0 kickback or scatter, so they're all hitting you in the head. They've also got perfect vision, despite saying in game 'its too dark i cant see anything' they can apparently pinpoint where you are sniping from 50m away with a silent weapon, the moment you kill their 'brother'. There can be 2 of them facing away form you, you can snipe one in the back of the head, and when the live one turns around and sees the corpse, he imidiately knows taht your hiding behind THAT tree/rock/wall, and opens fire. Same goes in thick fog so bad you cant see them at all, but they can still headshot you. oh, and if there's a large building inbetween you and them, no matter, they'll still throw molitov's or dinamite over said building, landing right at your feet. Shoot a silenced weapon to make a large peice of equipemnt fall and kill some enemies? oh, they know imidiatly that it was sabotage, and where you are. No 'what happened' no 'where is she?' just 'that was definately not an accident and she's there behind that wall, open fire'.\n\nDespite this, the AI is beyond stupid. A number of times they'd run right past me in a firefight, rather than attacking. They'll also just slowly walk round any corner you happen to hide behind, one by one, making it easy to pick them off. just sit there and wait for them to come to you. if they see their mate get blown away right in front of them, they'll still continue on slowly 'creeping' round the same corner. If you or they destroy a piece of cover, they'll still attemt to hid behind it, even though its no longer there. So they're just crouching, 'hiding' behind nothing.\n\nControlls\nIn a word, infuriating. Try to use a crate as cover, and she might take cover behind it, or to the right of it, or the left. who knows? not you. Want to peek out on the left side? ok. now the right side? nope. Varys according to each piece of cover.\nBos fights involve 'doge dogde shoot, go into QTE' kind of manotonous bordom.\n\nCharacters.\nSo dumb and wingy you want them to die, lara in particular. there's a number of cut scenes where you just cant help but say 'that is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you stupid %**@*!'. For instance (not really a spoiler) - jump and knock someone back off a large turret gun. then, rather than use the gun already in your hand to shoot them, you try to turn the heavy ♥♥♥ turret around to kill them. moving the heavy turret takes so long the guy recovers and knocks you off a ledge, and into a dreadded QTE. This is all a cutscene so there's nothing you can do about it either. Are you trying to save your mate, with enemies all around lookign for you? no worries, shout out at the top of your lungs Im' sure they wont hear you... Room full of 30-40 bad guys? no worries, step right out in the open and shoot a bow at them. oh gee, your captured AGAIN? how on earth did that happen? I have nooooo idea (sarcasm).\n\nQTE\nneed i say more?\n\nChallenge\nThere is none. Pretty much infinite ammo the moment you get the 'recover arrows' perk. even if you use 1 arrow to kill an enemy carrying a gun, you'll pick up anywhere form 1-7 arrows off their corpse, maybe some bullets too. Every boss fight is easy, the first one is actually the hardest since its a long QTE that restarts every time you fail it. The most 'challenging' part is killing large groups with the dodgy controlls even then its just run and gun to win, this is on 'hard' too. i'd have done FAR better with a crouch button and no 'auto' cover system.\n\nStory\nPredictable as all hell, and so linear it becomes more like a interactive movie. A really bad interactive movie. Strait to DVD $5 discount box bad interactive movie. Oh look, a clearing. leme guess, as soon as you zip line into it youll be fighting a bunch of enemies coming out of the woodwork? you bet your ♥♥♥. Cleared a room? yep, untill you step through that doorway, all of a suden theres other enemies that heard the gunfight, but didn't decide to come join in untill you went through said doorway. NO way to take alternative paths, to stealth (read above on AI) or do anything but walk allong this path, climb that wall, shoot that guy, wash, rince, repeat.\nStory is forgetable, and goes on WAY too long. Like LOTR or harry potter with about 3x the number of books/movies.\n\nall i can say is im glad i got it on sale, even then though i feel ripped off. In conclusion, NO, i dont reccomend this.","November 22, 2015","false","13.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are still quick-time events throughout the game, but they never really feel out of place and allow you to feel somewhat like you're taking part in an action movie. There's still plenty of climbing to do as with the older TR games, but now there's also a focus on using equipment to gain access to certain areas, which can be rather frustrating if you don't know that certain equipment exists and will be obtained later. The only other gripe I had with this game was that you get about the island searching for relics which you keep (that makes sense, just like the old TR games), but then there are other things you search for like religious artifacts that you are supposed to destroy. If Indiana Jones said "It belongs in a museum!" to Lara Croft, she would answer "No, it belongs in a fire!" - which reminds me, be prepared to solve many puzzles by setting fire to EVERYTHING. It may sound as though I'm completely rubbishing this game, but in spite of all the above comments TR is immeasurably fun to play and well worth buying. It doesn't feel as punishing as the older TR games as you don't have to worry about your health so much (it has that Portal style health bar where things go red and it's bad, but you get to safety and the redness goes away. Phew!), which means you don't have to worry too much about taking a little fall damage but there are still plenty of chances to die and be impaled on a giant tree branch or something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prenticesteam/recommended/203160/","prenticesteam","Prentice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prenticesteam/","85 products in account","Amazing game!  9,5/10\n\nA fresh and an essential take on the old good Tomb Raider franchise. This game definitely guarantees that you will have the best Tomb Raider experience up to now.\n\nThe game has so many features and implementations that make you feel like: "Wow, this feels so natural, why wasn't this implemented before anyway?"\n\nTaking Tomb Raider out of her "sexualized objectification" and giving her character a meaning is something this game has accomplished very well. So, our new fresh main character, Lara Croft is no longer just an Indiana Jones-with boobs, and this is how everyone should see her. Whether you are an old Tomb Raider fan, who wants to see more of Lara Croft or just a newcomer who has finally decided to meet Lara Croft (actually that's even better) this game is just for you!\n\nBtw. I like how it is called just Tomb Raider, and it deserves that name because they have really re-created the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft! Thanks Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics for this amazing game!\n\nOk here is my review of Tomb Raider:\n\nGraphics    10/10\nThis games graphics look amazing! I have played it on maxed settings with TressFx on and everything looks just beautiful. The details of the environment and the atmosphere are stunning and it is very immersive. When you are hiding from enemies in the forest you really feel like you are in a forest. There really isn't much to say. Also dynamic hair is evolutionary!\n\nSound     8/10\nThe sound effects were nicely done and the music was wonderful, maybe the ambient sounds could be worked on as I thought that the atmosphere of being in a forest lacked a little bit but that is very personal.\nAlso why didn't they put subtitles without hearing impaired captions? I prefer having subtitles but with this game I had to turn them off.\n\nStory     9/10\nNormally I never felt like the story was good in Tomb Raider games but this time it is really good. At first I thought it was a  cliche; ship crashes, enemies on the island try to kill you and your friends but the game has pulled it off very well and the story was interesting, logical and thrilling.\nCharacters were good.\nBut what I found lacking was the given information about the characters in the game.\nAnd also because you don't really spend much time with any of your friends, it's hard to connect with any of them emotionally.\nThe same goes for the enemies as well. Although it might be seen as you know only the things you see/find about them during the game; for me at least it wasn't enough.\n\nGameplay     10/10\nGameplay is really where this game shines. Everything is so smooth and fun to play with. Gunplay is great, jumping around looks and feels great, finding your way on the island right after you have escaped from your enemies is great, animations are amazing; in short everything is great!\n\nAt this point I want to point out a few features I loved about the game:\n\n- Animations: Animations in the game look just amazing! Whether you are exploring the island or shooting your enemies in a fight, they look great! Also, going through little cracks or auto-crouching animation or the way Lara holds the torch, they are all beautifully executed.\n\n- Weapon Upgrade System: You no longer find your new weapons somewhere in your Mansion or hidden in the world waiting for you. You upgrade your own weapons by finding "salvage parts" through out the island either by finding crates or by looting enemies. You also have skills that you can progress after gaining skill points. Both systems are working very well and you never really feel like you have to grind for your next weapon. It just plays out very natural.\n\n- Books: Books or diaries you find in the game are giving a lot of information both about the story and the characters. They help you to have a connection to the story and the characters. The extra beauty of them is that you don't have to read them or even find them, they are just optional; though I really recommend reading them as they enhance the story and the lore.\n\n- Relics: Relics are well relics scattered around the island that you can find. You can then see information about them and you can find small hidden clues on the relics that helps Lara to figure out more information about the relic, that's really interesting and fun. I wish more relics had those hidden clues. Additionally the information about the relics do not feel like a wikipedia article, instead they are short and interesting and you feel like Lara has just found a relic.\n\n- Tombs: Ironically this game has one of the best implementations of tombs in a Tomb Raider game. They are hidden and awating for you to explore them. After solving little puzzles, you find treasures and earn experience points. They are good breaks from the action-pace of the game while giving you some puzzles to solve and calm down :)\n\n- Immersion: This game is the most immersive and lore-friendly game I have played ever! All the implementations, characters and the story stay true to that!\n\n- Continue playing after it ends: Yes, I hate it when an amazing game is over and it doesn't let you continue playing the game with your developed character. This game lets you do that! Furthermore most of the areas are also clear from enemies which let you explore the island freely without a worry! Also I highly recommend going back to those places to see how beautiful all the environments are.\n\n- Lara Croft: Yes, Lara Croft. The modelling, animations and the voice acting are superb! And the fact that she has 'a soul'\nso to speak makes it all amazing! Also smaller boobs make her look more normal, natural and more beautiful, - in my opinion they could be even smaller ;)\n\nWhat I wish there was but there wasn't:\n\n- More time with friendly characters: You just play most of the time alone. I understand that it was meant to be that way but I wish there were times when you could at least see Lara Croft playing with other characters.\n\n- More hunting: I just wish the game had an optional hardcore survival mode that made you drink water, hunt animals for food etc. Afterall this was a survival game, right?\n\n- Romance?\n\nOverall     9,5/10\nThe game is amazing, period.\n","December 7, 2013","true","35.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

My favourite part about the audio was the voice acting - everyone was great in their role, which kept me somewhat interested in what was going on in terms of the plot.\n\nAnd now for the rest of the game:\nWhile the overall story is fine, the way some of the plot elements were handled was simply lazy - without spoiling anything, there is one moment in the game where you get an opportunity to pretty much resolve the plot of the game in a satisfying fasshion that would make sense. I personally was excited to do this and see where the game would go and what it would throw at me from there. However instead of doing what I wanted to do and what would havge made sense at the time, I was thrown into a cutscene where Lara did something that nobody with a brain would decide to do and just delayed the conclusion until the actual end of the game, which was extremely annoying from my perspective.\n\nNow for my major gripe with this game - the gameplay, or the lack thereof - for the first half an hour or so of the game, the only thing I got to do was mashing random buttons to get through quick time events and press W to move Lara along to the next round of button mashing. After a while you do get some gameplay, but even walking around a level as Lara is extremely unsatisfying - nice and shiny animations of her doing things were always prioritised over fluid feeling gameplay.\n\nMost of the levels apart from a couple of exceptions are extremely linear. The game urges you to use your "Survival sense" which is just a lazy way to communicate to the player what you want them to do, instead of putting more effort into intuitive level design, so that the player could figure out what to do on their own, even if they are actually being guided without them realising it. The strange thing is that Tomb Raider pretends to be somewhat open world, as you can fast travel between different checkpoints and explore the linear levels and complete optional dungeons which branch off from the main levels.\n\nThe way the puzzles are designed is kind of awful. You as the player might come up with multiple ways of solving puzzle thrown at you, but then when you try to execute your solutions, you'll find that what you figured out was in fact "wrong." There is no continuity in the game mechanics - just because something looks like something you can interact with, like you have done many times before in the game, you might not be able to because, this time, the game doesn't want you to, which leads to you as the player, getting punished for not thinking the way the designer thought when they were designing the level. This means that you get pretty much no more value out of playing this game, than watching a let's play of it on YouTube.\n\nThe combat isn't bad, however the half of the perks that you can acquire when leveling up that affect the combat are kind of useless, depending on your playstyle (aka how many QTEs you want to activate mid-combat), which meant that after I was about halfway through the game, the combat didn't evolve much, as I had already acquired pretty much everything that I wanted to have.\n\nOverall, this game is just one high budget set piece, a very long series of QTEs broken up by badly designed puzzles, walking at different speeds (depending on what mood Lara is in), mediocre combat and cutscenes that you can never just sit back and watch, because you never know when you're going to be thrown into a QTE again.","October 31, 2015","false","7.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

And you wanted to move on because you wanted to find the next puzzle, to explore and find the next secret area.\n\nWithout spoiling too much of this game, let me just tell you that your first goal is to survive and escape some cave. Every action you can perform the game will helpfully spoil by showing you an on-screen tip explaining what you can do by pressing this or that button. All puzzle elements are made even more obvious by semi-transparent icons, even more so with survival instinct power which you have and which conveniently highlights the key items or paths in the room.\n\nTrying to play this game I have realized that my passion for adventure games has not changed. What has changed is the target audience for the genre -- Tomb Raider 2013 like many other new games is targeted at casual console players who don't want their brains getting tired by hard-to-solve puzzles, and who will play it on a gamepad dutifully mashing the buttons when told to. Out with exploration and freedom, in with hand-holding and linear game play.\n\nIf you liked Tomb Raider I, II, III, IV... you should not bother with this game -- it has nothing in common with those old titles except for the heroine name -- the only thing worth playing for is its stunning visuals provided that your PC can handle them.\n","June 25, 2014","false","0.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Probably not, but I figured I would at least write a little something, as I did enjoy this game.\n\nThe new Tomb Raider is a reboot of the series for modern consoles and PC. You play as a young and inexperienced Lara Croft, before she becomes a badass adventurer - a new origin story, basically. This is one of the game's strengths. Since it's not really beholden to anything that came before (except really basic stuff such as Lara's name and archaeology background), the writers were free to build the character from the ground up, and they did it fairly well. The game takes place on a seemingly-inescapable island full of all sorts of mysteries. Sound familiar? If you said "hey, that's the plot of LOST", then you win the Captain Obvious prize. The whole setup and plot, in fact, feels like a direct love-letter to LOST, as they share many similarities. So that's a plus if you are also a fan of that series.\n\nGameplay is third-person action/adventure, very similar to the Uncharted series (with some hints of Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia thrown in). There is nothing particularly ground-breaking about any of it, but it's well made and is pretty fun. Your signature weapon is a bow, but you can also obtain a few others, such as a pistol, shotgun and more. Along the way, you'll also experience a fair amount of "set piece" moments and platforming sections. Overall, it's a good balance between exploration, combat, and action sequences. Combat itself is extremely easy (at least, it is with mouse aiming - more on that later). So this isn't a game you should play for a hard core challenge. Play it to experience the story and just have some good clean fun shooting dudes in the head with flaming arrows. There is also a multiplayer mode as well, but I don't really care about multiplayer in these types of games, so I didn't try it and can't really comment on that portion at all.\n\nI did encounter a couple of small issues with the game, though. The main problem I had was with the controls for gamepads. I started playing with an Xbox 360 controller, since most console ports tend to be designed for controllers and generally play better that way. However, this is not one of those games - that is, not unless you are a whiz with using the right-stick for aiming. Maybe it's just me (being a longtime PC gamer), but I just find controller aiming schemes to be terrible. For this game, it was too hard to aim with pinpoint precision under circumstances that required quick responses. Additionally, I had major problems with the camera control using the controller. I like to invert my X-axis for camera on the right-stick in 3rd person games, but for some reason, in this game, it just refused to work properly. It will work correctly once, and then not even 2 seconds later, the opposite effect happens, even though you are doing the same exact thing as you did a second ago - it's pretty much completely broken. So I switched to keyboard and mouse, and never looked back. I recommend you do the same. With a mouse, you can headshot pretty much every enemy in the game before they even have a chance to shoot at you. In retrospect, it's obvious that the AI was dumbed down for console players, who have to use the crappy right-stick aiming control method. Another issue I had with the game is its use of quicktime events (QTEs). These might have been novel when Resident Evil 4 came out, but that was nearly a decade ago now. Games have evolved since then, and these unholy abominations should have been banned from modern game design by now... *steps off soapbox*... Anyways, thankfully, there are only a few sections that have QTEs, but the ones that are there are still annoying as hell - you barely get any warning, so if you're not prepared and don't mash the right keys in time, you have to replay a section over and over again. It's really annoying, and takes you out of the game.\n\nThose small complaints aside, I enjoyed the game a lot. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or anything, but it's definitely well above average and provides a good, fun time (an interactive popcorn flick, basically). The gameplay, graphics, and setting are all pretty solid as well, and the story is a nice new start to a franchise that was on its last legs. I would estimate the main campaign lasts somewhere between 12-18 hours, depending on whether you just run through it or if you are a completionist - and there's also the aforementioned multiplayer, if you're into that sort of thing. So it's definitely worth the money, if you are into these sorts of action/adventure games (and definitely pick it up if you enjoyed the Uncharted series, in particular).","March 28, 2014","true","20.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","2"

Frustrating and tedious QTE's, an endless amount of cutscenes, inconsistent maps, dumbed down gameplay. Take your pick of whichever one(s) serve to help ruin any enjoyment you might otherwise get out of it. Lara is likable, but she can't seem to figure out if she's a tough independent woman or damsel in distress who needs encouragement and direction at every turn. She becomes so injured that I assumed she must be some kind of invincible robot by the time I stopped playing. Make no mistake- you're never under the impression that you're playing anything memorable here. Eidos should be embarrassed to have their name associated with this after the completely different Deus Ex masterpiece they put out (Yes, I know they're just the publisher for TR). Decent, if on par for 2011 graphics (but nothing mindblowing) aren't nearly enough to save whatever else this game offers.","December 31, 2013","false","2.0"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

What they ended up doing instead, was borrowing from other popular titles to create a moderately interactive movie that walks the line of generic and shows a few glimmers of brilliance.\n\nIt goes without saying that the game is absolutely gorgeous, with the exception of the introductory scene which I found to be rather ugly and off-putting. After that, the game is stunning to look at when it's not shoving some stupid post-processing effect or filter in your face. This is a miner gripe, but it's something that stood out to me. They are constantly trying to obscure the great environments and cutscenes with shoddy camera filters and a pseudo-shakey cam effect that is so jarring it would make a camera man with cerebral palsey frown.\n\nThere are a few moments through out the course of the game that are truly exciting and novel, but the majority of the game is composed of moments ripped straight out of other games. Environments are constantly crashing down around you, but it all equates to a fancy cut scene with few quick time events. Even though the world is coming apart and Lara is just barely scraping by, it all feels incredibly staged. And should you manage to miss one of the stupid button presses, you can be sure that you'll only lose about 30 seconds of game time. The game fails to establish any real stakes or tension, and because of this all the action scenes are utterly boring. More than once I got up to go to the bathroom or make a sandwich while the drawn out action scene played itself out so that I could finally get back to playing.\n\nOn the plus side, combat can be a lot of fun. Environments burn around you and fire can spread to nearby objects, forcing you to find new cover. Enemies are always moving which forces you to react fast. However, the cover system leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes Lara won't completely get behind an object, and you can't always choose to make her hide. And occasionally, AI can be a bit unfair. They tend to know where you are even when they have no way of knowing it and can respond with pinpoint accuracy from unreasonable distances.\n\nBecause of the constant interruption of cutscenes and quicktime events, the game has almost no momentum at all. You'll start moving through the game, glad to be out on your own and solving a little jump puzzle when BAM! - another cutscene.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is that the premise of the game is fundamentally flawed. We come to Tomb Raider because we want to see Lara Croft raid tombs, shoot guns, and be a general bad ♥♥♥. However, this is Lara's origin story, and as such she's a whiny little kid for the majority of the runtime. She spends the majority of the game whining about her boo boos and how hungry she is. Over the course of the game she works her way towards the goal of being the person we all know and love, but by the time she gets there the game is over. This kind of character development can be great in a game like "The Last of Us", where the characters are the driving force. But in Tomb Raider, a game that is supposed to be about... you know, rading tombs and murdering people, it's not such great thing to focus on.\n\nOne of the most exciting moments for me was when I got to go off and "raid a tomb". "Finally!" I thought, "Now this is going to be good." 3 minutes later, the tomb was fully raided and I walked away empty handed. No enemies, no tough puzzles, no new weapon reward, just another time-sink until I get to the next cutscene.\n\nIf you're looking to relive the action, puzzling, fall-to-your-death glory days of Tomb Raider but with updated graphics, you're not going to find it here. This is just a movie with some interactive portions stolen from "The Last of Us" and "Uncharted", both games which are vastly superior.\n\n\nPros:\nBeautiful\nGood Voice Acting\nCombat is fun and fast-paced\n\nCons:\ntoo many quick time events\ntoo many cutscenes\nNot enough badass Lara\nAI is slightly cheat-y sometimes\nSHAKEY CAM - Why, God, Why?! The game looks like The Blaire Witch Project half the time.","December 22, 2014","false","6.9"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","18","32","3","0"

Unfortunately with the most recent release/pre-boot Tomb Raider the game series was transformed into more action third-person shooter than anything else. Granted, with the success of Mass Effect I have no doubt that third-person action shooter puts the game in a more profitable position in the marketplace.\n\nI understand that it's a good place to make money but hardly does the Tomb Raider franchise justice. The gameplay seemed to mimic the feeling of Farcry 3, but without its charms. The killer for me was the constant interruption of cut-scene button smashing sequences, they became so constant and so annoying that the game was literally unplayable. The lack of puzzles did not help and aided in making the game an almost mindless FPS.\n\nThere are some nice additions, such as the optional diary entries and so on. This game had a few nice things going for it, but the gameplay is so annoying, so fragmented, and disjointed that I think I lasted maybe an hour before I was screaming at my computer "I'M DONE SPAMMING MY "E" KEY!" This game was literally this most agitating thing I've played since Trespasser in the 90's.\n\nIf I wanted to button mash, I'd play Metal Slug or Mario Party not Tomb Raider. Some people seem to like it, like I said it is not without its niceties, but also know that if you are expecting a Tomb Raider style game, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n","May 10, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It wasn't what I would expect from a Tomb Raider game as it was more focused on killing then it was on actual puzzle solving. The older TR's where about trying to navigate your enviroments and trying to solve puzzles. There is still some of that in this version of the series but it's smothered under all the violence.\n\nI was almost wondering if the TR creators where jealous of the Drake Fotune series as, based on my brief impression of that game, this TR was trying to be exactly like it.  Why tho?  What was wrong with the former light hearted version of TR? Did they really want to shove a multiplayer into the TR series that badly?\n\nI can understand the need to reboot ther series to keep it fresh but this seemed a bit too unpleasent and gritty.  I perfer the idea of Laura having a nice backstory instead of a sad one. I hope they will consider bringing the former Laura back and get back into puzzle gameplay more.\n\nIt's still a good and fun game on it's own but not with classic Tomb Raider expectations.","December 14, 2014","true","23.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

However, this game restructures combat and gameplay in a way that may leave old fans scathing. Much of the puzzle solving enjoyed in the old games are left by the wayside in favor of a more cinematic adventure feel. To further this feel of a cinematic adventure, combat is regularly interrupted by cut-scenes and quick-time events.  What puzzles are left are solved quickly; many of these puzzles are so intuitive, many players - especially gaming veterans - may not even realize they're\nthere.\n\nLara Croft is no longer an overly sexualized object of lust doling out bad-assery and oozing cucumber-cool confidence from every pore at the expense of having a believeable personality. Lara is a fresh-faced, academically-minded graduate in the field of archaeology with foibles, ambition, anxiety, insecurity and growth. Her outfit is designed for practicality in exploring a warm forest environment, and the alternative skins share in this proper aesthetic.\n\nThe game is not without flaws. Combat and platforming can have serious bugs. You might see your bullets and arrows fly straight through an enemy's eye, while not delivering the headshot you would expect - or any damage for that matter. Shooting from behind cover is heavily encouraged in this game, but trying to fire your weapon from behind a corner is a small gamble, as your projectiles might stop at the wall. There were a few times when I was leaping toward a surface that required a button press to latch on to (and it's easy to tell what is a legitimately climbable surface), actually pressing the button did nothing, and I plummeted to my death.  I also determined that aim sensitivity is not consistent, and traveling along the x-axis is minutely quicker than along the y-axis. Aiming is easier with a mouse, but general controls are much tighter with a controller - though not perfectly.\n\nThe plot was on the whole, very enjoyable and riveting; it was easily blockbuster quality, however some of the nasty things that happen to Lara Croft and her supporting cast could have easily been avoided. Some mistakes were actually understandable, but just as many only served to advance the plot action-movie style, and drive home the sense of despair and weariness that Lara was supposed to feel over the course of the game. Additionally, in the beginning of the game, Lara suffers a wound - front through back - to the left side of her waist. Her kidney was probably punctured from that, but once she's able to settle down with a first aid kit, she bandages two locations on her leg but not the gaping wounds on her torso. Still, there's enough twists and turns through the unfolding events to keep you excitedly guessing, and it won't be terribly hard to overlook the chronic idiocy that besets the cast.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good game, and definitely worth buying if you catch a sale.","January 10, 2015","true","25.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Took me this long to play it because of severe running issues on my old computer (refused to even start due to my Nvidia graphics card that was certainly good enough to run it), but it ran like a dream on my gaming desktop and looked stunning.\n\nThe direction and animation in this game is phenomenal and the redesign of Lara is much better than she used to look (will look? Prequels, eh?). Despite uproar over gameplay changes, this was a very fun game with plenty of exploration but still linear enough to find your way and move the story.\nThe writing is pretty good and the voice acting is above average; it's refreshing to hear a realistic British accent even if she does say 'elevator'.\n\nThe game can be a bit heavy-handed with the QTEs, particularly at the beginning, but hours of playing around and exploring is enough to drown that out.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: the death animations. God, this game has a lot of death animations. No simple ragdolling for Lara Croft. Enjoy watching a few particular ones again and again as you fail to get past the damn quick QTEs.\n\nNonetheless, this is a very polished game with only a couple of bugs (worst was when I did a combat roll and slipped through a rock into the void).\n\nI heartily recommend this game.","January 19, 2015","true","36.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.\n\nYou will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.\n\nWeapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.\n\nThis game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)\n\nMy only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpoints\n\nfor DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend\nTomb of the Lost Adventurer\nAgility Skill\nPistol Burst\nPistol Silencer\nAnimal Instinct\nHeadshot Reticule\n\nall these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price.","June 23, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are some large open areas to explore, and there is plenty of collectible hunting, but it was hard for me to do much of it since I kept wanting to go to the next mission. I wanted to know what happened next so much that it cut into my usual collectible mania.\n\nYou can tell the designers were aiming for the game-that-feels-like-a-movie, and I think they hit it straight on the head. There are a ton of set pieces, there are some QTEs, and you do lose control of the camera semi-frequently, but none of those things bother me.

The way you approach combat is surprisingly grounded. You won't be double fisting micro-uzis shooting up baddies while leaping 10 feet in the air doing backflips. The story and Uncharted-style escape scenes are completely over the top though.\n\nIt's not a completely cover-based shooter though, and you get a few tools to help you keep moving and get up close and personal. Melee's fun. The bow adds tension while charging it up and aiming. The firearms are typical. Lots of gruesome animations, from bashing people over the head with rocks to watching them flail around on fire for an uncomfortable amount of time.\n\nThe story fits for a Tomb Raider prequel reboot as well, although wow was the supporting cast just not there. They get introduced through flashbacks in the first 1/3rd of the game, which felt pretty late to be reflecting on people who were personal to Lara herself. They handwave the hell out of Lara's survial training, and it doesn't truly get explained until some late scenes and collectable documents concerning Rolf, the Obi-Wan Kenobi Jedi Master of the Croft family's Batman-like combat training.\nEarly on, he emerges through Lara's thoughts while she scrambles to remember how to, and then does, kill an army of mad cultists.\n\nThis isn't a very deep game. It's a comic book with a pittance of real world grounding. I won't even begin to engage with that old argument about survivor believability as compared to Jason Brody because it's as asinine as wondering why Superman faces challenge.","March 7","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You do not have to play through previous episodes in order to enjoy the game at the fullest.\n+ Exploration\n+ Story\n+ Characters\n+ Graphics (dat hair)\n+ User-friendliness\n+ Decent multiplayer\n+/- Console-esque gameplay\n+/- QTEs\n+/- Little to no recoil\n+/- Lara's accent (I personally love it)\n- Repetitiveness\n- No replay value\n- The shotgun has more bark than bite\n- The controls feel clumsy\n- No manual save\nAll in all, I recommend the game to everyone, not only to the die-hard fans.\n\nREVIEW\nI would like to begin by saying that I haven't played any of the previous episodes of the series. This review comes from someone who has little idea what Tomb Raider series are about. Having said that, this game is a great (and easy) way to get acquainted with Ms Croft.\n\nI must admit that I enjoyed the game much more than I thought I would! The thing I like the most is exploration. Although the plot is quite linear (it feels like watching a film), the places we travel to (which are accessible at any moment via "Fast Travel Camps") are admirable. This is not only due to their design, but also thanks to the amazing graphics. I can only imagine how tremendously good this game looks on "high" settings...\n\nThe story is told in a multi-dimensional way. Throughout the course of the game, we can find various documents which show the events through the eyes of different characters. I definitely recommend taking the time to read them.\n\nThe game is designed for consoles and, in my opinion, the gameplay suffers greatly from it. To begin with, there is an abundance of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Some swear by QTEs, but I cannot stand them. Second, the gunplay is characterised by little to no recoil and relies on random bullet spread. I know that many people prefer to just point and shoot, but I prefer having recoil as I believe it increases the skill ceiling in multiplayer (the one who controls the gun better wins). Weapons are overally well-balanced, but the shotgun has more bark than bite. And last but not least, the controls feel clumsy and are not responsive enough.\n\nAlthough the story is presented really well and there is a lot of area to explore, the game gets slightly repetitive. Also, it is very easy (at least on "normal" difficulty). Some riddles are more challenging than others, but finishing the game is almost effortless.\n\nA few words about multiplayer: it is decent. My favourite mode is "Rescue", which is an interesting variation of the good old Capture the Flag. One team (The Survivors) has to grab a few med-kits (their location is mostly random) while the other (The Solarii) has to execute the opponents. The multiplayer may be laggy, as it relies on peer-to-peer connection.\n\nTo conclude, this is a very solid game and I can definitely recommend it to everyone, not just to the die-hard fans. There are some shortcomings, but overall I am fond of the game. An 8/10.\n\nP.S.

Unfortunately with the most recent release/pre-boot Tomb Raider the game series was transformed into more action third-person shooter than anything else. Granted, with the success of Mass Effect I have no doubt that third-person action shooter puts the game in a more profitable position in the marketplace.\n\nI understand that it's a good place to make money but hardly does the Tomb Raider franchise justice. The gameplay seemed to mimic the feeling of Farcry 3, but without its charms. The killer for me was the constant interruption of cut-scene button smashing sequences, they became so constant and so annoying that the game was literally unplayable. The lack of puzzles did not help and aided in making the game an almost mindless FPS.\n\nThere are some nice additions, such as the optional diary entries and so on. This game had a few nice things going for it, but the gameplay is so annoying, so fragmented, and disjointed that I think I lasted maybe an hour before I was screaming at my computer "I'M DONE SPAMMING MY "E" KEY!" This game was literally this most agitating thing I've played since Trespasser in the 90's.\n\nIf I wanted to button mash, I'd play Metal Slug or Mario Party not Tomb Raider. Some people seem to like it, like I said it is not without its niceties, but also know that if you are expecting a Tomb Raider style game, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n","May 10, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is one example of what games should be, Good story, interesting cast, Good voice acting, Pretty enviorments, Good combat, and nice things to upgrade Lara with.\n\nThat said, this game, is in my opinion well optimized, and runs smoothly, yes the game also has some flaws, but it never takes away from the immersion. QTE fill in pretty well with Cutscenes, and gameplay is never really broken, Saying that because Lara can be pretty stupid with grappin Ledge's sometimes, or simply fall off and die.\n\nThere are alot collectibles to find, and every single one comes with an interesting story behind it,\nThe GPS's, Documents, Relics, and treasure maps await you, and ofcourse in true Tomb raider style, there are some tombs to be raided, though in my own opinion they are way to short and easy.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, i would say, go do it, Cause you will not regret it.\nand i don't care you do not like this sort of game, you like what i like, GOOD games. Games that are worth you're money.\nAs for me, i will deff, buy the "Rise of the Tomb Raider". Will revieuw that aswell!\n\nAs for now, the pros and cons of the game with ofc, the game score i think it deserves.\n\nPros:\n*Good Action/Stealth game\n*Good Combat\n*Interesting Story\n*Graphics are amazing and stunning\n*Alot of collectibles to find on you're own\n*Lara had a big and nice reboot\n*Can decide to go stealth or gunzablaze towards enemy\n*Bunny doll\n\n\nCons:\n*Multiplayer [ why? well its not bad, but not really that good either, it has very few maps, and was not needed imo ]\n* Lara can sometimes be frustrating by jumping off cliffs\n* QTE can sometimes be replaced with combat\n* Boss battle [Final] was not what i was expecting\n\nScore: 9/10 Beast of a game, Go pick it up.","March 4","true","47.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm not just talking about the original playstation games, even the most recent releases. The Game is heavily story driven. You get a large cut scene, followed by some QTE, explore the area, collect items, kill a few enemies, repeat, but the game does it well. The shooting and combat is very solid.\n\nIt's weird that a Tomb Raider game has Multiplayer, but it's a decent addition. It's not very populated, but It can be entertaining for a while. After a handful of hours, it kind of gets stale. If you like to collect achievements, most are fun to get.

However, this game restructures combat and gameplay in a way that may leave old fans scathing. Much of the puzzle solving enjoyed in the old games are left by the wayside in favor of a more cinematic adventure feel. To further this feel of a cinematic adventure, combat is regularly interrupted by cut-scenes and quick-time events.  What puzzles are left are solved quickly; many of these puzzles are so intuitive, many players - especially gaming veterans - may not even realize they're\nthere.\n\nLara Croft is no longer an overly sexualized object of lust doling out bad-assery and oozing cucumber-cool confidence from every pore at the expense of having a believeable personality. Lara is a fresh-faced, academically-minded graduate in the field of archaeology with foibles, ambition, anxiety, insecurity and growth. Her outfit is designed for practicality in exploring a warm forest environment, and the alternative skins share in this proper aesthetic.\n\nThe game is not without flaws. Combat and platforming can have serious bugs. You might see your bullets and arrows fly straight through an enemy's eye, while not delivering the headshot you would expect - or any damage for that matter. Shooting from behind cover is heavily encouraged in this game, but trying to fire your weapon from behind a corner is a small gamble, as your projectiles might stop at the wall. There were a few times when I was leaping toward a surface that required a button press to latch on to (and it's easy to tell what is a legitimately climbable surface), actually pressing the button did nothing, and I plummeted to my death.  I also determined that aim sensitivity is not consistent, and traveling along the x-axis is minutely quicker than along the y-axis. Aiming is easier with a mouse, but general controls are much tighter with a controller - though not perfectly.\n\nThe plot was on the whole, very enjoyable and riveting; it was easily blockbuster quality, however some of the nasty things that happen to Lara Croft and her supporting cast could have easily been avoided. Some mistakes were actually understandable, but just as many only served to advance the plot action-movie style, and drive home the sense of despair and weariness that Lara was supposed to feel over the course of the game. Additionally, in the beginning of the game, Lara suffers a wound - front through back - to the left side of her waist. Her kidney was probably punctured from that, but once she's able to settle down with a first aid kit, she bandages two locations on her leg but not the gaping wounds on her torso. Still, there's enough twists and turns through the unfolding events to keep you excitedly guessing, and it won't be terribly hard to overlook the chronic idiocy that besets the cast.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good game, and definitely worth buying if you catch a sale.","January 10, 2015","true","25.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Despite uproar over gameplay changes, this was a very fun game with plenty of exploration but still linear enough to find your way and move the story.\nThe writing is pretty good and the voice acting is above average; it's refreshing to hear a realistic British accent even if she does say 'elevator'.\n\nThe game can be a bit heavy-handed with the QTEs, particularly at the beginning, but hours of playing around and exploring is enough to drown that out.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: the death animations. God, this game has a lot of death animations. No simple ragdolling for Lara Croft. Enjoy watching a few particular ones again and again as you fail to get past the damn quick QTEs.\n\nNonetheless, this is a very polished game with only a couple of bugs (worst was when I did a combat roll and slipped through a rock into the void).\n\nI heartily recommend this game.","January 19, 2015","true","36.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.\n\nYou will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.\n\nWeapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.\n\nThis game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)\n\nMy only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpoints\n\nfor DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend\nTomb of the Lost Adventurer\nAgility Skill\nPistol Burst\nPistol Silencer\nAnimal Instinct\nHeadshot Reticule\n\nall these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price.","June 23, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corwinn/recommended/203160/","Corwinn","CorwiN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corwinn/","1130 products in account","While I quite enjoyed Tomb Raider for what it was worth, it should be mentioned that a better title might have been "Tomb Raider: A Gears of War Adventure," or perhaps "I CAN DO THIS - The Game." The trademark 3D platforming is instead mostly replaced with running unfailable exploding/deteriorating bridges/castles/cliffs and the occasional "OMG DODGING STUFF WHILE SLIDING DOWN SOMETHING/GETTING CARRIED AWAY IN A RIVER" simulator. So if you wanted 3D platforming, you'll have to either find something else ot make do with the handful of puzzle-based platforming optional tombs.\n\nThe story is neither bad nor good. A handful of moments stand out as good, and other inexplicable writing decisions, such as the young Lara Croft choosing to raid tombs for loot in the middle of deadly-horror-vacation, should leave pretty much anyone scratching his or her head. And why she'd do all of that and then each time take a single gold coin that looks exactly like all of the rest every. single. time... But that's just nitpicking.\n\nThe "I CAN DO THIS" moments get a bit annoying about three-fourths of the way through, but I can accept that in exchange for the characters being written in a way that I semi-cared about them, even if they are just stock characters. At least the game doesn't try to make you or expect you to be sad when something bad happens to any of the characters -- either you will or you wont, but the game doesn't try to make a hard sale about it.\n\nI also think it's worth pointing out how weird the quicktime events where Lara defends herself from male attackers are. I know there was a big blowup about some of this around E3 2012, but the thing I personally find strange is that all of the attacks appear highly sexualized while they're occuring, appearing to be leading toward some kind of assault -- but if the player fails, it turns out to actually be some kind of gambit to slit Lara's throat or something. I find something to be really off-putting about the strange difference between what's happening when you press the right button and what's happening when you don't.\n\nI know some people hated on the graphics in this game, but I thought they were quite good. It ran well on the GTX 670 I had at the time. Lara looks quite good, but without trying to sound too prurient, I have a little bit of a problem with the way her butt looks while she's stealth-crouching. Normally Lara's character model looks quite soft, but when she crouches it makes her thighs and buns look a bit blocky and hard. I know it's nitpicking, but for some reason it always drew my attention and annoyed me. And I say this as someone who isn't some kind of creeper who can't take his eyes off of female video game characters while he's gaming.\n\nAll things considered, it's a fun popcorn kind of game. If taken as harmless pleasure rather than hardcore gaming it can be quite enjoyable.\n\nRecommended to people who haven't ever played a Tomb Raider game, or people who didn't really enjoy previous entries that much.","November 30, 2013","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absolutely the best thing I've played this year, no question in my mind. The scenery is consistently beautiful. The combat is fun, and the cover system is the most natural I've ever encountered. The story is gripping, and even the fantastical elements work for me. There are some large open areas to explore, and there is plenty of collectible hunting, but it was hard for me to do much of it since I kept wanting to go to the next mission. I wanted to know what happened next so much that it cut into my usual collectible mania.\n\nYou can tell the designers were aiming for the game-that-feels-like-a-movie, and I think they hit it straight on the head. There are a ton of set pieces, there are some QTEs, and you do lose control of the camera semi-frequently, but none of those things bother me. The QTEs taper off rapidly after the first half-hour, and they don't even really bother me to begin with, and the camera being taken away from you feels slightly condescending, but what they're showing me is so cool or beautiful that I just can't make myself care.\n\nSeriously, I beat this game, and then immediately played through the whole damn thing again, that's how much fun I had.","March 20, 2013","true","58.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This game is very good and completely exceeded my expectations. The QTE's aren't that bad and are fairly easy to hit at the correct times. This, I was afraid of after hearing about it when the game first came out. However, they don't throw you off and aren't all that common compared the vastness of the game itself.\n\nThis game simply reminds me of the old Tomb Raider games, the story makes sense but doesn't at the same time because it's just so bizzare. The story was very good and Crystal Dynamics did a good job at keeping it similar to the old games which is a much better turn compared to their silly top down titles. The puzzles are there even though there aren't many and they are quite easy in comparison to the older titles, they are still fun none the less.\n\nThe collectibles make you want to go back and play the game and I will be doing so as to try and 100% the story. The one problem I face though is that I won't be able to get all the achievements. The reason behind this is that there are multiplayer achievements and unsurprisingly, it's dead. You can go back into the world after completing the story on your save so there's no need to worry about that.\n\nThe graphics are stunning for a game from 2013, the hair physics thing is a bit gimmicky but it works and it's cool. On my 970 it runs flawlessly on the "Ultimate" graphics mode and there shouldn't be much problem running it on a cheaper card with lower graphics settings, I'm sure the game will look superb even on "Low." The game controls flawlessly and the control scheme is very good, I did play with an Xbox 360 controller and I recommend using one as it's easier with the 360 degrees rotation on the sticks. Playing with a keyboard and mouse should be easy enough though if you get used to it.\n\nAll in all this game is a must have to a person who enjoys puzzles, story based games, adventure and collectables as they are all in this tightly nit package of a game. The only problem is the multiplayer achievements which can easily be fixed with some workaround.\n\nOverall this game gets an 8/10 for the graphics, story and nostalgia from past Tomb Raider titles.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game!","December 30, 2015","true","13.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If there is no game after these searches then all lobbies are currently full.\nSome Single-player DLC works in Multiplayer too while others gives strange benefits. (none of those benefits can help you win)\nSadly there are sometimes cheaters. Fortunately not so often.\n\n\n\n(Bulgarian review below)\n\nTomb Raider се препоръчва от мен.\nКратко лично мнение: (предимно за Multiplayer)\n\n*Single-player*\n-Историята е невероятно\n-Героинята е красиво изработена\n-Страхотен геймплей\n-Графиките са много добри (дори на нормално качество)\n\n*Multiplayer*\n-Прилича на FPS стил игри, но в 3-то лице (8 играчи макс 4 в отбор)\n-Приятен геймплей\n-Четири режима на игра\n-Чат системата не е добра, но поне я има\n-Може да искате да заглушите микрофона си, преди да започнете игра\n-Винаги има най-малко една започната игра\n-Практиката прави съвършенството\n\nДопълнително към Multiplayer игра:\nСамо Casual мачове се играят, така че ако искате да направите Ranked ачивменти може да  потърсите за хора в TR групи или да попитате в чата на играта.\nВсе още има много добри играчи които играят. Така че може да се намери предизвикателство.\nАко не можете да намерите игра с ''Quick Match'' бутона опитайте да проверите всички четири режима един по един. Ако няма игра след тези търсения тогава всички лобита са заети за момента.\nНякой Single-player DLC работят и в Multiplayer, докато други ви дават странни умения. (нито един от DLC уменията не може да ви помогне да спечелите)\nЗа съжаление понякога има чийтъри.

In the 4th one i got stuck at some puzzle where you had to move round really large chess pieces in a particular order and i could never figure out how to position them to open the right gate.\n\nThey fixed all the issues the old games had with the jumping, and now it gives you room if you mess up a jump slightly you will still grab onto the ledge and not fall to your death over and over. They also fixed the labyrinthine puzzles by  eliminating them altogether,\n\nThat's kinda the joke actually, all the tombs you can raid in this are both optional, tiny and simple as f*ck, too simple maybe. If you were into Tomb Raider for the puzzles i could see you not liking this game too much.\n\nI thought this game struck the right balance between gunplay and exploration, which a lot of game don't get right, but the gunplay and the bow and arrow play? are really satisfying to use on people, you can even use the bow later on once you get the rope upgrade for it to pull enemies off a cliff edge and watch them fall to their deaths.\n\nLara Croft also seems approachable in this, and has a personality of a real person, i'm not sure how much they changed of her story in this reboot, you don't really know if she is still rich and has a mansion. The only thing they messed up is her character arc of becoming a "survivor" replace survivor with killer, it's way more apt. Once she kills the first guy Lara becomes Jane Rambo, there's even achievements for killing 70 people with the assault rifle and 40 people with the shotgun, that aint surviving that's a f*cking massacre son! i'm not complaining about the action, i enjoyed killing all those people, but there's a real disconnect between the story and the gameplay.\n\nAnyway play this game if you haven't already, even if you were never a fan of Tomb Raider.","December 7, 2015","true","15.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played nearly 50 hours, but I did not complete it because the dark nature of the game finally got to me.  There are a lot of people who will think of this game as simple fun, and if you are into zombies or horror movies and that kind of stuff, you probably will not have any problem with this game.  I am writing this review as a warning to others who are a little more sensitive.  Lara finds herself in a truly nightmarish situation.  It starts that way and continues that way for as long as I have played it.  I don't think that is any great spoiler for those who really want to play it.  But there may be those have heard about what a great game it is, but are really not into "horror stuff."  If that is you, then don't waste your money on this game.  If that kind of stuff really doesn't bother you, there really is a lot to like about this game.

Lara wakes up on the island and someone kidnapps her. In this adventure, Lara will need to discover the paranormal secrets of the island. And now pro's and con's:\n\nPros:\n1. Good voice acting. I loved the voices of the characters, that's all.\n2. VERY well detailed textures / details. The devs did a really good work with all the little details, Example: when you jump in water (as Lara) some of the mud on her disapears wich is reallistic.\n3.

Awesome. Nothing else to say." - Review on the 8th May 2013\n\nComing back to this revew almost 2 years later as I have recently started playing again. I had no desire of going back to the single player story mode again as, like many players, the boredom of trying to get 100% without looking at guides and webpages, proved to much for me to handle. Instead I went to the multiplayer. Now I don't understand how the mulitplayer gets bad reviews. I like it, I think its great. It's simple yet diverse at the same time with hidden tricks and qualities that are revealed as you level up. Yes the system and servers are terrible, with the game glitching, freezing and kicking people out of matches, but that's Steams fault, not TR's. Anyway sometimes the glitches are funny - who doesn't laugh at Lara's manic, high-speed movements as she gets stuck between a rock :'D. I love the single player, but it gets old and in multiplayer mode there is always something different...apart from the cheaters and hackers. There are SO many. Too many. This is what brings the multiplayer down for me. I don't understand why some players think it's acceptable to cheat. It ruins the fun for everyone. The problem is that they keep getting away with it. No one checks the servers anymore - they didn't really to begin with - so they don't get banned and they keep cheating. It's still not going to stop me playing though. And nor will it affect the good TR players from playing; crizzl, nekov4ego, King-T to name a few. Nothing is better than laughing at a cheaters rage as you continually beat them - Mothra, PETIT LION, juliennatacha - all of them beat, over and over again. It makes my day!\n\nOverall I give Tomb Raider 4.5 stars as nothing deserves 5 stars - maybe Rise of the Tomb Raider when it comes out on PC. Seriously Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix, why make it exculusive to X-box One when the majority of the players are PC users? It doesn't make sense. I hope that they include a multiplayer feature on that game - one that hasn't been put together at the last minute! :D","May 5, 2013","true","516.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

The TONE is the biggest issue of the game, early on you think ok im in for a grizzly bleak survival game, and to me that sounds awesome ! but there is just something about how the cutscenses and character development play out, it just dosent give you a sense of anything, you just watch the cutscene and go ok time to fight, and the animations on certain people in certain cutscenes just dont look right they have a weird immature slaptstick feel to them its hardly hard to explain but i think some people might understand.\n\nYou get injured early on ( Heavily ) but after the next 5 minute set piece you just forget about the wound, but not long after you recieve a minor wound, that you bandage and take care of pretty sharpish...? confusing right. Your on some freezing cold island scaling mountains and climbing colossal radio towers in nothing but a vest ( its snowing ) but when you sit next to a fire at the start of the game Lara is shivering everywhere and you can see the breath coming out of her mouth. Such a shame that it is so inconsistent :(\n\nIt sounds like im hating on the game but i did like it the only thing i thought was actually done really well was the Platforming / Exploration, infact its probably the most fun i have had Exploring, but other games do it well and still have enjoyable combat and story when you dont have to worry about fighting some random bad guys you can just jump and climb around at your own free will and this is where the game is actually fun. i really enjoyed it - i actually think this game would have been better if there wasnt any enemies but was just a straight up Survival Game instead of action platformer.\n\nDefinately Play it and see what you think though, just dont expect a mind blowing story and great 3rd person combat im one of the very few people who just thought it was average, most people think its great but thats what encouarged me to do this review ! just thought a different oppinion can be quite interesting in these cases.\n\nIf i could some it up i would say that it feels very similar to the Uncharted franchise on Playstation but uncharted just does it better ! and has some good comedy which suits its theme/tone where as tomb raider is trying to be a bleak survival action adventure game but fails in a few ways ( no im not a PS fan boy, and yes i just mentioned PS on Steam :O )\n\nAnyway im dragging on a bit and you have probably stopped reading this review. While the game is good i wouldnt give it anymore than that, if your into your really dark, sinister survival stories ( The Road, Children Of Men, The Last Of Us, Metro 2033 ) then chances are you not going to be like "TOMB RAIDER OMG 10/10" while i get not all Survival games have to be like the games above i mentioned, you definately need a sense of "survival" and that normally comes with a sense of loss, and challenge but in Tomb Raider that fails to be apparent... which is a damn shame !","October 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

EVER. After some considerable convincing I snapped up this up and.... well, this here game has taken that previous opinion and evicted it from my cranium.

The TONE is the biggest issue of the game, early on you think ok im in for a grizzly bleak survival game, and to me that sounds awesome ! but there is just something about how the cutscenses and character development play out, it just dosent give you a sense of anything, you just watch the cutscene and go ok time to fight, and the animations on certain people in certain cutscenes just dont look right they have a weird immature slaptstick feel to them its hardly hard to explain but i think some people might understand.\n\nYou get injured early on ( Heavily ) but after the next 5 minute set piece you just forget about the wound, but not long after you recieve a minor wound, that you bandage and take care of pretty sharpish...? confusing right. Your on some freezing cold island scaling mountains and climbing colossal radio towers in nothing but a vest ( its snowing ) but when you sit next to a fire at the start of the game Lara is shivering everywhere and you can see the breath coming out of her mouth. Such a shame that it is so inconsistent :(\n\nIt sounds like im hating on the game but i did like it the only thing i thought was actually done really well was the Platforming / Exploration, infact its probably the most fun i have had Exploring, but other games do it well and still have enjoyable combat and story when you dont have to worry about fighting some random bad guys you can just jump and climb around at your own free will and this is where the game is actually fun. i really enjoyed it - i actually think this game would have been better if there wasnt any enemies but was just a straight up Survival Game instead of action platformer.\n\nDefinately Play it and see what you think though, just dont expect a mind blowing story and great 3rd person combat im one of the very few people who just thought it was average, most people think its great but thats what encouarged me to do this review ! just thought a different oppinion can be quite interesting in these cases.\n\nIf i could some it up i would say that it feels very similar to the Uncharted franchise on Playstation but uncharted just does it better ! and has some good comedy which suits its theme/tone where as tomb raider is trying to be a bleak survival action adventure game but fails in a few ways ( no im not a PS fan boy, and yes i just mentioned PS on Steam :O )\n\nAnyway im dragging on a bit and you have probably stopped reading this review. While the game is good i wouldnt give it anymore than that, if your into your really dark, sinister survival stories ( The Road, Children Of Men, The Last Of Us, Metro 2033 ) then chances are you not going to be like "TOMB RAIDER OMG 10/10" while i get not all Survival games have to be like the games above i mentioned, you definately need a sense of "survival" and that normally comes with a sense of loss, and challenge but in Tomb Raider that fails to be apparent... which is a damn shame !","October 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the individual...personally, I'm mostly in favour of the changes.  I'm certainly 100% for a grittier, darker, more brutally violent Lara Croft - think Tomb Raider meets "survival horror" by way of the last Rambo movie - but in all fairness, that's just me.  If criticisms were to be made, however, they would go something like this:\n\nFirst up...Quick-Time Events.  While these occasionally work in video games - the Walking Dead Telltale games, for instance - they by and largely are a pointless "innovation".  I understand the idea was probably to make what are essentially CUT SCENES into something more "immersive", but really...they're a PAIN, mostly.  In fact, I'm sure I'm far from the only gamer on the planet who believes that having to repeat such a moment, over and over again, is more liable to take you OUT of the game and therefore qualifies more as ANTI-immersion than anything...am I wrong?  For those people who find cut-scenes (i.e. story) excessively "boring", there's always the ESC key, and in the meantime the rest of us can enjoy a break from keyboard-mashing and sit back and enjoy a brief bit of cinematic storytelling.  This is a reasonably amicable compromise, is it not?  LESS OF THE QUICK-TIME EVENTS, PLEASE.  It's a tedious ♥♥♥♥ing way to die six times in a row, before you finally realise that the "F" button is the one right next to the "D"...cheers.\n\nWhat's next?  Oh, dearie me: Puzzles.  Another controversial subject.  I'll be as honest as possible here: As much respect as I have for the original Tomb Raider games, I actually find them too HARD.  I've only managed to complete the first one or two, as I recall...beyond that, I really couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed spending forty-five minutes searching about for that one elusive, cleverly-hidden ledge which I didn't even know I could get to until I tried (and, quite possibly, died).  So I'm mostly in favour of the dumbed-down puzzle-solving in this reboot, though I can understand why the old-school purists would have a complaint here.  Hell, even I found the "survival instinct" button, while a mostly nice idea, a little overgenerous on the whole; for those who haven't played, it's essentially "press the Q button and we'll show you PRECISELY WHAT TO DO NEXT".\n\n(There's a very amusing clip in the extras, I believe, of Indie Game: The Movie, where Phil Fish and cronies criticise the tendency of modern games to "hand-hold" players through each and every puzzle, 'cause after all, we're all ♥♥♥♥ing dumb-asses who couldn't figure our way out of a plastic bag, were we to find our heads stuck in one.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a dumb-♥♥♥ myself and don't mind the occasional HINT, but this "Q" button did make things just a tad TOO easy at times.  A compromise somewhere between the "older" and "newer" gaming styles may have hit a sweeter spot for me, but then again...that's just me.)\n\nI could also mention that some of the AI and combat mechanics are a tad dodgy or awkward at times, but for the most part these things are fine.  The up-skilling and "crafting" systems also leave a little to be desired - there's a bunch of skills relating to the "hunting" of animals, for instance, in spite of the fact that after your first such kill the needless butchery of wildlife appears to be nothing more than a quick XP grab, rather than a storytelling necessity - but again, for the most part, these gameplay aspects are handled at least adequately.  As long as you're not buying it expecting a full-blooded "survival" game - it's an action-adventure game, first and foremost - you're unlikely to have any major complaints herein.\n\nAnyhoo, if you've stuck with this review this long, you probably: A. Deserve a ♥♥♥♥ing medal of some description, and B. Are getting the overall impression that enjoyment of this game is largely dependent upon your own personal preferences towards, and indeed PHILOSOPHIES ABOUT (!)...video games.  The developers of this particular product most certainly HAVE NOT gone out of their way to please the "old-school" Tomb Raider fans.  In fact, it's more of a firm "♥♥♥♥ you" that's been thrown in their direction, and what we essentially have now is a slam-bang, ultra-brutal, highly cinematic action-adventure game with minor elements of puzzle-solving.\n\nPersonally, I dug it...A LOT.  Not without reservations, but...A LOT.  But then again, the main thing I look for when I play a game is usually ATMOSPHERE, and this game certainly has that in spades.  It's undeniably more aimed at the ultra-modern, casual-gaming-with-light-RPG-elements crowd, and I'm sure that's heart-breaking for all the old-schoolers out there, but...we all have to move on with the times a little...right?  Even me.  As a matter of fact, to make it easier on all the bemused, borderline-illiterate young'uns out there, I'll offer two completely opposed, but importantly MUCH SHORTER and more conventional reviewing opinions, which can go something like this:\n\n"Fukn TOPZ game.  U shoot lotz of thingz, and Lara haz BIG TITZ.  AWSUM."\n\nor:\n\n"Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.  Almost none of the challenging platform or puzzle-solving elements of past Tomb Raider games.  Totally dumbed-down for idiotic modern gaming audiences.  The only consolation...is that Lara STILL HAS BIG BAZOOKOIDS."\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","November 27, 2014","true","18.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is enjoyable, not tough (playthrough on hard) and very linear if played by the game's rules. The story takes place on an island known as Yamatai and features the queen Himiko. These two topics are Chinese and Japanese legends (Yamatai location even being discussed and argued about within Historians), and the writers of Tomb Raider (2013) had run with it and created a TR game just based off of the names.\n\nThe gameplay itself is moderately simple as I had stated above only if you play by the game's rules. There are a lot of minor time savers (roll jump cancel and out of bounds), but those would be for speedrunning the game. If I could compare this game to something else I would say it is very similar to Last of Us. You can switch between 4 weapons, customize and upgrade them. You are also given the options to buy skills with skillpoints you earn which give you better combat options, survivability and exp gaining. The game can be played in a guns blazing style or a more stealthy approach. Depending on situation one may be more favorable than the other.\n\nI think what really stuck out to me were the characters themselves. You can really feel the transformation that Lara goes through from when you first start controlling her to how she's almost a different person by the end. Each character that you meet is defined well and you will have love-hate relations which each one.\n\nOverall it is definitely worth a playthrough as it is a very stress free game and has a good story.","October 14, 2015","true","11.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This was suppose to be a review in progress. So far I have been taking this game like you'd handle a friend who's trying to fake it big to you while keeping a straight face but and you are like.. cool story bro.\n\nHowever, there are some good things to it:\n+ The graphics are pretty sweet if you overlook all the wrinkles on Lara's face in some cutscenes. they  make her look like a 60 year old granny without her yellow bird named tweety.\n\n+ The puzzles aren't as tough as they use to be. i have played only 2 games before from this franchise. Some people who like a challenge would probably frown upon me adding this to a plus but i feel its a good thing since they never did add any depth to the story. they were present just to increase the longevity of the game.\n\n+ adding a multiplayer mode. it is interesting but its pretty dead since nobody really plays it anymore.\n\n+ listening Lara fall off a cliff/die. Gosh, that makes me smile, just thinking about it. ( yep at times i hate guiding her like her damn mother. Witch, never learns )\n\nMinussesses:\n- the controls are dodgy.\nthey aren't accurate. In most cases when you try to move, she ends up moving a step further which might lead to death or getting stuck in a spot when you should run to save your ♥♥♥.\n\n-  The dialogues and their delivery.\nthey are so badly written. it does makes a difference when you are playing a story driven game. there is this one scene about 35 minutes into the game where Lara manages to find 2 of her friends after their ship crashes and some team mates get scattered. the dialogues between the characters is so bad that it makes you feel as if nothing had happened and these people are reconnecting after a walk in the park.\n\n-  There is not much to do but reach your destination and shoot stuff on the way. you have like 4-5 guns throughout the campaign and you are able to increase their stats but that's it.  Skill system isn't the greatest either. It is there just for the sake of it being there.\n\n-  Q-T-E's\nyep. the illusion of control. numerous times.\n\nits true that i haven't completed this game yet (played 5 hours). i keep procrastinating because it isn't really interesting or anything new. it becomes just so frustrating when something quite anticipated happens but your character is completely aloof. snatches the fun out of any good game for me.\n\nAs you can see i don't have a lot of good things to say about this game but it sure is fun to laugh at. It isn't everyone's niche. Don't bother buying it if this franchise use to P-O you for some reason(s). i'm pretty sure those reasons still are valid. and to others i say buy it on sale. it certainly isn't not worth spending $20 on.","May 2, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","4","5","5","0"

While the gameplay itself is not innovative in many ways, nor is the game very difficult.  It's the way that the overall package is put together that makes this game great.  You continuously upgrade your weapons/tools in order to reach places you couldn't reach before.  The island is a beautiful island to play in and Lara Croft moves fluidly through the environments making it look good when she performs her acrobatic moves.  The pacing of the game is just right, action, explore, platform, and then start again.  The exploring part is mostly exploring for collectibles, the rest is pretty linear like a natural floral hallway directing you to the next scene.\n\nI understand why others wouldn't like this sense of clostrophobic environment for a Tomb Raider game, but it allows for a smooth flowing story with very scriped scenes that make for a smooth flowing game of story/action/etc...  I obtained a 100% completion and it took me about 20 hours to accomplish.  Great game, great graphics, great action, great platform all wrapped up together it makes for a must play game of 2013.","January 12, 2014","true","23.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome.\n\nThe upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places!\n\nThe combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain.\n\nThe climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough.\n\nI really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving!","January 19, 2014","true","19.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Chronicles Demo on PC. So i'm pretty much unbiased when it comes to Tomb Raider series. Since most people nowadays totally ignore the legacy where certain game comes from, closest notable (in my opinion) is XCOM. The Firaxis  remake and the, eas it 3rd-person shooter.. Which i heard was.. MEH at best. But i'm getting sidetracked.\n\nTomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft on her first expedition to seek an mythical tomb of an ancient Empress. And i cannot say anything more about the plot because i try to avoid spoilers.\n\nOn the subject of storyline, i finished it in 10 hours if Steams playtime-meter is to be trusted. And this was with SOME faffing around some of the optional tombs an collectables. I finished the game at 77% Completion and that in 10 hours, might show some padding towards its length. However since i can somewhat give the optional time wasting on EXP-Grindings part, i think if you just blast the main storyline i'm sure it can be done under 7 hours. And since the story is (what i can see) about Laras development into the iconic heroine as portrayed in the original series.. So blasting through the story, might cause you to ignore the character development and other fine details altogether. The story was.. Okay. And i really cannot explain it that well, this is like trying to explain the storyline of any of the movies to someone. So with that excuse i shall escape stage left...\n\nInto the second part, which is the gameplay.\n\nStandard 3rd-person affair. Jump, climb but no crouch for some reason, unless you are in a fight situations. Which i will get to in a bit.. Basically, the gameplay consist of running around the area, climbing on those certainly obvious ledges and wall-kick jumps. But the heavier part of this is the combat, of dear...\n\nCombat, like in the previous paragraf. is the standard 3rd-person action affair. Taking cover in some conviniently placed chest-high walls and stuff.... Although the game somewhat tries to urge you to do it stealthily, which i did not succeed, even with intense trying. Since it kinda looks like that stealth is viable to a certain point and then you are forced to pull out the big guns and pulverize some fools. And speaking of weapons, the bow... I noticed that it might be possible to pass the game with just the bow, i'm pretty sure it can be done. Since the enemies suffer from the same "I'm sure in perfect cover right now"-Syndrome which caused the halfwits to position that way that their head is visible. And they give enough time for you to aim and fire the bow. Some of the enemies rush you, which when you get the counter-maneuver can be gotten rid of with a matter of seconds.. But lets get rid of the tangent before i say something offensive...\n\nVisuals and music are.. somewhat forgettable. I cannot at the time of writing, about 15-minute after competing the game. Remember any part of the soundtrack. Other that the pounding music during combat...\n\nVisually, the game is also semi forgettable. Although you would think, that a semi-tropical (or atlest in the Tropical climate-zone) Would have some vibrant greens and lots of foliage.. Instead you are treated so somewhat bland sortie of bleak forests , broken down bunkers, decaying villages and other equally imaginative areas. I might sound a bit biased, but that is because i have been playing FarCry 3 recently.  And after playing other bleak visual games i just get easily turned off.\n\nOtherwise, passing some of my pet-peeves. I feel that the game is good. Even if i'm turning a bit naggy with it.\n\nThe strongest part of the game, is the storyline. And nothing much else, everything else feels... Hmmh.. I think the only way i can portray my thoughts is, to say that everything else feels unnecessary. Not really contributing in any way, like i said, i felt as the games length was padded. And like i also said, everything else pretty much only serves EXP-Grinding and nothing much else. But can that be an excuse ? Not really, and can the soryline carry the game ? Yyyyyyes ? I think. Although thinking about the story just made me remember some of the the obvious plot twists...\n\nARRRR... Me brain!\n\nAnyway.. Tomb Raider is a reasonable story experience, even with some of the minor quirks it has. Although some friends of the original series might find this SECOND reboot, (Yes i DOUBLE checked that if i was correct.) A bit more in tune with the originals and also making some newer generation compromises a bit... Meh.\n\nTrust me, there is a treasure at the end of this Tomb, this, renmant of the gaming culture wrapped around is a see-trough vale of next generation graphics.\n\nTomb Raider get a rather reasonable: B, as in BUM.","April 5, 2014","true","11.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Crystal Dynamics did it again only this time with a Reboot to one of gamings most popular characters. unlike older installments of the game that focused more on puzzles and less on action this one is the exact opposite. yeah you'll get puzzles but this time around their in the for of QTEs (or Quick Time Events).  i cannot recommend this game enough having beaten it twice on console and once on PC. if you get it get it for the story. it is the best origins story ive played in a long time. yes it has multiplayer but it feels like a tacked on after thought and in my mind is not all that fun or enjoyable. this is one game i will be playing through again for a long time to come. story is one of the best the TR franchise has had in a long time. the combat is slow at times but it never felt like it was getting old or stale. the voice acting is some of the best i've heard in a long time. you can definately tell Crystal Dynamics took their time on the game. during my time on it i felt her fears and pain as if they were my own. and i have never felt that way over a main character before now. this is one game where you want to urge her to continue on and to push forward. again i cannot recommend it enough. that's why i am giving this  a 10/10.","January 3, 2015","true","46.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However, I think that's the only real highlight of this game. I'm a fan of linear singleplayer games, like Half-Life, Wolfenstein the New Order, and Max Payne, but the reason I didn't like this game that much is because it felt like the game was holding my hand through the entire experience. There really isn't much interactivity, and there are way too many quick time events. I liked the stealth parts of the game, but the combat just isn't very good; the weapons don't handle very well. It feels like they tried mashing realistic weapon combat with a video game style, and it just doesn't work. I don't recommend this game at full price, but pick it up on sale.

The gameplay is a mix of classic Tomb Raider exploration (in the best possible way) and more modern and intimate combat systems. The visuals are frequently incredible and certainly underrated.  Strong voice acting drives a great story that will have you transfixed up to (and past) the game's final cresendo. 10/10 from this reveiwer - I couldn't imagine it being better.\n\nAs an added bonus - the multiplayer is actually very fun and has a small but dedicated community.

To give some back story, I grew up on the old Tomb Raiders, followed through Underworld, and adored them all.  When I heard the series was being rebooted, and we'd be visiting Lara Croft's origins, I immediately dismissed it.  And I won't lie, when I heard negative things about the game, I was happy to hear that my choice was "on the right."  Fast forward to five days ago when I stumbled upon a video including this game, and my interest was piqued.  Now at the wonderful price of $20, and on a recommendation of a friend, I decided to give this "terrible game" (words I had previously used) a shot.  I was horribly, horribly wrong; and ignorance is no excuse.  The game is incredible, the setting, the atmosphere, the entire plot.  "Reboot" typically involves negative connotations, the largest of which typically means sucking out the soul of what had made the original series great; because in order to get to the point of rebooting, the developers typically have to have lost their way.  But, this is not the case here.  Though modernized, and starting with a new story, this game sticks with great platforming, amazing set pieces, collectibles, and a wonderful historical/supernatural story.  All the elements that had made the original great.  All that has been changed here is how it is presented.  With a modern open world island, that has details that are off the charts.\n\nI've finished the story now, but I can tell you I will be diving back in promptly to find all the collectibles and details I missed.  I was wrong:  A reboot can be for the better, and have a positive effect.  I hope any others who thought as I once did listen, and give this game a proper chance.  I don't regret it in the slightest, and hopefully neither will you.  And now, after having despised this game when it came out, I look forward to it's sequel with bated breath.  Because if they can put as much effort into the next one, this series has got a hell of a future.","April 27, 2014","true","44.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

While exploring Lara's origins and letting us see how she became the intrepid adventurer she is known for was a fun ride it falls just short of being a Tomb Raider game. I think the kill-cam execution upgrades are something that was not needed, they really didn't add anything to the game, other then an incentive to get out of cover (again Uncharted) and put an enemy down for more XP. I would have liked more of the tomb puzzles to do and more exploration. Overall I would say if you like action and adventure games you will probably find enjoyment in the game as long as you go into understanding that this reimagining is more in-line with Uncharted and its cover based shooting then the Tomb Raiders of old. You might find even more enjoyment if you get the game on sale.","January 16, 2014","true","19.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

Graphically, you can rarely fault this game. It offers a massive variety of environments, from deep dark caves to beautifully sun bathed landscapes, and captures the idea of being stranded on an island perfectly. The vast mountains and asian inspired scenary is almost flawless. However, is it a different story when it comes to gameplay?\n\nTo start off, this game offers a lot of things in bucket-loads. The first is combat. The combat feels fluid and the guns give some meaty kick which is nice compared to other third person shooters which can sometimes be lacking. There are also a wide variety of weapons, which in turns means that different situations can be dealt with in many different ways. The upgrades system can also provide some variety to combat, offering different attachments for weapons which can be obtained in order to suit your needs as a player, such as the silencer you can get for the tactical pistol, which can be a life saver in situations in which a quick silent ranged kill is in order, since the bow takes some time to get to maximum accuracy.\n\nThe second is exploration and discovery. I feel like this part can be linked back to the fact that the graphical fidelity of this game is mind blowing, because exploring different areas of the map and seeing new things generally feels very rewarding, although in actual fact, you're often not rewarded at all. Platforming feels responsive and accurate, as well as genuinely satisfying.\n\nThe third is the stealth element of the game. In the periods of time in which stealth can be used, it is effective and satisying. This is largely due to the absolutely brilliant minimalistic UI. It aids in immersion tenfold, rather brilliantly.\n\nHowever, this game does lack when it comes to key elements of the game. It is up to you whether you think these will bring down the enjoyment of the game to you. Tomb Raider, in it's legacy, has always been about platforming and exploring. Unfortunately, large parts of this game are dedicated to combat sequences which are both much too long and much too repetitive. Although there is a large array of weapons, it is often the case that enemies are just far too bullet spongey, and take far too many shots with any weapon in order to go down. This gets especially annoying when it comes to long combat sequences which cannot be avoided with stealth and are entirely scripted, as that offers even less variance.\n\nLinearity is also a problem in this game, as well as the scripted nature of some sequences in the game. I felt like I was being pushed down a road that I didn't particularly always want to follow, which not only ruined some areas of the game but also broke immersion. For instance, there is a scene around 35% of the way through the game in which there is a shooter hiding behind a shielded gun. In order to take this shooter down, you have to manoeuvre your way through the garden to a rope. However, I saw various times when I could get a good shot with weapons, but it was just scripted to not allow that paricular outcome.\n\nAnother problem is the storyline. It's not anything special, nothing we haven't heard of or seen before. And characters, while initially interesting, are somewhat shallow and superficial, and often don't play any role other than to cause problems for Lara and generally extending the length of the game where it is not necessary. I will however give props to the fact that the period of time when Lara is alone and cannot find her crew, her character, through the emotions she displays, is really tested, and I feel like it was honestly one of the better 'character gets stranded on an island and has to find safety and a way home' kind of situations since Lara has to deal with the fact that she is alone. Desperation really hits home, and her emotions were so well presented that you genuinely feel pity for Lara and her situation, and you really want it to all be okay. I also have to give props to the sound department and the voice actor too, both having done amazing work with the various emotions from anger to sadness and desperation.\n\nThis honestly feels like the type of game in which after completion, you may be able to hop into and just admire for it's beauty. It has faults, of course, but smooth gameplay and beautiful scenary create a masterpiece of video gaming. Lara starts off as a panicked hopeless character but as progression continues, she turns into a feared ruthless killer willing to do anything and go to any lengths to save herself and her crew, even if it means doing so alone.","December 5, 2013","true","15.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Great opening sequence minus the RTE's that is.  The bow is very fun to hunt with.  I love the upgrading system and having to find the treasure's.  My biggest complaint is however the camera bob in game and in cutscenes.  This issue limits my play time with this game though.  I start to get motion sickness only about after 30 mins of play time.  The last time I played I had to look away from a cutscene as I felt the strong urge to spew all over my keyboard.  I should mention that only 1 game in my 31 years of my life has ever made me feel sick before, and that was Halo on original x-box.  Only difference it took very long sessions to make me start to feel sick.  It's a fun game but with said problem for me in this game I don't see myself beating it anytime soon considering I can only play short intervals at a time.

AWESOME!\n\nPlaying this reminded me of why I have stayed with this series since the beginning.  The story was perfect! It's an origin story like the details above say. You really do get the feel of her starting out as a vulnerable, self doubter and by the end you see her as the confident, no fear character you know her to be from all the other games.\n\nThe game visually has a lot of darkness to it, in lighting and atmosphere.  It's the grittiest Tomb Raider I've ever played.  Without spoiling anything there is a reason you learn later on in the game why the environments are so dreary in parts.\n\nI've always been a fan of the series, but there is always one part in every one of the games that a timed sequence has driven me nuts.  Luckily there are some challenging timed sequences in this, however they pretty much perfected the checkpoint saves at all the right intervals! In other words if you die, you don't have to repeat a whole bunch of stuff all over again.. it's just a tiny bit.  Which is great for short of patience type people like myself, you won't lose your mind.\n\nThere are some stuff I did have to look up since I wasn't sure how to get where, thanks to Stella's walkthrough site she saves the day!\n\nA really great thing is the inventory, menu system.  Spending skill pts is a breeze, and earning them as well.  The map tracking is so helpful!!! I'm so glad they have this map tracking, because without spoiling it too much.. if you are looking for a specific collectable you can track it in blue, then use this special vision mode that makes it light up like a beacon.  This feature saves you from a massive headache of wandering aimlessly around trying to get all the collectibles!\n\nSay you forgot some collectibles in one camp.. NO problem they have a real handy fast tracking back and forth between camps.  Say you finish the whole game and still didn't find all the collectibles... NO problem at the end of the game you are given the choice to continue if you want to find them all, or just wander around and explore.\n\nI think the Devs really put a lot of thought and care into this game.  I really enjoyed it.\n\n**The only negatives that I remember are:\nSometimes the voice actors would call her Laura one minute then Lara the next... first time I heard this error in this entire series.\nOne other thing the camera angles in 1 or 2 of the timed sequence was a bit off which usually got me killed, however thankfully the improved checkpoint save intervals it wasn't that big of a deal to repeat.\nThe game didn't like it too much if I was alt tabbing to much.  I could get away with a couple of times but I'd eventually crash it. Most games are like this though...","December 27, 2013","true","29.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The controls go funny when most needed, suddenly, when you need to be the quickest and walk and jump and kill and hold, the mouse as a point of view device goes woobly, Lara moves erratically and you are lost figuring out which of the keys are the right ones, 'is it A, not wait, that's the wrong direction, maybe D, ok, walk..what? S now moves forward?\n\nAnother thing is the fact that sometimes Lara can fall from 3 stories, flat on her side and just get up, other times, a shorter fall, much, much shorter, kills her, or maims her so she limps around. The gimmicks get old (sliding on dirt or on water, same stupid trick of avoiding spikes)\n\nAlso, too many people die with a long melodramatic 'noooooo' it is as if Lara can be a real amazon in combat, and yet become a nuisance of tears  in less demanding situations.  She will moan and moan to no avail only meters away from an enemy and they wont even notice.\n\nIn some instances, during the cinematics, someone with Lara will be shot, ambushed or captured, yet the position of Lara was such before the cinematics that she would have been able to just lift up her gun and shoot the assailant, but in these instances she becomes frozen moans a bit more and them succumbs to whomever...\n\nReally, what could have been a very good game ended up being a movie with some interactive activities in between scenes.  Good to pass the time, but infuritating and well, annoying in my view.","June 30, 2014","false","22.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/203160/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","My immediate reaction in the first few hours of Tomb Raider was that I was playing Far Cry 3 again, which isn't a bad thing because Far Cry 3 did a lot of things right. But as the game progressed it became clear that Tomb Raider was not a mere carbon copy offering a more linear story, a much more subtle RPG framework, and trademark gameplay elements from the early Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia games.\n\nThe evolutionary story of Lara Croft is without a doubt the highlight of the game and is superbly presented, however it's hard not to give praise to the amazing graphics as well showcasing some incredible shadows, lighting, and fire effects. I seriously could not stop playing this game once I started, taking only 2 days to complete my 15 hour campaign--it was just that good.\n\nSome of the less stellar aspects of the game include the RPG skills. While they were helpful in moving the evolution of Lara Croft along, they really didn't feel all that unique or useful and in many cases I was forced to spend points on useless skills simply to unlock the next tier. The weapons, other than the bow, were lackluster and the upgrades just felt common. I also don't like interactive cutscenes in video games, and while this latest Tomb Raider hasn't changed my position, this is the best implementation I have seen so far.\n\nOverall, Tomb Raider turned out to be a highly enjoyable adventure giving a much need reboot to this franchise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holodoc_prime/recommended/203160/","holodoc_prime","Holodoc Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holodoc_prime/","261 products in account","Violence and gore pays off. Crystal Dynamics seem to have learned that because Tomb Raider used to be a game that could be played by everyone, especially children. With the insane amount of blood, point blank execution finishers and explicit depictions of Lara's body parts being pierced and cut off by various environmental hazards this game is the first Tomb Raider that clearly deserves a "Mature" (18+) ESRB rating. Even with the acknowledgment that the game's sole purpose is to explain Lara's transformation from an innocent, young and inexperienced girl to someone who could actually pull a trigger on another human being there is no justification for turning her into a blood-thirsty killing machine. So, what should we expect in the game's sequel? Tactical nuclear strikes and kill streaks?\n\nThat being said Tomb Raider is a rather enjoyable game. The environments are simply amazing especially on higher graphics settings which have a tendency of making the player stop for a moment and simply enjoy the view. Its clearly visible that game designers spent a lot of time polishing small details which add up to the immersion factor. The audio component is sadly a mixed bag. While some of the voice actors did a really god job the extremely forced accent of Lara Croft (played by Camilla Luddington) is simply annoying. Compared to Judith Gibbins and Keeley Hawes, which voice-acted Croft before, Luddington simply sounds forced and unnatural. The soundtrack also leaves much to desire because compared to, lets say, masterpieces from the "Underworld" OST like "Thor's Room" or themes played during Thailand levels the new Tomb Raider soundtrack sounds simply bland and uninspiring clearly trying only to promote the new main theme. Controls feel okay but there are times when they are clearly too vivid and unpredictable resulting in a lot of unintentional deaths. Combined with the fact that Lara now does a lot of things by herself like crouching (there is no dedicated control for crouch) and reducing her speed when traversing stuff like narrow passages and tombs (there is no dedicated control for sprint)... Well it can be pretty annoying to say the least.\n\nNow we come to the most problematic stuff about the game - cinematics and QTE (quick time events). This game is choke full of both! There can hardly pass more than a minute or two in the game without being forced to watch a cinematic or bash the controls like crazy to finish a QTE. At one time I even managed to count FOUR successive cinematics which followed each other! QTEs are a tale for themselves. It really boggles my mind how could anyone ever come to the conclusion that they would be a good way of immersing players into the gameplay. Having a ton of split-second QTEs is probably not a problem on consoles where every button has a specific color so its easier to follow them but when you get less than a second to read stuff like "Press RMOUSE + LMOUSE repeatedly" on a PC then that's a real problem.\n\nThere is also something to be said about the very anti-climatic ending but venturing onto that ground would probably mean divulging a lot of spoilers so I'll just leave it be. Tomb Raider is a very good game which could have been a lot better if some of the mainstream gaming elements were left out. I just hope that for the inevitable sequel developers decide to tone down those elements and simply get more in touch with the spirit of the previous games by expanding on adventure and exploring. From me personally Tomb Raider gets an 8/10 with a note of letting a lot of things simply slide.","December 1, 2013","true","18.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

But for a good reason.\n\nThe grafic of this game looks beautiful. All the details that got put in the characters and particularly in the scene, it's just stunning. Then - the weapons. Through the game you can find four types of weapons and you can upgrade them with salvage wich you have to collect. The ammo isn't a problem, because you're finding on every corner Pistol ammo here, arrows there. A bit to much, for my taste.\nBut the game isn't bad ... Well, except for the story.\nI have to admit that i was a bit disappointed from the doings of the characters. A lot of was predictable but even worse - illogical. I don't want to get in there to much because not a lot of people share my opinion, but for me, as a Tomb Raider player since the first game, I expected a different development for the reboot.\n\nAnyways, this game doesn't just contain a singleplayer. There's a multiplayer, too.\nAnd this is one is a lot of fun. My first online game with other people and all I can say that I'm playing it until now. It makes just fun playing on different maps and in four different modes. You can choose your character from the ones out of the singleplayer and unlock weapon upgrades and more characters in time.\n\nFinal words: The singleplayer makes fun, the grafic looks amazing and with the weapon upgrades and different styles the combat is always varied. The story isn't anything new or special, but I think the producers just focused more on the look this time. Trough it isn't like the old ones (Legend, Anniversary, Underworld, I, II, ...) at all, more like a new third person shooter with some skill distribution.\nThe multiplayer is a really great aspect of the game, really enjoy it and still like to play it after that many hours.","January 27, 2014","true","018.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I had a lot of fun playing it from start to finish (minus the multiplayer) due to the breathtaking level design, good voice acting (Camilla Luddington), and overall high-intensity throughout the game.\n\nThis is an example of a game that you can't play half-awake.\n\nIt took me about 25 hours to complete the SP campaign (35+ if you count the MP). One major thing that I feel they did right in this game are the collectibles. It's interesting because they're not hard to find due to skill upgrades and treasure maps but they are actually fun to 'try and get' because of all the platforming involved. It's not enough to know which direction to go. Reaching the collectibles requires an understanding of the map's layout. It's actually very easy to get lost within the beautiful island if you are just prancing around without direction.\n\nAs far as the combat goes, I am split 50-50. The game gives you enough freedom with how you can kill your enemies and that allows for some good times. On the other hand, it seems that enemy detection is a bit screwy. As an example, there's an enemy mounted on a turret gun that can see you through walls and will follow you wherever you go even if you are hidden from sight.\n\nI feel that this 2013 version of Tomb Raider is my favorite one so far. Even for an origin story, this Lara Croft is quite different from her predecessor even when you try and imagine how one can become the other. I think that this game should be a starting point for a new series of Tomb Raider games. I do recommend this game to fans of the old games but even more so to those who have yet to play anything from the collection.","February 4, 2014","true","36.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","2"

Beautiful landscapes, good graphics. However the jumping puzzles are reduced to a minimum (optional for most) and you just chain corridors by jumping on the obvious next plateform. On the other side the shooting part has taken a cumbersome part. Very similar to Far Cry or Mass Effect shooting : you cover behind a wall and shoot at the waves of enemies with a variety of archetypical weapons. In difficult mode, some shooting phases can give a challenge, but this is absolutely not what's expected from a Tomb Raider game.\nThe Quick Time Events are sometimes breaking the immersion by displaying a series of keys to press, but often are a well-integrated phase of quick jumps as plateforms collapse.\nThe Tomb Raider franchise has some great titles where you try to find your way through plateforms and puzzles while from time to time enemies ambush you. This game is an easy third person shooter, a shooting gallery in a beautiful uneven landscape where you have to follow the white marks to progress. The collectibles and the achievements are just ridiculous ways to push you to play more with Pavlovian mechanics.\nFinally, when the very first game of the series introduced a Lara Croft who had never killed a human before, making it the exception, this Tomb Raider reboot makes Lara Croft a mass murderer with the Hollywood justification that the humans she kills are baddies who don't deserve to live.","December 4, 2013","false","17.4"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

Considering the back in the day graphics of Lara with the square / triangular body. On either Normal or Hard it still had a great edge to it. Even on Easy the combat is still something with computer controls I think is much more diffcult if you're used to your regular console controlling.\n\nThan fact that you can even pick how defined you want her hair to be does seem a little rediculous but it's all about the gameplay if you actually bough this game for the actual Tomb Raider feel everyone knows and loves. It's just new take on the series, stop whining and play the game like it was meant to be. Another note even when you're done with the game and you're on free roam it makes the game even more oddly gorgeous since there's not alot of enemies unless you just missed a few on the way up and around the levels. Which gives you so much free time to look around finish some challenges if you'd like and even level up all your weapons and if you wish. You can just start a new slot on a different diffcultiyy and redo the game and you'll know where EVERYTHING is. There's really not much anout this game that i say i DON'T like.\n\nThe only cons id' say thig game would have oddly, there's not alot of people in the multiplayer servers and in my experience if you're not a high level when you do find someone they act like they don't really want to be in the multiplayer map or game. Which is a massive letdown if you just wanna do the multiplayer for some acievenments rather than leveling up. And just a few simple things that were mentioned prior like choosing Lara's hair graphic seems unccessary.

Throughout the years I've whitnessed as Lara evolved with the times, sometimes for the better (Anniversary) and sometimes for the worse (Angel of Darkness).\n\nAt first, I was skeptical of this reboot of Tomb Raider, especially since she has already had such an extensive backstory explained throughout her adventures. For such a beloved character, I didn't want her legacy to end with a horrid reboot. Thankfully, I was wrong.\n\nThe story begins where Lara and the crew of the Endurance have shipwrecked on an island after a storm capsizes the ship. She then sets out to find the rest of the crew while uncovering the secrets of Yamatai. Soon she finds herself diving head-first into an exciting, and deadly, new life.\n\nFor starters, those of us who have grown with the franchise will instantly notice the new "leveling" system. By salvaging items, looting bodies, and executing specialty kills, you advance through a tier-type leveling system. This boosts Lara's weapons, combat, and skills so that she can kick-a☆☆ and take name. This is a welcome change since RPG players will enjoy the opportunity to select how/when Lara should learn a certain skil.\n\nWhile the environments are a bit more open-world, players are still directed through a linear gameplay, at least for the first time around. Fast travel enables you to jump from location to location, in search of treasures that are unlocked later on in the game through Lara's leveled tiers.\n\nWhat kindof dampened my spirits for this game is the lack of tombs. The game designers had added tombs as side quests (secrets), as a nod to the original franchise. To me, what made Lara who she was, and who she came to be, was largely due to her adventures and mishaps in tombs. Sure, part of the storyline touches the surface of caverns and lost civilizations. However for me I truly enjoy the history and wonder of lost cities and hidden treasures. Hopefully, they'll address this in Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nGone are the bottomless medipacs and ammo clips (same for the last few games), but in its place comes the upgrading of weapons, which adds a fun level of depth and originality to the Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nCo-Op players and achievement junkies will find themselves busy with the newest Tomb Raider installment. The Co-Op is recommended for players with friends who will be online, as nowadays there aren't many players up and running for those missions. This, in turn, affects those hunting for achievements as half of them comprise of Co-Op galavanting. However, to those that can find players, this is a fun welcome to the traditionally 1 player gaming.\n\nTo sum it up, as a fan of the original Tomb Raider series, I believe others in the same boat will appreciate this reboot as a game worthy of the icon that is Lara Croft. With the exception of a few new twists that brings its originality down (Lost, anyone?), a new Co-Op that feels mildly out of place, and lack of the "Tomb" in Tomb Raider, this reboot will keep the long-time-fans happy, captivated by the stoyline and graphics, and thrilled that a great reboot kickstarted what is sure to be another fantastic series.\n\nFor those that are beginning the Raiding experience, especially the newer generation, this is an excellent way to start and get to know the brilliant heroine that is Lara. To join in her adventures and experience a fantastic storyline, and become the bad-a☆☆ Tomb Raider you were born to be.","December 28, 2014","true","35.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's pretty brainless fun on the whole but you really feel it could have done with a closer eye on scale. It follows what I'm going to call the Batman template of a story taking place on one interconnected island which you can go back and walk around, with many, many collectibles scattered about should you be so interested, and a gradually unlocked series of equipment to explore more and more of the environment. It's almost two separate games, though. There's the railroad-straight main storyline, a mess of shooting, fleeing and quicktime, and the calm after the storm, where you potter about the map trying to find hidden vases.\n\nIt uses height really well. There's some vertigo-inducing sky fights and climbs, and everything is really solid/competent. The climbing axe is really fun but you can only use it on special climbable walls. The rope arrows are really fun but you can only use them on special roped objects, or when you're next to rope posts. It's not free-roaming, it's figure out how the game wants you to get there and do it.\n\nNontheless, the tools you have are fun tools, and it's an enjoyable ride. Has it got anything special? Well, it's very pretty, there's a huge quantity of fire, the characters are fine....not really. The story arc is the only thing that makes it different, it really builds up impressively, but that suspense of disbelief only really lasts until 2/3 of the way through. After that it's just a standard Do Impossible Things And Kill The Bad Guy ending\n\nIn theory I'd have liked everything to have been ratcheted back a few notches. Have you kill maybe 5 people over the game rather than 500. Have a slower burn. Make it more based on survival and exploration. I dunno if it would have stood up to that lack of action though. Anyway. It's alright, it's fun, you're not going to miss out if you don't play it.","January 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I did not like the controls, there were a few times I felt the game would not respond to them even though my other games would respond just fine. Also, I had several issues with glitches that required me starting over from checkpoints. In the end I just got frustrated and mad, which took away from my ability to enjoy the storyline. Someday I might pick it back up to finish the story, but right now I’m just too frustrated with the game to continue.

The core experience of every Tomb Raider game remains in tact, just taken to the next level with improved mechanics.  I really like how they handled the loot system and how it ties directly in with uprading weaponry, it actually makes you want to search for loot.  The game is linear but you have a bit of freedom to change your path every now and then.  Make no mistake this is not an open world shooter, but I still found myself feeling like I had room to explore.  The optional side quest tombs are a nice addition as a way to take a breather from the main storyline.  There are not excessive amounts of quick time events, and the one's that are there feel like they belong.  Visually the game is beautiful and runs flawlessly on my pc.

It's an exciting adventure where you're shipwrecked on an island and you gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ out before the locals beat you to death three times over.\n\nThe combat was fast and fun. In addition to just shooting at you, the enemies would throw explosives which flush you out of cover, walk towards you with shields (probably the only game I can think of where guys like these aren't a pain in the ♥♥♥ to deal with), or just run at you with a sword in hand. Shootouts become more fun as you unlock skills like throwing dirt, stabbing people with an arrow (sigh... in the knee) as a counter attack, or an actual melee attack. There's also a stealth system, but outside of one part early in the game, it's just a matter of seeing how many guys you can kill before you get caught.\n\nWhen you're not busy killing a small town's worth of dudes, you'll be climbing, raiding, and exploring. The climbing is basically Uncharted. If there's something you can hang on to, you'll be jumping and climbing all over that ♥♥♥♥. Unlike Uncharted, there are also walls you have you press a button to grab onto and ropes that you can either zipline down or climb up. Also unlike Uncharted, the island can be explored. You can return to areas you've been to find anything from cool ancient artifacts to lame ♥♥♥ GPS trackers. I don't know what they do either.\n\nThen there's the tombs. All the tombs are optional areas where you're tasked with solving a single puzzle. These puzzles are usually trickier than the ones you deal with as part of the story. It was always satisfying when I finally piece together everything and make it to the chest at the end. The puzzles outside of tombs, as I already said, aren't as tricky. But they still require you to think about how to get past and they're more fun because of it.\n\nSo just ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game already.","July 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

TOMB RAIDER !!!\n\nRebooting Tomb Raider is the best thing that could have happened to the series. The game is full of story-wise emotions and superbly directed action scenes, and it still has a very strong human factor. I'm rarely this positive about a game. Crystal Dynamics took a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox fans, but all in all the developers have succeeded. The most important thing to know is this: the new Tomb Raider is one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating setting\n\nLara’s origin story is a terrific, action-packed experience with stunning visuals that sadly has not much to do with her previous adventures. Yet the puzzle physics are cool, the exploration of the island is rewarding and the much-improved combat is easily one of the biggest steps forward for the series – too bad there is sometimes too much of it.\n\nWhile not every promising idea Tomb Raider has is pulled off successfully, it nevertheless turns in a tense and memorable ride that combines modern game design with its forebears’ adventurous spirit in some exciting ways. Some of its missteps may well come at the cost of your enjoyment, but most can’t hope to hurt the adventure in the long run. Although it never fully finds its identity, this is a game and a story worth seeing through. A "Must Play" game indeed.\n\n- XeroSyphon","December 28, 2013","true","207.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While Tomb Raiders level design isn't necessarily unique, it's exceptionally well done and incredibly beautiful. With mountainous vistas, lush forests, craggy beachs, and detailed interiors, Tomb Raider is definitely one of the most beautiful works of the year. Breathtaking visuals aside, another one of Tomb Raiders major points of interest is the motion capture technique for Lara's model. When trekking through the landscapes, whether she's running, jumping (passive interactions with the level), in water (my favorite animations), climbing, or taking cover, Lara's motions are realistic and absolutely absorbing. Not since Uncharted have I seen such excellent motion capture techniques.\n\nAlthough Tomb Raider is a reboot AND origin story, it does an admirable job of setting up the Lara Croft mythos. Expect a modern retelling of our classic heroine though, which by no means incorporates dinosaurs (as of yet). While this installment focuses heavily on streamlining an actual story, compared to the tomb by tomb design of the classics, you can still expect to "raid those tombs", as the island of Yamatai is pockmarked by tombs of varying design and difficulty. The tombs aren't at all difficult, and while each tomb has an actual puzzle, don't expect a classic Tomb Raiding experience. The plot behind Tomb Raider incorporates supernatural elements, which befits the mythos, and is a fairly well written adventure. Multiplayer makes an appearance in Tomb Raider as well, and is on occasion entertaining, but is by no means a fleshed out experience. It's dull and nowadays, dead.\n\nIntroduced in the beginning of the story as a young, innocent and inexperienced University graduate, Lara's transformation to that of heroine and survivor might be considered extreme and unlikely, considering the events that she is placed through. Consider, though, that this is Lara Croft - indestructible, beautiful, and smart (she's still gorgeous, to all you nay-sayers). Unfortunately, Lara's character is the only one of interest, and the only one with character development of any sort (as all the supporting cast of characters are cliched and average). All in all, Tomb Raider boasts excellent production values, and is a well written and developed product. I highly recommend this cinematic journey, as it's definitely worth the money and the time.","June 11, 2014","true","50.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Tomb Raider is good. If you don't have a console then you will probably love it as there are few good games of this genre for the pc. The game takes place in a mysterious island  with interconnected paths though this is far from an open-world game.\n\nAbout the characters and the plot of the game I have to say that I was dissapointed. There are the bad guys, the good guys  and the island you have to escape from...That's it!. Also none of the characters is remarkable and all of them are badly voiced acted except from Lara. Though  even her voice acting was just fine and nothing special.\n\nThe gameplay is good enough as Lara will have to climb mountains and other structures, use ropes and her bow in order to reach her destination in the island. There are also some very enjoying sections where Lara has to escape from collapsing structures. What i didnt like about gameplay was the gunplay and the riddles. Gunplay because weapons don't have the right feeling and riddles because they are too easy, repetitive and you use the same methods on all of them. Also I almost hated the game for not having a dedicated key for taking cover! You just enter cover automatically when you are near walls and sadly this does not always work right.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of this game are it's graphics asuming that you have a powerful enough system. Everything is perfect here from textures to animations and... Lara's hair if you have an amd card! The sound however is a little generic compared to other games. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are forgetable.\n\nThe multiplayer is also generic. It has nothing special to offer and you will probably get bored of it after 3-4 matches.\n\nAs I said before Tomb Raider is one of the few good third person action adventure games out for pc so yes I recommend it. On pc Tomb Raider is one of its kind. But if you own a ps3 like me (I am not neither a console fanboy nor a pc one, I like both platforms) as well as any game of the Uncharted trilogy you will find this game a step down on every aspect and it just can't keep up to the competition.\n\n\nRating: 8/10","September 13, 2014","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The tracks are pouring with awesomeness and Jason Graves is a f*cking genious !\n\n(+)Cutscenes :  Oh how i love these cutscenes . Every cutscene in the game is fascinating to watch .\n\n(+)Story : It's an astonishing story to witness . This is yet another one of those games that you won't forget anytime soon .\n\n(+)Gameplay :  The game is at its best when you're fully in control, when you feel directly connected to Lara as she runs and leaps and clambers. But when the game does take some of that control away from you, it usually does so with skill and assurance. A number of semi-interactive scripted moments require less from you as a player, moments when the building Lara is standing on starts to crumble in spectacular fashion, or when she's being swept down a perilous river. What these sequences lack in interactivity, they make up for in spectacle. There are a few missteps; the quick-time-event-focused final confrontation ends the game on a slightly underwhelming note, for instance. But for the most part, these moments bring Tomb Raider a lot of cinematic thrills.\n\nBut no matter; The campaign here is the main attraction, and it is excellent. It doesn't try to rewrite the book on third-person action adventure games. But with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating setting, it doesn't need to. Lara may be covering some previously charted territory here, but Tomb Raider is so well-crafted, you won't mind at all.\n\n(-)Multiplayer : It's dead . Nobody plays multiplayer anymore and there isn't really anything special about it either . There are four modes ; a team deathmatch and a free for all, as well as two modes in which teams score points by completing basic objectives. It feels great to land a headshot on another player with a bow from across a map, or to activate a snare trap and then see another player heedlessly walk into it. But for the most part, it's standard fare, with the sorts of unlockable weapon upgrades and perks that are now par for the course.\n\nThis game is definetely worth your time . As i said earlier , It's one of those experiences that you won't be forgetting anytime soon .\n\n9.5/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","December 2, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The review explains this.\n\nAfter playing through the 10 hour long campaign, I had mixed feelings about Tomb Raider. There were so many things about the game that kept me playing, but also a few minor things that I think the developer Crystal Dynamics could have ironed out before release.\n\nFirst off, the game looks amazing. Even running it on low or medium graphics, the game aesthetics are great. The controls don't feel awkward, and the utilistation of Controller Support worked solidly with my Xbox One controller. For a survival game though, Lara's movements felt too fluid, and it didn't take her long to recover from a high fall or near-fatal attack. This, and her extremely high jump, make the gameplay feel slightly unbelievable.\n\nThe start of the story is somewhat believeable. Lara's ship, the Endurance, is shipwrecked on the island of Yamatai, in the Dragon's Triangle, off the coast of Japan. Lara then loses sight of her crew and must escape the strange and malevolent cult that live on the island. Towards the end however, the story becomes much more dramatic and outlandish. And sadly, it ends in a  boss fight.\n\nThe sounds in Tomb Raider are amazing, from the cries of enemies when they are shot in the knee with an arrow, or when Lara climbs up the side of a gushing waterfall. Camilla Luddington does a fantastic job of voicing Lara.\n\nSome strange things about Tomb Raider is its forced multiplayer. Whenever I tried to connect, no one was online to play. I can't say if it's worthwhile, but if people spent more time on this then it could add something more to gameplay. Also, the game is called Tomb Raider, but there are only seven tombs to raid, all of which are optional and don't benefit the story in any way.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a good third-person adventure, Tomb Raider does an astounding job at that. But if survival is more your thing, don't expect Tomb Raider to be one of the most challenging games.\n\n6.5/10","October 5, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The puzzles that you will do, require you to think well on what's going on. And the events that unfold require a think mind and a quick reflex to push the correct buttons to evade attacks. As well as the story demands that you go and look around, and discover the hidden secrets that you can find. It all explains everything, once you put all the peaces together.\n\nBe careful on what you do, one mistep can mean disaster.

There's stunning graphics, great world layout, smart AI, unique weapon choices+upgrades, and overall an amazing game, though it's not perfect by any means. There are 2 main problems I have with this game. First, the campaign is short, itt only took me 9.5 hours. Every minute of those 9.5 were incredible. Always keeping you on your toes and intensly into the game. I just wish that there was more. Espacailly the fact that the mulitplayer is boring (second problem). It's your average 3rd person shooter with nothing that really makes it unique or stand out. A short campaign and a boring mulitplayer makes for a short experience\n\nThis game is a great experince that I think all gamers should purchase. It's short, but worth your hard earned cash.","March 18, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything runs insanely smooth at max settings, and I haven't experienced any graphical hiccups throughout the time spent playing this game. With that being said, this game is phenomenal! From the graphics, to the storyline, to the open world interactivity, it continues to blow me away. The aiming mechanism works well, but I have to say that the "Survival Instinct" feature was a bit of overkill. The whole point to playing a game that revolves around survival is to make it moderately challenging. Some of my biggest complaints with Tomb Raider 2013 are as follows. Early on in the story, you are tasked with hunting for food because Lara is weak and needs to eat. After you complete that task, she no longer requires to be fed at all throughout the rest of the story, and can survive without killing another animal. Another thing I didn't like was the damage mechanics. Many times throughout the game, Lara gets badly injured, or so they want you to believe. You never have to tend to these wounds, and they just seem to go away on their own. When she falls from some higher up places, she will walk it off like it's nothing, while a normal person would have sustained at least broken bones from falls that great. And I won't even get started with the most flawed jumping and climbing mechanics.\n\nBut for every little complaint I have with this game, I can find two more good things. The weapons system was great, although it took a bit of time to get used to. (I just ended up using the 1-4 keys above the keyboard.) The versatility of the weapons was good, and the upgrades were well worth the time collecting extra salvage. As you progressed in the storyline, the enemies got harder to beat, coming at you in large numbers, and with the Stormguard requiring you to knock off the helmet in most cases before you can kill them. The ending was far to little of a challenge, but most of the game's AI functioned well.\n\nAll things considered, I would give Tomb Raider 2013 an 8/10. If you don't know what to do with $19.99, or it's on sale, buy it. You won't regret that you did.","March 9, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I was wondering why Lara was such a wuss, like this was her first time ever raiding a tomb and although they never say it, it's implied that this is the start of Lara's adventures, like way way before the OG Tomb Raider. That said, I have no doubt in my mind when I say this is the best TR title to date. This game has been perfected and I'm amazed it is almost 2 years old because the graphics on Ultra look nex-gen to me. Aside from amazing graphics the gameplay is beautiful, averaging 57 fps and near completion, I have yet to encounter a single glitch or bug. The characters have just that, character, a great plot with attention to detail all around. I love the weapons, the upgrades you can give them, the AI is fun, stealth kills are extremly satisfying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/recommended/203160/","Croaker1084","THE GODDAMN BATMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/","88 products in account","I am hiding behind cover in the darkness in an desparate attempt to escape unseen after being caught by members of the Solarii Brotherhood led by a medthodical madman known as Mathias.\nJust a few short hours ago I had been captured just after the shipwreck, only to break free and sustain a nasty wound. Now, here I am having been caught again, but fighting back, and while my hands are bound I move quietly\nthrough the paths that are dotted with rock, rumble, shrubs and trees. They're searching for me. I have to be careful of the flashlights, if I am spotted I will die instantly in a hail of gunfire. I make my way to what appears to be safe shelter, but alas, I am discovered by one of the Solarii and taken, a struggle breaks out with a small series of QTEs. This ends with me shooting my would be captor in the head, splattering his brains about the stone path and some soil. My bonds are broken free and I now make my way towards rescuing my shipmates, my friends. I take out severel of the Solarii with clean headshots using my bow and arrows. This is only the beginning and this adventure has sucked me in entirely. Welcome to Tomb Raider.\n\nWhen I first heard about the ressurection of the Tomb Raider of the Tomb Raider series, I had my doubts as whether this series' new facelift could compete with with newer IPs, such as Uncharted or the Batman Arkham IP for instance.\nI was very pleasantly surprised by the work of Crystal Dynamics. I feel, having played through the Uncharted series, that Tomb Raider surpassed it by leaps and bounds. I felt that CD breathed new life into Lara Croft in a way that I could never imagine.\nNo more cliche outfits with huge breasts, they kept her beautiful and tasteful, yet sexy and desirable; appealing to everyone on the spectrum. The Origin story of how Lara Croft becomes not only a survivor, but a tomb raider is an outstanding work.\nThe story has a natural pace to it, the pace quickens at the right moments and slows at the right moments to allow the player the time to explore optional tombs and to find and collect relics and documents. Characters are fleshed out well, despite the fact that they really don't have much screen time, and some characters you feel more of a bond with, like Roth. The VO work in this title is phenomenal! Aside from the story characters themselves, I always looked forward to discovering a new document just to hear the amazing VO work.\nOverall I would say that the origin story of Lara Croft is excellent, it pulls you in, it moves you to feel emotion. The story is well written and it isn't short, nor is it too long, it feels just right for the type of game that this is.\nThe setpieces in this game are of some the very best that I have seen. I know that they are setpieces, but the way in which CD implemented these setpieces..makes the setpieces and gameplay meld together in way in which it isn't too obvious. CD doesn't overdo the setpieces either, but the setpieces that are in place are epic. Even the smaller setpieces.\n\nThe gameplay for this title was very solid, the controls, unfortunately aren't that greatly suited to KB/M, so I used a control pad, in that regard the controls were very tight. I had no problems getting Lara to do what I wanted her to do\nat the very moment I needed her to dodge an enemy attack, to falling from a cliffside and catching herself with the pickaxe. I was very pleased with how the controls worked, with the exception of the KB/M. I am a PC gamer, and thus I prefer KB/M (duh).\nThe combat system overall felt new and fresh in so many ways, whereas in a few ways it did feel a bit stale. Hiding behind cover and popping out to take pop shots is standard fare. So, I put the combat system to the test. I played on hard and used only the bow through the game to kill, that and stealth kills, and melee. Of course there are certain instances in which you are forced to use your pistol. Those are rare. I made use of every tool at my disposal, in terms of pushing Lara forward and gaining ground with my bow and my pickaxe. Dodging enemy fire to the next set of cover, knowing they'll have to reload, I take my opportunity for a torso shot and as they're stunned for that brief second I put an arrow through their head.\nIf they get too close I dodge and throw dirt, dodge and sink an arrow into their knee, etc..While Lara's art of killing isn't very refined, it does get the job done and ultimately leads to some very intense combat throughout the game. The combat stays fresh with introduction of new enemies as well as the introdution of bow parts and bow upgrades. Your tactics in combat will have changed considerably the by the end game stretch, which offers the most resistance.\nThe one glaring complaint I do have with this game is the number of Solarii. I must have killed around 200 or more of these men. How are there so many of them? This doesn't include the ones I bypassed via stealth. In certain areas it felt like I was playing horde mode only with just a bow and some arrows.\n\nThe graphics in this game are beautiful, absolutely gorgeous looking. While I didn't pay much attention to the texture detail of every item in the game, there are a few that I noticed that suffered from low-res textures, as for the majority, the textures that count, those looked great.\nThe lighting system in Tomb Raider in very impressive, very easy on the eyes. The atmosphere of Tomb Raider was very well done in general. Each area had its own atmosphere to reflect what is happening in said area, and I feel that the artists nailed this! The Audio experience in this game made the whole adventure even more immersive and intense! My Klipsch 2.1 ProMedia set really fleshed out the audio engineering that went into this title.\nI also enjoyed seeing how dirty Lara could get, covered in mud, blood, waste, etc...then go into the water and she is cleaner. The progression of Lara over the game is also very well done. By the end of the game she has so many cuts and scrapes and bruises. Her clothing is torn to bits without\nbeing distateful and too revealing. All in all I can not recommend Tomb Raider enough! If you have not played this title already, you should. As I look back into the past of 2013, this game would have been my GOTY. I can't wait for the next Tomb Raider title.","February 15, 2015","true","30.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything runs insanely smooth at max settings, and I haven't experienced any graphical hiccups throughout the time spent playing this game. With that being said, this game is phenomenal! From the graphics, to the storyline, to the open world interactivity, it continues to blow me away. The aiming mechanism works well, but I have to say that the "Survival Instinct" feature was a bit of overkill. The whole point to playing a game that revolves around survival is to make it moderately challenging. Some of my biggest complaints with Tomb Raider 2013 are as follows. Early on in the story, you are tasked with hunting for food because Lara is weak and needs to eat. After you complete that task, she no longer requires to be fed at all throughout the rest of the story, and can survive without killing another animal. Another thing I didn't like was the damage mechanics. Many times throughout the game, Lara gets badly injured, or so they want you to believe. You never have to tend to these wounds, and they just seem to go away on their own. When she falls from some higher up places, she will walk it off like it's nothing, while a normal person would have sustained at least broken bones from falls that great. And I won't even get started with the most flawed jumping and climbing mechanics.\n\nBut for every little complaint I have with this game, I can find two more good things. The weapons system was great, although it took a bit of time to get used to. (I just ended up using the 1-4 keys above the keyboard.) The versatility of the weapons was good, and the upgrades were well worth the time collecting extra salvage. As you progressed in the storyline, the enemies got harder to beat, coming at you in large numbers, and with the Stormguard requiring you to knock off the helmet in most cases before you can kill them. The ending was far to little of a challenge, but most of the game's AI functioned well.\n\nAll things considered, I would give Tomb Raider 2013 an 8/10. If you don't know what to do with $19.99, or it's on sale, buy it. You won't regret that you did.","March 9, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

By the end of the game you're crafting magazine fed auto shotguns that fire grenades and it is kind of jarring departure from the beginning where you'll use a deer antler and hide to make a makeshift climbing pickaxe or a bow.\nI kind of wish they would've settled down to just basic weapons without customisation especially since the customisation is entirely linear and straight up upgrades rather than optional sidegrades. I understand the constant progression helps keep things fresh.\nThis is the most mature and grittiest Tomb Raider, which I feel is refreshing since I was never too keen on the atlantean gods and asgard god aliens. A lot of gruesome deaths. Enemy variety is unfortunately a bit limited because of this but near the end of the game you'll have a bit more refreshing encounters. No big monster bosses unfortunately.\n\nBiggest criticism I had with the game is the lack of Croft Manor and Lara not banging out with two pistols.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/recommended/203160/","droniac","Droniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/","884 products in account","Tomb Raider is an outstanding action-adventure game, but perhaps not what fans of the franchise were expecting. This reboot doesn't follow in the traditions of the original games so much as set out on its own path. It has resulted in a more modern game that's certain to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nThis is mainly evidenced by the streamlining of platforming and puzzling segments. Most of the more challenging bits are relegated to optional objectives, like raiding tombs. Puzzling is rarely required and always obvious, in part due to a make-objectives-glow-vision mode that's always available. And most of the platforming you'll have to do is based around maintaining forward momentum while navigating constantly changing terrain. It's more directly engaging and exciting, but also a lot more forgiving.\n\nWith platforming relegated to a supporting role, combat and exploration have filled the void. Most of the time Tomb Raider feels like a solid third person shooter with a cover system and Assassin's Creed-style melee counter system. There are only a few weapons available, but each has multiple fire modes and plenty of upgrades available. As a result the combat remains varied and entertaining throughout, helped by great use of physics and environmental destruction. And at the same time exploration is now a big deal as environments are more open and free-form than in previous installments. Meanwhile the treasure and logs you find help fill out the story.\n\nThat brings me to the game's key strength: its story. Tomb Raider grabbed me from the beginning and never let go. It helps to go out of your way to find every last book as these backstories strengthen the overarching plot considerably. But even without them Lara's evolving character is strong enough to keep you hooked. Even if she does make the switch from newbie to badass surprisingly quickly. Sadly all the other characters remain predictable and static throughout, so there aren't many twists you won't see coming. The ending is likewise not unexpected, but immensely satisfying and impeccably timed.\n\nTomb Raider's other strength is its variety. Lara's skills constantly improve and there are all sorts of new weapons, weapon attachments, and utilities to find and create. These are spaced out in such a way that platforming constantly stays fresh, while the combat never gets stuck into a rut of monotomy. There are usually various ways to approach a situation and it's up to the player to decide how they want things to play out.\n\nI preferred the stealthy approach, because it enhances the game's atmosphere. Many times bad guys will talk about what's happening on the island, which reinforces the story and their motivations. However, that's also the perfect time to take them out while they're distracted, because the encounter will often be more difficult once they finish talking.\n\nThat being said, the increased difficulty will likely be welcome. Perhaps one of the most well-known facts about this game is that it lets Lara die in some of the most gruesome ways possible. Impalement on a sword, bashing her head in on the rocks, taking a tree branch through the throat, it's all there and more besides. But even playing on Hard difficulty the chances of seeing those death scenes aren't very high. There's a reason there's no achievement for playing on Hard difficulty in this game: it's not an achievement.\n\nLastly there are some technical bits to touch on. The PC port is great and comes with a slew of additional visual effects that make the game look absolutely stunning. But much like Half Life 2: Episode 2, the reason this game is one of the most beautiful games out there isn't technical prowess but clever visual design. Exactly the right lighting and shadows throughout the entire game, with proper use of shaders. The voice acting and mouse and keyboard controls are top-notch too. In fact mouse and keyboard is equally as viable as a gamepad for playing Tomb Raider, which is rare for a third-person game.\n\nIt's a bit heavy on the QTEs though. And those take a lot longer to get used to on keyboard & mouse than on a gamepad.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nTomb Raider oozes atmosphere from every well-designed corner. If you enjoy a good action-packed story-driven gaming experience, then this will be one of the highlights of your collection. It's a Tomb Raider game everyone can enjoy. Even those who never liked the franchise.\n\nTechnical Droning\n120Hz - Yes\nBorderless Window - No\nGraphics Options - Plenty\nTexture Quality - High\nMouse Acceleration - Acceptable\nGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad for QTEs, keyboard and mouse for everything else","May 26, 2014","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game does everything right; story, gameplay, pacing, controls - you name it. The way the game takes you in makes you really care for Lara. No, I'm not being a little girl. The development of Lara's character as you progress throughout the game makes this one heck of an origin story. That's all I'll say. There's also some great cinematics (and damn the camera is amazing in capturing the atmosphere) accompanied with very believable voice acting which rounds off this title.\n\nI came across a few glitches that prevented me from moving forward, but with the frequent autosaves, restarting part of a level hardly registers as a negative experience. In the same vein though, death is not really punished. You'll get killed and pretty much respawn in the same spot that you died. Unless you're looking for some sort of Dark Souls experience, I think this is perfectly fine. I played on normal difficulty and died an acceptable number of times. There are definitely challenging parts which I had to repeat a few times, but they're appropriately dispersed between areas of exploration. I wasn't much of a collector in this game and mainly stuck to the main story line. I think I completed it in about 15 hours with ~70%.

The game story starts before the first Tomb Raider game and Lara Croft learns to adapt, survive and evolve during her though and unexpected journey. You have the ability to upgrade Lara's skills and weapons in order to become stronger against your opponents.\n\nHowever this game has astonishing graphics and the fact that Lara feels like a real person, the game itself felt different to me than the older ones I used to play (The first six games from Core Design, not Legend, Anniversary and Underworld).\n\nWhere the older games used puzzles, acrobatics and thoughtful levels as recipe, this game aims more for the action, collectibles & upgrades, button cutscenes, and most of all, on the events around Lara Croft itself. The outcome of this recipe is that you feel more connected to Lara and you are willing to spend more time in this game.\n\nI finished this game on 100% and enjoyed the game alot! I recommend it to anyone who love the Tomb Raider series, adventure games or just Lara Croft. Altough i want to say that this game is definitely not like predecessors because of the different developer team, Crystal Dynamics.","February 6, 2015","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Have to say, PC version is crawling with bugs, bugs that do not exist on console versions. I've been falling through ground a lot rendering this game unplayable at the time. I've bought Lost Adventurer DLC, and even the DLC have bugs. Since this game is not that new, and bugs still exist, I doubt they will be ever fixed.

To last. Nixxes did an excellent job here.\n\nMultiplayer: This addition feels unneccesary. Its' something gamers can do without, gladly so. My first impressions that have stuck about it is that its' clunky, slow (Even on a good network link) an it adds no value to the franchise. If you're going to pull of multi-player in an Open world game, take a leaf from Far Cry 3. End of story.\n\nOverall rating: 9.7/10\n\nHighly recommended.","July 27, 2014","true","76.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's beautiful. It's scenic. It's sound is brilliant.\nWhat breaks immersion in games like this? Quicktime events. This game is riddled with them. The weird part? I actually don't mind. I absolutely hate quicktime events, but this title somehow manages to use them delicately, with grace. The platforming bits often play out like a movie.\n\nThe combat is visceral. I'm not one for 'spray and prey', so I've been maining the handgun and bow. I use the bow for long range and stealth, and the pistol for accurate fire during combat. Otherwise? Well, if they're up close I ♥♥♥♥ them up with my climbing axe, or fill them with the glorious goodness of my shotty.\nThe combat feels great. It's responsive and downright fun. I often find myself looking for ways to dispatch my foes with as much style as possible, because I can. The combat in this game wasn't as stale as I thought it would be. It isn't just a mob of enemies and an assault rifle in your hands. It's creative, and that says something.\n\nThe puzzles are adequate. I find myself looking at my environment for a minute or two, tops. Still, they top most puzzles in non-puzzle games these days. Can I make a reference to relate the difficulty of these puzzles to you? Absolutely. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, or Majora's Mask.\n\nThe framerate occasionally dips twenty or so frames for a few seconds at a time on a GTX970, but I really do mean occasionally. It's not abhorrent, just a minor scratch on the gorgeous visage of this game. I have experienced only two crashes, both of them large aircrafts. I was in one of them. Also one shipwreck - I was in that one too.\n\nAll in all, I am enjoying the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Tomb Raider fans should be proud.\n\nTL;DR: This game is very pretty and Lara Croft does not understand how doorknobs work.","September 3, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are very nice and the story is ok, but the gameplay is so far from "Tomb Raider" it's appalling. There are some puzzles but none requres too much brainwork and even so the hardest ones seems to be entirely optional as well. Half of the game plays like a semi-interactive movie where you sometimes have to press a button or waggle the stick in order to not see Lara impaled for the nth time, and the other half, the combat sequences, she turns into Rambo's more violent little sister. There are some emotional cutscenes as well that tries to make us see her as the frightened little girl that she wasn't even close to being the moment before and make us feel sorry for her. Sadly though I mostly feel sorry that she's in the hands of Crystal Dynamics.","June 26, 2014","false","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game story starts before the first Tomb Raider game and Lara Croft learns to adapt, survive and evolve during her though and unexpected journey. You have the ability to upgrade Lara's skills and weapons in order to become stronger against your opponents.\n\nHowever this game has astonishing graphics and the fact that Lara feels like a real person, the game itself felt different to me than the older ones I used to play (The first six games from Core Design, not Legend, Anniversary and Underworld).\n\nWhere the older games used puzzles, acrobatics and thoughtful levels as recipe, this game aims more for the action, collectibles & upgrades, button cutscenes, and most of all, on the events around Lara Croft itself. The outcome of this recipe is that you feel more connected to Lara and you are willing to spend more time in this game.\n\nI finished this game on 100% and enjoyed the game alot! I recommend it to anyone who love the Tomb Raider series, adventure games or just Lara Croft. Altough i want to say that this game is definitely not like predecessors because of the different developer team, Crystal Dynamics.","February 6, 2015","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gone was the cute, ridiculous, big boobed caricature. Instead was this more believable human with emotion, detail and fragility.\n\nNo game is perfect but I find it hard personally to find faults.

Lara Croft reboot gives the franchise the refresh mechanics that it dearly needed, with lots of cinematic cutscenes inspired from Uncharted. Quick Time Events are the downside of this game but very little of it is used after the introduction of the game. Lara moans like a girl receiving a prolapse, so beware if you're sensitive to overdone moans.\n\nThe AI is dumb at times and it ruins the overall immersion this game has to offer. Puzzles are easy to solve but they still manage to feel rewarding with loot at the end of it. Combat mechanics are better than what they used to be, so any casual gamer should not feel punished by their silly mistakes.

If you don’t, but you’re a fan of the franchise, I’d still recommend buying it when it goes on sale. If you aren’t a completionist, be warned, you might find this game short.\n---------------------\n\nThe first five minutes of the game give you a very accurate idea of the course that Lara’s adventure will take: several gritty moments, fast paced action and struggle to survive.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me the most was the powerful immersion in the story, setting wise. This game has an incredible scenery, so much so that landscapes are breath-taking and views are always worth appreciating. However, because the island was the last destination of aircrafts and ships of all historical ages, sooner or later you feel that the beautiful place is aggressively hostile to outsiders.\nWhile it is true that Lara has to find her way through the island and overcome several environmental challenges, I think that there were a couple of missed opportunities to make the island itself a real antagonist to the adventurer. For example, at the very beginning of the game you must hunt a deer because Lara is hungry; nevertheless, from that moment on hunting becomes completely secondary and even dispensable. Maybe that’s nit-picking, but from my point of view, some things could have been added to emphasize the ‘woman versus wild’ premise.\n\nIn regard to the main plot of the game, it is decent. You might find it to be quite linear and I didn’t consider the foreshadowing to be effective. However —and this is why I loved the game so much— the character development is magnificent. Through the game you witness Lara’s evolution from being a naïve youngster to being a hardened survivor; personally, this added a lot of value to the game and to the reboot itself. You experience the birth of a true adventurer that has a very realistic human side. Lara’s strength doesn’t exclusively lie on sheer badassery anymore; her strength comes from experience and self-improvement. She’s afraid, she doubts, she suffers the burden of responsibility and guilt… she’s human.\nBesides, if you collect the documents along the game, you get a glimpse of Lara’s relationships with her friends and even what her father and her last name mean to her. Everything contributes to make her a deep character to whom you can empathize with.\n\nFinally, I would like to refer to one of the weakest points of the game: difficulty. If you enjoy challenging games, this one will probably not suit your taste. Unlike other Tomb Raider games, puzzles aren’t hard and most of them aren’t key to advance in the storyline (puzzles are mostly find in optional tombs). It’s unlikely that you get stuck somewhere and need to use guides or extra help to advance. Enemies aren’t hard either and even the ending of the game doesn’t represent a relevant trial.\nThe game is also quite linear, even if there are a couple of extensive maps, you don’t have —complete— freedom to explore the island. Due to its linearity, if you’re not aiming to end the game at 100% and/or with all achievements, I would recommend buying it only when it goes on sale, because it might not take you more than 13 hours to finish it. In addition, if you’re looking for some multiplayer action, go look elsewhere, because multiplayer is dead most of the time.\n\nTo sum it up, I think this is an excellent reboot to the franchise because Lara has become a deeper character, more human, with more value. Besides, it keeps many things from previous Tomb Raider titles, like ancient ruins and the misterious thin line that exists between myths and reality. I’m definitely looking forward to playing the next titles.","January 1","true","59.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is just awesome. Of course there are a few things that could have been done better, but the graphics, the atmosphere of the game, the landscapes, the cutscenes… they are just beautiful. I love the new portrayal of Lara Croft and I like how she looks more realistic than ever. She is smart, strong, fast and brave, but at the same time she’s also just a young woman doing her best to survive… and you feel for her. I really suffered whenever she got hurt, and I think that’s something the developers got just right. The gameplay is awesome, the story is certainly entertaining and playing this game feels like a super cool movie you don't want to stop watching.\n\nSo yes, Tomb Raider gets an A+ from me, but let’s have a look at some of the things it could have done better, like for example including a bit more “tomb raiding”, instead of so much “island exterminating”. I also did not like how fast Lara changes from being an innocent girl afraid of shooting a gun into the secret lost daughter of Rambo and John Wick.\n\nAnother thing I didn’t like is how I could never figure which key  they wanted me to press during the quick time events. Poor Lara just kept dying and I sometimes even had to open the key mapping menu just to see  what I was doing wrong. I hope they fix that in the next Tomb Raider. Give us a big “PRESS E”, or a massive “F” instead of a small red hand symbol.\n\nMore small details that are not as good as they should have been: Some of the characters are too based on cultural stereotypes, which sucks. And Lara complains all the time about how cold she is, but she never figures that she could cover herself with the hundreds of jackets she comes by. Oh, and it’s also funny how even though she is an archeologist, all she does is destroy all the buildings and old artifacts she sees. But we love you still, Lara. You made me suffer a lot throughout these 20 hours of gameplay, but we had a blast together. Can’t wait to see you again in the next Tomb Raider!\n\nPs: No, Crystal Dynamics, I appreciate the gesture at the beginning of the credits, but I am the one who should thank you for this amazing game and so many hours of awesomeness.

The only thing I thought could use some improvement were the puzzles/tombs. These could be more complex in my opinion.\n\nTo get a little more in depth: I haven't played tomb raider since the first one on the ps1. My interest in Tomb Raider 2013 was created by seeing the name and hearing it while looking for graphic card benchmarks. After looking in to it I saw a game that looked great and I decided to experience the story myself. I was not dissapointed. The game litteraly sucked me in to it and did not let me go until I finished it. And that took me about 2 weeks. Where I mostly switch games every day and hour this game deserved to be an exception. I truly love the visuals on normal settings. And the voice acting with corresponding character movements were great as well. As for Lara, the main character I was very satisfied with the way she is modeled. Not like the ones I used to know from the ps1 the movie and game reviews as a big boobed sex bomb. But like a beatiful, smart and strong athletic young woman.\nAnother plus is for the choices of weapons. There are not to much weapons but they are nice and balanced in strength and ammo supplies. My last point about the puzzles or tombs is that I would love to see them more complex and longer. I finished most within 5 minutes and think that they should have been a more important part of the game with a little backstory.\n\nNow I am looking forward to purchase the sequel when the price is right in a sale.","March 24","true","60.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even being so compressed to the point of pixelization on a 1080p screen, it was noticeable and wrecked them. Vsync recommended if you can, should fix the issues.\n\nHalf cut scene/intractable parts have no prompt of that you should take control over. Expect to die randomly, the camera will change angles and then out of the blue you are expected to interact and direct Lara. The camera angles are great and well done just be aware.\n\nPuzzles weren't hard, but due to how the engine handles interactions wilth climbing and jumping expect to be annoyed in certain parts.

Like a really bad movie directed by 8th graders. Lara never really does smart things, and gets her friends killed. She is like "I'm a strong female character" and I'm like "maybe you should take responsibility for getting your friends trapped on an island and then trying to manipulate them while they get shot up by cult members". There are a bunch of questions the game itself raises and then never answers.

LOTS of Action and Adventure.\n\nThere are no loading screens inbetween the areas as that is solved by using short hallways, and overall the map feels very fluent and interconnected (e.g. you can see a landmark in the distance, coming closer as you play, with you eventually reaching it). The map and graphics overall make for a great atmosphere. Obviously the stuff that happens to Lara is not really realistic, but even though one knows she will survive, one still flinches because the gameplay designers did not choose her experience in this game to be comforting. As such, when she begins to struggle on a ledge or similar, I actually thought that she might fall. The experience and skill point system is good, every skill point spent actually helps ingame and the XP system rewards exploration. Ideally you want to use your weapons as little as possible, but they can be upgraded too and receive new features during the game. This makes backtracking to old areas rewarding as with the new equipment new tombs and areas are unlocked.\n\nThe story is very linear, but the fact that the exploration and challenges are so enjoyable and larger areas yield many surprises makes up for it. Maybe I am just bored of sandbox and multiplayer games. It is just a long, awesome, action/adventure movie in that sense, as the cutscenes blend nicely with the gameplay, similar to the loading passages.\n\nThere are a few not so ideal things, such as the mediocre combat system and enemy AI, however I would not say that it substracted from the game, but it did not add to it either. Stealth is possible for some areas, in other areas however, the game forces you to be discovered (at the same time some explosions are probably going on too). While I am a huge stealth player, I did enjoy being forced to go "loud" for once, as I ALWAYS try to get a perfect stealth run if a game permits me to do so.\n\nGraphical performance is optimised, I am able to play it fluently on a lower resolution (1080p :v) with medium settings on a low grade notebook graphics card. A proper desktop should have no problems handling it. The most taxing options that should be disabled if aiming for more FPS are: Antialiasing, Post-processing, SSAO, High Precision, TressFX (set Hair to normal).\n\nOverall I recommend this game very highly, I do not like x/10 scales, as everyone sees those differently. I however, thoroughly enjoyed this game and would it recommend it to my friends and that is all that matters in the end.\n\n(First review, please be mindful)","October 2, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Gorgeous graphics, immersive level design and setting, tons of collectibles, a very well designed learning curve and challenging difficulty levels, amazing sound effects and soundtrack, great voice work and wonderful art all around. The only minuses - multiplayer isn't really fun, and by now there aren't many people to play with anyway + the overall story is, of course, very Lara Croft-ish. But the rich world and many hidden collectibles help out with that, and personally I wasn't really bothered by it that much, even though the outcome was quite predictable.\n\nNote: it does borrow a few things from Uncharted, yes, but then again Naughty Dog surely borrowed a lot from the original TR series, so it's all good in the end. Tomb Raider is a different experience than stepping into the shoes of Nathan Drake, and comparisons should be made with care.\n\nOverall I can't praise this enough. If you haven't explored the origin story of Lara Croft, there's no excuse not to do so!","October 20, 2015","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're playing the game whilst watching a movie or something.\nThe overal scenery and atmosphere was fantastic. I love games where you would run in this huge place, climb up and jump down while stuff around you is moving along with the atmosphere. Then you'd sit at the top of the mountain and point down at where you previously stood before you started climbing.\n\nThe story is very linear and so is the gameplay; not too much falling around, one way path with a little extras on the road, but overall it's pretty clear what to do.\n\nThe only minor irritation I had was the suddenly "stuck in place and have to shoot enemies" kind of thing. Where you would sit hiding, moving up sometimes to shoot enemies, then back down to hide...move around a little to get closer. This could've been so much better, like running combat, or anything else that makes you not 'forced' to sit in one place and hide and shoot.  BUT maybe that's just me, I know, this ain't no Assassin's Creed still. :)\n\nOverall, big thumbs up for my first Tomb Raider game I've ever played. I'd love to try out the sequel.","January 14, 2015","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

It's a barrage of qtes mixed with Lara screaming in pain or sounding like she's having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (which prompted my neighbour to ask which porn I was watching and why was it so loud). However, hang in there. The game afterwards is a lot better, when the game lets you play it.\n\nWhen not exploring dungeons and doing puzzles, you're half stuck in cutscenes where you'll have to suffer through awful dialogue and half playing whack-a-mole in the tedious gunfights that occur every 10-20 minutes. Boss battles are also a let down, there's not much variety in them.\n\nI did start to warm to the plot as the story progressed, but it's nothing to write home about. The graphics are beautiful in my opinion, I especially liked TressFX althought it's stupid how only Lara gets proper hair and everyone else has the standard glued to head hair. However I feel they should implement TressFX into more games.\n\nOverall, despite my review containing a lot of negativity, I'd reccomend this game. It's kind of like a poor mans Uncharted. I'm just hoping they address a lot of the problems in the next game cause I'm looking forward to playing it.","February 15, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game indeed looks beautiful and it's entertaining, but I don't find it challenging enough and the plot and most of characters don't interest me at all. The writing and narrative is not very good, more often than not I'm annoyed/disappointed by Lara's comments. The game is not very realistic, sometimes the amount of enemies you have to battle, even while being stealthy is ridiculous, but still not that difficult. The "secret" tombs are not so secret, it was all sort of simple. I don't think this game is one that will ever be replayed, I'm almost done with it, just haven't felt like doing the last part, but I got 100% completion in all other areas.

It's truly a trustworthy reborn of the TR franchice and an amazing depiction of Lara's commence as a survivor and, of course, as a tomb raider.\nFor the ones who played TR games like Legend or Underworld, you'll find this game still being a TR you always knew, yet much more plausible and credible in its story, world, enemies, mechanics, physics, customization, weapons, gadgets and Lara, the heroine herself.\nFor those of you who have not played TR before, give this game a try. It's full of action, exploration, stealth and surviving in a cursed island. I'd say it's kind of an Uncharted game, but with a female hero (heroine) and a practically open world (much like the freedom you have in Dead Space when exploring the space-ship stations, maybe even more).\nIf you're somehow into any of the games like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Hitman, Splinter Cell...

This game does everything right; story, gameplay, pacing, controls - you name it. The way the game takes you in makes you really care for Lara. No, I'm not being a little girl. The development of Lara's character as you progress throughout the game makes this one heck of an origin story. That's all I'll say. There's also some great cinematics (and damn the camera is amazing in capturing the atmosphere) accompanied with very believable voice acting which rounds off this title.\n\nI came across a few glitches that prevented me from moving forward, but with the frequent autosaves, restarting part of a level hardly registers as a negative experience. In the same vein though, death is not really punished. You'll get killed and pretty much respawn in the same spot that you died. Unless you're looking for some sort of Dark Souls experience, I think this is perfectly fine. I played on normal difficulty and died an acceptable number of times. There are definitely challenging parts which I had to repeat a few times, but they're appropriately dispersed between areas of exploration. I wasn't much of a collector in this game and mainly stuck to the main story line. I think I completed it in about 15 hours with ~70%. There's easily another 10 hours if I wanted to find everything (more if I wanted to get the Steam achievements).","June 15, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It offers a deeper and darker story about the origin of Lara Croft. Lara's so damn ordinary at first, just like any other girls. You may hate her character at first, but stranded on a remote island full of bloodlust crazy people quickly turn her into a badass adventurer that we all love.\n\nThe graphics and the details are gorgeous. Lara's movement is so smooth and real. The control's also very good. The gameplay itself is more balanced, not only dominated with puzzles, but there're also actions, stealth and survival.\n\nAt the other side, I feel that the puzzles're rather easy. Puzzles have become a major part of the series. By lowering the puzzles difficulty, I feel something's missing. I hope the next TR will come back with more challenging puzzles.\n\nOverall, this's a great game. A must buy.","May 19, 2015","true","77.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Linear environments that appear "open," boring gameplay that can't decide which style it wants to ripoff, puzzles that are too few and too easy, and sadistic and glorified death animations.  At least it has nice graphics, right?","February 1, 2014","false","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game story starts before the first Tomb Raider game and Lara Croft learns to adapt, survive and evolve during her though and unexpected journey. You have the ability to upgrade Lara's skills and weapons in order to become stronger against your opponents.\n\nHowever this game has astonishing graphics and the fact that Lara feels like a real person, the game itself felt different to me than the older ones I used to play (The first six games from Core Design, not Legend, Anniversary and Underworld).\n\nWhere the older games used puzzles, acrobatics and thoughtful levels as recipe, this game aims more for the action, collectibles & upgrades, button cutscenes, and most of all, on the events around Lara Croft itself. The outcome of this recipe is that you feel more connected to Lara and you are willing to spend more time in this game.\n\nI finished this game on 100% and enjoyed the game alot! I recommend it to anyone who love the Tomb Raider series, adventure games or just Lara Croft. Altough i want to say that this game is definitely not like predecessors because of the different developer team, Crystal Dynamics.","February 6, 2015","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
