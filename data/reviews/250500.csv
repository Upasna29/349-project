I had no idea what I was buying, but hey, it's a steam sale so you just shut your brain off and start adding things to your cart.\n\nWell it turns out I hit a goldmine with this one. I started it up, named my party members after my friends, and got right to playing. Suddenly I was in a low earth orbit fighting asteroids and rogue satellites. My wagon crashes back to earth, and I get burned to death by a dragon after chasing a unicorn through a field of flowers.\n\nStart up a new game - everything's going great, when all of a sudden\n\nBUFFALO BUFFALO\nBUFFALO BUFFALO\nBUFFALO BUFFALO\nBUFFALO BUFFALO\n\n10/10 would/will die in amazing ways again","January 12, 2014","true","7.6"," 286 of 300 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","286","300","4","6"

But HornyFishMan, NuggleSnugg, and HurgaDerga had to do it. It was time they traveled to the West Coast in their trusty station wagon. Leading the group, HornyFishMan picks up his uzi. They hunt. Bandits attack. Some could even aim. They reach a river. They ford it. Boulders... so many boulders... and then the pirate ship attacked. Luckily, there was a rocket launcher in the river. A few quick shots, and it's down. Suck it, Blackbeard.\n\nThe group enters the Great Plains. Buffalo buffalo buffalo. The number of buffalo was absurd. HurgaDerga is impaled by a buffalo, and I swear he will be missed. NuggleSnugg and HornyFishMan go on. Horny is healed by health kits that was bought, along with a flame thrower, with the buffalo hide. Remember, the ones that killed HurgaDerga? Revenge is sweet. They see a woman in a red dress. HornyFishMan stops to see if she needs help. It wasn't a trap, and she needs no help. She thanks Horny and sends him away. A civil war battle is underway nearby. The group says hello. There were no survivors.\n\nThe group reaches another river. It was time the station wagon went underwater. Water buffalo water buffalo water buffalo. The group reaches an island. Horny notices supplies on the shore. He takes them. It was a trap! PELICANS! Luckily, he survives. They swim to shore.\n\nThey reach a mountain pass. Food supplies were running low, so they hunted. No bandits this time, but wolves. So many wolves. They find a trader. They use the wolves they murdered to buy a double-barreled uzi. There is a snow storm, yet the wolves continue to attack. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... They deal with the wolves, and see a strange figure in the distance... Horny investigates.\n\nBIGFOOT! Horny runs at him, and having found another flamethrower in the snow, takes him down easily. It is now out of ammo, though, so he gets his double-barreled uzi back out. Infinite ammo rocks! He runs back to the wagon, and the snow storm was rough, so in their panic, they drive off a cliff.\n\nBuffalo followed HornyFishMan and NuggleSnugg off the cliff. So many buffalo. They dodge all the buffalo, and manage to land safely in a river. Having lost their wheels, the station wagon became a raft. They navigated through boulders and fought off alligators. Then they reached a bandit ambush. The bandits attacked with shotguns on their rafts. Successfully defending themselves from the bandits, alligators, and boulders, the group could see the West coast. They almost made it! But then a bandit showed up. He had found some sort of steam boat. Lighting up the boat as much as possible, it wasn't enough. A bandit holding a shotgun on top of the steam boat fired, and Horny wasn't quick to the dodge. NuggleSnugg joined Hurga, after all this time. She came so far, and it didn't even matter. Horny, in all his rage, blew up the boat with his uzi, ending his bandit problem. Reaching shore, Horny shoots pelicans in celebration. He made it to the West coast, though he lost his best friends. He will never forget that fateful Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.","October 21, 2014","true","32.8"," 183 of 193 people (95%) found this review helpful 111 people found this review funny","95","183","193","111","0"

On my first attempt, I was laughing the whole time, up until the point where my last dude was picked up by a tornado and gored by a flying buffalo. The humor is just incredibly over the top and ridiculous, and I recommend NOT watching any gameplay videos before playing, as to not spoil anything.\n\nThe game’s really short, but there’s plenty of replay value, so it can keep you busy for a few hours.

But as you experience each new scenario, the passion and care that went into creating this specific experience becomes more and more evident.\n\nThose visuals are supported by a soundtrack that is simply a joy to listen to.

I don't want to make it sound like a fact, but you will be hard-pressed to find someone who's played this game longer than I have, so for me to say that it still produces new scenes I've never experienced before, that's a stunning achievment.\n\nI won't go into detail about the finer points of controls, branching story-arc, the "meta" game or anything like that.  All I will say is that I've enjoyed playing the game for many years now, and the ability to rename the travelers is an instant trip to hilarity every time someone new dies.  For less than the cost of a decent sandwich, I've enjoyed over 100+ hours and many years of entertainment from SAWA and it continues to be a staple of my routine.\n\nI don't do numerical ratings, so take my review for what it is:  Two thumbs up.","April 12, 2015","true","152.4"," 72 of 77 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","72","77","12","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/recommended/250500/","coldfrog","coldfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/","386 products in account","Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a randomly generated sidescrolling shooter that banks on a couple things: goofiness, nostalgia (slightly) and not caring too much about shooter games.\n\nIf I was to judge it purely based on its mechanics, it's not much more than mediocre. The weapon options are nothing too special, and the enemies mainly rely on strength of numbers to add challenge. The boss fights that I've experienced so far were OK but no big deal.\n\nWhat really is entertaining is the silly nature of the entire endeavor. The game takes a lot of cues from Oregon Trail and basically makes fun of every option.\n\n"There is a river. [Tom] has the brilliant idea to jump over it. Or, you could try fording it."\n[Ford]\n[Jump]\n\nAnd then you can actually jump over the river if you want to.\n\nOther times you might be attacked by modern cars or "inner demons", and the text that accompanies almost every event is weird and goofy. And it works almost every time, and because the game is so quick to play (the game I won probably took between 5-10 minutes) and there are a lot of options, it hasn't yet gotten old.\n\nBut it probably will eventually. And when I'm tired of seeing a million buffalo charge at me for the hundredth time, then I'll probably stop because all it has left are the mechanics, which, as stated, really aren't much special.\n\nStill, it doesn't cost much, and it still plays much better than the far more tedious McPixel (I don't know why I feel the comparison is necessary - highly pixelated graphics and bite-size gameplay I guess, but nothing else much is in common so *shrug*) and I still foresee getting some quality time out of it, so I would recommend it!","August 1, 2014","true","2.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Simplistic, low-detail sprites represent your wagon, your party and anything else that may or may not want to kill you - and the former grossly outnumber the latter.\n\nEqually retro are the sound effects, with beeps and blops and a catchy MIDI-ish soundtrack.\n\nGameplay is like a sillier Oregon Trail - normally you control your wagon along a linear course, avoiding obstacles and shooting at things that (rarely don't) want to kill you. Your party has individual life bars and you lose once all of them are dead or missing. Events pop up after every gameplay section, ranging from shooting train robbers, to choosing between fording or jumping a river, to some rather spoiler-y occurences.\n\nThere's the main campaign mode, and progressing through it and beating certain challenges can unlock survival modes (last as long as possible in a gauntlet of enemies), shuffle modes (your starting settings are randomized from what I understand) and new wagons (which change your speed, party's health and firepower).\n\nIt's a small game and gets you a few laughs when you play short sessions of it, and it's probably in your best of interests not to take it too seriously, even if it does get a tad dark and difficult (especially difficult).","May 3","true","1.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

With random events this game can keep you occupied for a good amount of time. No flaws at the moment (That I have found anyway) Some events can be more hard than others but with determination you can survive. I am currently recording gameplay which will be out rather soon (At the time of writing this) so you can look it up if you wanna see gameplay. You can also have a party and name them after your friends like I did and watch 'em die in rather humerous deaths.

I absolutely recommend this game 100%.\n\nSuper Amazing Wagon Adventure is a game that made the YouTube rounds a while back and for very good reason.  It's one of those absurd hilarious games that just refuses to stop surprising you hour after hour.  It starts off as a pretty standard Oregon Trail inspired adventure as you customize your party, and pick a wagon.  Then after that first ten seconds I'm pretty sure the game takes a handful of shrooms and maybe coke right to the face and goes completely off the rails.  This game isn't trying to have a compelling narrative, it doesn't want to be IGN's game of the year, and it's not trying to tun the industry upside down with it's wicked angsty edginess.  No, SAWA is a game that just wants to be fun.  It wants to take you an adventure infused with pure randomness and heart of comedy gold.  You'll jump rivers and end up in space, you'll go looking for food and end up tripping balls, you'll be making your way across the plains and then fighting a Buffalo filled tornado.  A FREAKING BUFFANADO!\n\nVisuals- The atari style graphics are simple yet endearing, and the color is perfect for the cartoony feel.  It's not winning any awards but it's perfect for the game.\n\nReplayability- This game has it!  Not because this game offers new wagons and things to unlock, but because you just can't stop from wondering what could be next.\n\nSound-  Similar to the visuals, it's good but not mindblowing.  It's everything this game should be.\n\nGameplay_  The shooting can be a bit on the garbage side which is a shame.  You'll die a surprising amount, and what you die from will usually be even more surprising.  This game at points doesn't seem to follow any rules either.  I was once killed by a bear with no way to defend myself.  If this kind of thing bothers you, may be best to look else where.\n\n","August 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Great sense of humor, but the lack of any truly addictive qualities makes this game very easy to put down.  There is nothing wrong with it, really.  There is just not much terribly right with it.  Very neat little game, good for at least a few minutes of entertainment if arcadey is not your thing.\n\nextended:\nThis is more or less a series of extremely simple minigames strung together seemingly at random.  Most can be summarized as such: clumsily move around on the screen while dodging pixelated blobs and clicking to fire slow-moving bullets at such.  It can be amusing to see some of the situations described or depicted in the game, but the gameplay itself is lacking.  The controls are just clumsy enough that you never get into that addictive, edge-of-your-seat frenzy that the best arcade games can inspire.  Still, they are not so bad as to incite you to throw your peripherals at the monitor, and there is something to be said for character.\n\nIf there were an option for, "Maybe" instead of a simple yes or no, I would choose it.  That's a rare thing for me, because I am usually pretty opinionated about the games I play.  To put it in perspective, if I had paid $5 for this game instead of $2 on sale, I would feel extremely ripped off.  But for what I paid, I can appreciate the value.  Given all of this, I will err on the side of being positive and recommend the game.","January 15","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In addition, it has an exquisite challange factor, whilst managing to not feel punishing (or at least, leaving you a hope you won't get that particular encounter in the foreseeable future). It features unlockable wagons and music that accents the games lighthearted and pleasant qualities.\nAs for the actual gameplay itself, however, it is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up, when in the wagon, which is of course most of the time. Who ever went to Oregon on foot, that's silly and extremely dangerous.\nAt first glance, it's simplistic, not much challenge in it. But the rapidity of your movement, the size of your hitbox, and the sheer number and speed of hostile entities makes this game, for better or for w̶o̶r̶s̶e̶  better, a Bullet Curtain. Overall, highly recommended for its quick pace, delightful humour (and the utterly bizarre twists and turns that entails), and of course, its refreshing Roguelike and Shoot-'Em-Up elements. Enjoy!

Bandits, wild animals, zombies and mother nature are trying to stop you from reaching your goal.\nSo what do you do? Offense is the best defense, right? So just shoot everything!\nYour starting wagon gives you only a weak pistol, but you might find a lot of other weapons on your way, including shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas and even an airstrike!\nUnlock more wagons with better starting weapons, including the Diseased, which spreads disease! Or how about the Glitch, which shoots...stuff!\n\nMost of the time the game is a sidescrolling shooter. You man your wagon and fire away, but once in a while you'll have to leave your wagon and fight on foot and it's fun all the way.\nIt might be a bit unfair from time to time, depending on what scenes you end up in, but the game is rather short anyway, so just try again!

You should buy it.\n\nSlightly longer version: This game is merciless, unforgiving, and totally ruthless, just as an Oregon Trail homage should be. You are in a wagon and have a gun to shoot things. Sometimes you get out of the wagon to shoot things. If you are lucky you get medical recovery items and better guns, from shotguns to carpet-bombing airplanes. If you are not lucky, your three characters get horrible diseases and die to machine-gun-armed bandits and Civil War fights. More often than not, the latter will build up and have your journey end terribly.\n\nWhat keeps the game from getting overly frustrating (at least for me) is the humor. This game is hilarious, and it has everything from dinosaurs to satellites. The narration is fantastic, and it is worth playing for that alone. It's why I got the game, despite usually not being a fan of these types of games. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure was just too funny to skip.\n\nIt controls well, once you get the hang of it. I personally am terrible with keyboards for games, but from how it felt, I'm fairly certain a keyboard-savvy player will usually be perfectly fine. There are plenty of options as well, ranging from a number of wagons you can unlock to survival modes. With the numerous scenarios your playable party can get into, it has high replayability.\n\nThis game is $3 for a base price, and the witty narration is worth that alone. Add in the other great factors, such as the unlockables and tight controls, and you have a huge winner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go back to dying to buffalo.","June 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After a couple hours in solo queue, you begin to realize that the only reason why you found the hour long games (filled with failed Roshan steals and incoherent ♥♥♥♥♥) entertaining was because your friends were there. Once this realization occurs, the game morphs into a vice, an abusive figure who demands more and more from you by the hour.\nEach day not spent playing feels like a breath of fresh air, the first restful night after days of insomnia, etc. The game enervates you in so many ways without you even knowing it, through an insidious process that begins to set in after the thousandth hour of gameplay:\nPhysically, due to the missed meals and sedintary lifestyle it promotes.\nMentally, due to the wearing down of one's psyche that comes from the rising tension and pressure each game brings upon oneself.\nSpiritually, as your cheerful facade begins to crumble and you devolve into a flaming subhuman in order to better match the people that surround you.\nand finally Monetarily, as I must've spent like $200 on this game and when I sold my inventory I got back around twenty buckaroos.\n\nThat's not to say the game hasn't changed my life for the butter. ♥♥♥♥. Better.\nWe've done so much ♥♥♥♥ing around, touched the lives of so many confused pinoys and burgers, that I feel as though our legacy is something to be proud of.\nFrom ancient, antedilluvian memes like Helm of Iron Will on Jakiro to contemporary vorps like buying the enemy team a courier as Bounty Hunter, taking advantage of a glitch that allows you to coach the enemy team, and of course binding "SKROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" to a key and spamming it during teamfights.\nMy heart goes out to all the radical nigs I met while playing this game, regardless of whether or not I reported them:\nThe Spirit Breaker whom Pedro from Peru threatened to chainsaw the ♥♥♥♥ off of\nPCLA the Queen of Skywrath\nEvery victim of our double-cliffjungle strat, particularly the Undying who just couldn't take it any more\nThat one guy who played along and bought five Helm of the Dominators, winning the game with a mass of siege creeps\nNICE SET MIRANA\nDoppelganger-kun\nTheJimz (who was able to escape long before me)\nBizzaro stack/Two boots\nDavid & David II\nAnd of course, Rotk_playing\n\nIt really makes me wonder if this game will live on in my memory in like a decade. Will the specific games, like the 90-minute one where Austin went 1/30 as Earth Spirit fade into obscurity, to be replaced by only a fuzzy feeling of anguish? Or will this video game be one that I tell my kids of, a content smile on my face as I recant the day we came up with the word "vorp." Will I describe its role in my life as I see it right now; a vector that my friends and I used to kill time with each other, a buffer to spark the most wide-ranging conversations I've had in my life? The NEET version of meeting at the water cooler/skate park/convenience store to shoot the ♥♥♥♥?\nOr will I be plagued with phatoms of unwinnable matches, perpetual 5-game LPQs, and the sad fate of the Ka-Pusta-Krew? Will this game live in infamy, a chapter of my life I would rather die than relive, 1363 hours of some kind of Alighierian Hell?\nOnly time will tell.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this game. It will change you as a person, but be careful what you change into. For me, the change was positive, but I have watched many become monsters. The game itself is evil incarnate, but it is your choice if it will turn you evil as well.\n\nEDIT: JUST KIDDING, I STARTED PLAYING AGAIN IN THE SUMMER.

My brother and I left him, where we shortly thereafter battled a pirate ship in a small river that shot my brother with a cannonball. I managed to destroy the ship and continued onward, where I died in a large field of buffalo. Overall one of the single most hilarious five-minute singleplayer adventures I have ever had the pleasure of undertaking. 10/10","June 25, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very clearly based on games from the 80s. You have to get your wagon from point A to point B... and shot things along the way. There are cool powerups, interesting little random events that may help or harm your run, traders to buy things from, and multiple forks in the road to keep the game fresh and replayable. There are also different unlockable wagons to use, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and special quirks. There's not a whole lot more to say about the gameplay. It's mostly just automatically scrolling to the right as you move around the screen and shoot. It can be pretty easy or very hard depending on your choices and your luck. It's rather short, but highly replayable. I love the art style and the soundtrack is also pretty freakin' catchy. Plus the appropriate sound effects, of course. I really wish I could write a longer, more detailed review, but that's all there really is about it. It's fun, addictive, and only costs 3 bucks at full price. If you enjoy games you can complete in a sitting, this is great. And it keeps you coming back for more with the random events and different wagons. The only downside for this game is that... I wish there was more. More stuff in it. A longer trail. More events. Just... more everything. But I can't fault the game for any of that because what it DOES have is all great and makes for a wonderful experience that not many games aim to give you anymore. If you're thinking about it, just get it. You might not sink hundreds of hours into it, but the ones you DO put into it will all be worthwhile playtime, no filler.\n\nSuper Amazing Wagon Adventure gets an 8/10 for being a very fun little experience with lots of replayability and that throwback feeling.","January 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you enjoy games you can complete in a sitting, this is great. And it keeps you coming back for more with the random events and different wagons. The only downside for this game is that... I wish there was more. More stuff in it. A longer trail. More events. Just... more everything. But I can't fault the game for any of that because what it DOES have is all great and makes for a wonderful experience that not many games aim to give you anymore. If you're thinking about it, just get it. You might not sink hundreds of hours into it, but the ones you DO put into it will all be worthwhile playtime, no filler.\n\nSuper Amazing Wagon Adventure gets an 8/10 for being a very fun little experience with lots of replayability and that throwback feeling.","January 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's fast and doesn't really wants to tell a story, but is more for shooting. Shooting bandits, buffallos, deers, unicorns...\nIf you are not shooting, you will jump across rivers or walk on the ground of them.\nIt hasgreat visuals, nice music and is very addicting, so you are playing again and again, just to make it this time to the end (and you won't reach it).

This one is far more than just a re-hash of an old classic.  This game gives new meaning to the phrase "random event".  It really goes above and beyond to ensure you won't win.  From entering a den of angry bears, to battling your inner demons.  Anything can, and does, happen.  No two playthroughs are the same.  The game's aesthetics are retro to the point of exhaustion.  I don't mind this too much, but at times I can't figure out what's going on.\n\nIn short, the game works.\n\nThis game gets my Seal of Recomendation.  Pick it up, if not just for the sheer novelty of letting your friends be mauled to death by bears, and or unicorns.

THIS GAME HAS BROUGHT ME LOVE, HATE, THE RAT KID STORE, AND SO MUCH MORE. MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THESE KINDS OF VIDEO GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO NEVER GO OUTSIDE, NEVER SOCIALIZE, NEVER DO ANYTHING. I AM ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.\n\nBUT, THIS GAME GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY FIND CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE AND SPEAK WITH THEM. AND YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING: "WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?" BUT NO, THROUGH ACTUALLY BEING MYSELF WITH THE MIC AND TEXT IN THIS GAME, I'VE ACTUALLY MADE FRIENDS AND I'VE EVEN MET FEMALES WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!\n\nTHIS GAME HAS HELPED ME OVERCOME MY CRIPPLING SOCIAL ANXIETY, JUST A BIT. IT GAVE ME A SHRED, JUST A SHRED OF AGENCY. I CAN COMMAND MY TEAM TO GO DEEP INTO ENEMY LINES; I CAN BE A LEADER! A LEADER, SOMETHING I AM RARELY EVER IN MY LIFE. IT GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO SPEAK ON THE MIC WITH ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS, AND SOMETIMES HAVE CONVERSATIONS!\n\nTHE INTERACTIONS IN THE GAME ARE SOMETIMES PRICELESS, FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS PLAYING ALONE, 3A.M. AND I WAS PLAYING MEEPO, ALL THE LIGHTS OFF, COMFY ♥♥♥♥. THERE WAS THIS ONE MAN ON MY TEAM, HE WASN'T FROM THE AMERICAS, BUT HE SPOKE ENGLISH. AND, JUST THE WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK IN THIS GAME IS JUST, ♥♥♥♥ING CUTE. I LOVE IT. ANOTHER TIME, I WAS PLAYING ALONE AROUND THIS TIME AGAIN, AND MY TEAM WAS ALL COMMUNICATING AND ♥♥♥♥, AND THIS GUY JUST SAID: "ROGER THAT" I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT JUST FELT NICE. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. LIKE, WE WERE ALL WORKING SERIOUSLY, AND AS A TEAM.\n\nLOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR TEAMS ARE THE THING THAT ARE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO GAME. BUT, FROM MY EXPERIENCES, IN SOME GAMES. YOU HAVE A PERFECT TEAM, AND YOU ALL WORK IN UNISON, IT JUST FELT GREAT. AND REMEMBER, THIS WAS IN SOLO, ♥♥♥♥ING, QUEUE. PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS AND DOING ALL OF THIS, AND WORKING TOGETHER, COMPLETE FOCUS ON SOMETHING IS JUST ♥♥♥♥IN' GREAT. IT'S GREAT.\n\nDOIGN STUPID, GAY COMBOS WITH YOUR MATES IS GREAT TOO, OR DOING SOMEHTING ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, AND HAVING IT WORK IS BEAUTIFUL.\n\nTHIS GAME, TO ME IS A STEP TO BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL MEMBER OF SOCIETY. BUT, I FEEL THAT IT IS ALSO A WASTE OF FUKKING TIME. 4,300 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS TO MANAGE TO LEARN A BIT OF AGENCY AND BASIC ♥♥♥♥ING CONVERSATION SKILLS IS NOT WORTH IT.

Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is *not* fair though, so prepare to die. A lot. When there's more or less nothing you could do about it.\n\nYour hitbox is the entire wagon (large), but the area your default weapon can attack is one small line right ahead of you. You will get hit many, many times by enemies just above or just below this area charging toward you. Anyone who makes it to the Buffalo will know what I mean. There are other weapons, but there's no way to store or change them, so if you get something that could help you later you can prepare to fire it off about two minutes before you really need it.\n\nYour wagon has three passengers, among whom damage is "shared". Hits land not-really-randomly on your party members, often hitting and killing one person before the other two. It's possible to get hitpoints back but this happens on a purely random basis, and consists of either events that may or may not happen or medkit pickups you may not be able to reach. The frustration that comes when you find a rare event only to realize it's your 1-HP guy instead of your 4-HP guy that you have to try to finish it with... agonizing.\n\nThere's some laughs to be had here; I thought it was hilarious when I had the option to either ford a river or jump over it, and then later either go around or swim under the river. There's also a ton of content and different paths your adventure might take; I was still finding new ones until I finally quit playing.\n\nIt's a shame I'm not going to see the end of the game though because I cannot put up with these deaths that I have no real control over. If the hitbox on the wagon was a lot smaller and my gun could aim a little I'd probably play the hell out of this game. Sadly, I'm sick of it and going to see if I can get a refund.","May 12","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It feels just like it lacks a lot in gameplay, as things are just greatly difficult to accomplish and in the beginning you just depend on your luck if you want to get far.\nIt's biggest sale point, the randomness of events is... not really that big. Yes, there is a variety of things that can happen to you, but it seems to like there isn't really that much variety.\nYou always follow a specific basic path, which then has several options of what could happen to you. Sometimes, you can make the decision, like jumping or fording a river, which basically means having the chance for a random event, like having to dodge bees or asteroids. The other decision will have you... dodge... boulders.\nIf you play it and then die and play it again, you will soon realize that there isn't really that much variety in what will happen to you. And, because the game sometimes just throws undodgeable obstacles in your way, faster than a human being could possibly react to, dying will happen to you a lot.\nAlso you seem to be very limited in what you can do. The weapons, which the game will not really let you choose to fire it or conserve it, always have very limited ammo. You have, if you coun't all the party members, 12 points of health, from which the game sometimes RANDOMLY decides to take a quarter away. You either heal from (quickly appearing) health pickups or from random events.\nThe game has a real good soundtrack though, and the design is mostly nice to look at, the sound effects also appear to be fitting and they don't get annoying.\nThe text "scrolling", which is not in your hand, even on the fastest setting, was still too slow for me. Why not let me decide when to skip the text?\n\nIn conclusion, the game has some sort of variety and the random events are funny at first, but they get old quickly. The gameplay doesn't have much variety, where I would really have appreciated to put more effort in. It doesn't cost a lot, so it doesn't really hurt to try it out, but I for myself, did not pull a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\n","November 29, 2013","false","2.9"," 33 of 86 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","33","86","0","0"

However, since I bought Half-Life on Steam during a sale for $1.99, I think I am entitled to complain.\n\nThis game is something you would normally see on a flash games website, good for maybe a half-hour of entertainment before it gets boring.  To make matters worse, all of the wagons need to be unlocked through achievements save for the default one.  It also provides little real challenge other than twitch response in terms of gameplay.  The gameplay consists of being flashed a "random" message, then being thrown into a scenario that usually involves shooting animals, people, or dodging obstacles.  However, after a half-hour of play, I was seeing the same events every other run.  It turns out that the game isn't procedurally generated in the traditional sense, other than the random location of enemy spawns.  There are certain events that are fixed, such as crossing rivers, where the player is presented with a choice on how to do so.  However, most events that have a chance occur are linked to other events that is required to immediately follow, such as burning buffalo during a prairie fire only happens if there was a prarie fire, which only happens if there was a herd of buffalo, which happens every time upon entering the Great Plains level.  So there is actually not much variety in gameplay, since the event generation seems to only be based on two possible outcomes, often y/n, if a --> b ?, or based on player choice.\n\nBut I would forgive all of this, even LOVE IT, if the game was just fun to play past the 1 hour mark.  But instead, it becomes a tedious and annoying mess of screen ghosting after that.  Save your ten bucks for something worthwhile.","June 26, 2014","false","5.1"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","8","37","0","0"

You make no decisions at all really. It's pretty difficult. My whole group died quick the first time, which is fine as I started to get the feel for the game.

But it would be a million times better if i could unlock shuffle which i cant due to certain impossible events","June 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 26 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","2","26","0","0"

What I didn't expect was extremely repetitive gameplay.\n\nI also very soon learned to loath the text screens that are always popping up. Unless I am missing something, there is no way to quickly dismiss these text screens, even after you have seen them many, many times. You can slightly adjust how long they remain on screen.

Essentially you are thrown into a variety of bizzare scenarios where you shoot and dodge stuff for about 30 seconds or less, and then there's a short transition and you're suddenly somewhere else shooting and/or dodging other stuff. For example, you might be crossing a river dodging boulders, and then you'll make it across the river and into the prairie where you'll gun down some buffalo. The general order of events never changes (forest-->river-->plains-->desert/second river-->mountain-->freefall-->rapids/present day) but there are special random events that can occur, including everything from unicorns to time travel to pirates, many of which will unlock new wagons.\n\nSAWA is really fun, but also difficult. I've only completed it once, and I had to use the invisible wagon, which has a super tiny hitbox. Thankfully it has a good sense of humor and charming visuals and music to ease the pain of my many, many deaths.\n\n8/10 Would  BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO buy again","May 29, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has one of the best soundtracks for a videogame if not the best. Also if you hate everything about life or something along those lines you can turn it off.\n\n3.

And it's not the kind of game that you have to warm up to either; I can just pick it up, play through an adventure, and leave if need be.\n\nPersonally, I like unlocking things. Even if I don't put it to frequent use, unlockables are very similar to accomplishments for me, so naturally I never get tired of SAWA. The numerous unlockables aren't just for keeping you engrossed in the game; they make you go for certain events that you may not have chosen otherwise (I'm talking about the rivers here). I personally don't like going into the desert with the snakes, scorpians, and vultures, but when I saw the locked Survival mode, I figured I'd go to try and unlock it. Because of this, I encountered new events that I never would've seen without the motivation to go back to that desert. Now I like alternating between different areas to see what kind of new or unlikely events I can trigger!\n\nThis isn't intended to be a hardcore game, but there are those kind of challenges for the people that always aim for the gold in video games. You know what kind of challenges I mean, and SAWA has them, namely the Random wagon, where you have to make it 50 days in Shuffle without dying. For those who haven't played Shuffle mode, it's a hard challenge. Take it from me.\n\nSAWA is great for gamers of all types: casual, hardcore, completionists, you name it. I definitely recommend this game, even if it's for an hour.","September 11, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It alternates between a side scroller (when you're in the wagon) and being able to wander around on the screen to acomplish a task (on foot)  Most of the time you're going to be trying to avoid death by shooting various enemies with an assortment of weapons.  But you don't get this game for the gameplay you get it for the story.  While you will figure out the general format after a bit of playing the game will still continue to through curve balls at you.  This game will kill you and your other 2 friends  in ways you never expected such as unicorn magic, UFOs, and your inner demons to name a few.  Be prepared to die a lot.  My only complaint is that there is no mouse sensitivity adjustment, so in game my mouse is has very low sensitivity which is annoying.  Fortunatly the game can be played with only a keybord and doesn't require a mouse.\n\n9.6/10","June 23, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No.\nIs it fun? For a while.\nIs it hard? Artificially, yes. (Undodgeable objects, inability to heal outside of random chance, random drops in health via disease.)\nIs it roguelike? Partially. There are random events but only a select few that always occur at the same positions. Example is at the beginning you either get ambushed by Unicorns and fight a dragon or you get ambushed by bandits and fight a machine gun cart.\nIs this game entertaining? For a while, then it gets infuriatingly repetitive and boring as you never quite reach the end due to dumb luck. It would also be nice if the other carts weren't god awful or impossible to unlock. Reward players, don't cripple them when the odds are already stacked against them.\n\nEDIT: One really great thing about this game is the soundtrack. Even if the game is repetitive the soundtrack is enjoyable every time. The Great Plains music reminds me of the early days of Ninja Sex Party. Also the soundtrack is in the games files with remixes not in the game, so drop it into your music player of choice if you want to listen on the go.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Only on a sale. It is fun and it's a goofy game to introduce to friends. But it's basically a Newgrounds Flash Game, probably won't entertain past an 30min, an hour tops. $3 isn't bad but I've gotten better for free.","June 26, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's not the kind of game that you have to warm up to either; I can just pick it up, play through an adventure, and leave if need be.\n\nPersonally, I like unlocking things. Even if I don't put it to frequent use, unlockables are very similar to accomplishments for me, so naturally I never get tired of SAWA. The numerous unlockables aren't just for keeping you engrossed in the game; they make you go for certain events that you may not have chosen otherwise (I'm talking about the rivers here). I personally don't like going into the desert with the snakes, scorpians, and vultures, but when I saw the locked Survival mode, I figured I'd go to try and unlock it. Because of this, I encountered new events that I never would've seen without the motivation to go back to that desert. Now I like alternating between different areas to see what kind of new or unlikely events I can trigger!\n\nThis isn't intended to be a hardcore game, but there are those kind of challenges for the people that always aim for the gold in video games. You know what kind of challenges I mean, and SAWA has them, namely the Random wagon, where you have to make it 50 days in Shuffle without dying. For those who haven't played Shuffle mode, it's a hard challenge. Take it from me.\n\nSAWA is great for gamers of all types: casual, hardcore, completionists, you name it. I definitely recommend this game, even if it's for an hour.","September 11, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially you are thrown into a variety of bizzare scenarios where you shoot and dodge stuff for about 30 seconds or less, and then there's a short transition and you're suddenly somewhere else shooting and/or dodging other stuff. For example, you might be crossing a river dodging boulders, and then you'll make it across the river and into the prairie where you'll gun down some buffalo. The general order of events never changes (forest-->river-->plains-->desert/second river-->mountain-->freefall-->rapids/present day) but there are special random events that can occur, including everything from unicorns to time travel to pirates, many of which will unlock new wagons.\n\nSAWA is really fun, but also difficult. I've only completed it once, and I had to use the invisible wagon, which has a super tiny hitbox. Thankfully it has a good sense of humor and charming visuals and music to ease the pain of my many, many deaths.\n\n8/10 Would  BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO buy again","May 29, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, somehow he and LD had survived, they looked around them, blood and horns everywhere...to Sgt.Bigdick it was beautiful revenge, but to LD it seemed as though Sgt. had gone mad. They were on their merry way when suddenly, bandits. LD picked up a bow and was able to shoot a few before he ran out of arrows. Sgt.Bigdick pulls out his trusty pistol that never runs out of ammo for some reason, but now was not the time to question it. He was able to pick off 5 bandits before a machine gun bandit came in and shot Sgt.Bigdick within an inch of his life, the group found a rocket launcher aimed and blew up the machine gun bandit. The party comes across a river, Sgt.Bigdick obviously suffering from blood loss has the idea to jump it before fading out of consciousness. LD had the significantly better idea to ford the river, at first all was fine then...the boulders...so many boulders. Sgt. woke up just in time to be crushed by a boulder. LD was in tears as he finally made it across the river. Just as he thought nothing could be worse than losing his superior officer...a herd of buffalo appear. LD finds a flamethrower and roasts all of the buffalo without sustaining a scratch. But then, BUFFALO..."no"LD whispers...BUFFALO...BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO. LD goes down in a blaze of glory fighting till he couldn't bear to go on at one health left he sees an on-coming buffalo, this was it, this was the end. He had lost all of his friends, it was time...LD drove the wagon ox first into the buffalo and was immediately trampled to death.

Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is basically a shoot 'em up / bullet hell type of game that starts very slowly and that adds more and more and more elements to the mix until you can't take it, putting you in situations where you must dodge rabid bears while shooting at bandits while steering your wagon through flaming tumbleweeds. The gameplay is very simple, but the developers really nailed the difficulty right, which forces you to constantly stay on your toes and expect the worst possible outcome. Random elements and choices leading to several possible outcomes ensure a different playthrough almost everytime you try to clear the game and there are several fun unlockables for completionists.\n\nCome for the price tag, stay for the hilarity, and make sure all your friends get to try it as you watch.","June 14, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/recommended/250500/","FirstUtterance","FirstUtterance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/","571 products in account","This is the kind of game that makes me question if I should continue to bother with video games or not. Am I just wasting my time? Are these games that've been hyped to heaven with almost no backlash just bald-faced lies spitting in my face? I have come to this point after wasting so much of my life, throwing myself over 20 hours closer to my death, playing this repetitive, poorly balanced, poorly made-in-general piece of ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Yes, I despise this game. I have finally come to terms with that conclusion. I tried giving it one more chance after my first (also negative) review that's now deleted, unlocked a few more wagons and modes, but nothing changed for me except the growing hatred for this game, my grown distrust for popular consensus and for sources of game coverage I thought were reliable, and the weariness this has brought upon my life in general. I really, really hate this game.\n\nOK to start: what it looks like: an absurdist, tongue-in-cheek parody of Oregon Trail (obviously), like the video game equivalent of a Mel Brooks or an old Zucker/Abrahams movie. And that description is accurate to some extent. This is a game full of zany, random occurrences, ridiculous humor, and gameplay that, to put it one way, bears little resemblance to the original Oregon Trail. This is all just window dressing though. Strip it aside and what you have instead is a really awful vertical shmup mixed in with awful twin-stick shooter segments with a factor of randomization added to try to give it variation but they bungled it up so badly that it makes already badly done mechanics more frustrating.\n\nIf there is a singular goal in this game, it's to unlock all the wagons, since doing so requires accomplishing pretty much every possible task in the game. One wagon requires you not only unlock all five levels in survival mode, but get three full stars in all of them (which means surviving three or more minutes), another requires unlocking "shuffle mode" where you must survive as many randomly ordered scenes from the main game in a row (to get the wagon you need to survive 50), and unlocking the final wagon means completing the main adventure with ALL the wagons. Most of the wagons are unlocked by stumbling upon and surviving random scenarios, some rarer than others, in the game.\n\nThe main adventure allows you to ride a wagon with three attendants, which you can customize to some degree by gender, hair style, hair color, manner and color of dress, skin color, eyes, and facial hair (reserved for the men only). This is probably the most fun part of the game, not that it's necessarily interesting in itself, even if it is amusing, but because it's the one and only thing in this game that doesn't cause immense suffering. Then you pick your wagon which you only have one to start with and, if I'm being perfectly honest, is probably better than the majority of wagons I've tried so far. It sucks, but it sucks less so than some of the other crap you get. Now the concepts for the wagons sound fun but actually playing with them? No. The magic wagon has probably the worst default weapon of everything in the game, firing spread "magic" shots in wide angles, too wide actually, and disintegrates things when it kill them meaning you can't collect precious animal hides with it (better get a power-up!), and it fires slowly at that. The invisible wagon starts you off with 1 health for everyone, no joke, as a compromise for how small and easily maneuverable it is. If you survive the first areas and can grab full health for everyone it's great, otherwise, good luck. The space shuttle starts you all off with TWO health, has an even larger hit box than the other wagons (which are too big as it is, making the NES Silver Surfer's seem like a pixel by comparison), has only the same regular attack as the main wagon, and is faster, meaning, harder to control when you're faced by a barrage of enemies and herds of buffalo who will most assuredly kill you much faster. I could go on about how annoying and unfun some other wagons are but really it's the game itself that's out to get you more than the crappiness of your wagons (though that doesn't help).\n\nOK like I said the game is randomized, but not to the extent a roguelike or even some roguelites would take it. It's more like a Tower of Guns roguelite where there is a small amount of randomization but with mostly clear-cut, set paths, level designs and so forth, the difference being that Tower of Guns was actually not a terrible game (I gave up on some of its frustrating challenges eventually but for the most part had a good time with it). The game begins the same way every single time - you kill animals for fur, run into some bandits, seek either wild berries (or if the game wants to ♥♥♥♥ you over, shrooms, though surviving that once does unlock a wagon - but after that, it grows tiresome), then you come to a river crossing, where you can either jump or ford it. Most of the wagons are too slow, clunky and big to bother fording, so I always jumped (which sometimes landed me in the river anyway, getting me hit by boulders coming downriver). There is one set of boulders where you must wait for them to come down, with a space opening up to go through but I swear unless you have a fast-moving wagon this is literally impossible to get through without getting hit. And it goes on and on and on. The game itself is not that long, but you will be assuredly killed repeatedly due to the crappiness of the mechanics and the random events which will screw you over big time.\n\nSometimes the game asks if you want to investigate something, like distant gunfire (which is either a bank or train robbery), but a lot of times it forces you into situations that you don't want to go into. Like, no, I don't want to save the injured falcon or get the poison gun for the billionth time, especially if I'm at the brink of death and have a perfectly capable gun already at my disposal. But it will anyway and you have no choice but to go along with it. Some situations you may as well quit your game since you will get bent if you encounter them. Like having to travel to a distant trader for a new wheel with the falcon with coyotes all over you. These segments are long and the falcon really sucks at taking down large numbers of fast-moving enemies at once. Then you die and you must repeat the process with one of the other surviving characters and you die again. And if you're forced to meet a woman in a red dress and she turns into a bandit, just... quit right there. After that you will be assaulted by bandits you have no chance of winning against. Oh, and buffalo. I don't know how you're supposed to survive the large herds of buffalo with a large wagon without a decent weapon, and if your characters (idiotically) decide they're "bored" and speed through the herd, you're dead, and frankly they deserve it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid as to speed through buffalo to be trampled to death by them and your poorly handled vehicle. Oh yeah there are "twin stick" segments where you might be alone on foot and fight enemies without your wagon or compadres. Your hitbox is more reasonable, but movement never felt "right" nor did the mouse aiming. There are too many fast-moving, tiny enemies hard to hit with your puny weapons with you being too slow to outrun them and eventually you'll be circled and killed. That's actually more a complaint of the survival mode than of the main game but it can happen.\n\nBut no matter where you die, whether by buffalo, by wolves on a mountain, or river boulders, the game always feels so inanely repetitive. You will encounter every scenario, of which there are very few, so many times trying to complete the game with one of your many crappy wagons and failing that it becomes a mentally numbing experience. I don't want to hunt more wildlife, bandits, berries, or choose to cross or ford rivers ever again. This is sheer endurance, not fun.","June 9, 2015","false","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though it says that it feels like a new adventure everytime and that its randomized it felt repetitive to me like i was doing the same stuff over and over again which is why i only enjoyed for a couple of minutes before i started getting bored of it. other than that the game is awesome with tight controls and nice 8-bit graphics that really make it i would buy it if its on sale if not save your money and get something else.\n\n"Future me" ok ok i have put in a good hour or so of this game and holy crap its adicting ok in the first part of the review i was knocking it but this game if funny with all the random crap it make you do cant stop but laugh every playthrough though it does feel repetitive sometimes i still enjoy it buy this game if its on sale like i said befor its not worth the full price but on discount yes :D 10/10","June 26, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No.\nIs it fun? For a while.\nIs it hard? Artificially, yes. (Undodgeable objects, inability to heal outside of random chance, random drops in health via disease.)\nIs it roguelike? Partially. There are random events but only a select few that always occur at the same positions. Example is at the beginning you either get ambushed by Unicorns and fight a dragon or you get ambushed by bandits and fight a machine gun cart.\nIs this game entertaining? For a while, then it gets infuriatingly repetitive and boring as you never quite reach the end due to dumb luck. It would also be nice if the other carts weren't god awful or impossible to unlock. Reward players, don't cripple them when the odds are already stacked against them.\n\nEDIT: One really great thing about this game is the soundtrack. Even if the game is repetitive the soundtrack is enjoyable every time. The Great Plains music reminds me of the early days of Ninja Sex Party. Also the soundtrack is in the games files with remixes not in the game, so drop it into your music player of choice if you want to listen on the go.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Only on a sale. It is fun and it's a goofy game to introduce to friends. But it's basically a Newgrounds Flash Game, probably won't entertain past an 30min, an hour tops. $3 isn't bad but I've gotten better for free.","June 26, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some other reason why this game is amazing:\n\n1. The events are (semi)random so you get something different every time.\n\n*2. The soundtrack is AMAZING. This game has one of the best soundtracks for a videogame if not the best. Also if you hate everything about life or something along those lines you can turn it off.\n\n3. The game has curves around the edge and lines going across the screen so it lookes like an old tv. I think this is really cool but it can be turned off. I also like the pixel art style.\n\n4. The game is funny.\n\n5. BUFFALO\n\n6. There are power ups to collect and wagons to unlock.\n\n7. There is a survival and shuffle mode\n\n8. You can name and customize your party\n\nThe only downside to this game is the price. THREE DOLLARS!!! I don't have that kind of money! You might want to wait for a sale like me because I got it for only two dollars!!!

The amazing, original soundtrack tickles your eadrums while hilarious visuals keep you entertained throughout the entire game. I've never laughed so hard at an 8-bit game since...Well, ever! Almost every single aspect of Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is either pitch-perfect or incredibly innovative. Props to sparsevector for making a hilarious experience that shouldn't be missed. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure's only flaw is it's incredible difficulty. Although this may be frustrating at times, it's very easy to overlook, considering how much this game does right. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is an example of what 8-bit titles nowadays should be, and that is why I'm giving Super Amazing Wagon Adventure a 9 out of 10, just shy of a masterpiece. What just makes this game even better is the fact that it's only 3$. So, go buy this game or die at the hands of a little rabid squirrel.","March 1, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
