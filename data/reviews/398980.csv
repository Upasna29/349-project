"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/398980/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Before we get into the details I'd like to point out that this isn't really a game. It's a visual novel in the purest of senses. The experience is all reading with cute artwork to go with it, there are no choices to be made. If this idea turns you off then move along, however you'd be missing a great story.\n\nWithout Within 2 follows the story of Vinty, a struggling calligrapher. We met her in the first installment, which isn't required to understand this game but it's free and short so go enjoy that one as well, but this game continues her story as she follows her dreams. This time she has a grant to go to Melbourne Australia for a calligraphy event so we follow her adventure there. The story also involves Excelia, her idol, who Vinty gets to meet and actually get to know.\n\nThe story is well written and interesting, however, it reads more like a love letter to Melbourne than a story about Vinty. The most interesting moments are when things happen to Vinty or she interacts with someone. Like when she eats sausage and likens it to dog poo. There is still pop culture humor but it pops less frequently than the first game. Also, the ending was a nice twist. Vinty is a fun character and though I don't know much about the world of calligraphy it's nice to learn about it through her.\n\nThe artwork is good as well as the soundtrack, it all lends to a relaxing experience. You can put the text on auto then sit back and read everything as you nibble on a snack or eat dinner like I did. The game also offers trading cards and very easy to obtain achievements which are always positives.\n\nThere were points that I wish the story was interactive but the story was good the way it was so I didn't mind. For the price of a paperback book you could do a lot worse, though grabbing it on sale would be best. This would also be a great title to share with younger gamers.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","November 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/398980/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: As a pleasant and casual visual novel, it's the cheapest trip to Melbourne you can get.\n\nI rarely review visual novels (abbr. VN) so bear with me. I liked the first game (free-to-play at that) so I wanted to see what direction the second one would take. I'll be spoiler-free about this as far as possible.\n\nLet's start with the obvious, the visuals. The art style and music is clear and pleasant for both eyes and ears. Many scenes are animated to show off the life of the city. The English language (as I can't read Chinese) is excellent with virtually no mistakes or any reason for pet peeve.\n\nStory time!\nContinuing the story from the first game, Vinty the protagonist is a wannabe calligraphist. She's poor and absent-minded and gets into trouble because of that. Nice for her, she gets the fortune of visiting a fair of calligraphists in Melbourne.\n\nFunny enough, about half of the VN is about describing the trip, from plane rides to some small-time tourism. As a nice touch these are coupled (but not embedded) with YouTube videos (over 20 of them), specifically made for the game. This makes Without Within 2 effectively the cheapest trip to Melbourne one could buy up here in the northern hemisphere, or perhaps more fittingly a travel journal of more effort than usual. Consequently, it's also presented with a plot.\n\nStory time! ...part 2\nIn addition to praising Melbourne there's Vinty awkwardly trying to appeal to her idol Excelia, the famous calligrapher. This time around the novel is totally linear with no choices for alternate story lines given: you can just relax and follow the story to its end. It's a simple and perhaps familiar storyline but it works.\n\nWhile awkward in action, Vinty stays a thoughtful personality throughout the game, shamelessly grumping about her problems and celebrating her little victories at everyday life to the reader. It's a neat way to bring her to life as a vibrant, living person and immerse yourself into the story. That's where this VN shines - it really feels like you were on the trip as well.\n\nConclusions\nI usually want to find something bad to say about everything for completeness, but there's little to complain about Without Within 2. Perhaps it's a bit short with just some 2.5 hours of reading and video watching, give or take. The videos are not embedded so you got to have a browser and your connection ready for that additional immersion. Also, those 2.5 hours were not quite enough to get all the card drops.\n\nIf I were mean I would remark there was quite a lot of filler with all travel and praise about how great Melbourne is (like I ever had the money to go there). However, it does serve as a pleasing way in building the atmosphere so I'll let it slide.\n\nHaving liked Vinty's story in part 1 I would wager you liked this one as well, sale (like me) or even without.","January 5","true","5.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","11","12","4","0"

To see this wonderful little visual novel continued from where it left off.\n\nStory Breakdown: We return to pick up where we left Vinty, our protagonist and set out on a journey to Melbourne, Australia, (Close to home, yay!), thanks to a grant, she's able to travel and afford a two night stay in the big city to show off her calligraphy among a whole heap of other aspiring artists and her idol, Elxcelia.\n\nWhen on her flight, a bathroom break makes her scuttle through first class and note a whole heap of people trying to fit under a seat to retrieve someone’s glasses.. Conveniently, Vinty is small enough to upstage all the bodyguards there, only to have the glasses snatched from her hand with no praise and given to what seems to be a pop-star and she realises just who it is.\nIt is of course, Elxcelia.\n\nVinty goes for her bathroom break with a huff and comes back out to her idol summoning her over to accompany her for a while, and shouts her a meal in thanks/apology for how her bodyguards treated her. They exchange a few words before, after and during there meal and our protagonist goes back to her seat, preparing herself for the rest of the trip, still rather gobsmacked about having met the famed individual. After all, she is only human, too.\n\nGraphics: Just like the first Without Within, the art holds the adorable quaintness of it. Introducing a few more moving images, and bishy sparkles everywhere. I'm already rather fond of art styles like this, so it's an extra little reward for me for this keeping it.\n\nSoundtrack: As with the first, it fits into the quaint feel of the novel and really ties it together nicely. It's worth getting to have it playing in the background as you work on something.\n\nMenu: Blocky and chunky but in a really nice and satisfying way. It's simple and quaint like the novel itself making it a pleasure to use.\n\nFinal Conclusion: It's wonderful, it's adorable and much longer than the first Without Within which was free. The content you pay for in this one is by far worth it and following the story is also worth it. It's brought together really nicely, shows a lot of work and effort and just has really relatable or lovable characters.\n\nWhile Elxcelia's fall felt a tiny bit rushed, it honestly makes up for it with the development of our characters coming up to speed at a really nice pace.","November 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It follows up on the short story experienced in the first Without Within and takes Vinty (the protagonist) on a journey to Melbourne.\n\nThe story has lots of small fun moments and great drawings. Something I really love about this game in particular is something that a lot of other VNs miss, animated backgrounds!\nThank you InvertMouse for making animated backgrounds!\n\nAlso this game neatly features many small youtube clips of Melbourne town, all around 0.5 ~ 1 minute each.\n\nAll in all the story is great and a fun read. Took me a little longer than most people but I also watched all the small videos :D\n\nWould recommend this game any day, but it is a little short for the price you might say. It took me around 2 hours to complete the game and I personally feel like it was worth the money (bought it on sale on the day of release, so it was only €4.) At the standard price of €5 this game is about €2.5 gameplay an hour. If you want more than that out of the game I would recommend buying it on sale.","November 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

On the plane Vinty even manages to meet her idol, but will she actually be more successfull by going after her idol?\n\nApart from the story there´s to mention the great way Melbourne is pictured through several small videos the creator made by himself. Also there´s a ton of references and jokes about the first game that were really funny.\n\nJust like before Vinty has all the features that made me love the first game and especially the kind of character she is. She still has her sharp tongue when it comes to other people, although that parts is mostly covered with her thoughts it´s always really funny and a pleasure to read. Vinty is still easily depressed and quite cute and hilarious while being like this. And of course she still doesn´t open her eyes^^ In my opinion this is what builds her character and makes her this likeable.\nIt bothered me, at first, that she was chasing after Excelia that much. There are a lot of moments when she is thinking about how her idol would have managed the situation from a momet ago and such. So I just thought: Why would she give up on the lovely character she is just for the sake of success?!\nBut she isn´t. While thinking about how others would have handled the problems, she is encountering constantly, Vinty always manages to do things in her own way.\n\nWhile the story doesn´t seem THAT big, I think it´s more about the message that is delivered to us. You can always go after others and their ways of doing things, but what matters is just being yourself. And that´s the thing Vinty always does best. She has her ups and downs, good moments and bad moments, but regardless of what is happening she doesn´t change who she is and how she feels for anyone.\n\nAs I already liked the first game a lot, Without Within 2 just leaves it behind in every aspect. The story is a lot bigger, has another really relateable and important message, funny and serious moments and more Vinty! All in all a great game/VN. If you think the price is too much for 2h of this awesome experience I would recommend getting it on sale, but get it^^","November 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time, we will travel to Melbourne, Australia, in order to meet our idol and learn to be a professional artist. The plot in the end is a bit surprising, but I think the goal was achieved. Lets see it in detail.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Classic visual novel\n+ Chapter timing and animations\n+ Real world footages\n- Sometimes videos were too often\n\nInvertmouse made a good progress and learnt from his mistakes, that occured in the first title of this series. Visual novel stylisation and chapter timing was great. Also, Vinty's comments were hilarious. I was really surprised, when I saw real Melbourne footages, it is something that draws a player into the game. But it has to be used cautiously, too often may disrupt the player's mood.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Vinty\n+ Excelia\n+ Grace\no Other were just an episodic character\n\nVinty's comments and jokes were mentioned in the previous section. I like "the eyes joke" and how she was a little bit under- or overestimating situation. Excelia started as a proud and cocky star, but both characters learnt something. Excelia, that the fame is fragile and Vinty, her biggest talent is hidden within her heart.\n\nI loved also Grace, she is the type of character, that may change the world, by pushing other persons in the right way. Brilliant. Other characters made just an episodic appearance, which was expected and not bad at all.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Same as Without Within 1\n\nI have to say, there were no glitches, drawing and anime style were cute and bright.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ More lively songs\n\nCompared to the predecessor, this title has more song, that are fitting in the story perfectly. Good work!\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI am pleased, that even independent developers are able to create deep, funny and original game with surprising elements. The saying "less is sometimes more" pays here for one hundred percent. For the price is this game perfect and a must for every visual novel collector.\n\nStrongly recommended.","January 27","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art is fantastic, and Vinty is a great character. I get a sort of Watamote esc feeling from the story of her and her failure, though unlike Tomoko, Vinty isn't a trash human being. It would be pretty fun to see even more Without Within, though this feels like a conclusion. I'd say its worth the asking price, and worth the time to check it out, as it is a pretty short read.

I didn't laugh, but I thought it was fun a little bit. Beside those, there was no interesting writing I found.\nI don't know this game is designed whether to provide good readings or a virtual city tour.\nApproximatly 3/4 of 20,000 words are used just to explain how Vinty moved from this place to that place.\nJust not interesting.\n\nAbout DLC: OST was reasonably priced. More tracks included than the WOWI 1. That was good. But I disappointed about the digital artbook, again. If it claims itself to be a digital artbook, it should show some of the original pictures, other than showing the same thing from the game. I can go take a screenshots on the game gallery for the exact same thing. Author's commentaries were the only thing orignal, and I don't think that worth whole three dollars.\n\nWell, the vids of city IRL was good. Really good for the price. I can't imagine how much effort the author made to take those. But... this is a visual novel above all those things. The story told through the text should be the first thing considered in a these kind of thing. Really.\n\nI hope the sequal would be better than this one, if it will be made.","February 1","false","6.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/recommended/398980/","Lyonesse","Lyonesse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/","202 products in account","Without Within 2 is a really short Visual Novel about Vinty, a girl who dreams to be recognized as a great calligrapher one day. Vinty is has a lovely personality. She's........ real. Unperfect, full of failures, has a lot of bad luck and she's really sarcastic and funny. In this sequel of Without Within, she'll visit Melbourne to an calligrapher event, in hopes of meeting her calligraphy idol, Excelia, and learn with her.\n\nEven though the game didn't get me, I feel sad for giving Without Within 2 a negative review because I really think that the developer put a lot of effort and creativity in this, especially in making the YouTube videos to make our Melbourne experience more realistic.\n\nSadly, aside to Vinty funny jokes and the gorgeous videos, this game lacks a deeper plot and can't be considered a must play Visual Novel. It's fun, a bit silly but nothing special after all.","April 20","false","3.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Its all great.\n\nThe problem is that this is too short, I played £3.19, some will pay £4 and i got 2 hours of readability from the 16000 odd words present here. I want to like it considering how much I have enjoyed the past content from InvertMouse but this just isnt enough for me. I felt as if it should have gone on for longer no matter the topic ultimately the length of this visual novel in my opinion isnt good enough and the ending isnt explosive enough for me to for example think about it for the next week or so.\n\nAll of the content in this game is top quality you just need more of it. Ill certainly look forward to future titles.","November 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","0"
