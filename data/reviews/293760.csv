Everything is explained with the best tutorials for any game, ever. Twiddling all the knobs and pushing all the buttons is fascinating and the well designed scenarios really mix it up well. Actually, everything in this game is well designed which is a rare treat.\n\nMajor kudos to the devs and if they model the big bad world of fickle customers, predatory competitors (like me), gullible investors (hehehe) and irrational governments as well as they model fuel injection systems this will be an amazing game. Potentially 'all time classic' level amazing and I don't say that lightly.\n\nOne warning, the minimum requirement to enjoy this game is some sense of curiosity, otherwise you may find yourself searching for the fire button.\n\nWould I recommend this game to a friend? Heck yes.","March 15, 2015","true","44.0"," 86 of 92 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","86","92","3","1"

The way things are set up (so far) are very easy to learn, and work well. The creation system is basically broken down into a series of many choices, with explanations for the impacts of your choices when the option is moused over. The fluidity of the system thus far only makes me more anxious to play the finished product.\n\nNow, to the point. I do not recommend this game to anyone, as it currently exists. I have been burned quite a few times by early access games, and I usually take a stance of not buying them under any circumstances. My excitement for this concept got the better of me, and I just had to know if it was good.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, the tycoon/campaign mode has not been implemented. All you can do is create cars/engines etc. It is entertaining for a little while, but not enough to be worth the price. That is why I don't recommend this. I do recommend that you keep a very close eye on this one, if this concept interests you, and consider buying it when the tycoon mode has been added.\n\nIf the devs do this right, this could be an absolutely amazing game. My advice is simply to wait and see how they do with the first major addition to this game.\n\nI will update/change this review as updates are released for the game.\n\nEDIT (23 June 2015): I just hopped on again to test it out since I haven't touched this one in a while, and I still stand by what I said. The bug fixes and improvements made since my review are very apparent. The whole car making process is very smooth, and still fun. It appears the devs are trying to get the creation process completely done before implementing the campaign/tycoon. I regularly check the announcements, and haven't heard them mention anything about that mode coming anytime soon. I find this particularly strange, considering they're in the open beta stage of the game. Why would they consider the game to be in the beta phase when not a single piece of the main game mode has been implemented, or even said to be coming soon? Personally, I think the creation mode is in a good enough state where they could easily get to work on tycoon mode, and throw small bug fixes and content updates here and there. Every time I play this game, I find myself disappointed when I reach the end of the creation process and then have to say "well...I guess that's it." and then go play something else. For me, at least, it feels like a waste of time to make a car, and not be able to do anything with it.","March 24, 2015","false","1.8"," 218 of 293 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","218","293","6","27"

With a tweak to the name it could be released sooner (add in missing engines, forced induction and bodies) and already be worth the money. When the tycoon side is added this will be one of the most abitious projects on Steam and no doubt well made and well polished. Top stuff.\n\nAnd now I waffle...\n\nCurrently this is Automation - The Car Design Game. And it is bliddy brilliant at doing that. I got this a few years back, just after turbochargers were added to the engine designer. I guess I paid about this price and I have easily had my money's worth. The scenarios offer a challenge, getting platinum on the harder scenarios is a labour of love. And many hours can be lost forever fiddling around in the car designer.\n\nThere are a few annoyances at the moment, such as not being able to change fixtures for different trims and not being able to morph the body after placing fixtures (although I understand and respect the reason for this). But these are easy to live with just like limitations and design choices can be lived with in other titles.\n\nSo what about the 'Car Company Tycoon' bit. Why isn't a considerable chunk of the name not actually in the game. Logic. That's why. Car companies sell cars, so make the car design bit. Cars need engines, so build the engine bit. The detail is unprescedented, even with some parts such as the gearbox, cam and ignition settings simplified for gameplay reasons there is still an incredible amount of detail here. So I'm happy to wait months for an update and a year or two for the tycoon game because if the engine and car designers are anything to go by it is worth the wait. After all the 918/P1/LaFerrari (delete as applicable) wasn't designed in a day.\n\nSo back to the price. Is £22.99 (or whatever it is in $, Euros, Yen, Pieces-of-Eight, ...) worth it for an early access game from a teenie weenie indy dev. YES. Compared to other early access games there is plenty of content, and the devs are focussed on depth first, breadth (i.e. other engine types - I3, I5, V6 etc) later which is the correct way to do things.\n\nOn to the checklist I like to tick off before going for an early access game:\nDo the devs communicate well and often with the community? - A definitive tick.\nIs it frequently updated? - Cross\nAre the updates meaningful and adding depth to the game or are they just bug fixes and "look, shiny" crap to appease the masses? - Tick\nIs the content well made? - Tick\nDoes the game have potential? - Tick\nWill they reach that potential? (i.e. is it a proper game or does it stink of a money grab) - Tick\nDoes it have MOAR POWER - Tick","March 17, 2015","true","68.4"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","53","54","0","1"

I know they generally have four wheels and an engine to make them go. I’ve learnt the “controls” and I know that you have to feed them petrol or they’ll sulk and refuse to move, but when it comes to the actual mechanics of the vehicle it’s all magic and voodoo to me.\n\nThen again, the same could be said about a lot of things, I don’t know much about rocketry either but that hasn’t stopped me from putting some cool spacecraft together in “Kerbal Space Program”.\n\nIt’s with this “can do” attitude that I approach Automation: The Car Company Tycoon game in development by Camshaft Software.\n\n\nThe Fastest Colour\n\nArmed with the knowledge that “Red cars go faster” I dive straight into the game with visions of gull wing doors, sleek styling and cherry red paintwork racing through my mind.\n\nCasting an eye across the design options it seems that an engine might be an important component, my “cherry chariot” will probably need one of those so I confidently click on the icon, expecting a few engine options to choose from, you know, cheap and slow, standard and reliable or fast and expensive.\n\nThis was not the case, you have to design your own engines too, a thought which filled me with dread and anticipation in equal measure.\n\n\nMagic Box\n\nThe engine is the magic box that makes the car work, I’m vaguely aware of plugs that spark and shafts that crank but putting one together.... do some shafts crank better than others? I don’t even know what that means!\n\nIt’s at this point that I realised just how complicated piecing a working vehicle together is actually going to be.\n\n\nThe Rocksmith of Automotive Design.\n\nLuckily, Automation is eager to lend a hand in the form of tutorial videos which you can access from within the game. This is an excellent and for me vital option which explains the various components, what they do and why they do it.\n\nFour stroke configurations, head types, forced induction, headers, mufflers, these were all just words to me before I played automation, they’re still just words to me now too, but at least I know what they are!\n\nAny game that can teach you something whilst you’re having fun can only be a good thing.\n\n\nBespoke Build\n\nEvery component and every material you choose will have an impact on your engines performance.\n\nYou can tailor your design to your requirements, if you’re building an engine intended for an everyday city car then economy and reliability will likely be more important to you than raw power.\n\nVice versa if you’re planning on building a super car, then a big, powerful and inevitably expensive engine should power your wagon for the super rich.\n\n\nTalk the Torque\n\nThere’s a wealth of information and graphs you can pull up as you tinker with your design, looking for the torque, RPM or horsepower of your engine, it’s all there for you to see in its statistical glory.\n\n\nSound of Success\n\nAnother really nice touch are the dynamic engine sounds which will change to reflect your design choices, A beefy V8 should have its own distinctive growl and it does!\n\n\nOther Bits\n\nWhen you’re happy with your engine, it’s time move on to the car design itself, what chassis would be best, which suspension options  should you go with, what about engine placement, drivetrain setups, tyres, breaking systems, the list goes on and on, to say that the design options available are comprehensive is an understatement.\n\nThe level of detail available can be mind boggling, but again, Automation is there with its quick hit tutorial videos and text to guide you through.\n\n\nNice Body\n\nOnce you’ve finished tinkering with your mechanical design, it’s time to do the important things like adding the trims and spoilers, positioning the headlights and painting the whole thing red.\nEven in its early access state this design process is a comprehensive, slick and enjoyable experience.\n\n\nNext Step\n\nWe’ve finally done it, the “Cherry Chariot”, a masterpiece in botched engineering, is ready to leave the design phase and go into production.\n\nSo what’s next? Should we start sifting through supply and demand figures? Decide which territories are ripe for picking? set up production lines and start advertising the hell out of our mechanical marvel?\n\nWhen the money starts rolling in we could invest in some R&D, maybe start work on a new design, “The Crimson Carriage” and move our plans for global vehicular dominance another step forward.\n\n\nStop Sign\n\nThe answer unfortunately is no, at least not yet.\nAutomation: The Car Company Tycoon is still in development and as an early access title many of the planned features haven’t made it into the game yet.\n\n\nSign of Things to Come\n\nCamshaft Software are planning some very exciting features in future updates.\nThere will be a campaign mode running from the halcyon days of motoring through to the near future, in game scenarios and the obligatory sand box mode.\nThe game will feature dynamic world markets, distribution and demand, target groups etc. which should give a full business tycoon experience and more mechanical and chassis parts than even the most demanding designer could ever need.\n\n\nBuy a Fuzzy Feeling\n\nWhat you get at the moment is a very competent car design tool and that warm fuzzy feeling from helping fund development of what promises to be a detailed car design and company manager tycoon title.\n\n\nWaiting Game\n\nI’m not going to pin an arbitrary percentage on to Automation at this stage, it’s just too early and there isn’t really a “game” there yet to rate. I will say that the design element that is in place is excellently implemented (think the car equivalent to designing that spacecraft in Kerbal Space Program).\nI’m genuinely excited to see how development progresses and I hope Automation receives the company tycoon mechanics it deserves.\n\nIf the same care and attention lavished on the design aspect is spent on the tycoon side of the game then this could be something special.\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","April 25, 2015","true","0.9"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","47","49","11","3"

And they added a bunch of content like new bodies (AWESOME) and now, pretty much any colour you like, which is a nice touch. The car I'm making at the moment is a hot pink 2.4L V4 citycar (You can do utes or station wagons so that's really cool). They have also added a tooltip which directly allows you to compare parts, Pushrod vs DAOHC for instance which is really useful.\n\nOne really good thing I can say with confidence is that the Devs are highly active in the forums so it's easy to make suggestions and ask questions and the community is really good as well.

Quite the opposite. This is a game with a small, but highly passionate and committed, team of developers who are continually making additions and improvements to the project (watch any of the Dev Updates on the Automation YouTube channel for evidence.) The game is definitely in an unfinished state but there's already quite a bit of quality content available.\n\nSecond, ask yourself this question: do you, or have you ever, wanted to build your own car? At this point in development, that's really all you're doing. But even in a simplified state such as this, it is still quite an involved and difficult task. There is a rather steep learning curve (especially if you have little experience in auto mechanics) but once you figure out the basics, building a car is a pretty smooth process. As I said, all you can do at this point is build cars and then run them (Note: not actually drive yourself though) around a virtual test track; there are three built-in but the forums have numerous other fanmade tracks. Eventually, the tycoon aspects of the game will give exponetially more things to do with your cars.\n\nOverall, what you have here is a solid foundation with a lot of potential going forward.

The game devs are a small team of devoted (no pun intended) people who are just making the game that they and all gear heads alike always wanted and they did a really good job with it.\n\nBuuut the thing is they are steering the game for an easier interface with less engine tuning abillities, so you used to be able to fine tune your cam lift and duration now they are tied to one slider and you could choose the amount of sound insulation you had but that is now tied with the type of interior you want. These things I want control to more make the car as I see fit. It's like a stick or auto tranny, some like the auto because it makes a car easier to drive, others like manual because they like more control of there car. Same thing applies with this game. I believe that they should at least give you an option of like an easy mode or a real mode. Easy mode is pretty much how the game is, and real mode with more fine tuning features that used to be in the games and more over time. People with not much knowledge of cars and people with a high understanding of cars can both be happy.\n\nOverall buy the game if you like cars and the mechanical aspect of them, even if you don't know much the game will teach you.","September 9, 2015","true","002.8"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","7"

You ask: "What is Automation?" I answer: "It's a game that will change the perspective of the universe we live in."\n\n...\n\nNo, wait, scratch that.\n\nWell, in Automation you build cars. And that's what I wanted to do since I was a little kid. I LOVE this game. You can build your dirt-cheap hatchback or your two-million-dollar luxury car that handles like a boat. You can design the cars' exterior and engine just like the way you want.\n\nAutomation is a really solid game. It's actually pretty well polished regarding that it is an early access game. I've noticed some minor bugs here and there but there's actually not that many. The game still needs more content such as more car bodies, engine types and so on, but luckily there's going to be more.\n\nUpdates come rarely, but luckily they're always big. And they're not just like "Look, we got a new text box, how cool is that?", no, there's always new content. (Actually having big updates more rarely is better than small updates frequently. In PAYDAY 2 there's an update every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ week!)\n\nThe only bad side I can think of is that you can't actually drive your cars, but I understand it, as a driving model is hard to do with a 3 man dev team, and the game is about building cars, not driving them.\n\nTo sum it up, the game maybe isn't worth the price of 27,99€ with this amount of content, but if you're even slightly into cars, I cannot do anything but recommend it.","June 5, 2015","true","90.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","17","18","3","0"

That being said, i expect it to be buggy, crash constantly and have many imcomplete features.\n\nMy first impressions: wow, finally a game that someone gets me. i love building cars. as a kid i had dreams of one day having my own car company, one i can put my name on and triumph as an auto-manufacturer. kind of like way back when there was a man that started his own company called "Tucker" unfortunately he was crushed by the big three but the idea was that he was ahead of them with features we have today such as seatbelts. he was an innovator and was different from the rest. if i was to run my own car company i would specialize in being different then the "sheeple" cars that are quality, economically priced, fast, fun, exciting and safe.\n\nThis game excited me so much i jumped over to the steam page immediately and purchased the game. i downloaded it and while downloading it i thought up cars to build, engines to design, what to call everything. even as far as what to call the engines that describes them with a code\n\nlike for an example; i have a honda civic and the engine code is D17A2. D-series, 1.7L, A2 (cylinder head - with SOHC VEC)\n\nmine is simple C4TE C-inital of last name, 4 - cylinder, T-Turbo, E-Economical (not crazy specs, for DD use)\n\nPlaying the game: I was so excited to start the game. firing it up for the first time did not ease the excitement. I loaded the main menu and noted that there is Multiplayer comming and also a campain. at this point i am more excited to have that sandbox. no money limits, just plain fun. making engines, making my own custom vehicles.\n\nAt the time of this review: I have currently been playing this game for 3 days now and have not lost interest yet. i look forward to future updates and more functionality and features.\n\nThings i would like to see:\n- actually driving my designs\n- more shells to mod\n- more things to add to the car such as more lights, maybe some body kits, more rims, window tint, customizable interior, license plate holders and such\n- more engine stuff; supercharger, maybe super and turbo charger together, twin for more then just v6 engines, v6 v10 v12 v14, inlines 3 5-12, rotary engines, W engines, Slant 6, FWD configurations\n- MOD SUPPORT\n- Vinyls for customization (even custom text and stuff)","March 26, 2015","true","28.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/desgor/recommended/293760/","desgor","Desgor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/desgor/","118 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhere do I start. Note, that this review is based on the current state of the game - 23. december, 2015.\n\nThis is a long, philosophy filled review, for a short and quick one, scroll down.\n\nThe idea for Automation seems just fine, as there's nothing similar to this game to current date. The game has been in development for quite a long time, and the pace for it goes snail-like. Don't mind my playtime, I didn't want to get over two hour mark, as I am still thinking, whether I really want to keep the game.\nI  have followed this for quite some time, and by follower, I mean, passive. I had played demo version to get the overall feel, and of course, at some point a pirated version, which allowed full access, appeared. Let's not dive in to this, cause it's more about the experience this offers.\n\nDevelopment wise, there are huge plans for the future, but not actuall coverage or timelines beneath it, and let me explain why. Idea and gameplay, which Automation attempts to tackle, is for a very specific market of buyers - petrolheads and technical nerds. Don't get offended by this, as I am both of theese. Now, continuing on explaining, as I previously mentioned, the development is slow. Why? Because initially, it was developed by four people, and I assume, that this was/is their hobby right after their daily jobs. Quite recently there was an expansion in crew, and I hoped to see the new people accepted being programmers/scripters, not car modelers, as at some point and time, there's a plan to transfer the game to Unreal Engine.\n\nA game which delves this deep in an engineering process involved to produce working engines for cars requires serious R&D, as it is seen in overall gameplay it offers. That what's the problem?\n\nEngines consist of thousands of moving parts, and creating simulated versions where everything affects everthing is quite more difficult than producing precisely estimated engine from raw materials in real life. To be able to depict an engine and it's characteristics to at least a fraction of reality requres serious study, which becomes a problem, when so little people are involved in project like this, and, doing the simple math results in long development times.\n\nI tried to recreate one of my IRL car engine, which is a 1.6 Liter 4 banger from B5, and surprisingly, with a little tinkering, I came close to the actuall power figures and peak-power delivery. And yes, I used roughly the same materials, with whatever parameters they are coded, but when trying something like this, it becomes noticable, that certain aspects are missing, which probbably is a good thing, cause who the hell would want to enter precise camshaft profiles and what not.\n\nTo add something, most modern cars are using ECU's. If something like that could be programmed in the game, and allowed people to tinker with ECU values, at least at basic level, would surely bring a huge difference, as pure, predefined metal parts would no longer be the only thing that makes power.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nGood:\n\nThe game delivers what it promises and is supposed to;\nAllows you to build an engine with simple yet hard to master tools;\nTutorials explaining what everything does, so you have no need to be an engineer;\nGreat educational material for people interested how stuff works;\nBasic car designer, with click-and-drag functionality;\nVery interesting at start, as ideas for engines and cars just plow your mind.\n\nBad:\n\nSlow development;\nBasic visual representation with 3D models, which is subjected to change after transfering to UE, i.e., become more beautiful and, hopefully, sophisticated;\nSmall team tackling huge project and idea;\nLow replay value after you have tried massive, huge displacement POOWEEER roaring, small displacement usable moon-reving, and lastly, econobox engines.\n-This would not coun't as a con, but it's not great either - the engine sounds. At the end of the day, all same confguration engines sound foggy. You can't make it sound like mean American Muscle, or crisp German high-reving V8. I hope this subjects to change.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThis product is rivaling it's genere between game and educational material. If this would take an educational route, and would be pushed further with techical details and every little asspect of engines, probbably, it would make it to school programs, I am sure.\n\nI still recomend this game, although, it's possible to try a demo version, to get the overall feel what everything is about, and basically, that's it, at least for now, until core functionality of tycoon is implented.\n\nDid they bite bigger than they could chew? In my opinion, probbably yes.","December 23, 2015","true","16.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

A must for any car enthusiast, novice to expert, who simply has extra time to play with a cheap hobbie.  I can now confidently build an engine from what I've learned that can rival any built anywhere, (given the scratch for high end parts not being an issue.)  I already got my monies worth many times over and want more of what they are offering.\n\nThis game factors in details like bore/stroke, engine parts materials, head type, # of valves, aspiration, compression, air/fuel ratio, fuel delivery, cam shaft timing, engine timing, intake manifolds, a quality slider (on every creation page), exhaust type and diameter, I could go on, and that is just the engines.  For body, there is chassis design, chassis material, suspension type, engine placement, body material, body morphing, body design, drive type, paint, etc. .  For the 3rd part of the creation (sandbox mode), Automation covers all the rest of the cars overall detail from different differential types to # of gears, # of seats, tire details, brake details, aerodynamic variables, and alot more I'm sure that I missed. There are text and video explenations of anything one would want to know.  Some of the other parts of the game are still in development as of mid May/2016, but, this game already has plenty to keep one occupied while it is too wet to go out and play.\n\nThere are some game modes I've barely tampered with, like challenges to design a vehicle, (or engine), towards a particular niche of the cars character (w/ various levels of difficulty, [bordering on a mathematics utopia]) that could seem to stump your reach for the platinum prize, to the tycoon/company side that is near finished (my best guess, {although, it could be way deeper than I'm expecting [ It IS way better, caught glimpse of game with new Unreal Engine updating what already exists, Way better than expected as of 5/25/16 ]}) being developed.  The community is constantly adding mods to steam too that can effortlessly be added.  Multiplayer and Campain isn't even highlighted yet.  Oh, the anticipation....\n\nIt already covers most engine configurations that exist and with the diligent frequent updates, the rest are soon to follow.  It contains inline 4, inline 6, V6, V8, & V12's and turbos with future updates consisting of (I think) sequential twin turbos to eliminate low end turbo lag.  V10's, inline 3, inline 5, and superchargers are in the works for the future too, along with many vehicle types that already exist to match up with.  I've heard to expect well over 1000 car bodies, wow.\n\nHopeful future expansions W8, W12, W16, W18, Wankel Rotaries Flat 4, Flat 6, Flat 8, Inline 8, V4, Two Strokes, Diesels, Hybrids and Electric will probably be future paid content.  The more the merrier, the better the game does financially, the better the game gets.  (I'm guessing again that some of this might be part of vanilla game anyhow, there is a porsche-like mod that would support flat engines perfectly.)  <-- Just a hypothesis.\n\nThe game designers really seem to get it too, they follow up on a surprising amount of customer feedback informing all whom are curious on what to expect and why to expect it.  Fairly impressive in a world where games are sold before completed and people often don't know what they are getting.\n\nYou CAN upload created engines from Automation ---to---> Assetto Corsa, and then drive your creation in whatever vehicle you upload the engine to.  That is amazing!\nI'm assuming that with multiplayer, I'll be able to prove that my car can beat your car, BUY IT.","May 15","true","621.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","13","13","3","0"

They are updated live as you tweak or change options.\n- Fantastic, realistic audio. Engines sound fab, with reflections on your selected options and tweaks. Even has cheesy music that you expect to get in a sim.\n- Sandbox mode.\n- Fun scenarios give you something to do.\n- Skip between any section of your build.\n- In-depth in-game videos appear when editing options for the first time. Also has a "don't show videos" button.\n- Pre-game launcher with good selection of options.\n- Good in-game options menu.\n- Active developer so far. Good work so far, Please do not let us down.\n\nCons: (Note: We are pre warned on this page about many of these features being unimplemented or buggy.)\n- Tycoon mode not yet implemented in any form. Frustrating as the title clearly states Tycoon. It's like ordering pizza and only getting the base.\n- Multiplayer not yet implemented in any form.\n- UI can be confusing at times. Having to complete a section to get the graph for the section is annoying.\n- Can't pan the camera properly.\n- "Engine cannot fit" keeps popping up because it's difficult to guage the size, You have arrows that turn green to red in the visual designer, but it'd be nice to have an inline or overlay text appear such as you are X: 10inch out of 20inch etc. Also my UpDown (Height) arrow appeared red when building a 10ltr v8 in a massive truck, which seemingly cannot be resolved.\n- Lacking in content. I'd like to see more engines, with larger scaling. Perhaps even more exotic ones to cars, like wankel rotary and aircraft rotary.\n- Car base in designer can only be altered slightly by stretching certain parts. I'd like to be able to move windows and increase engine bay size\n- Engine colour and trim are very, very limited. Can only change with next or prev buttons. Why? When the car base designer has a colour picker?!\n- Certain videos are unfinished with "Video coming soon" placeholders and can abruptly end.\n- Graphics and UI could benefit from some higher resolutions and some polish.\n- Random bugs. Such as a LUA warning in a windows alert box.\n\nOverall this is a great simulator so far.\nIt however lacks in the "game" element, polish and content.\n\nI would recommend this to someone who loves engines, and the build process or customization.\n\nI do not recommend this if you are expecting a fleshed out Tycoon or multiplayer experience, as in this build (29/03/2015), it does not exist.","March 28, 2015","true","19.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","6"

The car and engine designer are simple enough to be understood by most people, but complex enough to not leave the more experienced ones among us wanting more. The devs are great. Killrob frequently posts update videos on the Automation YouTube channel, so not only do you know they're not slacking off, but new features are displayed and discussed.

(It is a ton of fun to send your cars on the 'test track', though.)\n\nThis game absolutely shines for what it is meant to do - let you make a fantasy car company, complete with fine-tuning the engines for economy or performance or both. It focuses on the very satisfying kind of multi-dimensional optimization problems that come with tweaking each model for the best marketability in a segment.\n\nMy complaints about this game pretty much only center around the things that are either not finished or can be easily modded in. There are some decades where you run out of contemporary body styles, for example; and flat-four, flat-six, V12, and V10 engines would be great. That said, for what this game is, there really isn't anything major missing. Plus, I can't wait for the "tycoon" side of this game to start happening (although I tend to lose in money-management settings).\n\nOne other note: The graphics look amazing while still being able to run easily on my PC. The Lua side of things can be a little shaky in terms of stability, but compared to a particular car-building game from 2003 that I've sunk even more time into (it's not on Steam), it's immensely better.\n\n(Edited to add: V12s were added in an update to the game, and I'd be remiss not to mention that mods cover the question of additional body styles.)","November 13, 2015","true","173.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

Giving you the ability to design vehicles in a period ranging from 1940 through to 2020, with a variety of different technologies and materials becoming available with time.\n\nI'd talk though all the various parts of the designer screens, but there's enough videos on youtube by now for you to actually see it for yourself. However I will say that it's quite an intuitive system. The body designer is simple enough that just about anybody can make something they like. While the engine designer is willing to give you enough hand holding to talk you though why your design keeps exploding - and how to fix that. It's even able to show you how to develop a better engine for what you want to achieve. Want to build a high revving lightweight engine for use in a sports car? It gives you enough information to figure out how to do that. Want a heavy duty low-revving truck engine? Or an economy car engine? Same thing.\n\nWhat it doesn't yet have is an actual career mode. And yes, that probably means that as it stands right now it's more of  a design tool rather than an actual game. But I'm confident that the guys behind this thing can get it done, given how much progress they have made already in the time I've been watching them.\n\n\nIs it worth the money?\n\nIf you're a car nerd I'd say it is, but if you want to wait till they've got the career mode done I'd entirely understand your apprehension.","July 22, 2015","true","208.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Now that they're on steam I don't think they will change their work habits and a lot of "game is dead" post will surely popup, ignore them and just check out their regular videos and make up your own mind.\n\nCommunity feedback is taken very seriously and they're very active in their own forums answering many questions and even asking some to us. Don't forget it's just 3 persons working on this game, I say persons because if I remember correctly one of them is a woman and I wouldn't want to disrespect any women by saying 3 guys ;).\n\nAfter more then 2 years I can stll say that I have trust in the devs and this game. Quality before anything else will make a great game.\n\nAs for the game itself, currently the engine and car designer work pretty much without bugs and is a lot of fun playing. I honestly do not know which options are available on steam but I got the package that includes the juicy V8 engines (also I6) and Turbo's. They got a lot of things still to add like more engines, car bodies and fixtures. So for now you can just design your cars and engines without much limits like time period, costs and so on. When your car is complete you can test it on a top down viewed maps to see if it's any good, fun thing is that there is a track which we all know as the top gear track... of course it's only "looks similar" so no copyrights will be broken ;)\n\nThere are also some scenarios that you can play where there are design limits, these can be very fun and some are very very hard. If you like cars you will like this game. I don't even own a car or drivers licence and I still enjoy it very very much (I'm just a tech freak I guess). Career mode (tycoon part) is what they're working on now and won't be finished for a long time, can't wait myself... well actually I can since I've already been on board for years. :p\n\nI suggest you check out their own forums and youtube channel, investing in this game is something I do not regret like other early access games (Talking about you Godus, the scam game).\n\nAgain I must say and can't emphasize this enough, that you should never buy anything of one review/opinion, even my little early access one. Educate yourself and see if this game is for you and if you want to invest now or wait for release. You know my opinion, now make up your own and enjoy this game if and when you buy it.\n\nTL;DR: Dude gives Automation (early access version) a big thumbs up!","May 16, 2015","true","35.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Being an engineering student I’ve always been intrigued by well put together simulation games. Several days ago I was looking around to see if any games had recently released that would peak my interest and to my luck I came across this gem.  Even in this stage of the games development this early access version seamlessly incorporates the engineering aspects of car manufacturing, with a strong focus on the engine itself. I've always been an automobile enthusiast, so this game naturally came to my attention, but initially I was worried that I would struggle to play through the game as I was not very experienced with the terminology and internals of automobile engines.\n\nAutomation was very presentable and surprisingly helpful as I started off. As I progressed in the pursuit of the perfect car the game gave me insightful videos that explained and simplified each aspect of the motor, as well as proper detail on the external parts of the vehicle itself. Obviously not being a final release the team still has work to finish but it seems like they consistently update the game, which is great. Despite not being close to a final cut, the first day that I purchased this game I nearly spent 6 hours just simply fine tuning my machine to my desire. Honestly I could only imagine what the upcoming updates will bring. Hopefully in the future we can come to see more car design options, as well as more in-depth car customization, and more engine customization and detail. Though the future looks bright for this game and I hope that the developers continue to work hard towards delivering a fantastic product!\n\nI wonder if there is a suggestion board that I could potentially give ideas on?","March 28, 2015","true","78.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

The only thing that I would like to improve in the car building part of the game is more control over the interior of a car, it's mostly just sliders and checkboxes right now.  They could really bring it to the next level by giving us more control over this.  The markets seem well throught out and a very good starting point to the tycoon play.

If you like management games, business games and games where you design and create something, this will be definitely up your alley. Be aware that right now, the game is still somewhat early in its development stage.\n\nYou can already create a variety of engines, be it inline 4 or 6 cylinder ones or V6 and V8 engines. There are options to turbocharge your creations as well. However, all of this comes with the ability to customise almost every part of what you create in great detail and realism. To help with the mechanical engineering jargon and explaining what everything you touch does, the game comes equipped with a rather comprehensive set of tooltips and narrated videos, which will help you understand what parts of the engine do what. Especially this latter part is worthy of applause, since you will not only understand the game better and have more fun, you will also gain some actual knowledge of the workings of engines, suspensions and so on.\n\nThe game aims to be along the lines of Motor City, where you will create your own car company, build factories, design cars, engines and then sell them on the market through various good or turbulent times. The campaign is currently not yet implemented, but it is the one aspect I am truly thrilled about.\n\nThe creator part of the game is already pretty amazing in itself; designing engines and then testing them is a lot of fun, despite the fact that (right now) there's nothing else you can do with them, except put them in a chasis and have the car run a test track.\n\nBut, again, if you like these kinds of games, I strongly recommend you keep an eye on this one.

A great designer for both the engine and cars.\n\nI believe that one arbitrary number to rate a game is foolish and about as useful as making a review just "duuh its GUUD" so thereforth I will use a divided rating system so people can see if the game excels in what they like or fails miserable (e.g. Game scores high in graphics but low in story, this may be a big deal for some people and one number isn't going\nto tell them anything)\n\nTake these ratings with a grain of salt and refer to this when reading them, normally a full 20 would mean it's perfect but I'm basing this system off of my knowledge. 0-5 - Gamebreaker/Poor, 6-10 - Mediocre/Average, 11-15 - Above\nAverage/Great, 16-20 - Excellent/Blew Me Away\n\nGraphics: 8/20\nThis is really something not nice to look at HOWEVER I have heard word that this game is being ported to UE4 so if Graphics is a make or break for you then stick around this game until that happens.\nStory: 0/20 [AS OF NOW]\nThis game has no story and is currently free and sandbox but please don't ignore it because of this reason, once the tycoon part comes out you can essentially make your own story with your own car company which may be a big success at first but then become a downfall in the oil crisis.\nGameplay: 17/20\nReally is fun to play and i find myself coming back for that quick and snappy UI helping me glide through the creation of a car, Fast UI's can make a game 10x more fun (I'm looking at you MCLA and NFSUC)\nOptimization: 16/20\nI had a really hard time giving a number on this one, the game did work pretty well on my mums laptop but there isn't really any amazing graphics to optimize so, it just worked well on my computer.\nOriginality: 19/20\nThis game definetly shines in the fact that it is such an original idea and something that in the bottom of every car enthusiasts hearts being that they want to make their own car and see how it does out there.\n\nConclusion: Let me just say this, yes you can make your own car... sold? There are certain aspects in this game that can be a gamebreaker and majority of them will be fixed in the future of this games developement so please if there is something you do not like about this game just stick with it till it is implemented or fixed.","September 30, 2015","true","44.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

At the time of writing this review the mechanics of the engine and car designer features are more or less fully fleshed out, but tweaks and additional content are being added. The tycoon feature is partially present, but still being built.\n\nBefore its release on Steam and the implementation of the car designer, I spent at least a hundred hours with the game tinkering with the engine designer. For players with an interest in internal combustion engines, the engine designer on its own is going to take up a lot of your time. Fantasizing about a tiny 1.5 liter turbo I4 with 450 HP? Build it. A smooth, efficient 3.0 liter I6 for a mid-size sedan? Build it. They're all possible, and the level of detail is sufficient to allow for a lot of tinkering, but not so overwhelming that a degree in mechanical engineering is required to not feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe car designer is impressive, but less so. There are currently several dozen body types and even more variations (a small hatchback can turn into a small pickup truck by lopping off the rear roof, for example). It is possible to modify existing bodies in numerous ways, such as stretching the hood, modifying the slope of the windshield, extending the fenders, and so on. However, it's not possible to design a body from scratch in the game, which is forgivable. The issue is with fixture placement (headlights, taillights, etc). Currently, this can be buggy and tedious. Getting a specific headlight to fit in a specific place can be unnecessarily difficult because some of the bodies have very conservative placement limits to prevent clipping and warping.\n\nFor those with an interest in cars, the game is an easy purchase. It's easy to understand yet hard to master. The developer has shown themselves to be reliable at updating the game frequently, and actually improving it with each update rather than adding features for the sake of it. There's nothing else like it.","December 29, 2015","true","114.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

So there are a few bugs that pop up and there is a lot of content still in the pipe line.\n\nI really enjoy a good tycoon game (there is no tycoon part implemented yet). I'm a big car fan. So I figured I would give this a shot.\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised at how the game plays and how enjoyable it is.\n\nThere is a really good tutorial system which is complete enough to get you up to speed. With the tutorials and the in game feedback you should up and running designing engines and cars.\n\nThis game is really in depth. the first car you design if you watch all the tutorials along the way will take well over an hour.\n\nAfter you have designed 2 or 3 cars you can crank one out in a few minutes and then if you want spend over an hour tweaking it to exactly how you the the car to be.  I really enjoy shaving a few seconds off the cars lap time and seeing how much faster I can get it to go around the track.\n\nI'm really impressed with now well they mimic real life into a simulation. Take a real world car and make it in Automation, You get close to the same HP, MPG top speed, 0-60 and other benchmarks as the real world counterpart.\n\nThe engine designer scenarios are a lot of fun. Make an engine within certain guidelines sounds easy. Some of the scenarios are really easy others are down right brutal as it states in the scenario.\n\nComplete car designer scenarios are a bit trickier if not more rewarding at the end.\n\nIf you are into simulation games and like cars I would give it a go.\n","January 30","true","28.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Especially the engine design area, which takes me back to my R&D days.  The pros/cons of this early access are.\nPros:\n1. Extremely detailed build section\n2. The engine development section.\nCons:\n1. limited engine types. (V12, V10, wankle, diesel, etc).\n2. turbo charger types limited (also unable to develop your own).\nRecommendations:\n1. Would enjoy a turbo design section. (variable/set vane diffusion, adjustable a/r, etc).\n2. Would enjoy making a decision between diesel/gasoline. (as a possible dlc).\nOverall for an early access game it is surprisingly sound.  From my perspective the developers see quality and attempt to attain it before they let an update out to the community.  I recommend this game to all of my freinds.

Whether you are new to game or you are profesional car mechanic working with engines on daily basis this game is good for everyone who loves either to biuld (like) a real engines what existed or just create moster engines and 2000bhp. Like I said it is easy for everyone.\nIf you still not sure there are tutorials for every element about the car/engine and they are very helpfull.\nGraphics are just beautifull. Very very nice graphics. Engines look better than real engines :D\n\nAlso you can use US/UK (metric/imperial) untis in a game to suit eveyone.\nYou can create anything and everyhting. The only limitation is your mind.\nLet's say you want to create the most powerfull car what goes around the track super fast regarless money/budget.\nSo you can start shaping up your cars body followed by adding lights, grilles, vents/ exaust pipes....\nRemeber you will need big enough grill for you moster engine :)\nWhen you happy with your cars body and chassis off course all from carbon fibre :D than you can move on to make an engine for it.\nAgain you will start by chosing material for you engine blocks and pistons and rods, followed by chosing massive turbos and chosing air flow and pressure boost, followed by compresion and how rich you want your engine to run. When you are happy with you engine test it and THEN you can adjust it/tweak and SEE RESULTS IN REAL TIME.\nDon't need to adjust it and test and adjust it and test it, just tweak it and see result real time in diagrph.\nAlso every selection you make it tells you what is cost, weight, economy, max rpm, max torque . . . . you can all details about your selections.\n\nSO once you happy with engine you put it in a car and then you chose type of gearbox/clutch, spacing, type of wheels and how wide/big you want them to be, off course carbon fibre brakes 6 piston calibers :D because why not :D we have got money and we want overkill brakes :D\n\nAnd once you happy with everything test you car on track see the results. time, acceleration/stopping distance, G-forces , drag/downforce, fuel consuption and so all the details are there.\n\nAgain, if you not 100% happy with car/engine you can go back and tweak to absolute maximum and SEE RESULTS IN REAL TIME and then you can test it again around the track.\n\nSO, even if you are type of person who doesn't like these kind of game, you should buy it, it will drag you in and it is fun.\nYou can also do SCENARIOS where you have got orders what type of engine your client is looking for and these are good to test how good you are in making engines. When you have limited budget but what good reliable engine with good prformance BUT also good fuel consuption.\n\nAnd also developers are doing awesome job, they always tell you what they working on, what they will be working on in future and keep you updated all the time.\n\nDo I like this game? No, I LOVE IT\nDo I recommend this game? Strongly recommended to everyone\n\nP.S. Alo I forgot to say the sound of those engines, whether you trying to replicate like a F1 engine it will sound like F1 car or muscle 10 litres V12 and it will sound like it.\n\nLike I said the only limitaiton is your mind. ;)","March 14, 2015","true","7.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

I would consider the general level of detail regarding engine and vehicle design to be fairly high, though it certainly could be more detailed in places. The main problem of the game is that there's simply nothing to do apart from designing vehicles and this does get old at some point.\n\nNo one has yet seen the tycoon mode, which IMO should be the main focus of the game (after all, it's in the title). More information about that mode was promised to be provided around Christmas of last year (IIRC), however, no such information was ever published. How detailed is that ominous tycoon mode going to be? Will it ever be released? Will the team run out of money before this, IMO most important, milestone?\n\nThe truth is, not much has happened with the game in the past few months, possibly even the last year. Even small changes seem to take an inordinate amount of time to be implemented. The GUI was redesigned a couple of times (IMO too often) - sometimes with questionable effects. Little things were added (especially with this Steam version, like more options for brakes, active aero and so forth) - but these are minute additions. It seems like time is being wasted. A look at the roadmap also reveals plans for competitive engine and vehicle design multiplayer modes. Really? Why is valuable development time being spent on something like this? I honestly cannot imagine anyone craving for something like that as it's basically moving sliders around against the clock.\n\nI have to reiterate at this point that I love the general idea of the game - and do hope with all my heart that we will all live to see the game live up to its potential - but I remain in doubt. Too many early access programs have failed spectacularly and this has all the signs pointing to such failure. Still, I can only recommend this game, hoping that, indeed, developmental pace will pick up after this Steam release (as promised).","March 12, 2015","true","400.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Automation has been an incredibly effective teaching tool for me. Now I know how Air-Fuel fuel ratios affect compression, how an oversquare engine revs higher while generating less torque then a comparable displacement undersquare engine, and many other tuning aspects.\n\nI am looking forward very much to the completed tycoon game mode, as you should also be. It will complete this simulator making so you can waste even more of your time playing it, not that it's a complete waste of your time. You could be doing much worse things then blowing 4 hours in automation, you could be stabbing a homeless person. Or drowning your sorrows in booze.

Lack of content, polish, or just a general lack of interest in playing them again.  I can already tell that Automation is not going to be one of those games, and I am extremely excited for what the future holds for this game.\n\nAs it stands at the time of this review, Automation is fleshed out pretty well.  The graphics are decent, and the engines look beautiful.  In terms of car aesthetics, there is some left to be desired.  There aren't exactly a lot of options, however, there's enough to work with to keep you coming back.  The engines are just outrageously beautiful.\n\nScenario mode is quite a lot of fun, if not somewhat challenging (that's not a bad thing).  But my real interest lies in Sandbox mode.  When I was younger, me and one of my best friends were obsessed with cars.  We created a fake brand name, drew up ideas for models and specifications.  I had forgotten about all of that up until now: and it's simply amazing to see some of the ideas we had become rendered in three-dimension.\n\nI will admit that there is a ton of tutorials, some of which are kind of grueling to watch.  However, it's more or less a necessity, and you can learn quite a lot about automobiles from them, so if you're not mechanically inclined, it's an educational experience.\n\nIn terms of realism and simulation?  Well, this game pretty much gets it to a T.  It's extraordinarily accurate.  To test it out, I built a car based on an actual one: specifically, a 1998 Ford Crown Victoria.  Surprisingly, one of the models looked quite like the real car, so I chose it and made it look aesthetically similar to the real one.  Then, the real meat of the simulation: recreating the engine.  I won't go into all the heavy detail, so to save some time, I'll sum it up: I chose the V8 engine, selected the actual parts, crank, cam, the correct ratios, etc., all based on the real car.  When it all came out in the wash during the testing process, I was shocked at how dead-on accurate the engine audio sounded (I own the same car in real life).  My virtual Crown Victoria ended up rating at 202 HP and 268 ft. lbs. of torque (as opposed to 200 and 275, respectively, from actual factory specifications).  I couldn't believe it.\n\nIn short, if you have any interest in cars whatsoever, buy this game right now.  I haven't encountered any bugs, but the game has crashed once.  It can only get better from here, which is what excites me.\n\nI'll probably come back and edit this after the next two modes are released, but I'm sure I'll have nothing more than positive words.","March 24, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The fact that it is termed 'early access' is only because there is so much more to come - in the way of the Tycoon part of the game. This is a very ambitious project being undertaken by a very committed team; one of the most professional 'early access' releases I've seen. Like many people I have made a few ealry access purchases Ive regretted, but not this one. I think the sheer popularity of the subject matter will generate the financial support necessary for this one to come to fruition if done right - as it has been so far.\n\nYou don't get to drive the cars (or shoot at anyone, etc), but that is not the intention here at all; this is not GTA or a racing sim. If you have long hankered for a really good tycoon sim based on automobiles, it appears to be in the making here. Of course the 'tycoon sim' part is yet to come, but with this game you actually get very detailed control of the design, capability and quality of the cars you will be selling (in a way that is far, far beyond other games that claim to let you 'design your own').  That part of the game is here now, and is for all intents and purposes finished.\n\nThe main benefit of buying at this stage is that you will have had time to master car & engine design by the time the tycoon part is ready.  If your understanding of car & engine design is a bit limited that time will be worth spending. And it's really not a grind. Although fairly complex it is all explained and presented in a very consumable fashion, and you'd have to be uninterested in the subject matter in the first place not to learn a lot here.   If the Tycoon part is essential to you then of course wait - but if you want to get the hang of developing engines & building cars early, this is street-ready.","March 13, 2015","true","27.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I love to work on cars doing anythig from simple maintanence, to aftermarket upgrades. This game has eveything I have ever wanted in a car designing game. It has wonderful animations, amazing customization for both the body and engine, and even though the company design isnt out yet, I have fun imagining how the public would view my cars. I can not wait until this feature is added to the game. Even if you are not a gear head, it's super fun to just play around with the engine tool to see if you can make the best engine possible. The only real cons I can think of are A.) not enough engine style choices yet. There are only V8's, V plane 8's, I6's, and I4's. They promise there will be more in the near future. And B.) they changed it from the original versions, before the steam greenlight, where you could change and add some body features, like adding wings, and more headlights if you want to make a version that is a rally car. I really hope they change this so that I won't have to start over every time I want to make a "sport model" and just want to add a front lip, bigger exhaust tips, and a wing to the current model for instance. I should also add that I bought this game before it's release on steam, and I fid myself coming back to in constantly.","March 17, 2015","true","247.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game is a great concept and I believe when the tycoon is put into the game it will be worth the price. But as it stands now I can't recommend this game because $30 for just the engine builder isn't worth it. I would say check on this game every few months and see how far the development has come along. This game is worth 7 bucks as is, but has the potential to be worth the 30 bucks that is being charged as of now.\n\nUpdate 1/18/16\nGame has shown some slight improvement since two months ago. You can see the dev taking steps in order to implement the tycoon system. But fair warning it will still probably take awhile before the tycoon idea gets it wheels truely rolling. I'll up my rating from 7 bucks to 8.25 for now.\n\nUpdate 4/20/16\nGame has added in the engineering part of the tycoon, but the tycoon still is not there so be warned. Since my last update the game has more playablity I guess you would say considering it is not longer just a make a car game.

The fact that it is fully modifiable is one of my favorite features. If there is beta testing or anything I can help with it would be my honorable plesure. Your all doing an amazing job and I cant wait to see how the adjustments ( as there are literally an unfathumable amout of combinations you can do) will effect the way the car drives even if its only a straight qtr mile run then back in the shop to put it up for sale.\nBRAVO encore and much more.\nHope that I am lucky enough to be in contact with the creators as it is an amazing feat and I really couldn't be happier thus far.\nJust keep on updating and modding it you will have a customer forever. " or your money back"\nHeck who knows in 20 years add in a car show feature addin and people can show the cars that were made from this year even.\nWell just wanted to see if there is anything can test do to be a tiny part of it I would be honored.\nTimothy Eerdmans\narmyman2121@hotmail.com","April 15, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is a lot of advanced subject matter in this game about what an engine does and how it performes under stress that not everyone may understand but they do a very good job of explaining the concepts behind them. The graphics are the best for what the car looks like when you make it, I would personally prefer some more functionality in paint designs and lighting effects, but I understand that's not the intent of the game, I can play Forza 5 for making pretty looking cars. This is more about the fundamental aspects of what a car is for and how much it costs to produce and why a company would want to make this car and think people will buy it. Imagine you are taking over Ford, how would you change the mustang, the focus, or their trucks? how would you make sure people wanted to buy them?\n\nTL;DR lots of science, and economics, and you get to be in control of every aspect of car design and production.","March 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Think of this game as a blend of old car-building games like "Street Legal" where you design engines and bodies and mix it with business-simulations where you massproduce said cars in the millions in huge plants for the masses, or have a handful of extremely skilled craftsmen carefully sculpting 10 supercars a year.\n\nFor now, we have the engine designer and body designer with the business part of the game in the making.\nStill even in this phase this is one of the best simulations out there on this subject. When i say simulator i mean it in a positive way, but it can also be considered a game depending on how serious you are approaching it and what you do with it. The developers are active on their forum and on their facebook page and communicate with the players on a regular basis and seems like really great guys.\n\nYou can make your own engines in almost every way concievable from small, cheap, weak and smoking cast iron engines straight out from a peoples car of the 60's eastern bloc to huge, high-tech roaring V8's in titanium with horsepowers in 4 digits from a modern supercar, all with a fantastic attention to detail for those who want to get knee-deep in technical specs. Heck, i've even taken specs from my real cars engines and used them in the game to get quite accurate results!\n\nDesign car bodies to make hideous and comical cars that should be killed with fire to spare mankind the horror or design beautiful cars fit for the nice salons and red carpet. Go for round, sleek aerodynamic shapes or why not a classic 70's box with wedges and angles everywhere? Make your own take on the huge barges with rocket-fins of the 50's or try to make a copy of the car on your own driveway!\n\nI really look forward to seeing this game take off and grow. This is what a car tycoon game is all about. This is what other "simulators" and "tycoon" games should be if they had any decency and self respect.

When you play for first time the only thing you can do is create your own desired car modifying the chassis, headlights, etc. There's various stages of fabrication, body, engine, interior, running gear... but that's it, there's nothing more than that. If you like creating your preferred car go ahead and buy it, there's also workshop, but if you want to create your car and play the tycoon part it's not made yet.

Automation has an eye for technical detail and the engine building tutorials are a pretty decent beginners guide to engine design, sadly on my playthrough some of the later tutorial videos still contained placeholder visuals or were lacking voiceovers. The challenges are enjoyable but pretty limited and hardly varied enough to keep you coming back. Ideally you should be setting out with a goal to meet the requirements but too often you complete challenges by adjusting sliders until you hit the right performance values.\n\nThe car sandbox mode is again hugely detailed, quite possibly too much so, but so lacking in an endgoal that leaves it deeply unrewarding.\n\nThe crux of the matter is that the game is called a Car Company Tycoon Game and yet update after update releases another slew of headlights or number plate options without ever getting close to being a tycoon game at all. If the devs ever make good on their original intentions Automation might be one of the most in depth tycoon games ever created but as it stands is an overpriced car builder sandbox lacking the satisfaction of an actual game.\n\nIt is rollercoaster tycoon that lets you build coasters without ever opening a park. Sim city where you build detailed sanitation pumps for a town with no people.\n\nSave your money. If they deliver it will be worth the price tag but at the moment you're paying for not an awful lot.","October 22, 2015","false","6.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","2"

Is this a game you can get about 10 hours of fun out of, yes. is it worth getting now unfinished at a cost of £22 for a beta... No.\n\nThe game as it stands is very limited, it has no more than a few dozen car styles (most older than 2000), only three engines avalible (V8, SV8 and 4c), and ultimately gets boring once youve created a V8 supercar with as much power as possible (because thats all you can do at the moment, there is no career or "tycoon" part avalible yet to progress).\n\nOverall this is a good game and the developers have put alot of effort into it, I woldnt personally spend £22 on it but if you have money to burn and dont mind waiting a few months for the finished product then go ahead, otherwise wait until it progresses a bit.

On my MacBook Pro Retina, gets lots of error messages within the program.  Sometimes I am clicking the send bug report button more than the game interface buttons.  At this stage, design is clunky and more like games from the 90's.  Very limited.  I rarely can make it through to the engine design, since the game encounters so many errors.\n\nNow, this is still early access, so they have the ability to make this a great game.  But so far, the "creation" process is not really any process at all.\n\nI absolutely would wait until this game has evolved more before spending money on it.

Customization on vehicle platforms are very limited, you cannot infinietely change and build the chassis, body, or suspension to look the way you want which is pretty lame. Instead, you are stuck with limitations on body lines, engine sizes due to chassis limitations, and suspension and drivetrain limitations that are not real world. Also, adding body hardware such as lights, exhaust, and bumpers is very limited. when it comes to actually testing the vehicle, the test is super lame!

Subsequent attempts have resulted in the same thing, I can't get passed putting cylinders in the engine before it crashed on me.\n\nSo, I have not experienced much further than that, however even if I was able to get through to the car testing phase, I don't believe there is enough in this game to reflect the price point.  At 10 bucks, i could recommend it, but for 30 dollars there just isn't enough there, for now.\n\nHopefully this game won't be early access on a 10 year plan like a lot of these other ones are, and it reaches the quality that its price demands.\n\nEDIT:  Stop commenting about my computer, my computer is fine, everything runs properly and my drivers are updated.

The game is very interesting and the tutorials are informative and helpful, and actually result in you coming away with a better understanding of how cars work.\nThe game is still in development, so I look forward to it getting better.\n\nThe Bad: It doesn't really work... for me and a bunch of others. As the game is still in development, it is understandably buggy - my version simply does not run, so the last I played this game was its demo version.\n\nThe Verdict: My personal opinion is that you, the potential buyer, wait it out until this game is actually released to make a purchase decision, because in the current state it is frankly a waste of money (again I stress that this is in my opinion).\nThis is a great game, and I would not recommend taking the same path that I did - i.e. buying the beta - because it leaves a sour taste in my mouth due to it being unplayable and extremely buggy.","July 23, 2015","false","20.1"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

While the idea of building/repairing cars or running an automotive company is not new, they managed to go further and squeeze in so much micromanagement and "learning" into it that they made boring and somewhat stale simulator which also looks incredibly dated and cheap - from low res UI and videos, to stock music, this game feels like it was made at least 10 years ago or more.\n\nHowever the main issue are the tutorials. Each section of the game, each part of the car, has its own video tutorial and the further you get into game - the lengthier they become. I get that the developers want to teach the player everything they can but i am 100% sure that i could've gone without such gems as "entertainment system keeps passengers entertained". Some videos go on for what it feels like 10 minutes and i honestly can tell that i did not learn or remembered anything they said, especially since some videos are not yet finished and only include agonizingly boring developer voice.\n\nAgain - i get the idea of trying to teach the player something valuable about cars but its one thing to include some trivia along as you play, and its another when you are force-feeding information which is actually required to play this "game". And you do actually need to learn things they mention in their videos unless you just want to mash sliders at random and hope for the best.\n\nOverall i was impressed with the amount of fine-tuning and options they included but i also was thoroughly annoyed with their videos and stopped paying attention as soon as i got to the "trim" part which had the longest and most boring videos. Figuring out things for myself using tooltips, wikipedia and random clicking wasn't that much fun either.\n\nI do hope that they are planning to change their UI (at least make it high res and look bit less like Windows 95) and completely revamp tutorials while making them interactive, this would make the game so much more interesting and engaging because as it stands right now its more of an excel-car-slider-clicker-video-learning-course than anything else.\n\nAlso the "tycoon" part of the game is not actually in the game yet - you can only build and fine-tune engines and cars just for the "fun" of it. I suppose its good enough for car enthusiasts but for a person who's more interested in the actual strategy/management aspect of the game - its going to be rather dull.\n\nOh what the hell - im voting it down. Someone has to be the bad guy.\n\nP.S.\n\n#bringbackclarkson\n\n#freedomtofracas\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell the developer has responded politely and now i feel completely uncomfortable :( Where are the death threats, deleted reviews and banned accounts? Clearly you are not being professional!\n\nSeriously though - tutorial videos in general aren't that bad of an idea BUT you really do need to time them (don't make them too long) and use better voice, and better animation to keep the player engaged.\n\nAs for an interactive tutorial - you don't have to narrate or animate everything, using tooltips and pointers, perhaps simple "quest" system would suffice. An example:\n\n1) Tooltip appears briefly explaining what is required from the player in this scenario. Player clicks "next" button.\n2) Second tooltip explains where do you have to click, what it will change (for example changing fuel to unleaded) and the "next" button appears when you done so.\n3) ???\n4) Profit.\n5) Rinse and repeat for all the tutorial scenarios, until you teach player everything you want.\n6) Don't forget to include "back" button and/or repeat button so the player can view all of the messages again.\n\nThe main problem with videos is that i did not remember a thing after watching them. I couldn't fast forward them, pause or view and play them at the same time so i could try and learn what you just told me. You want me to know more about cars? Well... use your own game and teach me while i am playing!\n\nAs for the tooltips in the game - they were good enough to explain the basics (as in what is this option i am currently tweaking) but not the interaction between different parts of the car and engine which is the most important part to succeeding in this game.\nI can cope with dated graphics and music but better tutorial is really a must in my opinion for this intricate and complicated game. Take heed in Capitalism 2 - it took 14 years and a remake to actually include decent tutorial in this game, despite it being great otherwise.","March 15, 2015","false","7.1"," 29 of 72 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","29","72","3","6"

You "create" a car without any reason. You cant drive it, only put it on a testtrack and you see your car driving around.\nWhen creating a beast of a motor it can't be fit in ANY car, because the engine is to big. So why can you build a great engine then?\nAnd what about the suspension etc? It is nice to choose which tires, rims, springs etc to place under your car, but you are doing it for nothing. The only time you will see it or have any fun of it is when you are designing your car. It doesn't mean anything, it has no value in the "game".\nThe thing that most annoys me is that you have limited options to build a "good" engine that will actually fit a car.\nTo be quite honest, I'm really into creating and modifying cars, but this game gave me a flashback to the game Streetrod I and Streetrod II, offcourse you can change more settings in the Automation game, but what if you have created a car? Then the fun ends. For example, you can design 30 cars (which look like crap from the outsite by the way) and then you have a list of 30 cars. Then what? Are you going to post on your facebook that you have created an awesome ride? You cant do anything with it. In my opinion, after designing 10 cars you are just burning daylight. I expected much more of this game.\nRefund?#","April 14, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","2","19","2","4"

However it feels very shallow. I built a 900hp car for less than $25k. Not sure that it works right. Also a lot of the the benchmark ratings the game creates like "Driveability" and "Sportiness" have no comparison. I have no idea what my rating MEANS. I got a Driveability score of 50 on a car that does 0-60 in 3.4 seconds. Is that good? Is that awful? Do you need to be the Stig to drive it? or is it damn near self driving? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? I ask that question a lot while playing this game and I don't mean about technical car features- those are all remarkably well explained.

This is basically the kind of game I have been looking for my entire life. The closest I have come to finding something like this is an old DOS program simply called "Car Test." You entered in the parameters and saw performance data. Nothing as in depth as Automation, though. My hopes will be that there will be a huge selection of head lights/tail lights, and all the add-on pieces, as the parts that are currently in the game don't fit well with every body style. I'm sure that the selection will be increased in the future. I would also hope to have more control over the molding of the body shape. Only suggestions I would make is to improve the graphics. The game is quite taxing for the quality of the graphics.

If I have a negative it would be that I feel a little bit miss led, I paid for the game but cant play a campaign, I would of liked to of had that clearly stated before purchase.\n\nTo end with a positive though, I throughly enjoyed playing for the last 6 hours with the content that was available and will recommend giving it a go to anyone who likes cars, engineering and customising.","March 15, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish they would allow you to change head type and block material in an engine family tho, that would make for easier progression of engine designs. I just dont see the point to making a new family to only change the head type and head/block material as you move forward in time. I would love to start My 654 family in the early game and progress the family all the way up to the end game, without having to star over everytime. Other than what has been promised that is the biggest thing i would like to see added to the game, and maybe a better exhaust option. the sticker style works on some cars but not all, so i just dont use them at all half the time.

This is actually  quite fantastic. while it is still in early  realease and there are tons of changes and additions made to it now and then  and on top of the great selection of workshop items  to add to the game.   This is more of a techical game and it's focus is completely  on building the  cars themselves from the floor up frame  body style and engine.  you can give specifications to the interior but not make actual physical changes to it...yet? that might be something cool to see. you can  see how well the car performs by having your tame racing driver take it a spin around a track which you have two to chose from.. which one definitely isn't the top gear test track.  You do have an option to add other custom tracks.  the cars you make can be very unique.  This game still has a LONG way to go  but  is worth the money to spend. it already is worth its price..and as said not even finished.  if you are into  Cars and Tycoon games  get this game. If you love the techinical  side of car building...get this game. if  you are looking for a racing game this isn't it... but still get it because it is awesome.","November 20, 2015","true","65.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of content appears to be not implemented yet. And as of now there are only inline and v engine configurations. I have used the educational materials to teach others how an internal combustion engine works, And the educational videos included are top notch, and more to come as it seems. This is a great sandbox engine for building motors, and the car design aspects are there, but l;eave ALOT of room for improvement. i.e. a 1590cc inline 4 should fit into a crx body no problem; sadly this is not the case. The motor building and configuring works as it should, I was able to recreate a D16y8 motor to exact specs, and it performed exactly as expected in a sim environment. For all of it's flaws this is what has gotten me hooked on this game. I'm excited to see where it goes, and hopeful that some of the things that get to me will be polished up, like proper belts, without broken textures, or passing THROUGH pulleys. And proper "realistic" scaling of engine revolutions based on rpm.\n\nIn it's current state, the game is definitely not worth $30, however I saw this as an investment in the future of the game. I hope I'm not disappointed in the end. And you'll probably read about it if so.","February 22","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This product seemed and is very informative and allows you to learn a great deal about different parts of the car and the evolution of an industry as a whole. They advertise it as "edutainment" and it really is. The knowledge and user-friendly application of gaming elements allows you to learn "first-hand" about cars. I obviously am not the best at this game, so I can't verify how fun it is for a gear head, but I think it would even be fun for them. I am actually mostly looking forward to the campaign mode and building a business and running the behind the sense things appeals to me (I am in the mutual fund world in real life).

Buy it, they've fixed the important bugs (Like being unable to save your car, reinstall your copy of the game if this is occuring) and its only going to improve from here on out! A truly epic engine/car/trim/tycoon simulator. I hope they let us drive the car we build eventually! But I'll be happy just to sell them in tycoon mode once the game includes it and tycoon mode is completed.\n\nI have quite accuratley simulated my everyday drivers engine and my dream engine, Its so accurate it managed to get to within the last kilowatt/horsepower that the actual real life car produces, and how it would handle around a racetrack. My everyday driver unfortunatley would not fare too well.\n\nAt least now I know what an extra 10kW-50kW would do to my everyday driver, nothing at all really in the grand scheme of things. Now I don't need to do these modifications to my car, as I know what kind of deathtrap it would produce without also upgrading the brakes.\n\nSpeaking of brakes, going beyond single piston calipers really isn't worth it, sheer size of the rotors are what matters.\n\nThis "game" can really teach you a LOT about engines/transmissions and body types and their various pros and cons.\n\nOh and don't forget to check out the forums where you can download custom maps, cars, etc:\nhttp://automationgame.com/phpBB3/index.php\n\nI hope that they allow us to have an online multiplayer mode where we can buy and sell completed cars. My car the "carro de los condenado" or "chariot of the damned" with the trim of "danza de la muerte" or "dance with the devil" would probably sell amazingly well.

However, it is lacking quite a lot of components now. Apart from the crashes, it is lacking quite a bit of detail, for example, there isn't even an option for a blow-off valve for the turbo and no hybrids. Also, the lack of interior design and the ability to drive the ca or at least see it in action in 3D instead of just a 2D map makes the gameplay quite unrealistic. So the devs do have a lot to work on, but it is certainly worth it to invest in it.","March 9","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if they add anything about it I'll update the review to say that it has been added, But for now It's only scenarios and sandbox so don't think about running your own company*.\nWhat you notice the first time you launch the game is pretty simple:You build cars.\n(As I was trying to mention earlier,You just build cars.No selling cars or profit and stuff.)\nBut it's early access so it'll get better.\nBut other than that and some saving issues the game is near flawless. Everything is explained perfectly and it's suprisingly easy to understand. In this game there is suprisingly many things to do. You could build real cars. Or a ridicolous supercar (I actually made a car that goes like 450km/h so you can do that.) You can even make a car that's really cheap.Or a really expensive car.\nThis game is awesome.I definatly recommend this game to anyone that likes cars.\n\n8.5/10 (early access score* [read above] might change later.)","September 3, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Number one for negative is that this is by no means a complete game. The Game sometimes can't connect to steam, therefore it crashes. Number two is that The developing process is not as fast as other games like minecraft or Roblox or Kerbal Space Program because the team of developers is small. Don't expect bugfixes every couple of days, but rather a week or so. The positive things are that the tycoon elements are going to be implemented in 2 weeks. Also, The in depth engine and body design are very understandable due to many tutorials. One drawback though is that the tutorials come everytime you do something new in the game (i.e. tweaking fuel mix for the first time.)

You can build your car from scratch or use a pre-made model also choose from a front,middle,rear engine as well as 2x4 and 4x4. The engine customization is just amazing with over 100+ choice of parts and tuning - (timing,ignition,air intake,exhaust diameter,fuel mixture,turbos,I4,I6,V6,V8 and rpm) are the choices you have from many others. This is an early acces game but still very complete,the Engine Designer and Car Designer already available for you to try out.","June 29, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it, they've fixed the important bugs (Like being unable to save your car, reinstall your copy of the game if this is occuring) and its only going to improve from here on out! A truly epic engine/car/trim/tycoon simulator. I hope they let us drive the car we build eventually! But I'll be happy just to sell them in tycoon mode once the game includes it and tycoon mode is completed.\n\nI have quite accuratley simulated my everyday drivers engine and my dream engine, Its so accurate it managed to get to within the last kilowatt/horsepower that the actual real life car produces, and how it would handle around a racetrack. My everyday driver unfortunatley would not fare too well.\n\nAt least now I know what an extra 10kW-50kW would do to my everyday driver, nothing at all really in the grand scheme of things. Now I don't need to do these modifications to my car, as I know what kind of deathtrap it would produce without also upgrading the brakes.\n\nSpeaking of brakes, going beyond single piston calipers really isn't worth it, sheer size of the rotors are what matters.\n\nThis "game" can really teach you a LOT about engines/transmissions and body types and their various pros and cons.\n\nOh and don't forget to check out the forums where you can download custom maps, cars, etc:\nhttp://automationgame.com/phpBB3/index.php\n\nI hope that they allow us to have an online multiplayer mode where we can buy and sell completed cars. My car the "carro de los condenado" or "chariot of the damned" with the trim of "danza de la muerte" or "dance with the devil" would probably sell amazingly well. Especially when the engine is named "La Diablo". (ALL names/makes/models and engine names are copyrighted, no stealing!)\n\nLove it!

You do have an option to add other custom tracks.  the cars you make can be very unique.

NOT a racing game but a very detailed Simulator for the complete construction of a vehicle.\n\nWhat I would like to see further in development would be different/ more variety air filters especially the 4bbl and 2bbl racefilters would it be possible to engineer a more traditional velocity stack and or multple filters for twin 4bbl carbs?\n\nSupercharging, could you run a simple positive displacement blower with mods to cfm per revelution and max boost with the pulley changing size (visually) as you increased or decreased boost, and a simple non-intercooled/intercooled option that simply raised the blower 3 inches higher.\nThen an option for a centrifugul supercharger with mods to a/r ratio, compressor size, and max boost as per the current turbo arangement with the compressor changing sizes and pulley (again visually) and use the current turbo intercooler options?\n\nTurbocharging, single turbo option for V engines.\n\nDiesel, could  diesel possibly be as simple as adding a option to the carb/injection screen with a simple common rail and single throttle option?\n\nMORE BONNET SCOOPS PLEASE reverse cowl, shaker?, hornet scoop (small), single offset (ie early gt falcon)\nAnd more Wheel options a few more 2000+ style factory alloys suited from 16-20 inches?\n\nSorry to rabble but I know that the Devs are working hard and that they listen to all ideas and the automation community and my hats off to them for making this a reality\nThis game/Idea is BRILLIANT 10/10\n","March 31","true","233.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows you to build and tune the engine and a good amount of details about the car.\n\nHowever, the tycoon part of the game is not done yet. In fact, other than demographics charts based on 3 ficticious countries, there is not a  "run your own car company" feature yet. If you take as what it is and what it will and can be, then it is PHENOMINAL.\n\nAutomation is on the track for game greatness. They are taking there time, but they are really getting a lot done for a 3 man team. They are relatively active in the community and on forums. In fact, check out Killrob's little dev updates on youtube to explain newer features and upgrades in the game that may not be explined elsewhere.\n\nIn a nut shell, if GearCity and Automation had a baby, it'd be the best car simlutator to date. Though neither are very optimized. At least not yet. Crashes, bugs, an clunky/incomplete interfaces can become apparent. I really look forward to Automation being ported over to the Unreal engine.\n\nMy biggest complain is slowish development. There is so much to be done to finish the tycoon game, yet there are talking of adding more detail into the car designer aspect right now. While I beleive in the future, adding resonance algorithms and more exhaust and intake design control would be great, we should get the tycoon game running. Once the tycoon game is running, balancing both it and the car designer together will take place and we can develop both. The team seams to focus 90% on the car designing aspect. (As the dev pointed out, that has been changing. They are now focusing more on developing the tycoon portion of the game =D)\n\nAs such, the game is a pretty phenominal car designer and tester. Pretty good visuals and sounds. At least sometimes!\n\nIn short, if you're a "car" person, chances are you'll like this game.","December 10, 2015","true","227.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Seeing the developers actually competing in events and being a part of the HVMC (a motorsport club) really reassures the fact that these people are making a game based on something that they enjoy/love.\n\nThe game is amazing to play. personally I will just spend ages on sandbox messing around with different cars and engines. I cannot wait until the 'campaign' gamemode is released.\n\nOne thing that I would like to see introduced is more engine types.

It seems to have alzheimers. It is incredibly easy for saved cars and engines to become corrupt, and half the time when I make a new trim or variant it forgets the difference even when I press save and just says "Trim 1" and is no different from the old trim. Sometimes the sliders fail to change values in the UI and sometimes the values become corrupt. I had a 2 litre engine and when I came back to it after editing the variant capacity the bore and stroke had increased for some reason and it was now a 1.6 litre. Things slowly became more corrupted until the whole car file could not be read for any trims of any car and I had to delete everything I had made. I know this is an earlyy access build and will be smoothed out, but it is very frustrating that the devs probably arent focusing on it too hard. Other than the current bugs though this game is amazing. The extent the devs have gone to on the detail and how vast everything is truly is amazing, and the concept of the game is great!

If you want to design engines this game will provide a few hours of good fun as it is now. The car designer is good too but the novelty wears off fairly quickly. I bought this game in January of 2014, well before it became available on Steam. It was very hyped and looked promising, but very little has changed in the last two years, and it had already been in development for sime time back then. I have resigned myself to never seeing the tycoon aspect of this game, which is the part I most looked forward to. GearCity is a great tycoon car game that has a very dedicated developer, but it lacks the things that this game excels at (intricate design).\n\nSo, as a sandbox engine designer this game is fun, if a little overpriced, but if you're looking for a fun tycoon style game this is not it (and may never be).","January 23","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It allows you to build and tune the engine and a good amount of details about the car.\n\nHowever, the tycoon part of the game is not done yet. In fact, other than demographics charts based on 3 ficticious countries, there is not a  "run your own car company" feature yet. If you take as what it is and what it will and can be, then it is PHENOMINAL.\n\nAutomation is on the track for game greatness. They are taking there time, but they are really getting a lot done for a 3 man team. They are relatively active in the community and on forums. In fact, check out Killrob's little dev updates on youtube to explain newer features and upgrades in the game that may not be explined elsewhere.\n\nIn a nut shell, if GearCity and Automation had a baby, it'd be the best car simlutator to date. Though neither are very optimized. At least not yet. Crashes, bugs, an clunky/incomplete interfaces can become apparent. I really look forward to Automation being ported over to the Unreal engine.\n\nMy biggest complain is slowish development. There is so much to be done to finish the tycoon game, yet there are talking of adding more detail into the car designer aspect right now. While I beleive in the future, adding resonance algorithms and more exhaust and intake design control would be great, we should get the tycoon game running. Once the tycoon game is running, balancing both it and the car designer together will take place and we can develop both. The team seams to focus 90% on the car designing aspect. (As the dev pointed out, that has been changing. They are now focusing more on developing the tycoon portion of the game =D)\n\nAs such, the game is a pretty phenominal car designer and tester. Pretty good visuals and sounds. At least sometimes!\n\nIn short, if you're a "car" person, chances are you'll like this game.","December 10, 2015","true","227.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
