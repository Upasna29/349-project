This means there isn't platforming, but rather strafing (M+KB), but apart from that much of the gameplay is similar. I will add here that the sprite work is WAY better than Terraria's and though you get less customization overall (1 helm slot, 1 armor slot, 3 accessory slots), I expect this to change as the game develops.\n\nThe farming in this game is absolutely fantastic and mesmerizing, easy to pick up and satisfying to do (also super quick, though I expect this to be tweaked later; currently it's way too easy to just farm up a few hundred loaves of bread and solve your hunger forever).\n\nThis is a criminally overlooked game, probably because in-game there's no guidance whatsoever (might change but I hope it doesn't; discovery is great in it as it is currently).\n\nPros:\n\n- Simple and easy controls, mechanics\n- Visually beautiful - I expect there to be more variety as the game develops as well\n- Familiar gameplay progression (build X to build Y, which lets you build Z, etc.)\n- Farming is satisfying and rewarding (best foods through farming AFAIK)\n- Exploration is satisfying and rewarding (required to get forging materials, early on you get some good stuff through just walking around)\n- You can raise your own pigs/sheep/chicken, something that is often overlooked in many games like this. Unlike Minecraft where you had to gimmick rooms to spawn cows/sheep/whatever before, ranching is built into the game here.\n- Auto-detect nearby crafting stations so you're not always switching back and forth for a single item. Bunch up your related crafting stations.\n- A lot to do in-game despite early access\n\nCons (NOTE: The game is EA when I write this review, I expect most of these to be solved on launch because they are quite significant IMO)\n\n- No multiplayer yet. I would be very sad if the game finished without multiplayer, this seems like a REALLY fun MP game.\n- Hunger rate needs reworking IMO, currently it drops a bit too fast so you're forced to spend a lot of time foraging until you build a farm, after which your hunger issues go from "urgent" to "non-existant" really fast\n- Saves lag my PC for unknown reasons, this is really annoying with auto-save as the game sill simply freeze for about 2-3 seconds every 12-hours in-game time.\n- No way to make multiple items at once (shiftclick, ctrlclick, hold click, etc.); really annoying when you have 1000 logs and need to turn half of those into sticks.\n- No way to split stacks of items, gotta move them wholesale.\n- Item organization button would be extremely useful tbh, it's annoying to manually have to move items every time you craft something.\n- Monster variety could probably be expanded a bit.\n- Updates are slow. AFAIK the team is super small so don't expect this to fully release any time soon. The game is definitely playable but not finished.\n\n\nAlso under cons, but more bug-related:\n\n- Items never disappear from the map (they just blink forever)\n- You can activate doors and refill troughs from across the screen, not sure why this happens\n\nOverall, for an EA game it's surprisingly well polished and I'm really looking forward to release. Honest 9/10 if you don't count the mildly annoying bugs that come with the game not being finished.","February 7","true","13.5"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","36","36","0","0"

No other compensation was given.\n\n\nIntroduction\n==========\n"Ahoy matey! Me ship crashed on this island, leavin' me alone on this godforsaken island. It's up t' me t' find a way t' survive! This be a survival craftin' game, much like Minecraft, Terraria, and other games in t' genre. I have t' collect resources t' make what I need t' get by. Fightin' monsters, buildin' shelter, makin' food...all be skills that I will need t' survive on this mesterious island."\n\n\nGameplay\n==========\nForsaken Isle literally dumps you onto a large island with next to nothing. There is no story, except for what is found on the store page. You play as a pirate whose ship crashed on this island. You don't start with anything. You'll have to forage for supplies and gather resources to build and craft tools to build and survive. The first night is very important, as you should be able to build some walls around yourself with a campfire to light your area, to ward off monsters.\n\nThere is a somewhat robust character creator (robust for this type of game with it's graphics), allowing different heads, hair, and other features. There is also a random option.\n\nAs you discover new materials and resources, new recipes are made available to you. But it's your job to discover them and put them to use! This is one of the fun aspects of any survival game: figuring out what does what, what makes what, and what's useless. You can also find/craft weapons and armor, which grant you different effects, such as increased defense or movement speed.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nForsaken Isle is entirely pixel based. Everything looks really crisp and detailed for being sprite-based. While this isn't a heavy 3D modelled game like something from a AAA title, it works. The retro pixel style they've used here is very appealing, and suprisingly pleasant.\n\nEquipping different tools, weapons, and armor all change how your character looks. Put on a Wolf Helm, you'll see a wolf head on your character. Holding a sword? You'll see the wooden sword being brandished.\n\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThis is the game's lowest point: There is absolutely NO music in the game whatsoever. MOst everythign has a sound effect though: sword slashes, digging, animals, picking up items...but no music. Not even ambient sound effects like crickets or whatnot. Being an Early Access title, it is safe to assume that the music is just not ready to be implemented yet, and I'm sure it will be in the future. For now, this is a great game to play with your own playlist blasting in the background!\n\n\nPerformance\n==========\nIn the dozen hours I played I ran into no issues with the game. No FPS drops, no lag, no stuttering. It's a very minimal game, no one should have any issues running Forsaken Isle. Heck, even a toaster could run it!\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nA worthy entry into the survival genre that's not an obvious copy of another title, it's almost too good to be true! With some great systems and gameplay already set in place, Forsaken Isle should shape up nicely in the coming months as it runs through Early Access. If you don't want to drop the $8 on it now, just keep an eye out for the next few updates. Even if you do buy it now and are disappointed, $8 isn't as much as some of the AAA titles that have bombed recently and there's a chance it'll shape up into something you'd enjoy later.\n\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/wrrHsEeT9xU\n\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","50","60","0","4"

Looking at past updates it seems like it only gets update once every few months. Also, being so close to 1.0 (its already at 0.9.4) it really doesn't appear to have enough content. It becomes quite boring and repetitive after a few hours.\n\nAdditions I would like to see:\n-portable light system\n-more cooking recipes ( a lot more)\n-more armor/clothes variants\n-more enemy variants\n-different types of fishing poles and bows\n-fish that are specific to certain areas (underground and swamp)\n-more magic items\n-possibly a small hidden village for bartering\n-actually have to grow food for animals instead of just clicking trough\n\nThis game has so so so so much potential and I really hope the dev(s) take full advantage of it. With just a bit more work this could easily be a indie goty and worth $10-$15.","March 27","true","18.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Although it is Early Access, it is very stable and fun, but could use a bit more polish.  I'm still having a lot of fun crafting items and designing my home base, however.\n\nPROS\n+ Simple, effective controls make gathering items and fighting monsters a breeze\n+ Large overworld with multiple biomes and underground cave systems to explore\n+ Building house/farm/base is easy and fun\n+ Progressive crafting and hunger systems encourage exploration\n+ Charming graphics\n\nCONS\n- Experimenting to find recipes is fun and rewarding at first, but quickly grows very frustrating\n- No tutorial, quests, or instructions makes the initial hour of the game seem a bit daunting\n- Dragging items from inventory to storage or crafting window sucks (needs a "Shift-Click to move" setting BADLY)\n- No storyline or quests makes it seem a little lifeless\n- Minimal sound effects and virtually no music","February 7","true","12.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It has everything you would ever need in an island survival game, even pizza! Besides that, it still has an interesting crafting system and plenty of mobs to 'engage' with. Worth the price if you are willing to gather enough in order to make some really neat farms, caves, and bases. Best part about that, is it doesn't take much to gather all these resources. You do not have to fight a million mobs constantly just for iron ore in the underground systems! It's all very simple and thought out (however I do recommend the wiki, as there is tons of stuff to try out!).\n\nOverall, a relaxing game that should be constantly added to and, honestly, it should be more popular.","February 24, 2015","true","8.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

All are great Survivor/Collector/Adventurer/Builder games.\n\nForsaken Isle puts a fresh spin on these greats with an early access, but solid concept with the appeals of some of my personal favorite types of games. After my first few deaths from starvation, wraiths, and other carnivorous monsters, I began to get the hang of this little game. before long, I was mining ores for weapons and armor, farming too much food to eat, and catching the all too cute piggies for my pig pin. I've been chopping through forests, fighting tribal tiki people deep in marshy jungles, and fought hordes of zombie pirates and goo balls in the cavernous depths below my growing homestead. before I knew it, 6 hours of my life were gone, and I had only bought it 7 hours ago.\n\nthere's plenty going on in this game for an early access, and I'm hoping there will be a consistent updating... Forsaken Isle could go places on the right track.\n\nAs for what attracted and hooked me in to this? Well...\n-Terraria-esque, pixel-art graphics paired with an overview, fixed angle camera, gives the feel of good old' Dungeon Crawlers.\n-painfully simple controls make the learning curve a breeze, and easy to get in to.\n-Collect, craft, and survive a rugged land full of monsters, mysteries, and many things to explore.\n-An interesting crafting system encourages you to discover new items through trial and error.\n-A simple and clean farming system; no watering, no fancy irrigation layouts, just a tilled plot of land and an interesting selection of fruits and veggies.\n-Thwack, smack, and slash monsters with an array of weapons from swords to boomerangs, to blowpipes and throwing knives.\n-wide variety of crafting stations start you from humble wood and stone tools to the fancy living style of jewelry and pizza.\n\n--The biggest of my qualms that I have with the game is the rapid pace that your hunger bar drops, leaving you scurrying around for food, or dying of starvation (it will happen... more frequent than you'd think.).\n--Armor, you get a head, torso, and 3 accessory slots for the likes of rings, boots, etc.\nI'd like to see boot/leggings get their own slot, and maybe some sort of shielding... but perhaps it's best in its simplicity.\n--my other issue, it a small one... the sounds... there's a squawking bird that could come down an octave or two, but that's why they made mute buttons.\n\nAltogether, Forsaken Isle, with its retro pixel art graphics, easy to learn aspects like farming and fighting, will quickly have you losing hours off your day. And if you're a fan of the likes of Minecraft and Terraria, this needs to be in your Library.","February 8","true","78.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty soild though there is a bit of a learning curve. It's not difficult, but it's a good idea to keep in mind that you'll probably want to start a new character at least once after you get the hang of how the game works.\nThey switched up the graphics compared to the screenshots, there's an actual clock in the top center of the screen which is pretty nice.\n\nThere is one thing that is pretty annoying though: Occasionally at dawn or dusk the game will crash. Not a clue why. But the game's autosave does a nice job and you literally can pick up exactly where it crashed. Thus far I have not lost anything due to this random crash. Just an annoyance at this point.\n\nBut it is still in early access, thus for what it is, I would recommend.","May 2","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The wiki needs a lot of work to catch up with all the changes being made.\nTake 'Don't Starve' and any of the early 'Harvest Moon' games, swirl them together, pour into a 16 bit mold and you get 'Forsaken Isle'.\nWithout the wiki, the learning curve would be overwhelming. There is no tutorial. You stand up on the world/land you will be playing on. You can customize your character a bit, although with 16 bit graphics, it doesn't matter much. There is no prompt for a name because this is a single player game and you should already know your name.\nTo craft, open your inventory and move items from left to the right area. When you have the ability to craft something with any of those combination of items, it will be listed below. Click on the item and it's made.\nWatch your food. Hunger hurts and if you don't pay attention. you can suddenly start taking damage and have no clue where it's coming from. This can make your character run around in circles while you (the player) panic and reach to your phone ready to call 991... er... That didn't happen, really. It probably won't happen to you either.\n\nFor this early access game, I say yes, it's worth the price. At the very least, it'll show Smoodlez I enjoyed it.

I love crafting/survival games so this is right up my alley. If I didn't like anything about it it would be that you just have to play around with your inventory and guess how to make things. It doesn't give you any help with how to make things until you've already made it. Also, and this could be a problem personal to me, but when I save the game it freezes and it doesn't give me any notification that it is actually saving. It does the same thing when it autosaves - it just freezes the game for a few seconds. Typically I don't mind this, but it's usually because it has some kind of loading bar or wheel or something to let me know the game didn't just crash.

Don't get me wrong, magic is always my favorite features in FANTASY games, but in a pirate based survival game, it just dosen't fit well. Maybe something else would be more fitting like using the mana bar as an enegry bar, and energy instead is consumed by unique skills that could be attached to certain weapons.

I've plaid a fair bit and still haven't crafted half the items in this game. The doungen only becomes interesting after going a couple of levels down, the first few are very familiar and empty. I found a portal, which i couldn't find any access into, and a maze which had an alter but didn't know what to do with it so i assumed these where unfinished developments. Very interested in finding out oneday though. I found myself getting lost without a map of some kind, especially in the lower doungen. Farming is great, crops grow too fast though, by the end of a 3 hour run i had a mass of carrots building up which pretty much kept me fed the entier game. Little confused about which crafting station i was activly using as there is no indication however the GUI is beautiful, loved it. Never got close to using magic in this game, its really a "end-game" mechanic unless you know the crafting recipies to begin with. Interested to try adventure mode next. I found there to be not much verity of mobs, or not enouth, they where also really weak and easy to kill. I would love to see more go into this game, it has great potential with already tons of content that can get you a good 4-5 hours+ of gameplay, will defineltly be playing again.\n\nCon's Conclusion:\n- Crops grow too quickly.\n- Not enouth monster veriety, too weak and easy to kill.\n- Recipies dificult to figure out without consulting the wiki.\n- Early-on pickaxes tend to break really quickly but this isn't a major issue, they are easy to craft.\n- Magic is not easy to figure out.\n- No shift click, or picking up items into hotbar.\n- Little to no guidance to newbs so you have to have the patience to figure stuff out.","February 15","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not going into technicals because I honestly don't know what it needs and also I'm not use to retro crafting games too so it just might be me so I am a tad slow in learning and getting a grasp onto this game.

WIth just a little experimentation I was able to understand how to play the game.\n\nThe art style is very fun, and overall very well done. The way the game plays with pixel art effects is fantastic and makes the whole style tie together. Unlike some pixel art games that look like the developer was attempting to be lazy with the graphics, Forsaken Isle looks well polished and refined.\n\nThe lack of a tutorial is both a pro and a con in my book, depending on how you look at it. Pro: it gives the game a lot more feeling. You really have to learn everything to survive. Con: before you can play, you have to learn the basic controls on how to move and interact with stuff. I would assume that our character knew how to walk and pick up rocks before he became Forsaken on this Isle.\n\nAnother thing is the lack of a full-featured save system. You can save your game, but only one game. I haven't really found this to be an issue because I love just taking a few minutes to go into my Isle and do some farming or build another room for my house and having this long-running story where I'm focused on just one character. But on the other hand, I am currently working on an introductory steam guide for the game and would love to have the ability to quickly choose between loading different save files so I could have a main save file for playing and a different one for taking pictures or exploring for the guide.\n\nI realize this game is still in Early Access so any negatives stated above could very well be fixed by the time the game is finished. Some other early access problems that exist right now is the lack of usage for crafting tables or resources. Some crafting tables have very few things you need them for (so far the only recipe for the cooking table is pizza, unless there's one I haven't discovered) and some resources have very few uses. I expect problems like these to sort themselves out though as the game progresses.\n\nAll in all this is a fun game! It is definitely poised to become one of my favorites!\n\nMy rating for the current alpha version (v.0.9.0): 8.5/10\n\nBut by the end of Early Release, I can easily see this game becoming a 10/10!","February 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's no jumping on platforms (like Terraria), no risk of falling down/jump on the wrong spot, etc.\nYou just walk around, gather, digging, explore, discovering new recipes. crafting. Sure there's action and killing if you want but if you don't feel like it you won't/barely have to as long as you built yourself a safe place.\n\nI'm not a fan of waiting a long time for nights to end. In Forsaken Isle, nighttime duration is tuned very well imo. So far I spent the nights to sort my gathered loot/mats and put it in storage, replenish your tools, bandages. ammo and food, maybe discover some new recipes. And when I'm done it won't take long for sunrise.\n\nForsaken Island has plenty for both action and relaxing players, and the game has a very nice price as well.

I also have not played it in a while. But what I remember is overall game play was okay fun wise. Crafting, on the other hand, is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Other reviewers mentioned that you have to try and try and try again different things in order to find recipes. One reviewer said in his opinion he liked that. My opinion is it's a crappy way to design a game. Or anything really. Unless the game itself is ABOUT discovering recipes.\n\nMaybe I'm misremembering what the game is about. But from what I recall we are basically stranded on an island. A pirate island maybe? Who cares? To me it's about survival and adventure. Exploring. But if any one of us were to be 'stranded' on an island we wouldn't suddenly find that everything we'd learned in life before was poof, gone! We'd still know what a hammer is and nails. A saw and a knife. We'd know what the frack a stick was and we could, quite easily, fashion a bloomin spear or hatchet(thought maybe not very effective ones) from handy materials WITHOUT having to craft some convoluted 'crafting station' to do so.\n\nTo me crafting is annoying and filled with frustrations. I ended up opening my browser to look up recipes. To mw that's NOT a well designed game. What happens if the info gets deleted or the recipes change? It IS early access after all. The developer recently added in a crafting book. I think with that he's on the right track to fixing one of the primary reasons why I quit playing the game. He claims he plans on adding to it so that we get hints or something on how to proceed and  craft other interesting or needed items. I hope so. But now we come to the second main reason I don't recommend the game in it's current state. Updates are extremely rare. So rare it makes me wonder if he's lost his motivation or interest in continuing the game.\n\nMy recommendation is wait. The game isn't much fun as it is. In fact, I've been considering uninstalling it and putting it in a steam 'category' that I use for hiding games I don't play. So that's basically $8-$10 down the drain unless the dev/'s release more updates which remove the annoyance factors from the game.","April 29, 2015","false","6.4"," 6 of 39 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","6","39","0","0"

I managed to create a hammer, but since there are no explanations, I didn't know what it was good for. I found some boots, but didn't know what to do with them or where to put then for them to be useful. I found a torch, but I couldn't use it or place it or do anything with it. After hitting every key on the keyboard and clicking the mouse madly, I just gave up on it and this game.\n\nWhat I guess is night came, I was instantly surrounded and killed. Gee, that makes a lot of sense, on the first night, most games try to atleast give you a chance to survive. I should also mention, night comes fast, you won't have time to do much of anything.\n\nCrafting is hit or miss. You throw items into the crafting window and hope you can make something out of it. There are no recipes for anything, you get to try to figure it all out by yourself. Only thing you have is a tech tree to see what items you've discovered, by what you've picked up. I couldn't even figure out how to make an axe, and I'm not new to crafting games. 2nd game, I couldn't even find a stick (I'm pretty sure you need one for something).\n\nYou also have hunger which goes down remarkedly fast.  I couldn't keep up with it. The other 2 were health and what I guess is energy. Again, no explanations for anything.\n\nI noticed in the key features it states "free updates" So what, you were considering charging for updates?\n\nUnless you're a die hard fan of this game, the only thing you'll be doing after trying it out is deleting it.","May 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 43 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","4","43","0","3"

I haven't had too much time to play it, but for the length of time it has been out it is very well rounded game. The best description I can give is that it is like a top-down version of Minecraft. The crafting system in particular is very nice, especially with how it shows you what can be built with what you have through the Recipe Book.\n\nThe only complaints I have at the moment are lack of variety and the scarcity of ores. Once you have a base established it can be rather repetitive (farm, get wood, look around underground a bit, repeat), but the game is still expanding, so that will probably change. Finding usable ores can be difficult, as enemies can come at you from all sides underground.\n\nAs for suggestions, I would like to see other islands to be traveled to, with different environments, like alpine or volcanic. Maybe introduce a way to build a ship, or summon one with a ghost pirate compass.

The dev looks like he's interacting with the community a lot which is great to see; it was that which persuaded me to buy it in the first place.\n\nGame play is fun. Bopping around the island with a spear murdering evil pigs is always good for a laugh and the depth of crafting is impressive. I like the fact that all the recipes aren't handed to you on a plate. Experimentation makes it feel a lot more survival orientated.\n\nI haven't got all that far yet but from what I have played I can wholly reccomend this game to anyone who loves Don't Starve, Gnomoria, Terraria or even Minecraft. I just hope that the dev's obvious love for his game doesn't run dry before it's finished.","November 30, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game through and through, its entirely developed by one person and is just so much fun. The crafting, atmosphere, and overall art scheme is my favorite in this type of genre. Its a nice casual survival game with some great crafting that keeps you interested to just see what else you can make!\n\nWith the recent updates it has balanced the underground (which at one point was nearly impossible to adventure too due to insane amount of enemies spawning). The combat is well balanced and fun, and isn't unfair in anyway. With the recent update though I will say the combat became easy, maybe too easy but still fun. Buy it on sale or full price, either way you'll be satisfied.","January 4","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The food system is wrong  12 for a pineapple  20 for bread and 15 for pizza   pizza clearly should heal more since it takes more to make\n\n2. There is way too much lag produced with the torches\n\nfix theses issues please so i dont have to play this game in the dark the whole time","November 28, 2015","true","37.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good large list of craftables already, with a large amount of the fun in discovering what does what and how. Interface is still a bit counter-intuitive for me (closing/opening/etc doesn't work with the keys I automatically expect them to), but it's easy to use once you figure it out. Considering early access status, those kinds of things can still be tweaked.\n\nHappy so far, will be following for updates. For my intitial "blind" reactions (I normally play completely blind, but did play this to get a feel first before recording), see the following video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XMxgpfAV8XA","July 1, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Smoodlez (Dev) is a really nice guy and is always happy to tell you recipes for stuff and he does a good job at it!\n\nI enjoy this game a lot and defenity recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like games like FI I don't but I really like it","May 27, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks simple but it manages to really pull you in. Being early access, there are still a number of issues but they will undoubtedly be resolved before too long. You play as a pirate stranded on a desert island and you must use the resources around you to survive. The game is built in the same vein as minecraft, terraria and starbound and there are loads of crafting recipes to discover. Even though there isn't much of an endgame yet (I've only encountered 2 bosses so far) the gameplay is addictive and oddly relaxing at the same time.","February 8","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics, the sandbox the exploration, everything. Add more conent, and this is sure to be an amazing game. I do have one major gripe about it. The crashes. They are very frequent and happen mostly when i try to load a world, or save. Other than that, this is definitley one of my favorite gams atm. kkep up the good work. (also I personaly really like the way the game looks in the screenshots as apposed to v. 0.9.5, is that just me?) :p","May 29","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thing is it will not load at all. Have posted the error in discussions and given as much detail as is generally requested to help the dev troubleshoot the issue but there has been no response in over a week.\n\nUpdate: Have an older version of the game running using a beta code provided in the discussion forum and for being a earlier version with no sound it is very good.","May 22","true","3.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
