I really mean that. Don't say you weren't warned.\nI DO RECOMMEND watchlisting or following it if you like sandbox games in general.\nIf you want more details, read further to understand.\n\n[ BACKGROUND AND DISCLAMERS ]:\n- Me and Empyrion:\nI got to know Empyrion through Scott Manley's Youtube Channel 2 weeks before the Steam Early Access Release, and decided that I would most definitely give it a go.\nI went through ~97% of the game - I got all the resources I need and explored (probably) everything, but didn't build a Capital Ship yet.\n\n- The Team:\nEmpyrion is made by 3 indie devs. They pushed through a failed kickstarter, and here is the (early) result. They seem nice, and determined.\n\n- This Review:\nI'll first describe the game with as little personal notes as possible, and in the end I'll give my take on whatever I find necessary. This way, I save both your time and mine! :)\n\n[ REVIEW ] :\n\n> INTRODUCTION:\nYour capital ship crashes on an alien planet. Left with a escape pod, you must gather resources and craft your way back to space.\nCrafting, mining, building, hunting, surviving, running for your life when things go wrong. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\nEmpyrion provides a very immersive and fresh experience for those who like survival and sandbox games.\n\n> GAME FEATURES:\n\nSURVIVING is your first priority and your constant goal in Empyrion. You must find Water to generate Oxygen, hunt, scavange or forage for food, and find Promethium Ore to make Fuel to power all your operations!\n\nMINING is crucial. You'll need to find resource deposits and strike the earth in order to build your base, vehicles and personal items. Mining is done by equipping your drill and digging - vehicles don't mine yet.\n\nCRAFTING and BUILDING is a main part of the game. Much like Space Engineers, every final item is comprised of components which you must craft first. Removing a block will return its components, so remember to bring your Removal Tool to rip those expensive components from ships and bases you find in your expeditions!\nBuilding your base is straightforward, and can end up looking pretty nice.\n\nVEHICLES are critical for survival, exploration and progress. You can build a hovering Ground Vehicle, Small Vessels for interplanetary and atmospheric flights (as well as small-scale combat and raids), or Capital Vessels for (not yet implemented) intergalatic travel and serious combat operations.\n\nCOMBAT can happen on ground or in space. You can also be inside a ship or on foot, which makes things great: what if you leave your ship, but get flanked or surprised by the enemy?\nYou can also hunt wildlife for food and resources.\n\nThe EXPLORATION vibe is definitely there. Even on initial release, you can't help but wonder what awaits you when you look at the night sky - or when seeing a weird building from a distance when you're still a survivor with just a escape pod. Maybe you could cannibalize or take over whatever that thing is, and turn it against your enemies (or against the unsuspecting wildlife)?\nIt's something I was looking forward in a survival sandbox space game for ages.\n\n> GAME ASPECTS:\n\nGRAPHICS: Very good for an indie game, but could definitely look better. Yet, I wasn't bothered by it.\n\nSOUND:  Decent, but needs mastering, attention and variety - which are probably planned.\n\nINTERFACE: Simple and straightforward, if you have played any similar games you'll be ready to go in minutes. The lack of a tutorial or proper in-game instructions WILL make things harder and more tiresome for non-hardcore fans. Be ready.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Survive, mine, craft, build, fly. The gameplay and progression already feels nice, and the game doesn't take you by the hand. You're free to do whatever, whenever, however you decide.\n\nBUGS AND ISSUES: There was a big number of release issues and bugs, some people even had their savegames corrupted or fallen out of the world. I didn't experience anything gamebreaking like that, but there's a lot of minor things that can get on the way of your fun. Still, it feels more polished than many Early Access titles I've played.\n\n> PERSONAL NOTES:\n\n= Positive:\n- Regarding GAMEPLAY: Even though story and quests/missions are planned, I love how YOU choose where to go.\nThere's an obvious way to go about things ("now I need X ore that's only available on Y planet in order to build Z item"), but you can ignore that and end up getting end-game gear by your own means and creativity. I REALLY hope this doesn't change with development.\n\n- Random, non-scripted "events": Sometimes, circumstance might surprise you. You might be distracted and hear a weird noise, and a squad of drones are coming for you..and you forgot to craft a better gun and more ammo. This sort of stuff is what could potentially make Empyrion the best space sandbox out there, but it only happened one time..and I was probably lucky.\n\n-  Currently, I believe food and oxygen requirement is well balanced: you won't have to run every 5 minutes back to base, but if you neglect your needs you might find yourself in deep trouble. Which is always fun.\n\n- The game has a good selection (for an Alpha) of weapons. Choices for personal weapons include Assault Rifle, Sniper, Rocket Launcher and Laser Rifle, and ships have both (automatic/manual) Turrets and fixed weapons like the Gatling Gun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Cannon or Rail Gun.\n\n= Negative:\n- The Unknown: There's a LOT of work to be done before it makes sense to buy and play this game. How commited is the team? What is the roadmap and milestones? Will the annoying stuff ever get fixed? There's a lot of questions like these, which are critical for EA titles to answer first.\n\n- Annoying bugs/half-made features: Crafting takes a LOT (and I mean, A LOT) of time and requires you to manually craft EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT. Removing blocks take AGES. Mouse-wheel doesn't work. Flight model feels bad. And so on, and so forth. This makes playing the game rather painfully after the first hour or so. Is player convenience a priority?\n\n- Space-Flight and Space-Combat must be redone from scratch. Both as an astrounaut or in a Small Ship, space-flight is terrible and space combat is insanely bad. Getting near an enemy in space will break your controls and make you lag and wonder what happened.\n\n- Community, Hype and Fanboying: This kills games. I've seen criticism be bashed simply due to hype or 'fandom'. There's a real HUGE amount of things to be done and fixed, and dodging/dismissing feedback and criticism is not the way to go. I didn't see much developer interaction (on Steam forums), and I hope people get more of it.\n\n> CONCLUSION:\nThe core concept and gameplay from this Early Access title definitely deserves to be noted and followed, but it doesn't make sense to buy it yet - unless you're really, REALLY into it.\nPeople who played the very first moments (before building an actual base, vehicles, and getting to space) loved it - and I did too. But after these ~2 first hours, the current state of the game presents itself.\n\nThere's A LOT of work to be done in Empyrion, more than people seem think or talk about. There's many critical issues to be fixed or developed, and it's still unknown wether the ACTUAL content (planned storyline and progression) will make any sense. There's no human/alien 'sentient' NPCs or any trace of a story/quest system, and the space part of the game is really terrible and not developed at all. This is why I can't recommend you to jump head-first into it.\n\nTherefore, put your expectations in line, take a deep breath, and make your choice.\nThanks for reading! :)","August 18, 2015","true","55.9"," 484 of 505 people (96%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","96","484","505","22","32"

I was about halfway there when I had a great idea and decided to go to one of the little alien towers near the lava planet that looks like a satellite, I took out what I thought were all of the massive plasma rocket cannon thingies, pulled in close to go salvage the core and be on my way, when suddenly I heard a big huge explosion, I was face to face with a huge plasma turret which had been hidden on the other end of the satelllite. Just like that my ship was without any fuel tanks to power up with, my emergency ship parts at the time did not include fuel tanks, only RCS, generator, & a couple directional thrusters. I was distraught, there is no way to get back down to my large constructors on Akua to repair the ship. I'm going to lose a whole days worth of preparation and it's gonna be a sad day. That's when I checked my inventory one last time and saw a spare core, it was at this time I knew I only had 1 option left. Assault the massive alien base that looks like a giant satellite on foot, with nothing but my assault rifle, 250~ bullets, & my trusty remove & repair tool. I set off towards the gigantic intimidating space station, the closer I got, the more I knew this was going to end with my backpack floating around in space, lost forever. The base was absolutely covered head to toe with those giant plasma rocket turrets, usually the bases on a planet have 5-6, sometimes even 10 turrets that can destroy a basic SV in 1-2 hits, this base had at least 30-40 rocket turrets on the outside. I charged the station, zig zagging up & down, left & right, just narrowly avoiding what felt like thousands of missiles and plasma blasts. I slammed against the side of the station and immediately used my remove&repair tool to bust inside, where I was met with a space station full of automatic turrets that were shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and causing me to panic. I cleared the first room of turrets and took a moment to think, my oxygen was running very low, time was getting shorter, at this point I figured I'd never forgive myself if I came all this way for nothing, so I pressed on. I went through a hallway in to a room that was covered in turrets, I took them out with my assault rifle from afar, upon walking in, I hear and see a huge explosion right in front of me, one of the massive plasma cannons outside had shot a hole in the wall of the space station, blowing up several fuel tanks and almost killing me. Short on oxygen, health, food, & ammo, things were looking grim. Eventually, I fought my way to the top of the space station, where I was overcome with joy when I found a small room containing the core, a fuel tank, and 2 constructors. I did it! I replaced the core with my own, threw some fuel in the tanks, & made myself a brand new fuel tank for my SV. I have never felt so victorious in any game ever, against insurmountable odds, I managed to fight my way though a hail of gunfire, giant face-melting missiles, & a dwindling oxygen tank to salvage my ship and my mission. I returned to Akua to make some much needed cosmetic repairs to my ship, as well as a lot more armor covering just about everything on the ship that can explode when shot by those horrifyingly powerful turrets. Learned my lesson after that, always have a plan b in this game, because if you're not prepared for just about anything, you're going to have to pull some crazy ♥♥♥♥ like that in order to salvage the situation :P","September 10, 2015","true","224.1"," 346 of 377 people (92%) found this review helpful 145 people found this review funny","92","346","377","145","10"

What I do want to do, is give you a fair assessment of the game.\nThis is a Pre-Alpha game. I’m writing this while the game is currently at PA 3.5.something-or-other (*1). That said, there are some things that it lacks. A plot for one. If you want a story (as of right now) move along. If you are expecting perfection, move along. If you’re expecting a million dollars, get in line, send me half, or move along.\n\nI read through several reviews of this game before and after purchasing it. Those who have played the game for less than an hour have generally (and undeservingly) given negative reviews. Yes, this game has issues. It’s not perfect (*2). It has some flaws. But to insult a game based on less than 60 minutes because it’s not perfect or does not fit your play style is not entirely fair.\n\nThose who have played 40+ hours and have given it negative reviews; I have read them and can relate to most of their frustrations and experiences. Read them! (*3) You may find that what you and the reviewer expect from a game that (currently) costs about $20 are similar. If they sway you away from buying the game, that’s fine.\n\nThings to help you with a decision:\nDo you/did you like Minecraft; before the Ender Dragon and “beating the game”?\n\nDo you like survival games? Imagine Seven Days to Die - in space, without the never ending hordes of zombies ripping your base (that you spent 20 hours on) apart in minutes. (Although there’s drones to worry about, but there’s way’s to avoid them)\n\nDo you enjoy challenges? Figure it out on your own, or pull up your trusty search engine and start researching. Either way, there’s lots of trial and error.\n\nAre you expecting perfection? This game is well made. Hell, I’d imagine a few big name companies releasing it “as is” with all the hype and a very large Zero-Day patch followed by several patches and DLC’s later to make it a real game… It’s not perfect. Not by a long shot, but it’s progressing. Very well too.\n\nAre you okay with dumping hours and hours (20-60) into a game, knowing that there’s a possibility to  lose it all when a new patch comes out? All in the name of progress?\n\nAs of right now, this game is Minecraft in space. Similar to Space Engineers, but not quite. While there’s no real goal other than to survive, it’s going to be more than that when it’s through. It reminds me a lot of SDtD: the textures, the crafting style, etc. But it’s more enjoyable because there’s not random zombies and hordes spawning every 15-30 minutes hell bent on tearing apart all you’ve worked for. Although, there are “waves” of drones now every 20-30 minutes. They’re pretty easily overcome and there’s a warning too.\n\nDo you enjoy developer support? This game has it. I have emailed the game developers on several occasions and have received plenty of personal replies back. It lets me know that my voice matters. I’m contributing and not just some a stupid consumer who has nothing offer. The community is helping and the developers listen! Their forum's very active. http://empyriononline.com/forums\n\nThat said, there’s been several times I’ve found myself stuck/lost/stranded and unable to “progress”. Some of these times have been my own fault. I didn’t know any better, or I didn’t prepare, etc. People who complain about losing hours of work because of this or that happening, should take advantage of the “backup” system. People who tell of losing weeks because of corrupted save files have my sympathies. I too, have lost hours of play time because of corrupted saves. It’s pre-alpha. I have walked away from this game (and subsequently, the computer) so often in the last few months that my wife is no longer surprised at me beginning a conversation with her over a cigarette and some coffee (or a beer) in the garage (*4). This game has its faults, to be sure. However. This game really fills a niche - for me at least.\n\nThis game has its problems:\nThere’s no plot. After you’ve “done” everything, there’s not much more to do but wait around or start over.\n\nThere’s some glitches: You can fall through the map. Yup. It’s 2015 and games still break like that. Check out their forum for more. http://empyriononline.com/forums/bugs.24/\n\nPlease, be informed before you buy this game! Honestly if I could give a “Mixed” recommendation, I would. I know this game is not for everyone, but it really bothers me when people give negative reviews because it doesn’t “fit” their style. But then again... (*3)\n\n*1 Not the official version.\n*2 Who is, really?\n*3 But, you know, do what you want. I’m not a cop or anything.\n*4 Just kidding. I don’t so much talk to her as such. It’s more I stare at my beer while she stares at her Kindle, reading.","October 25, 2015","true","473.0"," 229 of 250 people (92%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","92","229","250","62","14"

Then kaboom. Two drones, one laser, one plasma, blew my ship to shreds and I am now floating in free space with nothing but a handful of emergency rations and the limited oxygen supply in my space suit. A silouette of what appears to be a research station just outside the nearest asteriod belt catches my eye and I immediately turn towards it purging the last few pounds of O2 in my space suit to gain forward velocity. The two drones lurk behind me relentlessly firing.\nAs I get closer to the research station, I notice it's heavily armed with auto plasma turrets and AI drones. I am almost out of O2 now, the immediate future feels very grim at this time. I push on. If I could just sneak past the enemies and slip into the space station, I could probably find an O2 station and a few mre rations to get me by temporarily. I'm approaching the near vicinity of the turrets detection range now and all turrets begin attacking in sync. Now I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They blew up the ship I spent hours perfecting, then chased me all the way through the asteroid field, and are now joining forces with this hostile facility in a mutual effort to end my existence. I'm now almost completely out of O2, so I use the last of it flying around the turrets in circles until they literally shoot each other trying to hit me as I purposely time the cycle of their shots to dodge at the right time. But what their scanners didn't pick up is that this man is Chuck Norris. So I destroyed the AI core and replaced it with my own, and powered up my new space base :)\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of sci-fi entertainment and voxel based sandbox games, buy this game now.\n\nFirst of all, this is one of the few early access games out there that is not only regularly updated but actively developed by the dev team. Now for the content review.\n\nEmpyrion is a free roaming sandbox game, where you fight for survival in an open universe. You begin the game plummeting through the atmosphere in a small escape pod watching the surface of the planet you chose get closer and closer. After crashing down sometimes on land or at the bottom of an ocean, you leave your vessel behind and begin your journey.\n\nIn Empyrion, you can freely build bases, hovercraft, space vehicles, galactic space travel vessels, even space stations or asteroid mining facilities. The sky is the limit, as you can easily build anything you can imagine using the unique construction system. The beautiful part about buiding is the simulated physics. For example, if you have too much weight on one side of your ship, you will directly feel that imbalance when you pilot the vessel. The placement of all objects, balance, thruster force and direction, are all factors that affect the way your ship flys, including turning speed, and even precise directional acceleration. You have full access to fuel consumption, power generation, power drain and other data directly from the cockpit. Take my word, the ship system is amazing in its complexity and is very satisfying.\n\nDedicated servers are out, so you can host, join a public pvp/pve, etc.\n\nCrafting. Oh yes, the sweet sweet glory of crafting. As you level up, you earn points that are used to upgrade your tech tree, unlocking more blueprints at the various types of constructors available. The crafting system is very polished. The devs really put hard work into making it not feel grindy and making it fun and rewarding. There are TONS of awesome sci-fi themed items to build, not even including all the weapons and vehicle materials. Too much to cover all details here.\n\nMining.\noh.my.god.....\nYou have to either watch a video or buy this game now to see how rediculously amazing it is. Finally!!! You can freely mine any shape or direction or size you want without stupid little blocks everywhere. Thank you devs. Much appreciated.This is exactly what we sandbox addicts have been craving. I feel like the guys and gals that made this game sat down with each other, and agreed to build a familiar sandbox game this time with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ issues addressed that other similar games ignore . You know what I mean guys...\n\nSorry my phone is on 3% and I dont want to lose this review text so I gotta end this now. Look at my time gamers... trust me and indulge in your sandbox addiction and buy this twenty dollar jewel right now. Thank you devs for making and continually improving this fulfilling experience that me and my brothers thoroughly enjoy!\n\nEDIT:\nI apologize for not already mentioning the fact that you can fly directly off any planet with NO loading screens. Having seamless transitions makes this game very fulfilling as you explore the universe and random POI's (points of interest) which are randomly generated and mostly hostile facilities that you can find anywhere. Some of them have a VAST underground complex that quite frankly, is very difficult to conquer. Most of the poi's that you find have plasma and machine turrets that will kill you and blow up your ship so be very careful flying around these. Park with a mountain to cover your vessel from enemy fire and then go on foot to pillage and loot and DESTROY THE ALIENS. There are so many adventures to be had in Empyrion.

You start off right now on a crashed Planet in an escape pod. You have some basic survival gear in the escape pod as well as the ability to cannibalize the pod it'self. From here you survival the harsh planet environment slowly building up a base with oxygen collectors and creating food by growing and harvesting or even hunting the wild life of the planet and cooking their meat.\n\nFrom here you end up building a Ground Vehicle to explore the planet and then slowly move to a Small Ship where you can explore the stars.

Then you can blueprint your build and upload them to the workshop. If you are not a good builder you can download other peoples blueprints and use them in game. Not only do these blueprints work in Creative mode, they work in Survival mode for Single player or Multiplayer.\n\nThere is tons to explore. If your tired of exploring the planet you are on just build a ship and go to orbit and see whats there....\nThere are no "Cutscenes" when leaving planet to go into orbit. A second or two delay as you change playfields, but hardly noticable.\nIf you have explored the planet, orbit, and moon of the area you are in just build a Capital vessel and go to other areas with more planets, orbits and moons.\n\nExplore on Foot, walk around the planet and if you get tired of walking Jump into a Hover Vehicle and explore the planet.  Climb into a Small or Capital vessel and fly around the planet or fly into space. While in space you can leave the cockpit of your ship and float in space or if your ship is big enough you can walk around inside your ship.\n\nYou will find Land, Air and Space combat exciting when you get tired of exploring. You can Lay siege to hostile bases and take them over as your own. Dont want to build a space station, attack a hostile station and claim it as your own.\n\nThe gameplay is exceptional but that is not the best part.\n\nThe Devs and community of this game is really what makes it The Best Game on Steam.\nThe Devs are constantly working with the community and taking suggestions that they apply in new Patches.

Many will work with you to help you start and enjoy the game.\n\nMany of the Multiplayer servers have custom content as the Pre Alpha allows for a small amount of modding.\nSome extemely talented People are in this community and have stretched the limits of this pre Alpha to the max, creating some spetacular builds and worlds to explore.\n\nThis is all a Pre Alpha (thousands of hours of fun) and the game will only be better as of this Friday when Alpha is released.\n\nPS you do not even have to have the best gaming computer to run this.

However, by the end of the 24th century, the Earth will be far from being a paradisiacal place...Overpopulation, runaway climate change and natural resource exhaustion had lead to political instability, riots and looting, war over resources, hundreds of millions of refugees, severe droughts, famines, mass extinctions of many species, and ecosystem collapse.\n\nIn the year 2402, a team of researchers discovered the wreck of a starship in the Antarctic, hidden up to this time under a thick cover of ice. Apparently, the ship belonged to a technologically highly advanced alien race and was powered by an unknown form of energy. Also a star was recovered whose symbols were similar to those used in ancient cosmologies to describe "Empyrion" – the land of plenty. The star map seemed to point to a location far away in the Andromeda Galaxy about 2.5 million light-years away.\n\nGiven the increasingly desperate situation on Earth, the "United Council of Humanity" decided to focus the remaining resources on Earth on a unified effort to build a fleet of starships with the aim of establishing contact with the mysterious aliens and finding Empyrion. All ships were equipped with an alien energy cell to power their experimental hyperdrives.\n\nFinally, in the year 2473, the fleet of starships is ready and you are the first commander of the frigate "Helios". After you activate the hyperdrive, however, something goes wrong an unknown force takes control of your ship... Subsequent to reappearance from hyperdrive, your ship is disabled and drifts in the orbit of an unknown planet somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy far away from the destination that was indicated by the map. You have lost contact with all other ships of your fleet.

In E: GS you begin your fight for survival on a barren, desert planet called Omicron next to your escape pod which is beyond repair. In the distance you see the remains of your Capital ship and exploring the planet not only reveals ore deposits but it also reveals strange structures and hostile drones wandering the planet.\n\nNow you're probably thinking why on Earth should anyone be interested in yet another Early Access game, simply put E: GS does something no other survival game, to my knowledge, has done; it gives you three entire planets to explore as well as the ability to travel around in Space. The next thing that might spring to mind for you is how is this any different to Space Engineers? E: GS is fundementally different to SE, E: GS is more focused on the Survival side of things whereas SE is more focused on the creativity in building side of things, plus SE doesn't have planets.\n\nSince some of this game's issues are more serious than others I'll split my negative section into two, the first section having a much larger impact on my overall verdict than the second.\n\n+E: GS manages to add something new to an already crowded genre and it does it reasonably well\n+You're given a great deal of freedom in regards to crafting bases, vehicles etc. So long as you have the key components for whatever it is you're building (key components are listed by the starting block for each thing) you can add whatever you want and make it look however you want it to look and still be able to use it, though practicality is often something worth considering with vehicles\n+Speaking of starting blocks, each large project (i.e. a base, a ground vehicle, a small cruiser or a capital cruiser) has a corresponding starter block which provides the ship's foundations. A starter block gives you access to a menu detailing your project's stats, such as power consumption, but it also gives you a list of the components which your project MUST have in order to function, such as a fuel tank or a cockpit\n+There are already a lot of different items which can be crafted ranging from tools and weapons to thrusters and generators\n+The three planets are all very different to each other, each one with its own distinct appearance as well as different creatures and plants\n+The game's controls are, for the most part, good though using the mouse for turning in vehicles sometimes feels a tad bit sluggish\n+The devs are already updating the game frequently, hopefully that'll continue throughout the game's development\n+E: GS already features multiplayer and there are plans to improve it over the course of the game's development process\n+The four planets are procedurally generated. What does this mean? While the four planets will always be the same, everything on the planet's surface will be randomized everytime you play with a different seed, e.g. where resources can be found and where enemies spawn\n\n+/-E: GS' graphics aren't awful but they aren't exactly easy on the eye either, it doesn't take away from the game as a whole (hence it's in the neutral section) but considering the fact there are currently no solid plans to improve the game's graphics it is somewhat disappointing\n\nMajor Negatives:\n-Crafting items is unbelievably tedious, which is a problem in a game where so much of the gameplay is based around crafting things. Every major item, such as a generator, requires several different components for you to make it, some of these components require other components to make them, all of your components require some sort of ingot or equivalent item and each ingot has to be made from the ore. At face value it isn't awful but when you add into the mix the fact that you can only craft one type of item at a time, the fact that most things take between 5-20 seconds to craft one unit of and the fact that the crafting machines have small inventories for you to store raw materials as well as completed items it starts to become clear why E: GS' crafting system is its biggest problem\n-The four currently available worlds feel empty, apart from the occasional hostile structure or drone and the creatures that inhabit these worlds there is literally nothing to see on the worlds other than the ore in the ground. Futhermore, to counteract this ore deposits are very spread out, a nice idea in theory but frustrating when a round trip to get more ore takes 10 minutes while you're still on foot\n-Despite the fact that silica is one of the most important ingredients in crafting (used in some capacity to make pretty much every major component) it's seemingly incredibly rare which is rather frustrating when you run out of it and have no means of finding more\n\nMinor Negatives:\n-Unlike in Space Engineers, colliding with terrain in a vehicle has no effect on the terrain though it does still damage your vehicle\n-There's currently very little in the way of character customisation\n-Sound effects are pretty hit and miss as to whether or not they sound realistic and apart from on the main menu there's no music in the game\n-The in-game menu can't be accessed while the game is paused which means if you wish to tweak your settings or controls you can't do so unless you want to risk not pausing your game\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing On Sale (6.5/10)\n\nE: GS is a good survival game which gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to building things and surviving but it's currently let down by its tedious crafting system.  E: GS has a lot of potential and hopefully the game will only get better as time goes on but for now, wait until a sale unless you're willing to look past the game's major issues.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","August 12, 2015","true","10.8"," 191 of 218 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","191","218","7","28"

[SE 2.5m blocks for large and .5 for small]  This results in large builds with large blocks ending up much slicker and less blocky, It also means you need to place alot more blocks for the same size ship.\nThere is going to be a levelling up system and theres alot of blocks still missing in the game, but it has more blocks and items than SE does right now in pre-alpha so it can only get better from there.\nThe AI in the game is pretty good for there first version, alot of fun with the drones in space around the Xentor station, you can go to 3 planets and a moon at the moment, and asteroids,  the planets are being seperated at a later stage in development when the procedual map generator is put into the game.\nThe performance of this game on a good pc is awesome if your used to SE performance.\nThe developers are very friendly, Eleon Game Studio read there forum often and respond to alot of posts, its awesome to see that.\nLike SE and KEEN I wish Eleon the best with this game and I hope its very successful for them and I thank them for the hours of enjoyment I have ahead in survival. My current game is 4 weeks old has multiple big bases, a big ship, multiple small ships, stuff going on on all the bases, and its not lagging at all. Fantastic stuff. Playing on amd 9590 and 16g ram with r9 290.\n\nGame has alot of different creatures in it already, alot of them will attack you, be armed or suffer, there are alot of plant models already in the game, but you can see there are still alot more to come, like trees, you can collect all sorts of things, most of the plants you see around have a use and can be harvested, the creatures [ ai ] are pretty good for pre-alpha, a few of them are deadly, there are drones that hunt you if you go into particular areas.\nYou can collect meat from animals you kill, parts ammo and fuel from downed drones, you can build your base or ships block by block to whatever shape you like, Empyrion has alot of curved blocks already, it has interior decorative blocks as well, you can really replicate sci fi show ships with ease in Empyrion because of the extra time the developers have put into interior blocks, nice job devs.\nYou can build on the planet, under ground, in water, under water, or in space or on an asteroid or in an asteroid, so building is very free range.\nWater doesnt flow, yet.\nLava doesnt flow, yet.\nThe graphics are pretty good, DX9 or DX11, both look nice, alot of blocks are placeholders but still look pretty good, the game is high definition textures, and has a performance mode or quality graphics mode that it can be played in, the options for video are getting better every few weeks, the patches are big, alot of content and alot of bugfixes, the developers are very friendly and have added alot of player made structures to the game and my impression is they want more for there huge universe they need to fill.\nFlying mechanics in Empyrion are much more precise than SE, a little arcade like even, makes for much more enjoyable dogfights, alot more fun to fly ships in Empyrion in my opinion.\nHavent had much to do with the hover craft, built a couple , over the lakes there alot of fun to race, but I use an SV for survival hunting.\nHoping the developers get super filthy rich from this game and fully develop it, Empyrion will be a master piece when its completed.","August 6, 2015","true","432.4"," 187 of 215 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","187","215","7","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/383120/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival is a space open world survival game with randomly generated planets and with heavy crafting and building elements. When I say open world, I really mean it, in the sense that if you have some sort of spacecraft you can fly across space and land on any planet you choose.\n\nThe game offers you two different game modes at the moment, creative and survival. Creative is what you’d expect, build and do whatever you like, your imagination is your limit. As for the survival mode, you’re able to choose different seeds to create your worlds and you can also choose where you’d like to begin your adventure, in a more friendly planetnet with a breathable atmosphere or in a more deadly desert planet that is perfect for hardcore players. Since I’m not really someone who is very creative or that enjoys building, survival is always what I go for in these types of games.\n\nThe core:\nOn survival mode you’ll find yourself looking for oxygen, food and other resources. The game provides a pretty in-depth tutorial covering survival, base and ship building. Food can be acquired by hunting, gathering or farming and it can get spoiled. This can be prevented by either cooking or by storing food on a fridge. The oxygen can be obtained by placing a O2 generator on water, which then will begin producing bottles of oxygen. Resource gathering is pretty simple since you start with the tools needed, simply aim and click with the right tool to the place you want to mine. Still, every tool requires a certain type of charges to use so be careful not to waste all your charges before you’ve gathered the resources needed to craft more. One thing I really like about the game is the fact that when you discover a ore deposit, it will be marked on your map which is a 3D representation of the planet you’re in. If you check the map, you can also see how many, and what type of deposits you still haven’t found on the planet.\n\nEmpyrion also has some other mechanics which make it somewhat more challenging and engaging, such as stamina, a jetpack and blueprint “trees”. You use stamina while sprinting so you have to keep an eye out in case you’re being followed by some mobs and run out of stamina. Nonetheless, you still have your jetpack which, despite making you unable to run, allows you to escape tricky situations including when you get trapped while mining downwards (never dig downwards). By performing simple actions such as gathering resources or crafting you’ll gain experience points, these will allow you to level up and gain points which you can use to unlock certain blueprints/recipes on some sort of “skill tree” menu.\n\nAssuming you have the required blueprints and materials, crafting is pretty straight simple since the game tells you what a certain item needs in order to be crafted. Building is likewise pretty straightforward, you just select on your hotbar the block you want to place and click where you want it, and you can also fly a drone to help you build in more tricky spots where your character can’t properly reach. If farming is an option in a survival game, I tend to go that route, thus I must say I quite enjoy how farming plays out in Empyrion. Basically you place “growing plot” blocks, place whatever seed you want and then you have to make sure that a light source is 2 blocks above it. The plant won’t grow immediately of course so you can go on another errands while you wait for your crops to be ready to harvest.\n\nOne minor complaint I have with the game is the fact that there are no reload animations. Still, I’m sure this is due to the Early Access nature of the title and that is something that will be implemented soon. That said, combat is serviceable at best, you just aim and shoot, the weapons have pretty much no recoil or authentic feel to them and I believe this is something that should be worked on. Despite the dynamic day and night cycle (where if you look at the sky you can see the other planets far off), I didn’t notice any change in mobs behaviour which kind of disapointed me.\n\nVerdict:Huge amount of things to craft\nSpace and planetary exploration\nOverall decent performance - except a few slowdowns when visiting new areas\nWell done ambient and background sound effects + pretty great main menu theme\nDetailed tutorial, which welcomes newcomers\nDated visuals - as far as I care, the game looks somewhat dated\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival is the closest thing to what I want from a game that combines space and planetary exploration. Even if you’re like me and don’t like building, you can just import creations from other players from the Workshop, in the form of blueprints, and get them in your world. I highly recommend you check this one out if you’re into space exploration and survival! I’m looking forward to see how this one develops.","April 16","true","7.0"," 157 of 182 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","157","182","8","17"

Some are good and some are bad and every once in a while I find one that really just surprises me at how good it is....Empyrion is one of those that has surprised me at just how good it is.\n\nThe survival aspect of the game is great....it has some of the usual aspects of most sandboxes such as mining, leveling, crafting, farming, base/ship building and exploration.  Most of these are similar to other games so I will touch on each of these briefly.\n\nMiningMining is done by scouting out the planet and a scanner locating deposits. Once a suitable deposit of ore is found you use a drill to extract the ore. It does take some time to mine much like most sandboxes, but oddly it seems more satisfying in Empyrion to me than other games even though I cannot pinpoint exactly why. Once you are done with the drill you can then press "T" to pickup the mined ore to take back to base from processing said ore into ingots.\n\nLeveling/Tech TreeThere is leveling and a tech tree that go hand-in-hand.  Basically, you start out at level 1 and as you do certain tasks suchs as mining, building or farming you gain experience towards the next level. You also gather points that you can spend learning new things to craft via the Tech Tree in the game. This is broken up into various tabs such as Hover Vessel, Space Vessel, Capital Vessel, Base, Decor and a few others. So each time you level you get to learn new craftable items. While this is not something new, it is still great fun!\n\nCraftingCrafting is done via Constructors. Constructors are large multi-block structures that craft items for you. These constructors come in various sizes and versions. At the start of the game you get a simple "Survival Constructor" and as you progress through the game you gain access to create more advanced constructors.  The more advanced constructors are slightly faster and the top tier constructor allows for auto-assembly of items by automatically constructing pre-requisite items for whatever item you may want to build. It saves quite a bit of time.\n\nFarmingYou can farm in the game via seeds, growth boxes and grow lights. You simply put a box down place a grow light over the box and plant the seed and over time plants will grow and produce food. You can grow things such as tomatoes and wheat to more exotic plant life found in the game. You can then use the food you harvest in a Food Processor to create food some food is simple one item recipes while some are more complex and give extra bonuses.\n\nBase/Ship BuildingThis is one of the areas I love in the game. It's your typical build a base, build power, build a support system for you and your base. There are some great blocks to use for building such as curves and angles like most sandbox games along with turrets, that are both automated or manned, O2 generation, water filtration, medical bays, cargo boxes and various other exciting things.\n\nShip building is probably my favorite aspect of the game. You can build various ships such as Hover Vessels (HV), Space Vessels (SV) and Capital Vessels (CV). Each of these are as you expect, HV's simply hover over the ground and allow you to move around the planet faster than walking. SV's allow you to fly around the planet and even exit the planet's orbit and fly around a specified area around the planet including asteroid belts around the planet and any moons that the planet may have. CV's are the largest ships and allow you to add warp drives to them that allow you to visit other planets and systems. CV's also allow you to dock SV's to them so you can use your CV to transport SV's to other planets for exploration.\n\nExplorationThis is another great aspect to the game. When starting out you start on a single planet and can explore this planet finding alient life, alien bases, attack drones of various types, ore deposits, plant life and other players.  What I think sets Empyrion apart from some of the other sandbox games is the existence of numerous planets each with its own type of plants, aliens, POI's and ores.  Some items can only be found on these planets and are required to fully craft everything in the game, so it makes for great fun hopping in a Capital Ship and warping to another planet and exploring it.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd highly suggest Empyrion as it just does everything right and since it is still pre-alpha (surprisingly because the game is well polished) I can't wait to see what awaits the game in the future.  With what seems to be a very active dev team I feel purchasing this game would well be worth it if you enjoy sandbox style games or even if you just like space-based games that allow you to fly and build ships no matter how large. If you are looking for a great sandbox...give Emyprion a shot, I am sure glad I did and I'm pretty sure you would too.","February 26","true","193.8"," 69 of 73 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","69","73","2","0"

With realistic mining for rare elements, terraforming, exploration, & hunting; it provides a PVE experience that is a delight to play, even in early access.\n\nState of the Art:\nEmpyrion has a full suite of heavy duty tools, equipped with lights for night/cave mining & terraforming, like a futuristic drill, & a Flatten/Fill tool for terraforming. It can drill in a pinch, but it can also repair holes in your mine roof to keep spiders out. In creative mode, your jetpack flies. In survival it has limited gravity jumps that can result in injury. You start with a handgun, but the assault rifle upgrade has a powerful feel. You can add other weapons, turrets & machinery as you upgrade. The interaction of component parts just feels great!\n\nFlora & Fauna:\nWith the wide variety of indigenous plants & animals; you feel like you’ve just stepped into Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World, or the set from Lost in Space or Guardians of the Galaxy. But, there is no cool 70’s walkman or choosing music tracks, which would probably be a welcome plus. The game soundtrack is good, but the two scores will get repetitive if you play this much. (If you saw The Martian movie you know we need more music.)\nThere are edible & Medicinal plants, like Ahax fruit, Alien Spike Lemons, Space Oranges, Cobra leaves, Aloe Vera, & varieties of Alien plasma. Fearsome creatures become dinner, like the multi-headed Hydra-like Olyugh, the Desert Worm, Wood walkers who looks like Sasquatch, a warrior type AI, a baby Allosaurus & triceratops. Some are hostile, others will be if provoked.\n\nSkill Trees & Game Modes:\nYou find yourself falling from the sky in an escape pod if you are lucky, or already on the ground in the pod if it glitches on loading. If you are still in freefall, you are able to steer the pod’s fall with the mouse. Once you get out of the pod you grab all your gear. The last update to 1.4.0 fixed the ability to open pods that land in water, as well as improving functionality of turrets.\nThe game uses an efficient Tech tree system to allow you to unlock equipment as you earn levels which reset for each game you play & augments the rewards of the strategy & resource management needed to survive on this level.\nGame Modes give lots of variety with Creative or Survival Modes of PVE & PVP in MP. But, within Survival worlds, at the moment you are only able to choose between the normal forest planet of Akua or the Hardcore Desert planet of Omicron. Akua is Hawaiian for “god” & definitely looks like a lost world paradise. Omicron is where the intensity picks up, with more scarcity of resources that are spread further apart, & volatile terrain. You have a seed generator for terrain variety. If you land near the drones it’s all over before it begins. The drones are real techno-beasts & you probably can’t evade them early game.\n\nCrafting:\nThe crafting interface can be confusing at first. Production flows right to left with the queue on bottom. Click the template you want, to move it to the queue to be constructed. Then the new item you wanted is output into the constructor's inventory space. You can move what you want from there to your own inventory or hot-bar.\n\nSpace Travel & Vehicles:\nThe game allows you to set up not only a home base on a planet or in space, but you can construct a “hover vehicle” which is a fully stocked mobile base, equipped with fridge & food facilities for mining & hunting. You can also build small aircraft & capital vessels which can equip warp-drive to visit other planets & mine asteroid fields. In MP asteroids land for mining elements. In early access only 2 planets are available, though you can see the full list on the warp map.\nEach base/vehicle has a “starter block” with a core which emits a beacon when the power is turned on. When you build it, equip it, & power it up then prepare for an incoming drone siege that will last until you are able to dispatch drones quickly.  You must be well stocked with food before powering up that generator. This creates a game of tower defense. The drones will try to destroy the core starter block. Once you lose that block the game is for all practical purposes over, giving it a perma-death element. You have the option to restart at the location you die near your backpack. But, if drones were there, they will still be there when you respawn at half stats & they will likely kill you again before you can recover your weapon. The game also gives you the option to respawn near your base or take a fresh start, but the fresh start is a bad choice. It will put you in a falling pod with fewer resources. Best option is to exit the game & start a whole new world. You can build a clone chamber once you have a base that will set your spawn point. This is a great feature.\n\nMapping & Graphics:\nThe game runs on much less hardware than stated. The graphics seem to be similar on my screenshots to what people who have better machines are experiencing. There’s no lag. The first day I flew the small vessels I experienced holes in my terrain, but that was cleared up by the next day’s update. The scenery is lovely, but the graphics are subpar resolution in the current access state.\nThe mechanic of space travel is less well developed than the planetary aspects of the game mechanics. You experience a slideshow of backgrounds as you leave the planet’s atmosphere, enter orbit, go deep space, & finally approach a new planet. You move around in each slide, but it has a bottom of the picture. I accidentally fell off the space station in deep space. I visibly fell for a few seconds, & then my avatar just stood there among the stars at the bottom of the background scenery in a “stop the world & I’ll jump off” effect.\nThe in-game HUD utilizes a nice planetary mapping system with marker/beacons for different points of interest, like bases, rare elements, & drones. The space map needs work but does not affect the fun to be found in this great game. Visible location coordinates would be nice.\n\nTutorial:\nThe tutorial is really just simply the PDA info displayed one subchapter at a time on the right side of the HUD as missions. The instructions will not move forward until you do that mission. Also, it won’t remember actions that you’ve done early, so you have to repeat actions to get that mission objective to progress to the next step. You can deactivate chapters in the PDA, but you will lose subchapter steps. Also, there is no pause feature in the game, & reading or opening the PDA wastes your limited O2 & food while you stand around reading a TL:DR wall of text. I hope this is a priority because it leads to frustration trying to figure out what to do as a new player. Like Elon Musk says, “If it needs a manual it is broken.” I would like to see a computer generated voice-over speaking to you from your PDA, kind of like HAL in 2001, giving you an emergency briefing to get you started on the HUD mission log.\n\nPros:\n•	Hardcore Tower/Base Defense\n•	Workshop to share ready-made build Templates\n•	Flight controls are intuitive\n•	Plug & play construction\n•	Planetary exploration includes excellent game mechanics\n•	Underpriced at $17.99/ many games in this tier $30.00\n\nCons:\n•	No weather & Space Travel is subpar\n•	AI (except drones) are unintelligent\n•	PDA not noticeable in HUD. Lack of real Tutorial\n•	The ‘hit-boxes’ seem a bit small slowing collection\n\nIf you are dreaming of exploring planets, then Empyrion is the space sim for you. I rate it an 8 out of 10 for survival games, with elements of tower defense & resource management. I highly recommend this game for everyone. If the tutorial is augmented & the space mechanics are perfected I will change my review to a perfect ten.","April 29","true","75.9"," 104 of 126 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","104","126","7","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/82namnio/recommended/383120/","82namnio","NamNio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/82namnio/","206 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGot a buddy who enjoys a good cooperative survival scenario as much as you? Give Empyrion a shot.\n\nThe Positive:\nMe and my buddy Meowmix have been gaming for years and we both love a good survival scenario. This game really impressed us, it was the first game in a long time that had hooked us with the gameplay. Many early access titles hook you with the premise, then fail to deliver with the initial gameplay, but Empyrion is in a very playable state and there is actually a lot to do and figure out.\n\nThe game captures the survival scenario very well, I was impressed. It is not easy to create a challenging survival game, but the developers did well here. You need to assess, prioritize, and address your immediate needs or you will die. If you ♥♥♥♥ up and play fast-and-loose with your resources too much, you can paint yourself into a corner where you need to restart. That consequence looms over you as you play and I feel like the potential for a permanent end to my scenario was a driving factor to buckle the ♥♥♥♥ down and figure out how to sustainably address my needs for power, oxygen, food, and defense.\n\nThe oxygen system is worth commending. It felt balanced. I didn't have to constantly top off my oxygen or spend too much time managing it, but it was always a factor. In a typical sandbox survival game, your resource bars usually just become an annoyance; they are just another factor to survival condensed into a linear measurement. In Empyrion there is an initial concern of running out of oxygen and the clock is ticking, but once you figure out how to produce oxygen bottles in a sustainable fashion; your oxygen now limits how far you can travel from your refilling stations. It was brilliant, and it gave me a reason to invest my resources in a land vehicle that could serve as a mobile refilling station. This is necessary to explore the planet you are marooned on and reach metal deposits that are outside of walking distance.\n\nThere were a lot of moments of desperation and perseverance. When you die, you drop all your items on the ground in a backpack then spawn with nothing. There was one time I lost a backpack, and with it went my mining tool and firearm as well as all the ammunition I had. To make things worse, we didn't have enough material to create another mining tool to replace it. We were also low on the material needed to craft more ammunition, which was a major concern. Fortunately, I had a partner. My buddy Meowmix still had his mining tool and enough charge to go scrape up enough minerals to replace my tool and keep us in business. The act of losing my items forced us to shift our focus and adapt; I feel like that is the essence of survival. Well done.\n\n\nThe Negative:\nThe game looks like half-life. Boxy and generally unpolished, the developers clearly narrowed their focus on the gameplay instead of making it look super-polished. This actually doesn't bother me, but I could see it being a point of contention for some.\n\nWait.. Space Engineers just added planets recently. Did I just type up a review for the wrong game? No, I have hours played here I was right.. The look and feel of the bases and ships is so close to Space Engineers, it hurts. If you've played Space Engineers before you will know what I'm talking about. I wouldn't go so far as to call this game a clone, however. Space Engineers seems to focus on the physics of being in space and feels like a sandbox game at heart. Empyrion was developed with survival as it's focus. Though the game may look and feel like Space Engineers at times, the gameplay as a whole is different. I would describe this game as 'Space Engineers with a purpose' but, some of the physics lack polish and make me wish I was just playing Space Engineers.\n\nYou can't transition from space to planet unless everyone is in the same vehicle. Typing that sentence made me sad, and as I read it through cupped hands: I know I have found a game-breaking flaw. They have to address this one, and I am confident they will in time. While playing, the main goal for Meowmix and I was to get our escape pod functional and get off-planet. It took us a while, but eventually we succeeded and decided to take our modified escape pod exploring. We made planetfall at a nearby planet and found that we were incredibly underprepared. I don't want to spoil too much, but we ended up getting shot down and found ourselves marooned on this new ice-planet with no food. The cockpit of our ship had been destroyed and we had no way to create a replacement because I ♥♥♥♥ed up and dismantled the constructor when I built the car. We did some scouting, got into some trouble, and won some battles. Without a constructor, we really couldn't do anything on that planet. We were essentially, ♥♥♥♥ed. So, we packed our inventories into storage and let the hunger finish us off. It was a huge setback, but we were able to spawn at the base we built on the first planet. Our new mission was to build a new, beefier ship and go back to ice planet to repair and recover our crashed space pod. Hours later we had mined and scavenged enough parts together to make a new ship. We shot back over to ice planet, found our crash site, recovered our items, and bolted a new cockpit onto the old ship. I hopped in, did a quick flight test, and we headed for space only to hit an invisible wall and a notification that we both had to be in the same vehicle to transition off planet. Seriously ...the ♥♥♥♥?\n\nThe game lacks content. I know, it's Alpha or early access or whatever.. Here is a fact though: it still costs money to buy it. If it costs money, I expect something playable and with content. I was happy to find the game in a very playable state, and to be fair it does have a decent amount of content. Once you get into space, there isn't much more to do. You can explore the handful of other planets, or try to mine them for the special minerals needed to create a capital ship, but there is no point at this stage. There is potential to grow the content further, but I would say there are about 12-16 hours of gameplay right now and after that you are just playing a mediocre version of Space Engineers.\n\nThe crafting takes too long. Space Engineers had a more polished system for this, and this was one of the times I wish I was playing Space Engineers instead. You can queue up a bunch of stuff to be made, then go off and do other stuff but sometimes you need to sit there and micromanage it. The worst part was that you needed to build all the small components needed to make a part, then build the part. You could run two large constructors, but they can only craft using the resources stored inside the machine, so it doesn't really work well. Again, Space Engineers figured all this out and gives you a way more robust crafting system, which I think Empyrion should adopt. Two players cannot access the same machine / container either. This was a generally annoying experience, because I want to make some bullets or mining tool ammo to go do my thing, but Meowmix is in the middle of fabricating complicated parts to create a spaceship. I have to wait for his parts to finish, then make him wait while I craft my ♥♥♥♥ so I can go mining because I used up the last of the magnesium on him making bullets. Think you like your room-mate? Try getting stranded on a hostile alien plannet with him.\n\n\nAdvice:\nRebind your 'Z' key to 'Number pad Minus'. One of the first things Meowmix and I did was go mining and he accidentally pressed 'Z', dropping his tool through the ground. If you don't have a mining tool, or the resources needed to create one it is game over. Literally. You need to be able to mine, unless you like twiddling your thumbs waiting for the lights to go off because you ran out of power and can't produce more without promethium.\n\nThree is one and one is none. Keep spare tools, guns, and ammo handy. Trust me on this one.","August 22, 2015","true","21.9"," 90 of 106 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","90","106","9","1"

THAT baby is Empyrion - Galactic Survival. The strongest point in this game the immersion factor... when you play Empyrion Galactic Survival... you FEEL like you are there... weather crawling through the lush terrain of Akua or the desert land of Omicron.. you feel like you are there almost every moment.\n\nAnd this is one lucky baby, because it got the BEST of it's parents traits.\n\nCompared to Space Engineers - many of the building options are dumbed down a bit, and there are less of them... however GREATLY more user friendly and runs smooth on almost any PC. Same "we're not going to hold your hand" attitude for both games, you need learn how to play the game on your own, often through painful trial and error... but once you learn, the world is your oyster and the possibilities are endless.\n\nMuch like Space Engineers, actual engineering comes into play here... want to make a hover craft? Sure! However if you load that hover craft down with too much weapons, contraptions like a mini fridge and what have you, it will NOT float (or barely so that it'll get stuck on any incline). Your job as a builder of this vessel, is to make it so it can do all you want it to do AND still work, which isn't always by the way...so what do you do? Scrap this here...add this here...until finally you get it right!\n\nOh and not only are there hover crafts... there are small vessels (tiny more mobile ships), additional bases (self explanatory), and the amazing and glorious capital vessel, which are basically titan ships that can literally transport entire fleets of small vessels within it! And all of it is 100% up to you to build...there's no pre built templates here, your imagination is the template, use it to build what you want.\n\nCompared to 7 Days to Die -\nOkay so there are no zombies here (but considering the overflood of zombie survival games... to me that's a good thing.), however there are aliens and alien creatures on the planets you will visit.. Some passive, some out for your blood! If you're in survival mode (which cmon, of course you're in survival mode) you will periodically be attacked by alien drones. Now most of the times these drones are easy dispatched and most of the times have some very useful and hard to make parts on them,\n\nBut who sends these drones? The Inhabitants of the planet of course! Aliens who don’t really like the fact that you're on their planet, and they WILL need to go down if you want to plunder the rich booty of their strongholds, and the planets resources in peace!  Therefore for defense there are turrets of a variety of kinds to protect your base, and also (of course) weapons that you can unlock and use for your own purposes, which is a good thing because the wildlife on the planets are not always friendly! However weapons don’t stop there, equip your vessels with turrets, rail guns, missiles and gatling guns, all for you to place and use however you wish.\n\nThe exploration -\n\nYou may start off on one planet and decide you wish to expand and conquer another area, well in Empyrion you can do that! Leave your planet’s atmosphere and start on another planet! But be warned, every planet is different. Some have breathable atmospheres, some don't! And without Oxygen, you'll find yourself dying and quick. Out in space is its own "planet" per se, remember those alien guys? Well let's just say most of them aren't too happy to see you, and will attempt to combat you in space.. this is where the "galactic" part comes in, which interesting dogfights in space, as well as asteroid exploration and mining.\n\nThe immersion juices flowing like plump steak right off the grill! And for most of the game you'll experience that feeling.\n\nHowever there are some negatives to the game...\n\n1. As of patch 4.0 the WHOLE game changed, with a new tier system that you have to earn XP to unlock items and with changes to the game start, it's hard to find guides on the game, as many are for previous versions that no longer apply.\n\n2. The game is young...which means besides the bugs, glitch’s and what have you (which there are few of thankfully), multiplayer is new... and like all games who have taken that first leap into multiplayer, you can find hackers, and abusers. HOWEVER, as of 4.1.1 the game has changed and now pvp\n\n\nThe developers -\nThe developers seem fairly nice and dedicated to perfecting the game. With updates coming out about twice to three times a month, the game is updated fairly often with most of the updates being what the community informs the developers about, with few bugs. I see little to worry about them bolting out the door with your cash and leaving you with a half-completed game.\n\n___________CONCLUSTION - HERE'S THE SHORTER VERSION OF ABOVE _________\n\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival has alot going for it right now, with tasteful blend of survival and vessel building and PVE.. You’ll find alot to do in the game! With only a few in game hints to guide you, and little guides (at the moment) you'll find that most of the game is based on your own trial and error. However this game pulls you in like no other and offers planetary exploration, as well as space exploration, with very few glitches. As of patch 4.1.1 there is a new "factions" system, with player targeting turrets as well! Therefore multiplayer is starting to become playable on public servers, so multiplayer HOO!  The developers also seem rather dedicated to the game, releasing nicely optimized and patched updates.\n\nSo what's Empyrion’s rating (At the moment)? I would give it a 8/10 - with a tasteful mix of survival, construction and exploration you'll find plenty to do! With the newest changes multiplayer is become doable on a public server, however hackers will still probably be found..however for the price it's at right now... still totally worth a buy.","November 28, 2015","true","91.5"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","64","70","6","5"

You can just look at the developers updates/comments and see that they are pushing so hard to get this game to be something great.\n\nEmpyrion is one hell of a sandbox and space exploration game. If you want to do anything, you must cronstruct, construct, construct your way to glorious material heaven where you can sustain a capital vessel. The mining is intituitive, much better to me than the block based games like Minecraft.\n\nEmpyrion's constructions serve purpose. Your base, under threat of attack on different worlds, needs to be defended at all times. You are extremely vulnerable on different planets, and the game starts to get hard when you start to travel within the star system using a capital vessel. These behemoth vehicles take up massive space weighin in at over 1.5 Kilotons. For those of you who don't do math, that's 1500 tons. Let me put this in perspective... one of the heaviest aircrafts that man has built, according to Wikipedia, is a whopping jet that takes off with 640 tons. Capital Vessels and their glory weigh in with 2x as much.\n\nNot satisfied with building massive constructions? Take the fight to your enemy and decimate foes using hover vehicles and small vehicles. Blast your way through the alien constructions, loot their glorious materials, safely return to your vessel, and clap and cheer with your friends at a job well done. Death awaited you at every corner of that base, but you triumphantly destroyed its outer defenses, blasted each of its automated turrets, killed the alien Krogohms, and stole their valuable resources.\n\nI have clocked 100 hours, and will continue to try each and every single one of the updates that the developers put out. Empyrion is that addictive, shows extreme promise, and is worth it.\n\nLet me share a story with you as well: My friend and I spent 19 hours building a capital vessel (yes 19 hours to get it to be how we liked it). Proud of our work, we named her Queen Bee, cristend the vessel and flew her off to space. There we kicked the hyperdrive into gear flew to another planet, Aestus (a lava planet filled with terrible nightmarish creatures), and hell broke loose. We dropped the Hover Vessel to the planet, had its auto turrets buzzing away, and we could not defend against the enemy onslaught. Queen Bee was almost destroyed entirely. We lost the Fuel Tanks, the core, and most of its canons.\n\n11/10 would be destroyed.","January 14","true","128.5"," 74 of 86 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","74","86","7","6"

Like putting an oxygen generator inside water instead of on land to generate more oxygen since H2O contains O2. Or needing to power your escape pod with fuel before you can use its crafting tool.\n\nThe mining system is very satisfying. Minerals are patches in the ground. You can flatten mountains with your drill, and see pieces of material roll down the hill and wait to be collected. It feels very real.\n\nCurrently you can only play survival mode on one planet, although the devs have said they plan to make an antirely randomly generated galaxy with which you can travel from massive planets to another.\nRight now in creative mode, you have 3 planets to choose from, and CAN fly in between them through space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/383120/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I first picked up Empyrion : Galactic Survival I have to admit that I wasn’t impressed.  I had been playing another very similar title for quite some time and found Empyrion to be fairly inferior when it came to the game experience as a whole.  Recently returning to Empyrion I found many changes.  Let’s just say, my first day returning to this game I put 12 hours into it.\n\nEmpyrion : Galactic Survival is one of those games that you’ll either love or hate.  It’s a game based heavily on survival where you absolutely can’t sit idle.  You can’t just put up a few walls, toss on a roof, and consider yourself safe.  If you don’t keep up with your tasks (like gathering food/oxygen) you’ll quickly find yourself dying.  In addition, resources are fairly limited so you have to continuously push yourself to explore further and further away from your comfort zone (aka. Your base).\n\nCrafting in Empyrion is a fairly simple task, with most machines requiring you to first craft components for those machines.  Even some components require components.  While some may find this a tedious task to perform, I rather enjoied it as it gave me something to constantly be doing.   You can’t just “click” and have yourself a cockpit (for example), you actually have to build the parts for it before it can be assembled.  I enjoyed this in the other title I mentioned earlier, and I like that Empyrion has adopted this crafting style.  There is a bit of a balance problem in crafting, however, and I hope that the developers solve it in the future.  While crafting items doesn't really have this problem, crafting food seems to be a little problematic.  Take a "sandwitch", for example.  In order to make a sandwitch you need to use a salami, a bread, and a tomato.  Seperately, in total these three items contain values of 195 food, 30 health, and 30 stamina.  Together, as a sandwitch, the values are 160 food, 10 health, and 25 stamina.  Thus you would be an idiot to craft a sandwitch as you are loosing a lot of food value in a game where food is always a struggle.  In crafting you would expect that a crafted item would have an equal, if not a higher, value than what you are putting into it.  This is one small way in which crafting recipes are currently "broken" in empyrion, but hopefully will be fixed.\n\nIn returning to the game I also found myself dealing with a new leveling system as well.  Each time you gain a level you unlock some basic building block recipes and get points to unlock more complex crafting recipes.  You have to spend your points wisely or you may find yourself without the recipes you need, when you want them.  In addition, all recipes have a level requirement so you can’t simply unlock missile launchers (for example) at level 2 and blow everything up.  The mix of level locks, plus point unlocks, makes leveling a fairly exciting experience.  That being, every time you level you basically go “Sweet!  Now I can unlock that ____ I’ve been wanting to make!”\n\nMobs in Empyrion come in a couple different varieties.  You first have your basic non-aggressive indigenous creatures that will simply go about their business without a care in the world (until you shoot at them).  Next you have indigenous creatures that are hostile towards you and will attack you if you get too close.  It’s fairly difficult to tell the hostile mobs apart from the non-hostile mobs without actually risking being attacked, as they all look pretty mean, but once you gain the knowledge it makes the world a lot easier to navigate.  The third variety comes in the form of NPC structures that have turrets and enemy units, as well as drones that will hunt you down.  These drones can be fairly useful when lured away from their bases as, if you’re powerful enough to take them on, they always drop components you can use to craft equipment and machinery.\n\nFinally we come down to the core of the game.  Does the game look good and sound good?  Well…  Yes, it does.  It’s not going to be winning any awards for realism and immersion, but when it’s stacked up beside other games in this genre it actually surpasses most of them.  Each creature has unique sounds, which I actually find very fitting to them and enjoy.  Music is well placed and fits the theme.  Distant planets and moons rise and set in the sky.  It’s actually very well polished for still being in Pre-Alpha.\n\nSpeaking of which, the only issue I currently have with this game is it isn’t complete.  In the crafting tree there are a lot of items that are labeled as “decorative” simply because the objects can be crafted but currently have no use.  One example being, the radar dish.  In addition, this being a Pre-Alpha version, there are also several bugs that creep up once in a while.  I’ve already experienced one where I was surface mining and ended up falling through a hole in the map because there was a problem with the land deformation.  Another "bug" I found has to do with my capital ship's requirement to fly sideways to do any warp jumps.  I’m not really holding these against the game because, as I said, it’s a Pre-Alpha and these things usually aren't polished off until Beta.\n\nSo what’s my verdict?  Well, as I said, people will either love this game or hate it.  Personally I love it and I’d recommend it to anyone who likes games from the survival crafting genre.  That said, you'll just have to make up your own mind.","December 21, 2015","true","69.7"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","50","52","3","7"

And this for a pre-alpha. Anyone who says this is a Space Engineers knockoff or rip should get their heads checked. Now don't get me wrong. I love Space Engineers, but this brings something new to the table. There are so many unique features in this game that seperates them completely. The way mining is done, generating oxygen and hydrogen, the different enemy bases (some with defences I realised after getting my ♥♥♥ kicked exploring), planting plants to use in recipes for food, and more. If I have to go into detail I'll type all day.\n\nBuilding my first base and hover craft was exciting. Especially taking the hover craft for a spin. The hunting for food and mining is also much fun, not to mention taking out drones with your base turrets.\n\nAfter a while though it got pretty boring as I fell into a repetive pattern, so I decided to build a small vessal to see what else there is to offer, and oh man was I surprised by the different drone bases I found. Factories, fuel stations, and so on.\n\nI decided to take my ship into outerspace, knowing that I'd need supplies, so I made sure I had enough resources like, food, oxygen, power, building material for repairs and for my first capital ship, and I went off.\n\nNow first let me tell you, I'm not an average gamer who just plays to beat the game. I appreciate every detail put into a game from the mechanics to the gameplay, to the graphics. Due to this I spend much more time to achieve what other gamers do. Well I'm overwhelmingly impressed with what I've seen so far.\n\nBefore starting the capital ship I realised that I had to get away far enough from the planet to avoid gravity pull.\nThe view is amazing from space. There are currently only about 5 or 6 planets with an asteroid belt, but I'm sure it will expand in future. After building the capital ship I went to explore one of these planets and it was an entire different atmosphere, and as mentioned earlier, completely diffirent alien life.\n\nRaided a base on that planet and found that you not only have to watch out for ships and turrets, there are infantry to take care of as well before you can start looting.\n\nWith everything I've experienced so far in this game I am so looking forward to future updates and I don't regret buying this game for one second.","December 18, 2015","true","281.8"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","55","60","6","0"

That is part of how things are now.\nYaps, there ARE bugs.\nThere ARE things that arent balanced.\nAnd yeah, some things, arent really THAT logical.\nBut, that is exactely why, we get to play EA games. to find these things, and tell them to the developers, so they can fix it :)\n\nNot only, is Empyrion developing EXTREMELY fast, the development team, which is a mere 5 people, living out a dream, never sleeping, (it seems), it also develops WITH the community.\nthe developers listen, reflect, and, maybe, execute the ideas we throw at them.\n\nThe community for Empyrion is stunning.\nNever have i waited more than a day before someone, have responded to an issue / idea / bug i have posted.\nThere are no "elitists" on the main empyrion forums, (Those outside of STEAM). Mostly mature people, exchanging ideas, comments, stories and experiences.\n\nNow. Stop reading this silly post, and get you'r gamer mind going, as you explore the worlds of empyrion on your own :)\nespecially this weekend, where it is "free-to-play", albeit for a limited time.\n\nLast word of advice:\nLook up videos, making sure to sort them into "newest first", before you start a new game.\nVideos, that are usefull, will state theyre "Alpha - episode ******"\nAnother way, to make sure you're watching the latest video, is to look at the top left in the video. That, is where the release number is located. It needs to read "Alpha" ... NOT "Pre-Alpha" :)\n\nAt the moment of this writing, we are at Alpha 1.5.4 (Build 424)","May 13","true","742.3"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","58","68","0","2"

This is less of a game and more of a tool for unlocking your imagination. A lot of others have already made great comments about the game so will just bullet out the bassics, as of 3.6. Simply put, it's one of a very few early access games I've felt is worth a purchase.\n\nThe great:\n- Decent graphics for early release\n- Do whatever you want, total sandox feeling\n- World feels BIG\n- No handholding - no in-game tutorial - learn and adapt or die\n- Reasonably stable, easy to set up co-op gameplay\n- Lots of stuff to collect, craft and test\n- Good blend between walking simulator and combat when appropriate\n- Slow pace, but always feel suspence\n- Complicated where it needs to be, simple where it needs to be\n- No quests or generic story, do what YOU want, when YOU want\n- Easy to pick back up after a few days of absence\n- Loads quickly, no time wasted waiting to play\n- Game will punish you brutally for mistakes, poor planning can lead to hours lost\n\nThis game is a mature entity in a world oversaturated by family-friendly, hand-holding casual games. This game will not tell you a story, but inspire you to create your own.\n\nThis game is expectedly raw, in early stages, but if you like to get totally immersed in a world where you don't know what's around the corner, this game is definitely worth picking up. I am excited to see the direction this game will take in further development.","November 3, 2015","true","60.1"," 65 of 80 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","65","80","3","0"

The developers of this game have been working part-time on this game for years.  This alpha is the result of a love and passion to create this game.\n\nLook through my EA games and look at my reviews.  I'm a very critical person over games because I use a very strict methodology of measuring and sizing up a developer on thier abilities to produce a completed and fun game.  So, my reviews are generally based on the games potential to release a badass game rather than "is it currently fun?" type review.\n\nThe answer to that is of course, hell yes.\n\nBut to the actual review.\n1) Are the developers responding to the community: YES\n2) Are the developers providing meaningful updates: YES\n3) Are there serious flaws that would require a near-rewrite: NO\n4) Are the developers timely in their updates: YES\n5) Do the developers currently keep promises: YES\n\nAccording to my metrics this game has a TON of potential to not just be a badass game but Game of the Year worthy if the developers stay on track.\n\nBut what can you do so far?\nYou can currently struggle to survive and use tools, structures (with guns), ground vehicles (with guns), space vehicles (with guns), and capital ships (with guns) to enhance your survival experience.\n\nThe co-op is also working flawlessly, however there is currently no DS option which has been told to the community a few times it is in the works and planned for after the EA release.  So I would give them some time on that.\n\nFurthermore this game seems to me as the perfect melding of many games out there that strike people as "that's an awesome feature!" with the rest of the game being "meh".  So survival is precisely combined with building, and neither really seem to get in the way of fun.  And then you have the big angry stuff that likes to eat your face off -- that's the really fun stuff, but I hope you won't encounter these mobs until after you're well established :)\n\nWhat do they have planned?So far:\n1) Multiplayer / Dedicated Server\n2) Infinate proceedural galaxy\n3) Volumetric (room-filling) oxygen\nand a lot more\n\nIs this game worth $15.00? No.  It is worth $50 or more.","August 5, 2015","true","152.9"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","64","84","4","18"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nOver the past few years we have seen our fair share of survival games coming to Steam: Terraria, Starbound, TUG, Dig or Die, ARK: Survival Evolved, Savage Lands, and so on. They all share the same, base concept, but what sets each of them apart from the rest are either the mechanics, the setting, or the gameply. For Empyrion, it's all of the above! It's really a mix of the best of everything we've seen thus far, except dinosaurs. That's Ark's jurisdiction.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nEmpyrion is a voxel-based survivial multiplayer game played in first person, though you can toggle a over-the-shoulder (sort of) third person view. Though honestly first person is best. Empyrion boasts a variety of environments in it's current pre-Alpha Early Access state, although they are a bit limited at this stage. You have a desert planet, a lava planet, etc. Each planet has different features, flora, and fauna.\n\nThe game starts with you exiting an escape pod that's crashed on an alien planet. Emptying your pod's storage units gives you enough to get started making your own way on this new world. Along the way, you will learn how to manage your oxygen levels, hunger, and stamina. Learning how to craft what you need to refill your hunger and oxygen is the most crucial thing to learn at first. Empyrion has somewhat of a learning curve, as most survival games do, but once you get a grasp on the basics everything flows very well.\n\nEventually you are able to craft a new ship, leave the planet, and travel to others--provided you have built up a stock of fuel. Travelling to other hostile worlds requires an assortment of weapons as well, and Empyrion has a nice handful of guns you can wield. A pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, minigun, and rocket launcher are just a few you can find or craft. Most survival games use tools such as pickaxes. Empyrion features a 'drill' that uses laser technology that's quite fun to handle.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis game looks really sharp. The visuals (especially for vehicles) give off a Space Engineers vibe, and that game looked great. Empyrion looks pretty similar quality-wise. The creatures look great, even if their designs are a tad uninspired. Some of them are pretty creepy looking though, especially the ones on the lava planet. The guns looks absolutely stunning though, as do the ships, tools, and devices. Water effects are pretty solid looking too. Overall this game looks pretty great for what it is.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nCurrently Empyrion is lacking in this department. There is only really music on the title screen, but that track is great. It really sets the tone of the game...inspiring a sense of awe and wonder. There are sound effects are for everything I've found, so far at least. I expect more to be added during th egame's development while in Early Access. Music really helps to set the mood for many aspects of a game, and can be the most memorable thing gamers recall about a game. I'm such a gamer, and music really stands out to me if it's good.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nMy framerate ranged from 30 to 49 during my time playing, according to Shadowplay's FPS counter. I didn't experience any crashes, missing textures, or anything of that nature. I did experience a slight bug wher ea monster started pursuing me and just stood there, even while filling it with bullet holes. Apparently this glitch was fixed in a patch earlier today, showing that the developers are at least paying attention to their game and player feedback/bug reports. This is always a big plus for Early Access titles.\n\nUsing the mouse/keyboard is the the way to go. I didn't bother testing my controller as the default controls suit me better for this type of game. The same goes for most first person shooters. It's just easier to aim using the mouse/keyboard.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nEven though it's Early Acces, Empyrion shows a lot of promise. This is definitely a title to keep your eye on. Buy it if you want to support hard-working developers complete their game and watch the game evolve as more features and content are added!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/7zPbyzADK7s\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 141 of 209 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","141","209","10","15"

Part Sci-fi, all Survival, Empyrion starts you off on one of Two planets, a lush and plentiful world with abundant resources, or a hostile and sparse desert planet where survival is even more of a struggle. Choose your planet, depending on how difficult a challenge you want. You need to hunt for meat, eat food, drink water, and manage your oxygen. While trying to live off the land you also will have to fend off creatures, alien soldiers, drones and more. Mine for ore and materials, craft and build ships and bases, there is a wealth of things to do in Empyrion.\n\nHover Ships allow for quick and easy travel across planet surfaces, whereas small ships allow you to leave the planets orbit and fly to nearby asteroids and moons. Capital Ships, the biggest in the game, can be built which will take you to other solar systems. There you can discover new types of planets, new creatures and more. You are limited in the types of materials you can build with, but this may be an issue fixed over time as the game continues to develop.\n\nThe game is still in early access, so there are some things which are subject to possibly change. The game doesn't have quests or objectives and is currently an open-world sandbox; However, for those who enjoy a challenge, the AI tends to be very aggressive, but predictable and can present a challenge to players new to the survival genre. I would like to see more objects you can build, more creatures, and more content overall, but as I said this game is still in Early Alpha, so we can expect to see some changes over time. Empyrion has quickly become one of my go-to Survival Games and I look forward to seeing how it continues to develop.","January 1","true","106.4"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","42","50","2","1"

However, it still has a lot of work before its worth the price. So far it is just too shallow. Multiplayer isn't yet fully functional. The combat is rather dull and repetitive. The building is pretty shallow as well with not many 'functional' or 'useful' blocks. The damage model is block by block, which results in combat simply being about tunneling to a critical component which isn't very deep and it is asthetically unpleasing when you have parts of ships just free floating still magically connected. The damage model probably should have been different. The crafting is rather tedious with raw mats to sub components to components and many of the features or mechanics of the game are also very tedious, such as the oxygen and power cell systems. Game will likely be another lobby based 'survival game' which means the servers will be run by butthurt kids that kick/ban anyone better than them. The game likely will not be a MMO by any means as much of the current testing community is hostile towards anything but single player.\n\nAlso careful, the fanbois apparently down vote all dissenting views.","August 7, 2015","false","12.7"," 329 of 522 people (63%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","63","329","522","20","12"

Fun factor:  8 (lots to explore and discover.  Tense yet exciting gameplay almost throughout the entire experience)\n\n2.Creative factor: 10 (such great potential in designs, from full-fledged star ships to hidden underground bases and the ability to share them with the community)\n\n3. Challenge factor: 6 (this is probably higher if the wiki is unavailable to assist your start.  Magnesium resource is a single point of failure however, meaning if you don't have much or run out, you run out of ammo)\n\n4. Graphics factor: 8 (will be higher upon release I'm sure but still looks pretty amazing as is)\n\n5. Music factor:  10!  (Two steps from hell vibe and I just love it!  I hold a games music as one of the most important aspects of experiencing a game.)\n\n6. Cinematics factor: n/a (being a sandbox there are no cinematic events... yet at least)\n\n7. Story factor n/a (as of early access, with current lore though it's a 6 with potential for more)\n\n8. Content factor: 8 (lots of blocks and components with more being added steadily)\n\n9. Control factor: 7 (I personally don't like wavy cameras which only happens in third person view anyways, otherwise controls are intuitive)\n\n10.  Gameplay factor: 10 (it's already a pretty good survival game, coupled with creativity and terraforming capabilities the game play is through the roof for me!  Also there is multiplayer which I have yet to experience)\n\nIssues:\n1. Mechanically speaking there are none, the game runs great though I have a better than middling machine.  For an early access game there is quite a bit of polish it seems.\n\n2. Capital vessels still fly a bit clunky sometimes, but mostly show no issues outside your own faults in designing the vessel.\n\n\n\nMy most intense experience came while raiding an alien power plant.  After delving down a few levels I came to a stairwell that led to an open floor below.  I took out a couple guards who were visible from the top of the stairs.  As I descended the screen turned red and gunshots were everywhere.  I blasted two more aliens with my chain gun then B lined to a door well to hide in and made it there with 1 hp left.  Much to their chagrin I was prepared.  I was able to heal up and clear the rest of the room.  I went on to salvage the rest of the base.\n\nEmpyrion strikes a near perfect balance between surviving and thriving.  There is always something to do whether that's mining more resources, creating and expanding your base, gathering and creating your necessities, or striking out to explore your world, then your solar system, and eventually on to other systems.  None of this feels like work, it's almost all play!\n\nI give Empyrion in its current state a 7.5/10 and it gets better with each patch!  The dev team is great at communicating and the community is extremely helpful as well.","March 14","true","161.2"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

The originally exciting feeling of being a lone survivor on an alien planet with nothing but your wits and skill has been replaced with to many mainstream, easy path, options that ultimately lessen the whole experience.\n\nLike many gamers I really enjoy the surival/sandbox genre. The restrictions of linear, on rails, gaming seems to be rapidly falling behind us and a new era of 'do whatever you want' gaming is the current trend. However, this type of gaming is very time consuming for developers and as a consequence is probably not very financially sustanable.\n\nWhen i first started playing EGS it really seemed to encapsulate the true feeling of survival sandbox. I actually feel really sorry for players who wont get to experience 'vanilla' EGS. Waking up on an alien world with nothing but a broken escape pod, a few emergency supplies, and rapidly diminishing oxygen supply (the environment of the original start planet was not breathable), and hostile alien life forms everywhere, created a real sense of panic and urgency.\n\nYou had to make fast decisions and weigh up pros and cons of your actions; for example, you can see a crashed captial ship in the distance where there might be more supplies but to get there and back on limited oxygen and with hostile creatures around is a real gamble. Do you make a run for it, hoping to get there and back in time? Do you waste precious resources to build a land vehicle to take you there? Do you boycote the idea altogether and think of something else?\n\nEGS gave you these choices and the means to accomplish them but it left the 'how' entirely up to you. It was just as likely that your choices would end up getting you killed, but that was okay as it leant to the feeling of tension.\n\nThere was a definite feeling of elation once you had developed a sustainable source of food and clean water.\n\nAnd then there was space travel. Wow, that feeling when you make your first craft space worthy and break the bonds of gravity - awesome.\n\nAnd then there is now, The survival sandbox has gone, replaced with a starting world so habitable and 'easy' that there is little point going anywhere else. Your new construction module doesn't even need power for pity's sake! And tech trees? Really?? I dont recall Robinson Crusoe having a tech tree (look him up kids), or Matt Damon in The Martian.\n\nThe sense of panic felt when you spawned on a planet without air is gone, as is any sense of need to progress at all.\n\nYes, I am aware that I can still choose to spawn on Omicron but what is the point? Once multiplayer comes in there will be no incentive to have a harder start than your friends.\n\nUltimately it is just a real shame. I don't know what caused the devs to head down this path as this is certainly not what I paid for. You are no longer buying a survival sandbox but a FPS with tech trees and some base building.\n\nThe priority for the devs was supposed to be procedularly generated planets. That is what the game needed. That would have made it epic, especially as No Man's Sky is rapidly approaching. Without this feature this game will get quickly left behind, even more so  now the core elements that made it fun are gone.\n\nI loved this game and the potential it had and a few weeks ago would have recommended it whole heartedly. Now i dont, and I wont. I feel quite sad about that.","November 15, 2015","false","71.3"," 109 of 164 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","109","164","7","11"

Most fun I've had in survival multiplayer since minecraft.  Hosting a server doesnt even require skills, and runs stable.\n\nI HATE complex crafting games, but somehow this one takes that complexity and makes it digestable...thats important I think for the long term viability of a game like this.\n\nThe planets are generous with resources but they are used quickly - for a team of 4 or 5 that is many mouths to feed, and just keeping fed is a real pain in the early game when you cant leave the planet or have a food device in your base.\n\nMake a capital ship and suddenly fuel is a real issue.\n\nBut the best part of this game, and its the same quality that minecraft enjoyed back in the beta when monsters first came out and were bugged, is that you can find yourself in genuinely star trek like problems and have to find a way out of them...somehow.\n\njust the other night a friend of mine steered our new ship to a new planet while me and another person tagged along, the idea being to get food because the desert planet is lacking and were all starving.  While there, one of us turned on the ship then got out by accident, which led to the three of us looking at the ship floating away from us and into space.  We would have been stranded, except that one of us decided to shoot and destroy the RCS of the ship to bring it back down.  The ship landed, and took hull damage and lost a side thruster.  With a fridge on the ship full of food, one of us had to use the map to help the pilot navigate back home on no RCS or side thrust. Took a while but we actually made it back to base on the other planet.  We've had more adventures like this since....this game needs to be played multi with friends for the best experience.\n\nRecommend you start on the desert planet first - make it harder on yourself and the rewards for surviving are that much richer...that is the point of a survival game, isnt it?","September 26, 2015","true","194.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","31","36","7","0"

This just adds so much to the immersion in the game for me, as opposed to spending all your time floating around space.\n\nEmpyrions engineering aspects are a lot less complex (and thus a lot less interesting in my opinion) currently, then space engineers. As such it holds nowhere near the same replay-ability as SE.\nImportant to note though, that SE has been around for 2 years or so already, and I'm writing this review of Empyrion, two weeks after its pre-alpa release on steam.\n\nI'd actually recommend buying it now due to temporary low price, be completely addicted to it for a few weeks, then wait for more mechanics to be added.\nGranted I don't know at this point to what extent they plan on evolving the complexity of the engineering elements of the game, I would be very surprised if they chose only to expand on the survival.\n\nThere are a number of little bugs at the moment, none of which are gamebraking IMO, but one feature that we all eagerly await is dedicated multiplayer servers, as for now, you are limited to simulated LAN (like hamachi etc) to play with others.\n","August 25, 2015","true","111.2"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","35","43","3","0"

I park it underwater and go loot an abandoned mine. Bad idea.\nI shall never speak of the horrors I have witnessed down there. My little space man is emotionally scarred forever.\nAnyway back to my vessel. Well apparently the waterpressure or whatever dammaged everything. The cockpit is gone.

There's all kinds of stuff to build, mine, craft, smelt, etc.  You have to pay attention to health, hunger and oxygen (although the "easy" start planet has breathable atmosphere), which makes for a constant tension.  It's decently paced, in that you won't get bored while searching for materials often.  There are several hard lessons to learn in this game, which can either be really fun or really frustrating depending on what you like.  For me it is pretty fun, and of course the balancing will be tweaked as the game develops.  My advice for new players: bring guns.  and ammo.  as much as you can.  The most common "shooting" enemies have very powerful guns, incredible aim, and they never give up and cannot be outrun.  Basically if you run into one with no ammo, you are going to die.  And lose everything you've spent the last 2 hours gathering, unless you respawn in your base, craft new weapons and ammo, and hike over to where you were killed (hopefully you can find it) and then kill the drone and reclaim your stuff. This is the one area of the game so far that I feel could really be improved, as it means if at any time a drone comes within a kilometer or so and you don't have much ammo, you're going to die and lose everything and there's never anything you can do about it.\nBut overall this is a fantastic pre-alpha and I'm eager to see what the devs can do wit hthis","October 3, 2015","true","24.5"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","1"

I had chills!\n\nShips having burning re-entry! YEEEEEEEE!!! :D\n\nand so much more! play the game to see the rest of the pros!\n\nCons:\n\nblocked off poles of the planets, soon to be replaced.\n\nCapital ships causing your death and their destruction upon planetary entry\n\nmissing animations (but hey, pre-alpha so far)\n\nentering void space and desync mishaps (however entertaining)\n\nin my personal opinion, a lack of a certain few weapons for infantry and ships alike, I.E. Melee weapons and general melee ability for infantry, and a wider variety of weapons available for large ships and small. some of those guns on bases would actually work well on large ships.\n\nno large doors to cover multiple block sizes, for example, hangar doors.\n\ncurrently no way to bring hover vehicles into the atmosphere and store away on larger ships.\n\nwater doesn't fill in areas if drilling extends the water's fill area\n\nall of these I believe will be resolved in later versions, and so, I'll continue to enjoy this game for what it is.\n\n\nIf you love sandbox games and even more so, love watching something grow, get this game, it is well worth the money","December 2, 2015","true","75.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","26","29","4","0"

Even in pre-alpha it has absorbed over 30 hours of my time without even a second thought. Obviously there are a lot of issues and the developers have a lot of work to do but the game is stable (on my machine at least) and loads of fun, so what more can you ask of a pre-alpha?\n\nPros:\n- Great ideas implemented already regarding items, resources and constructables\n- Build system is largely done and works very nicely\n- Awesome concept, wanted a galactic survival game for ages\n- Exciting possibilities for adventuring with POIs to explore and loot\n- Cool weaponry like pulse rifles\n- Already has a great atmosphere/ambience to it\n\nCons:\n- Planets are a bit wee and you currently can't visit the poles plus there is a green barrier where the terrain has been wrapped about the planetary sphere and joined. Bit freaky and weird that!\n- Memory requirements are vast; I have 8GB which overflows after a few hours play. Exiting and restarting the game dumps the memory for further play...\n- Ship weapons are a bit difficult to use currently, no heat seekers yet...\n- I fell though the ground into null space! Haven't done this since the days of the first Quake! Only the once in 30 odd hours though...\n- Hover vessels can flip over when bumping into objects like plants = annoying and irreversible\n- Need more/better animals and weather to bring worlds to life. Marine life?\n- Not fully procedural yet and it is not 'galactic' yet either; more like a single solar system where the planets sit rotating on their axes and not orbiting their parent star at all. As an astrophysicist this is a little strange to me!\n\nOverall the game at this stage deserves a 6/10 for entertainment and interest value, though falls down precisely because it is pre-alpha and there is much to do. With the right development, and it looks like the team are on the case with this, I can see this getting towards 9/10 quite easily over the coming year or so. If you enjoy creative games like minecraft then you'll get a lot out of this already. That being said you may wish to wait a little longer for its alpha release if the bugs and issues will frustrate.

Okay, so that may be an overuse of the word epic, but you get the point.\n\nThis game is in Early Access and has it's rough edges and bugs, but so far, since the closed pre-alpha has started they have squashed numerous bugs and proven that they are willing to listen to the community.  The game so far is already fun, but if they implement even half the features they have planned for the future this game will definitely be amazing.\n\nDon't look to this game for super complicated systems with 20 dozen moving parts, look to this game for it's namesake, intergalactic survival (or at least interplanetary survival for now).  Oh, and never go anywhere without a backup plan.  At this stage of the game it's much too easy to accidentally wreck your ship on an alien planet and have no way to get back up and going again.  My recommendation, carry a base starter kit with a constructor, generator, and fuel tank.  That way if you get wrecked then you at least have SOMETHING to start with.","August 6, 2015","true","34.7"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","30","38","4","0"

No, you're not big. No, you're not. You're small in time and in space. And you have this frail vessel called the human body that's limited on Earth."  -  Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\nEmpyrion is an open world, or should I say open galaxy space exploration survival game.  Build, craft, fight, kill, struggle, survive, overcome and devour EVERYTHING..  The game starts you off in a space pod headings towards a planet (one of two options you can initially select when the game starts up)  After crashing into the ground you exit your space pod and you're off.  The game like many other survival games doesn't really give you any type of direction, it's more of a do whatever you want whenever you want type of game.\n\nWhat you'll want to do is start collecting resources so you can build yourself a nifty spaceship and get off either of the starter planets as soon as possible..  Not because the planets aren't awesome (they are) but because you'll want to get up there in space, where a man (or woman) can be free.  Turn on some Lynyrd Skynyrd's Freebird, kick your craft into overdrive and look for the next planet where you can cash some checks and crack some necks.. Before we start getting into building your ship you'll need to collect some resources, maybe explore some ancient structures, be the first to discover an Alien Species and nail it (Ok maybe not so much Alien nailing, as you'll be doing Alien slaughtering, like one of the founding fathers)  The Galaxy is your oyster, to do with what you will\n\nEmpyrion doesn't really have much a story, outside of you crash landing on a strange planet, so the story you create will be your own, unlike many other survival games which are limited, this game seems to have unlimited potential.  Whether you want to explore new planets, build a vehicle, (3 choices to choose from) build yourself bases (ever had a dream of visiting the space station hovering above earth... you can totally do it)... You can literally do so many things in this game you could get lost for hours upon hours of fun and excitement.\n\nI can say I absolutely loved this game with a passion, it can take a bit of getting used too until you're able to really love it, but once you start to love it you won't stop..   (Pro Tip - put your O2 Machine inside water.. or else it won't work.. don't be a knuckle head like me and try to place i ton land, then wonder why it won't start up..)\n\nPro's\nAmazing looking worlds,\nAwesome progression system\nLoads of crafting..\nSpaceships..\ndecent sounds..\nEarly Access means it'll only continue to get better\n\nCon's\nCould have used a better tutorial, I possibly could have missed it?  This was really the only negative I had about the game.\n\nRecommendation\nWhat are you waiting for..  go buy Empyrion now, don't waste time reading, just go, add funds to your steam account, hit the add to cart and buy it.  If you love other survival games you'll love this one.  I can't recommend this game enough, I absolutely loved it on every conceivable level possible.  My children watched me and were drooling, demanding I get off the computer, all I could do was simply tell them I was enjoying the game on a level they couldn't even begin to comprehend.  Normally Early Access games are a snatch and grab but this game has an awesome developer, who listens to the community and makes changes which seem to be universally loved..","April 19","true","6.1"," 54 of 80 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","54","80","5","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xarinatan/recommended/383120/","xarinatan","Anthropy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xarinatan/","309 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Under the warning that this game is far from finished and, certainly for the current price, I really expect the game to be more complete and rebalanced in the future.\n\nIs it currently enjoyable playing? A bit I guess. Some things like crafting are tedious, but there's plenty content if you take the time to actually explore and play the game.\n\nWhat I dislike in the current state (16-8-2015):\nThe game is very unfinished and out of balance. Things like crafting are tedious and boring, resources are scarce, enemies are powerful (especially drones and turrets), AI is limited (own turrets usually don't work), and so forth. This really is a pre-alpha and you should treat it as such. The current price seems a little high for a pre-alpha, although I guess there's plenty content already. Furthermore:\n-Everything requires tremendous amounts of resources which are only sparsely available and have to be hand-drilled.\n-The construction system is tedious and mediocre, requiring you to craft intermediate items from intermediate items before you can create usable products and blocks.\n-(Enemy) weapons are overpowered. Drones and turrets can spam rockets with 1 per 2-3 seconds, from a 500-1000M distance, and it takes exactly 3 direct shots for a heavily armored ship to be shot to hell. Enemies (towers for example) often have multiple of these turrets.\n-Physics are clumsy. Spaceships don't float, they glide sorta like airplanes, regardless of thruster setup and complete lack of wings. possible bug with broken inertial dampener system, only using the bottom thruster to fight against gravity?\n-Characters are slow, especially with the jet pack, and it's easy to get disoriented as they can flip over when flying into objects or when turning on/off the jetpack.\n-lots of little glitches and bugs, that can range from randomly causing the game to crash to just displaying errors, and just a very incomplete feel to the game.\n-In my taste the planet implementation is weird. when you fly from space to a planet, you essentially transfer into a different map. All maps are flat, so the worlds may seem flat, but when you fly forward for a while you hit a green zone which teleports you to the other side of the map. Additionally the poles of planets are unreachable for the same reason, the square map would cause cluster♥♥♥♥ happening there. They say they're going to make the poles reachable, but with the current implementation I wonder how they're going to accomplish that.\n\n\nWhat I do like about the game:\nIt's an interesting concept, a Survival oriented space sandbox, where you can choose the sky after you're done with one planet. This basically means you have your typical survival game where you must collect food and resources in a map with other players and creatures, but you can expand your horizons by choosing space, flying to another planet, or simply build a base in space. That alone makes it more interesting in concept than something like most zombie survival games out there right now, since you'll have infinitely more environments to play with than other games.\nFurthermore:\n-Voxel all the things, you can mine and terraform planets and asteroids, you can build your own ships, and everything is destructible.\n-Plenty things to do for now. There's certainly more than a few hours of gameplay already in there, some things may be a bit tedious to do, but you can create a base on and explore every planet, and try to take all the towers and stations and bases that are setup across the different worlds and in space with your own creations, which will take you quite a while.\n-Devs seem committed, even though I haven't had the game very long, there's been a few updates, and each update they've addressed issues and expanded the game.\n-Promises seem lofty, this can be a gem of a game if the developers keep working on this.\n\n\nPersonally I'm going to wait a while and hope for content updates and improvements. When it has improved, I will continue playing. A little the same as with Space engineers, which some others here may have played, although space engineers has a much more advanced engine and physics, and the upcoming worlds should be a lot larger and better implemented than this game. Grr, why is everything awesome unfinished :P stupid devs! fix everything and make it perfect pls! I'm bored and require my antiboredom fix! zamg!","August 16, 2015","true","65.2"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","25","31","4","2"

Runaway climate change has caused extreme weather like hurricanes of unimaginable ferocity that brought widespread devastation. Global warming has reduced most of the polar ice and has induced a rise in sea levels by more than 30 meters submerging low-lying areas of the planet and flooding coastal cities.\n\nThe cascade of resulting changes had lead to political instability, riots and looting, war over resources, hundreds of millions of refugees, severe droughts, famines, mass extinctions of many species, and ecosystem collapse. According to the “United Council of Humanity” (UCH), the human race has less than 100 years before a complete breakdown of industrial civilization.\n\nIn the year 2402, a team of researchers discovered the wreck of a starship in the Antarctic, hidden up to this time under a thick cover of ice. Apparently, the ship belonged to a technologically highly advanced alien race and was powered by an unknown form of energy. Also a star map containing ancient symbols was recovered. Soon scientists realized that the symbols on the star map were similar to those used in ancient cosmologies to describe “Empyrion” – the land of plenty.\n\nIt took two decades until scientists began to understand the functioning of the alien energy cells and decrypt the map.\n\nDecryption, however, was only partially successful and the resulting coordinates remained ambiguous. The star map seemed to point to a location far away in the Andromeda Galaxy about 2.5 million light-years away.\n\nGiven the increasingly desperate situation on Earth, the UCH decided to focus the remaining resources on Earth on a unified effort to build a fleet of starships with the aim of establishing contact with the mysterious aliens and finding Empyrion.\n\nThe hope of saving the Earth from apocalypse guided the endeavor, named “Operation Phoenix.” All ships were equipped with an alien energy cell to power their experimental hyperdrives – a technology never used before. The preparation and construction of the fleet took more than 50 years. Participants were selected at young age, contingent on showing superior genetic, cognitive and physical attributes. They received extensive combat training and broad engineering skills.\n\nFinally, in 2473, the fleet of starships is ready and you are the first commander of the frigate “MS Titan.” When the fleet disembarks on its journey to find Empyrion, mankind has united to attend the event. After you activate the hyperdrive, however, something goes wrong and an unknown force takes control of your ship…\n\nSubsequent to reappearance from hyperdrive, your ship is disabled and drifts in the orbit of an unknown planet somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy far away from the destination that was indicated by the map. You have lost contact with all other ships of Operation Phoenix. Gravity pulls your disabled ship towards the surface where it crashes.\n\nThe impact completely destroys the ship and kills the crew. You are the only survivor. Find a way to leave this hostile planet and uncover the mysteries of Empyrion. Save the Earth before it is too late!\n\nThe Game\nThis is where we start, lost in the Andromeda Galaxy crash landed with an escape pod on Omicron, an alien planet. Your mission is to find Empyrion the new World.\n\nSurvive the harsh environment, fighting aliens and monsters. Build your base of operations, harness the planets resources, farm, hunt, mine. Mining has never been as much fun with each Planet allowing you to fully deform it mining out all those resources.\n\nWhen you are ready build a Ground Vehicle to explore the planet, gather resources, invade and eliminate Alien Structures and loot the spoils for survival.\n\nBuild your own space ship and travel from Omicron into space, mining Asteroids, visiting different Planet with their own unique resource you need to harvest to survive. Fight alien spaceships and attack alien space stations.\n\nVisit the dark side of the Omicron moon, who knows what skeletons of past events await you there.\n\nWhy stop there, build your own mothership and space station to dock your spaceship fleet on and take over space on your mission to find Empyrion.\n\nThe sky is not the limit, only your imagination is.\n\nWant to know what the gameplay looks like, here you go:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfWXLfR-pcI","August 5, 2015","true","275.2"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","2"

Well worth the 10$.\n\nI only played multiplayer. Your experience may vary. This in reference to 5.1 prealpha.\n\nThe game is very entertaining and engaging. There's a lot to keep you busy through level 20. Once you hit around Level 15-20 you get your space legs. The game becomes a colony game after that; visiting planets to acquire/collect its resources. There are four types of structures you can build: a base, a hover vehicle, a small space vessel, and a Capital Vessel (Space Base).\n\nCentral to the game is building. You're constantly building something. If you're not building something, you're collecting stuff to build something.\n\nAI on mobs are trivial.\nPvP leaves something to be desired.\nThe bugs. Being pre-alpha there are a number of them. I'm not going to list them all but I will share my experience: All told, across 3 or 4 servers, I've lost 3 capital vessels, 2 small vessels, and one base. Just poofed, vanished. Capital vessels are a huge time sink in regards to resource collecting, design, and build. It gets very frustrating having several hours of work wiped out. And then there's the issue of not being able to login to a server if you logged out on a bugged planet or orbit....\n\nWithout the current bugs I would highly recommend it. With it I would say maybe wait until the servers are more stable. If you can get over losing hours of your time to server issues/bugs, go for it. If not, wait until they fix server optimization.\n\n","January 11","true","483.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

This already feels well worth the money in it's current state.\n\nI hope in time this will grow to the point of completion as it does feel very special as is, so I can only imagine this will be mind blowing on final release. This ran at a solid 60 fps. When I changed the refresh rate to 144hz, my fps would vary between 112 and 144 fps. For anyoone playing with 3 monitors, it scales quite well @ 5760 x 1080.\n\nspec....\n\nGTX 980 ti\ni7 4790\n16 Gigs ram\nWindows 10\n\nI fully recommend this to players that have a good attention span and are willing to learn how to do things in the game either through trial and error, watching the video guides, or reading the forums a little. Once you get going it is not as difficult as it seems. Quite fun learning by yourself too. If you get frustrated with micro managing or resource gathering, then this might not be for you. The same applies if you need the game to guide you as you go.","August 7, 2015","true","13.4"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","69","36","52","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/383120/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEmpyrion – Galactic Survival is an early access open world survival game set in space with tons of content, Steam workshop and a great soundtrack.\n\nEmpyrion starts with you selecting which world you'd like to play on out of two available: Akua and Omicron. They differ from each other aesthetically and environmentally (gravity, oxygen) but the main difference is difficulty; Omicron is not recommended for people starting out for the first time as the overall conditions of the planet are more challenging. Once you've chosen your world you can select your game mode from Creative and Survival both being relatively self-explanatory. In survival mode you must scavenge, craft, build and keep yourself alive whilst gradually building yourself a base, exploring the massive world and if you choose later on, making some kind of spacecraft. You can choose your seed, play with the predefined one or randomize it to add plenty of re-playability when it comes to exploration. Creative mode allows you to play without worrying about your health/food/oxygen and starts with your tech trees fully unlocked and all blocks and items available. You also have the choice when choosing your creative world to turn pre-built structures on or off; if you choose to have them on you'll spawn in the world inside a pre-built base with a spaceship already made for you outside. This is a fantastic way for you to see how a basic functioning base looks and also helps you to envision how you're going to build your own as choosing what goes where on your first few plays can be pretty difficult.\n\nWhen you start survival mode you'll find yourself in an escape pod that is crash landing. You can guide your pod to a safe location, preferably somewhere near water or an ore deposit as those are crucial to your base building and general survival. Once you land you'll need to remove your starting gear from your now-destroyed pod and then it is up to you to survive alone. You'll find you have various stats of your own that you'll need to monitor whilst playing as they will decrease over time or with certain actions. These are your health, food, oxygen and stamina levels. Food is an easy one as you can find various food sources scattered all over the planet, either growing on the ground of from hostile mobs you may encounter. All food that you find or create has a perish time within which you'll need to consume it to stop it going bad. As you progress and level up you'll be able to unlock a fridge which will freeze perish times whilst food is stored inside it. Oxygen is required on some planets that do not have a breathable atmosphere and can also come in handy whilst you are underwater. While you have your helmet on you will consume oxygen which can be refilled at an O2 station but you can remove your helmet at any time to conserve your O2 levels. Though Akua has a breathable atmosphere you will still need oxygen tanks with you if you choose to explore other planets or risk possibly fatal consequences. Stamina is consumed when running and will auto refill whilst you are stationary and as far as I have seen has no other use. Lastly, health is pretty self explanatory, when you take damage you'll lose health which you can regenerate by using the various medical items in game.\n\nExploration in Empyrion is so far the most enjoyable part for me with plenty to be found already. There are multiple types of resources and mobs that you'll find, some which are peaceful and others that'll attack on sight. There are also pre-built structures such as settlements of other races, abandoned factories or buildings and crashed ships to explore and scavenge. Once you tire of your current planet you can leave and explore space and other moons (right now I wasn't able to find too much in space but I'm sure more content will be added to during early access).\nYou can level yourself via exploration and combat and this will grant you with unlock points to be spent within your tech trees. Your tech tree allows you to unlock various items that'll be useful but also grants you a way to control your progression rather than having predefined unlocks thrust upon you. This lets you to choose which gameplay style you prefer, prioritizing combat upgrades over base building ones for example if you prefer an aggressive approach to things.\nCrafting is relatively simple, you'll need to the correct resources, have the correct tech unlocked and the correct crafting machine built. Once you input all the items or resources into the machine (it can store crafting materials there that aren't in use) you select the output item and quantity then wait for construction to complete.\n\nFor all the creative people who are torn on whether or not to buy Empyrion, I suggest checking out some of the Steam Workshop creations to see just what is possible as even I was shocked at what some people are able to create.\n\nDespite being a fantastic game I must mention Empyrion is not without fault, though I am sure this is due to it's early access nature. Right now the tutorial is completely text based and missable if you do not pay attention within the first 10 seconds of the game. To access the tutorial you must press F1 which is explained to you in a tiny box beside the mini-map which disappears shortly after appearing. I cannot understand why this does not just remain there until you choose to close it. My first time playing I missed it and this led to me having no clue what I was meant to be doing until after ten minutes of running around aimlessly I restarted completely. Once I was able to work my way through the tutorial there were some important bits of information that I felt were missing and I was only able to find out what most of the buttons did by repeatedly switching back and forth between the game and key binding settings. Whilst completing the various tutorial objectives I was also switching between that menu and the game without realising there is no auto-pause feature so my oxygen and food levels were depleting whilst I was reading the walls of text.\nMy only other complaint is placing blocks can be very tricky at times and can end up leaving you feeling frustrated because they don't align properly or snap out of place as you left click placing it somewhere else entirely. This makes building a solid foundation for a base a little tedious at time, especially in survival mode.\n\nEmpyrion so far has a lot to offer in terms of content and has active developers who provide frequent updates. The gameplay is very fun and the appealing graphics, immersive soundtrack and multiplayer options are a huge plus. If you're a fan of any of the great base-building survival games then there is no doubt you'll love Empyrion.","April 27","true","9.0"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","32","45","0","0"

There's obviously a bit of a learning curve with the game, as there is with any survival game at this stage of development, but once I found the in-game PDA with basic information, things started to fall into place.\n\nThere's certainly work that still needs to be done on the game, as I have seen several things things that are either missing (reload animations) or using low-quality placeholder assets (players w/o their helmets look rough).  But this is not the first alpha-phase survival game I've played, so I know the routine.  I've also seen some reviews from other long-time players that indicate the devs are fairly active with the community as well.\n\nAt the very least, I certainly play to put more time into the game this weekend when I get the time, and will update my review when I can.\n\nEDIT:  It's been nearly a week now since my first review, and I've had a hard time tearing myself away from it.  The game has been very enjoyable, from exploring a given planet to reaching outer space and beginning to explore out there.  As I said earlier, there are rough spots in the game, but for the state the game is in right now, even for an early alpha, it's been very enjoyable.","May 13","true","117.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

My full, long winded, review is here - http://steamcommunity.com/app/383120/discussions/0/357286119116489333/\n\n(Many of the issues I encountered have been fixed with update 1.6 which is a good sign.)\n\nI tried the game, in early state, as part of the free weekend given out on 5/13/2016. ~5 hours. I started on the, hard, planet Omicron. I figured it would be the most most challenging and interesting.  In addition to exploring and doing my own things I followed the tutorial, built an initial camp, a base, a hover vessel, and ultimately a small vessel to visit another planet.  These are my initial impressions and my experiences throughout that time.\n\nPROS\n*Stability and performance - No crashes, errors, or slowdown.  Game ran great.\n\n*Concept - A sci-fi game where you build ships and explore planets has a ton of potential.\n\n*Graphics - Didn't  have the typical blockiness of the genre. Looked good.\n\n*World Generation - The planets, despite being procedural looked natural. None of the normal strange in randomly made world stuff like large vertical dropoffs, odd floating bits, or opposing climates. Water looked great and it was relaxing to watch it lap at the shoreline.\n\n*Game Start - You plummet down in an escape pod you can kind of steer instead of just spawning on land.\n\n*Laser Mining Drill - Felt sci-fi unlike the copper pickaxe that other games hand you. Could do precise work or bore out large tunnels quickly.\n\n*Jetpack - Fun to  to fly.  Essential for some terrain.\n\n*The Drone - Hands down my favorite feature.  Deploy a drone which you can fly to scout and even build with.  Any builder game without it will now feel lacking to me.\n\nCONS*Initial Survival - You start with a ton of supplies.  Weaponry, tools, healing, curing, food, oxygen, base stations, lots resources, flashlight, portable work light, seeds for crops, crop soil, crop lights, etc.  I didn't feel like I was "roughing it" at all.\n\n*Survival Overall - Never felt like I was trying to survive.  Start with a machine for  oxygen.  Can easily get lots of food by picking plants, killing critters, or planting it.  The biggest survival issues were that its possible to get into situations where you are kinda stuck. Such as not having enough resources to make drill ammo to mine not enough to make bullets to kill creatures that are preventing you from mining to make more bullets, etc.\n\n*Tutorial - A PDA available (F1) with useful information, but actual tutorial isn't good. Veterans of the game even say the tutorial needed a lot of work.  Should have been fixed before the free weekend.  It has you build and do things in and order that doesn't set up properly. Worst of all, tts easily broken if you do anything out of order.  Once broken  you have to restart the game, restart the entire tutorial, go without it, or try doing things over again to "fix" it.\n\n*Combat - Few wildlife about.  Enemies AI is just charge you until within attack range. Repeat until you or it is dead.  Chase forever Faster than walking speed, but a bit slower than sprinting speed.\n\n*Sprinting / Jetpack - Mutually exclusive.  Toggle whether you want to jump and sprint or be use the jetpack.  You can't do both together.  It travel more annoying and makes it a royal pain to use in combat. (- Fixed with update 1.6)\n\n*Controls - Default controls, and those used often, are bound to ackward to press keys.  Can rebind, however, you can only bind a key to a single function.  Especially annoying with the jetpback toggle, bound to 'J', and the interact ability, bound to 'T.' Interact can't be bound to 'E' as in most games because it is used for rolling vehicles to the right which is also important.  The majority of control and keybinding issues could easily be fixed by seperating the controls into two templates, one for a keys function on foot and another for a keys function when in a vehicle.  This would allow for more customization of controls and to make them comfortable.\n\n*Building - Making blocks is tedious.  You can't get and use basic building materials like gather dirt, stone, or wood.  All blocks must be crafted acrafting station.  Rotation controls are ackward and don't make for quick and comfortable placement. Placed things can only be removed by use of a removal tool which you need to craft and has ammo.(- Update 1.6 made devices able to be picked up)  Removing sometimes gives back the block or will just give some parts it took to make it.  You can use blueprints to build things you've saved or gotten from workshop before hand which is nice for repeat builds of things, but doesn't address the issues of trying to build on the fly or in an improvisational way such as when jointly working to try to build something with friends.\n\n*Crafting - Can't craft anything, even basic stuff on foot.  All crafting must be done at crafting stations.  The interface doesn't provide enough useful info.  If you have enough materials to make 1 of something you can queue up 100's and it won't stop or tell you.  Doesn't tell you when early item in the queue will use up materials for something later in the queue.  Can't remove from queue without toggling station off and then restarting it.  Most things take parts, which take parts, which take parts. Its tedious with lots of fiddly micromanagement and extra steps.  Advanced Constructor stations later in the game address a lot of the tedium, but that doesn't fix the early game tedium or the lack of information. Crafting should be streamlined with better progression throughout instead of lumped into the last upgrade. (- Update 1.6 made early crafting less tedious)\n\n*Food - Food is easy to get, sure, but its a pain to juggle it.  Food items don't stack so they take more space than needed.  You can't use consumables directly from inventory so you have to open inventory, equip food, close inventory, select food, use food.  Lather, rinse, and repeat for each item of food of the numerous pieces of food you will eat. every. single. day. over the hundreds of hours of time you may end up putting into the game. (- FIXED with update 1.6)\n\nConclsuionMy issues are largely minor and annoying, yes. Its just that this is the kind of game you sink hundreds of hours into and those little things constantly annoying me will quickly grow to drive me completely insane.\n\nIn the time I spent playing the game I felt more like I was struggling to survival the interface and controls and not the beautiful hostile alien world that stretched out before me.\n\nLuckily, the issues I've described can predominately be fixed quite easily... only time will tell if the dvelopers do fix them and make this game a classic or if this is yet another potentially awesome game I'll be looking back on and thinking of what could have been.","May 13","false","5.3"," 270 of 467 people (58%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","58","270","467","19","118"

Sure, there's a ton of things still missing, but I wasn't that much hooked to a game in a long long time.\n\nYou start small on a planet with quite some ressources. First it seems pretty easy as you have a lot of everything. But if you aren't careful you might run out faster on things than you think.\n\nAs soon as you start building you get ideas. Bases, Shipyard, huge Capital Ships... possibilities seem endless.

But not this one. There's just to much things to do to bring yourself up to speed so you manage to get yourself juicy bases and enough ressources to concentrate on building the big things.\n\nAnd on the hunt for ressources you get quite some action as there are enemy bases set around that fire on you. Also the wildlife is not that tame and a drone here and there is also a danger.\n\nI had one smash my Glider while I was mining. Barely made it back to base, literally with my last breath on oxygen.

Most have come here from space engineers during the free weekend with the mindset that this game is like SE, and its not, and also foregetting that the game was just recently released to steam, and is currently still in beta/EA.\n\nNow, with that said, I am giving it a postitive review because it has several things to offer if you are willing to give it a real chance.\n\nPro's:\n1. Survival actually plays a role, at least in the early steps of the game.\n2. Need to work for the items.\n3. Need to manage resources in early game.\n4. Neutral and hostle mobs to contend with.\n5.

First, I haven't bought the game, only played during the free weekend. Second, in spite of rating it "recommended", I have no immediate plans to buy the game.\n\nThis game is a superb sci-fi exploration/survival/building game. You get dropped onto a hostile world, with a set of tools which should be sufficient to keep you alive if you keep your wits about you. In time, you can build up resources, and build a base. From there, you can build small vehicles to carry you around the planet, and eventually into space. Where you will get brutally murdered because you brought a fighter into a dogfight with an entire enemy capital ship fleet. Oops.\n\nMy first experience ended with me suffocating because I didn't know how to keep myself supplied with oxygen. I died by not knowing how to breathe (I'm terrible at this game). After that failed attempt, I started over. I fought off a couple of drones armed with gatling guns, while I was only armed with a pistol. Admittedly, the starting pistol fires .50cal rounds, so it's not like it's a pea-shooter, but it was a rough fight. Then I built up a decent stock of food and supplies, and constructed my first vehicle and promptly crashed it into a tree. Then a dinosaur. That didn't go well. No, the controls aren't bad. Like I said, I'm terrible at this game. When I eventually made it into space, I ran into a bigger ship than my own, and promptly died again. Because I'm terrible.\n\nBuilding things is somewhat reminiscent of Space Engineers for me, in the sense that you're not always building everything out of little cubes. There are pre-made turrets, and structures with different shapes and sizes that take up different amounts of space. It all makes sense, and it fits with the aesthetic of the game. You need food and oxygen. Your weapons need ammunition. Other systems need their own resources. You have to manage these things effectively to keep your base/ship/self functioning.\n\nThis game has a great sense of progression, survivalism and scale. It combines a lot of elements from Minecraft-like games, and does what it does well. Empyrion is subtitled "Galactic SURVIVAL" because it's a survival game first and foremost. Many Minecraft clones - particularly the sci-fi ones - don't do that part very well. It's very much about trying not to die in a hostile environment. Even in the "easy" starting world, it doesn't feel like it's an easy game.\n\nThere's a learning curve to be found here, but it's not too horrible. The tutorial is comprehensive, but doesn't always explain itself as well as I'd like. A few of the things it told me to do, it didn't explain HOW to do, and I had to dig around online to find out. While this isn't necessarily game-breaking, and there are good resources in easy reach, it would be nice to see this area cleaned up a bit as time goes on.\n\nMy experience revealed no game-breaking issues. The graphics are great, and it runs well on my year-old laptop (high-spec for a laptop at the time, but aging and still just a laptop). I played the game in 1080p with the graphics turned up high, and barely saw any dropped frames (about a second or so when loading a new area). The controls felt responsive, and the sound and music is great.\n\nAll that said, there are a few animations lacking (reloading is the most obvious absence), and the graphics and sound options seem incomplete. There's nothing that feels like it's unreasonable to be missing at this stage in development. It's still worth mentioning though. If you're expecting a completed and release-ready product, this isn't quite up to that yet. It is VERY stable and seems impressively well-optimised for alpha, but it does still have some rough edges to work on.\n\nI was quite impressed with the game, and at some stage, I'm sure I will pick it up. For the moment, what I want in a sci-fi voxel based building game is a bit different from the experience I found in Empyrion. That said, if you like the sound of a sci-fi survival game with a hostile world that actually feels threatening, I can whole-heartedly recommend this game.","May 15","true","0.8"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","1"

I am one of the lucky ones who has had no major glitches (no runaway ships, falling through the world or that sort of thing). For a game that is using a lot of stock tools, textures, models etc it is really well thought out. Despite having a lot of placeholders in it it feels very unique and has a personality all its own. The flow of it is very good. You start off with a sense of hopelessness and panic, as any good survival game should have, but quickly learn to get over yourself and get to work.\n\nOnce you've beaten that initial fear of dying and gotten a rythm going you move on to bigger and better things. The game is excellent at creating a "phased" or tiered growth, where each new plateau offers new challenges and new rewards. If this is a sign of things to come, I am going to keep right on loving this game. Some things I hope they do to expand the scope, many of which are already in the works, are solar systems (interstellar travel), procedurally generated random planets/flora/fauna/enemies, research, more customization, events (meteor showers, extreme weather, alien raids, volcanos etc), rare alien technology, more complex needs system, and my personal favorite: truly pressurized hulls.\n\nImagine being in a capital ship battle and hearing a missile slam into the side of your ship, suddenly you hear klaxxons blaring and a whoosh of oxygen escaping...seal that section off by closing blast doors and get back to the fight. I'd like to see oxygen become a major factor in this game as it was in FTL. Vacuum could work against you or for you, put out fires or cause you to rely on your suit's oxygen. In fact, extreme climates are a must imo because they'll help differentiate planets as well as space. Your ship will be all cozy and climate controlled until its plunged into darkness when your generator blows and now you have to deal with the harshness of the void.\n\nI won't say anything negative about this game at this point, not because I am such a fan but because its in pre-alpha so much of it will change...its not really a game yet so much as a framework for one (a very good one). This could go one of two ways, either they made this as a quick cash grab and knew they had to make it special enough to get early adopter's  $$$ or they really intended to build on it and move forward. Lets hope for the later. I'll be watching this one.","August 11, 2015","true","26.3"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

There are ofc some problems but with this game not being close to finnished i belive i will spend more time here then i am supposed to....\n\nStart....\n\nStarted up in the dessert (Omicron) with nothing and died about 10 times before i figured out that i need to read something about this game.. After that i made my first home on Omicron with a large base and both HV and SV ships in hangar. Now it was time to go to space...\n\nSpace - The final frontier.......\n\nIve now realised that if you want to build something bigger its a good thing to draw it up on paper. Used up some 2000 blocks before i was happy with it and some 30 hours later i have a space station that works :)\n\nFor now -\n\nAfter all my stations and ships that i have created i thought that it was time for a CV to be created. I loaded up my SV with rockets and alot of fuel and went to the lava planet to get some special ore... Oh so much fun i had there and then BANG. My ship got blown to bits by a rocket turret i missed when figting the big towers. Lost my O2 generator and my crafter plus rcs and core.\n\nSo here i am after 80 hours. Im left on a lava planet with no crafter and a butt load of stuff in the ship and need to reboot bak to starting point. I think i have learned something. Remember to have replacement parts in ship when you go out fighting or build a local base.\n\nStill im loving the game. For now i think il restart and make everything better from start.\n\nPS: Love the idea of MP but il wait until there is a good way to protect youre gear.\n","September 14, 2015","true","379.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","2"

I've had so much fun playing with buddies on our own private server. The excitement of slowly gathering the appropriate amount of resources to build a base, then a hover vessel for travel, then a bigger base, then your first small vessel to explore the moon and space, and then a bigger base, and then finally a capital vessel is so excrutiating and exhilarating.\n\nReally.\n\nFor an Alpha, this game feels more than playable. Thinking up new ship and base ideas, or emulating whatever sci-fi film franchise you can think of is never-ending.\n\nThe crafting system is relatively simple, and the learning curve will come naturally with a few hours of messing around.\n\nTruly the biggest excitement here is being able to leave orbit and warp to other galaxies and planets. It's such a wonderful concept I've been waiting years for.\n\nAlien bases are challenging, figuring out a good plan of attack is fun as well. Coordinating with fellow players and building bases together doesn't get old. There is always some new goal to complete, or new place to explore.\n\nThe devs work hard to update regularly, and whenever I've had issues or thoughts on how the game can get better, they seem to read my mind.\n\nI really recomend this game, and while there are a fair amount of weird glitches and bugs and workarounds (especially for server owners) I trust these things will get ironed out one at time as the Alpha continues its progress.","May 11","true","84.4"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

It's  bloody amazing.\nI recall the dark days where I would stare at the store page procrastinating for hours upon end. Well, those days are over as I now own this superior game. It's perfect for all those people who love a challenge and attempting to survive in a hostile environment at the same time. Empyrion boasts a huge potential, as it is only in a pre-alpha state.\nFrom what I've gathered from my short time playing (wrote at 4hrs gameplay) is that you, a lone survivor of a ship lands their escape pod onto one of two planets, one where oxygen is plentiful and the other a desolate wasteland of a desert with the only oxygen being in water. Shame there are no fishies. Tasked with survival in mind, you soon come across superior foes that utilise UAVs and other autonomous weapons platforms.\nI hate writing reviews. Do yourself a favour;\nPurchase Empyrion - Galactic Survival.\nLet me know if you are thinking of getting this game, and I may have to persuade you even further.\n\n-F","November 2, 2015","true","88.2"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","0"

I have not been able to stomache any other survival games since early minecraft but this one did it somehow. Seriously its great guys.\nIm gonna just copy and paste a story of what happened to me and my friends in the game that I wrote down somewhere else. (It all really happened)\n\n\n"So on a voyage back to our homeworld of earth on the U.S.S. Xanadu we come under attack by what appears to be alien like drones, our ship was lightly armed so we didnt stand a chance. They took out our engines first and we were locked in a descent towards a desert planet that our archives said it was named "Omicron". In our descent we hopped into an escape pod and I managed to land us into a desert mountain valley next to a very large body of water. We had nothing but a few rations and a coupple of energy packs. We could see a few lit up towers and combat drones on the horizon and our crashed ship in the sand a few miles away. Me and my two crew mates Ensign Jeremiah Neilson, Ensign Jeff Soc, and me their leader Captian Evalyn Dykton armed ourselves with a few standard issue pistols we grabbed as the ship was going down. We set up a means of oxygen generation in the nearby shallow water and headed to the wreck of our ship. We were met with heavy resistance and a few drones took down Ensign Soc and we had to leave him with some water and food while me and Ensign Jeremiah headed to the wreck. We managed to find enough things to start our inssurection of the alien forces. Over the coming weeks we set up a base and hover craft with weapons and one by one, the towers fell and the alien prescence on the planet was slowly extinguished. With the peace we decided to start fixing up a ship to head to orbit and we construced the Dragonfly dropsip which was baiscially a mobile base. We did some test flights and loaded it with weapons, ammo, oxygen, and fuel packs. We broke orbit to see what we could do about the aliens in space that took our beloved ship down. We found they were much stronger than we anticipated and we fought for a long time holding our own but got swarmed by a few drones, I attempted to fly back to the desert planet of Omicron and we were getting hit so badly we could not make it that far. The alien drones followed us right to the point of the planets atmosphere at this point we had no power and were free falling to the surface. We bailed out and used our RCS on our jet packs to pad our falls. We landed on the planets surface with a "ship" with nothing more on it than a landing gear and a cocpit. So here we are stranded on another planet back to square one. But this time, on a apparently uninhabited Icy wasteland of a planet. Or so we think."","September 27, 2015","true","54.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

The game has some polishing that needs to be done but the survival aspects are real. You start with a generous amount of supplies when you land on your starting planet and it may seem easy enough making progress but once you've made some of the basic machines and a small base your resources are going to run out and quickly...so you'll need to make a vehicle to find resources and take them back to base because the planets are BIG and the ore veins are reasonably spread apart. Either that or you can make some weapons and try to assualt some of the alien bases you'll encounter which btw are actually quite nerve wrecking to infiltrate. Mainly because they are guarded by automated turrets, drones and infested with alien soldiers as well as their "Pets". but the rewards are definitely justifiable. Give this game a go if you love building and even more so if you love space exploration.

This game is in a very early development state, for a pre-alpha wich is the current build (march 2016) it got plenty of features and still get more with every update. Soon there is the change to Alpha. Alot of People do not have a idea about pre-alpha and alpha, they expect a fully and sometimes also a polished game. This is usually not what you get when you buy a game in this stage of development. It means you get a playabe "demo" of what the game may will be when it goes in to a Beta stage - thats how it usualy works in the beginning devs add new features and content but ofc also bugfixes. The devs here seems to like what they do and also listen alot to the community and all the suggestions and feedback, as a owner of a early access game your meant to be a active part of the development process and if you like you are a tester, this is how EA works and nothing else. If you don't like this style you should go away and play something else - but don't forget to come back when it is released because this small team of devs are doing a great job, content is coming with lightspeed and most of those things are implemented because of feedback and suggestions of the community, It's not usual that a developer team is listening so much to the community and try to implent features wich are never planed or even on a roadmap when the game came first to a playable state to steam. Other EA games going well in the first weeks after first release of pre-alpha or alpha but then the devs falling a sleep and after months you may get a patch with some bugfixes and if your lucky also some advanced content or features, but not here. You can clearly see how the game is growing and get better and better with every update. There are bugs - thats usual for prealpha because this is the time to create and be creative for the devs and implement ideas and new content from the roadmap or just new ideas from the community. Don't be a fool and miss the chance to be part of this great survey since they really listen to the players - and not just say they do.\n\nThe game it self is growing fast and is a nice openworld survival space game wich has no need to hide behind bloommy shiny trailers and grafix and it's a hard opponent for other similiar games. The community is overall adult (ofc there are also kids but most of them get bored while they have no plan and expect too much for ea games.\n\nYou can Terraform the world with some tools, i builded myself a big reduit insde a mountain, with hangars for vessels of all kind and need, currently you can explore arround 10 Planets and some space playfields and moons. Some are friendly and really easy to settle others are hard if you try solo. There are plenty of weapons and alot of different ammunitoins for all kind of weapons, like easy peasy projectile weapons like pistols, shotguns, assualt rifle sniper rifles, laser guns and rifles, plasma weapons rocketlaunchers ect ect. every kind of weapon got his own ammo and all is craftable if your able to gather all needed ressources.\n\nYou can hunt aliens or animals, there are different Point of interest on every playfield wich are raidable destuctable and you can even take them over and build a better base on the remainings of your raid. or just salvage and get crafting materials to use for your builds.\n\nOn a standart game Single Player or Multiplayer you can choose between two starterplanets you start your Empire from. There may will be more in a later stage of the development, as you can see on the shop page there are plans for a bigger universe, currently there is only a single starsystem but thats alot allready to do, explore fight destroy or just enjoy while flying over with your self builded Vessels alone or together with your friend sitting by your in your vessels in passenger seats. Thats really alot of fun for hours and hours.\n\ni could tell you much more about this game, and later on i may will do that but for now this is enough Hope this small review helped you to decide if this could be the game you was looking for or not. Im quite sure you will like it and fall in love like me. If not don't blame me. I suggest wait some months and come back and be astonished how much more this gem growed up while you missed all the fun","February 19","true","295.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","10","13","5","0"

Disclaimer: I'm playing this for free during their free preview weekend.\n\nOverall: It still needs work, a lot of it.  It's Early Access Alpha, but it still needs a lot of tuning.  However, the gameplay itself is reasonably stable and what's there is quite functional.\n\nThe game's general premise is crash land on a planet and eventually build yourself up into a galactic menace.  You'd think the poor guy really would like to just get home once he's got a warp engine, but it gets a bit open ended.\n\nThe biggest problem is the grinding of materials. You have to make every pipe, every eletronic component, every everything.  That's fine, for a game like Factorio or Big Pharma where it's all about automating the pipeline.  For a game like this, where I find myself making 200-500 of each item before I go on a mining mission just so I don't have to wait again, it's a huge time sink for a game that has a core gameplay of 'make cool things and go blow them up'.\n\nThe fix for that is to simply make more constructors, but each constructor has its own inventory of materials to use for constructing which is incredibly micro heavy, and you can't give orders along the lines of "Keep 200 each of Pipes, Computers, Controls, and Electronics in supply" either.\n\nThen there's little things, like your character is too distracted to reload on his own when you use up the 10 shots in your starting pistol.  You have to manually reload.  Mining, something you'll do a lot of during your early missions, is tedious until you get an upgraded mining drill, which you can only upgrade AFTER you've built a ship, left the planet, and explored elsewhere.  Food takes up an inventory slot per item (IE: A burger), where as another inventory slot can carry a few tons of ore in a single stack.  You can't use anything from inventory, you have to put it on the hotbar and it will not replace from inventory once used (rather annoying with 50-food snacks when you're trying to refill your hunger meter, which is a 500 value bar).  You can't build 'under' a vessel until you've got it halfway built and can hover it with power.  Your inventory in the constructors are non-searchable and have no sorting, making for a game of hide and seek when you build a component or to figure out what supplies you have available.  A few dozen more of these small things add up to tedious exercises that just shouldn't be there.\n\nFinally, there's a gameplay choice I'm not sure I like, but I understand it.  Center of Mass means nothing.  If you're into Kerbal Space Program or any of that ilk, this will throw you for a loop.  If it points left, you go left.  You can hang it 100m off the nose of your craft, and it will not spin you, it will push you.\n\nIn the end, no, I don't recommend this game in its current state.  It's playable.  It COULD be a lot of fun.  There's a LOT of neat things you can do in this, and certainly make some cool looking stuff. However, until they allow for shared inventories for the crafting and allow automation of component construction and fix up a bunch of the small 'C'mon, really?' type interface and playability items, your time is too valuable to sink into this game.  Follow it.  See where it goes in 6 months.  It could become great.","May 14","false","8.6"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","34","59","0","14"

I play offline and currently have put about 20 hours in.\n\nI also think that this could, possibly, be the game that people think no mans sky will be.....hopefully people will support this one when/if NMS lets them down. Tbh, Empyrion is what i thought NMS would be, just still in development.\n\nPros-\n+Minecraft-like building system for bases and all vehicles. Your imagination is the limit (along with some sensible building limitations - ie you can't build an infinitely long unsupported beam). I'm not really a minecraft fan but in this context, it's great.\n+Crafting- resources for building revolves around roughly 10 base materials, some more difficult to find than others. Various foodstuffs to pickup and craft with as well. Crafting system is not a chore once you get a large constructor.\n+ Blueprint System - allows you to create designs in the creation mode of the game and import into any game you're playing\n+ Deformable terrain -i think this is just for mining or levelling tools but allows for underground base building if you want\n+ Stable - not one crash, high framerate, just the odd stutter\n+ Price - have not felt cheated on price at all, but i would have if it was more. I think they hit the best price point for us AND them\n+ POTENTIAL - the game has massive potential, it really does. They have, at this point in time, given us a relly solid base game which, if done correctly, could develop into a rip-snorter of a game. Could be EPIC, and i mean that :)\n\nCons (whilst bearing in mind it's still Alpha and some of these points already adressed in roadmap/announcements)\n- i find it a bit too easy currently, even on the hard planet\n- could do with much greater variation planetside - enemies, npc creatures, flora/fauna. Essentially i want this to look like no mans sky but maybe with a better colour pallet. Don't want much, do i :).\n- objectives would help stimulate gameplay possibly, currently they do not exist\n- tech tree needs a lot of work or removal. Would prefer to see it removed, alongside an expansion in crafting materials and using the relative scarcity of such materials as another driver for exploration.\n\nI've not played multiplayer yet so can't comment on that\n\nAll in all i'm really impressed with this game, but above all with its potential given where they are now. I only hope they stick with it. Therefore, thumbs up and i hope more people buy.","May 28","true","0.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

For now, I will say it is positive. I do wish there was a way like in Space Engineers to have a "sped up" world, in which the constructor was faster, less resources were needed, etc, as a lot of time is spent waiting around for stuff to craft. The game also should definitely get a tutorial to make it more obvious what to do at the start. A "major" bug I have found is that randomly in play, you will lose the ability to clear items from the queue, which might not seem like a big deal, until you realize that you might accidentally click a block that uses all of your materials, and be unable to stop it from crafting. This is a very annoying bug that if it gets fixed will help the game a good bit. People are getting all pissy that the trailer shows exploring and flying around planets, and that they can't do that right off the bat. People, come on. It's a survival game. You have to work your way up to leaving the planet. It shows what you can do AFTER you make your MOTHERSHIP in the video, which will take a while to get ready. The game looks alright, not great, but at the very least it performs pretty well for a pre-alpha. I also wish they made it so that if you remove a block or machine, it would actually give you everything you need to remake it, not just some, because I misplaced the Oxygen generator that was given to me, and instead of removing it and placing it in a closer water source, instead I had to break it down into a few parts and completely make it from scratch again. One more thing- MAKE IT SO THAT IF YOU CLICK A DEVICE, IT WILL CRAFT THE COMPONENTS TO THAT DEVICE AND JUST MAKE IT. Having to sift through the crafting menus and craft all the right stuff (the materials sometimes take other materials that you just made, so you can either work out the math of how much you need or just make more than you need) is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥.

Then the drop pod lands and right before i reach it, a giant monster with 3 arms eats me.... 10/10\n\n\nSerious review: This game is amazing, it is LIKE space engineers however those two games do not compare as they are on different calibers, this game however is like space engineers in the fact you can build your ship as big as you want but unlike other space games, in this game you have to make sure you have the supplies to run such a large ship as other games i have played once you get a large ship... it is end game as you never have to do anything to sustain it.\nYou have tons of weapons to fight off alien hordes and your ship can be what you want it to be without lagging your computer badly (Looking at you SE) this game also has very minor Block deformation, if you smash into an asteroid at 100m/s the front of your ship will be dented badly... and some blocks flatout break when you hit asteroids, Bases on this game are also amazing, want an orbital platform that can blockade the planet and stop people from landing on it? You can do that (However most server players would turn against you if you acted like the Empire....)\n\nSo for the amazing Dev team and game i give this game 9/10 and i will boost it up to a 10 when they allow small ships small warp drives that let them jump 1 AU (AU is a measurement of distance i believe) as right now small ships must dock to a capital ship to warp.\n\nMain highlights of my game....

I'll do a short explaination of how my attempts went after giving the new update a chance.\n\nLanded on the planet, gather the supplies out of the pod, start searching for food and iron to setup a base. Stumble across the crashed ship mid section, kill a couple of drones. Get an alert about a dropship, 3 dogs and 2 NPCs land, I killed one before having to run away, being chased by drones.\n\nAt this point my current situation is that I have no building materials, no "upgrade points" to even start a legitimate base, no resources (Searched probably about 1/8 of the planet) Still being chased by drones and dropships, almost no ammo left and nowhere safe to hide because I didn't spawn in the ideal location. Repeat x3 before I got too frustrated to continue making futile attempts to play a game that has been broken.\n\nI hope the devs remove or change this tech tree system, I've been trying to understand why they did it and why they gave no warning and their only excuse is "we polled people and this ranked #5 on the list so we did it first" not to mention the poll was for an "experience gain / tech tree / advancement of character" this system included experience gain, but that is it. The "tech tree" as they call it makes no sense, it's a constructor that does the building, why does my characters' experience matter? As I said in my previous review, it is an arbitrary lock-out system designed to make you play the game precisely how the devs want you do with zero deviation, which defeats the purpose of a sandbox game and finally advancement of character is completely absent in this latest tech tree. I am completely confident that when the people voted for this (And remember, it only ranked #5, but was implemented first) they did not intend for it to lock features previously available but rather to unlock easier ways for you to survive, such as faster drilling, or longer jet-packing, requiring less food etc... Not to lock away basic building materials necessary to survive in the game.\n\nSorry for the long review, but overall I was extremely excited about this game but all of that has been sapped away with this ridiculous system, this is hardly a survival or sandbox game anymore, it's a scripted RTS with a construction element tacked on.\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI wanted to warn anyone before purchasing this game so you have a better idea of what you're getting.. Before I purchased this game I looked into how well the devs were keeping up with it and read a lot of positive reviews, which prompted me to purchase the game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for a short period of time.\n\n\nEmpyrion is similar to other survival games such as Minecraft or Space Engineers but with its' own unique twist, being able to fly from planet to planet seemlessly and a great early crafting system that I thought would only get better as the game developed. Very solid survival mechanics, plenty of enemies to keep you entertained and busy with great rewards for attacking NPC bases (Loot, less assaults on your base, etc...) I really love the durability of the small ships on this game, you are able to actually fight the NPCs and take some damage before having to retreat where as in a game like Space Engineers, a few missles are all that is necessary to breach a hull or disable *most* ships, although the cockpit is still vulnerable (as it should be, unless you protect it). So overall, with these mechanics I would have normally recommended this game and probably rated it at least 7/10, with the potential of 10/10.\n\nHowever, the reason I do NOT recommend this game is because of the October 31st patch, which introduced a terrible, game breaking "experience system". This system now limits what you can use your constructor machine to build, including bases, ships, hover vehicles, everything. This means that if you do not reach a specific level, have the necessary materials on hand, and move fast enough, you have to restart. So basically, keep reloading a new game until you have an optimal starting location with plenty of nearby supplies because you won't have time to explore or try to plan where you want to establish a base anymore. This makes no sense to me because you are using a machine to produce those blocks necessary for oxygen, a base starter, etc... So why does it matter what my character endures before I can use a machine to build things? I understand restricting weapons, but I did not understand this part, so I did some reading on the forums and the devs wanted to promote the use of a Hover Vehicle instead of allowing the player to jump straight to a Small Ship and travel to other planets. This is when I immediately regretted purchasing this game, because I lost all faith in the devs at that point. Instead of adding some kind of utility to the Hover Vehicle to make it an option, or making it more stable (It currently crashes into everything while you're driving and frequently sinks in oceans) they force you to struggle through a poorly established XP system so you can earn the "reward" of being able to survive, which was already a challenge but becomes impossible if you do not have an optimal starting location, as I mentioned above.\n\nIt might seem irrational that I do not recommend the game because of the above reasons, but think about it, a dev team that is going to simply restrict your options during gameplay for the sake of forcing you to follow their ideal path in the game ruins the purpose of a sandbox game, and making survival dependant on your starting location ruins the thrill of surviving.

The multitude of problems it has aren’t just because the game is early access - they are fundamental design issues.\n\nStarting the game hurtling towards the planet in an escape pod is a nice touch, even if the controls for guiding it seem a little... uncontrollable but the game then proceeds to fill your inventory with enough resources to last for days, which seems slightly counterintuitive in a survival game. Since the pod then mysteriously vanishes you’re left carrying thousands of tonnes worth of metal around in your backpack whilst the game tells you to go pick plants and such. Naturally that is a priority because whilst the escape pod designers decided that the absolute minimum amount of iron necessary to survive was enough to build a 1:1 scale working replica of the Eiffel Tower they neglected to include more than a handful of rations. I picked some aloe vera, some fiber and some... corn dogs (?) and moved on with the tutorial.\n\nOne of the first things it has you do is build an oxygen generator, so I naturally assumed the planet did not have a breathable atmosphere. Oxygen was a big problem at first and I found myself constantly having to pick up bottles from the generator and wait the achingly long time it takes the constructor to convert a 200 unit O2 tank into single 50 unit bottle whilst pondering what it does with the other 150 units. Then I discovered I could just take my helmet off and breathe perfectly fine without oxygen bottles, throwing into question why building an oxygen generator was the first priority on a planet filled with oxygen and indeed why it needs a water source when it could evidently just suck oxygen out of the air...\n\nThe next issue was one of food or rather - an overabundance of it. Whilst resources like iron and copper stack in hundreds food items don’t seem to stack at all. So half my bag was literally filled with salami. The salami situation became increasingly problematic as every time I needed to craft something I was having to juggle salami back and forth between the constructor and the inventory just to make space. That or eat it.\n\nSo needless to say I passed the ‘Survival Cooking’ part of the tutorial with flying colours. Then it decided the next priority after stuffing myself with sausage was naturally to craft an assault rifle. Forget where I’m going to sleep tonight or what I am going to do with a dozen artisanal sausages - the priority was clearly weaponry. Up until now the local slimes hadn’t been a particular issue and apart from one mildly menacing dinosaur it hardly seemed like my 50 cal pistol was on the weak side.\n\nTo craft an assault rifle however I needed to level up and this meant actively seeking out slimes to shoot or plants to pick and that meant walking about half a mile to find any. By the time I finally got enough experience to build the rifle it was night and I couldn’t see to shoot it anyway. Surely, I thought, the next thing to do must be to build a shelter but no, the tutorial decided to tell me to go collect some ore from the mine which was 400m away across the other side of a lake. If there is a swim button I haven’t found it so this meant either sinking to the bottom of the lake and walking across the floor and out the other side like some kind of swamp monster or saving the O2 and hiking a mile through the woods.\n\nAs I still had 300 ingots of more or less every metal known to man I decided neither option was particularly sensible and enough was enough. After wildly mashing every function key on the keyboard I managed to get the tutorial log to pop up and found I could just skip to the next chapter: Build a Base.\n\nAh, I thought, now the game will finally get interesting. How wrong I was.\n\nIt told me to place a generator, fuel tank and large constructor... conveniently missing out ‘build a generator, fuel tank and large constructor’ - a process which must have taken a good half hour of waiting for things to finish building. The very first thing this game should tell you to do is to construct 200 metal components and a mile of cable because you’re going to spend about ten minutes alone waiting for that to finish with nothing to do. This problem is hampered hugely by the constructor requiring you to manually manufacture every intermediate part for everything you build. You can’t just click ‘build generator’ and go do something fun. You have to build the computers, the control devices, the reactor and to build each of those you have to make the cables, the metal components, the electronics the... god is this actually meant to be a game?\n\nStill I persevered and actually built the base only to find I was entirely unable to activate it. The tutorial says to simply press Y to activate the base but this results in absolutely nothing happening. Even after getting the generator going, the base glowing green (for some reason) and the constructor churning out thousands of bullets without making a dent in my starting resources the base is apparently still not active and the tutorial remains incomplete. So I give up.\n\nI thought the game might suddenly show its hidden potential after building a base but all that happened was that a minigun drone showed up and started shooting me whilst I was AFK (because you cannot pause the game). I’m not sure how long it had been going at it only that my screen was so filled with blood and night time is so dark that I wasn’t sure precisely what was going on - only that eating salami didn’t seem to solve the problem. After actually managing to work out what was attacking me and from where I tried shooting it with my assault rifle but it didn’t seem to work. Then I remembered the game doesn’t automatically reload the guns. I reloaded, killed it instantly and dived into the lake to loot it’s corpse only to find it was loaded with half the required materials to build a base that I’d just wasted half an hour making...\n\nI then decided the best course of action was to stay at the bottom of the lake... and take my helmet off.\n\n\nEDIT: Some ammendments based on the comments.\n\nApparently you can swim but only when empty handed, otherwise you just immediately sink. Clearly 'treading water' wasn't a part of his training.\n\nApparently you can pause the game but only with the Pause Break button. Clearly the developers decided that this was the most sensible place to put that function and that pausing the game whilst editing the settings or with the escape key would be totally insane...\n\nSalami goes in the fridge, not in your pockets. Happy now?\n\nSeems like the sort of things a tutorial might have wanted to point out.","May 13","false","2.3"," 161 of 302 people (53%) found this review helpful 120 people found this review funny","53","161","302","120","31"

There are always things you can do. Empyrion is in EA and shows it, with a few bugs and features missing. However, as far as EA's go, the Empyrion team has done a wonderful job.\nThe biggest compliment is that the dev's listen to the players and build around our wants as well as their vision. Ever since the private release this has been true and has remained so.\nWhile there are a number of features still in the planned phase, the game as it is is quite enough for most players to get a handle on what the game is about and how to survive. Since the inclusion of randomly generated planets, this can only get better!\nSo, TLDR\n\nPro:\nDevs listen and respond to players.\nGame doesn't take a whole lot to play (PC wise)\nEA title that hasn't abandoned it's goals\nYou can build multiple different vehicles and bases\nCan be a challenging game, but also lets you use your creative side.\n\nCons:\nStill in EA.

The ride on the drop pod on the way down every time you start a new game is really neat. The sheer amount of exploration and crafting ING this game is intense, however crafting is made super easy. Just stay away from drives until you have a rifle and maybe try building a base like I did. I built a twisting tunnel network, leading to a large cavern housing my base structure. Use plenty of auto turrets and a manual turret in the right place. Drives can't even find your base this way.

Having played a lot of EA titles I have become very wary when it comes to purchasing them, I went out on a limb and bought Empryion, it was the correct choice.\n\nThe first thing that greets you as you enter your lovely fresh planet is the planet itself hurtling at you as you zoom down in your escape pod, manically trying to land somewhere nice to start building, if you're lucky you will even spot some resources on your flight down.\n\nOnce you land you are free to do whatever you want, firstly you will want to grab your backup supplies from your escape pod, you will have EVERYTHING you need here to work through the tutorial which holds your hand quite nicely through everything you will need to know, ranging from:\n\n- Crafting\n- Building your first base\n- Kitting it out with essentials\n- Teaches you multiple ways to get food\n- Building your first ship / hovercraft / capital vessel\n\nIf you follow the tutorial you really cannot go wrong, I am seeing some daft posts about placing o2 generators on land etc. well read the tutorial, clearly states it has to be placed in water, not fully submerged but on the edge is generally fine.\n\nThe base building and ship building in the game is partly my favourite aspect, I have been using workshop content as honestly I am not always the most creative, by god there are some nice ships out there. You have a vast amount of styles of blocks to work with to make your ships / bases look beautiful, lots of interior items if you want to go for the nice cosmetic / at home feel.\n\nLeaving the planet for the first time has to be one of the most exciting things, you finally are free, power up that warp drive and head for the stars.\n\nSo far I have jumped lightyears away and found a hostile research facility, parked up my capital vessel and investigated with my smaller attack ship. I took out the research defences, docked up and hunted down the core of the structure, after swiftly demolishing the core I returned to my capital vessel, crafted my own and zoomed back, powered that baby online and got to work repairing and extending the landing bay to fit my CV on.\n\nAnother part I love ^ see a nice alien base? Take that ♥♥♥♥ over, destroy the core, place yours and you have a new home, just make sure you don't go in rockets flying as if you plan on taking it over, you'll have a lot to repair!\n\nTl:dr\n\n1. Solid game considering it's just entered alpha\n\n2. Very friendly community on the official forums (Lets be honest, steam discussions are horrible everywhere)\n\n3. Tutorial will answer any questions you have, if you think you need a little bit more helps just join a server instead of going in single player - You will have more fun and be helped out a lot should you need it / ask.

Customise everything\n\n7. Workshop content galore + easy to upload your own stuff\n\n8. Hard working devs for such a small team\n\n9. Exciting PVP\n\n10.

The race is on to build a shelter that can protect you from the hostile inhabitants of this rather moist desert planet until you are prepared to go from hunted to hunter.

It has all the classic features of a good survival game with a few twists like oxygen and with the add on of a game like StarMade or Space Engineers it gets even better. Multiplayer work flawlessly as long as you either port forward your IP or use a VPN like Hamachi or Tunngle. It is suspiring how stable this game is for only being on EA for a day.

If you are willing to put in the time, it's a very rewarding experience.\n\nFingers crossed that this continues to get more polished as time goes on.

I have only played solo so far.  In short...is it worth the $10 it is now?  YES...is it worth the full price if you miss the sale?....Hell YES!\n\nTry this game if you like sci fi, survival, exploring, sandbox games or doing things the way you want.\n\nAre there bugs?  Of course there bloody are!  It's an alpha game.  I have not run into any game breaking bugs yet, all small or annoying things but nothing that would stop me playing.\n\nI've played a lot of survival games in various stages of early access and release on Steam and this is so far my favorite.\n\nSo the obligitory pro/con list:\n\nPro:\n\n-No zombies.  Animals, dinosaures (I think maybe the triceratops should go, it's an alien planet), and alien natives.\n\n-Factions (not sure how this works or if it is fully available yet), seems you can set up your own factions as well.\n\n-Detailed and extensive craft system.\n\n-Good selection of starting items and food/meds to get you through you first couple of days.\n\n-Good tutorial.  YES it is a good tutorial...just read the dirrections in your PDA like it says.  Push F1, read, do, done.  The people complaining about the tutorial are not using the PDA or following instructions.\n\n-Player leveling and  a tech tree to unlock new gear, you choose the order.\n\n-Blueprints.  I have looked at the stock ones, but I belive you can make your own.  Want a nice house but not a build master?  No Problem, get a blueprint, add all the mats and off you go.\n\n-It's $10 bucks on sale!  More than worth it.\n\nCon\n\n(Early Alpha - much of this will be fixed)\n\n-Complex crafting system which I like!  But some people (the impatient ones) may find it annoying to have to build all the parts before building the item you want.  And your parts take parts too....so it can be slow at first.  Sometimes you are waiting around for stuff to just get made so you can move on.  (If the devs are reading, I hope there is or will be a craft station up the tech tree that can speed this up somewhat)\n\n-Inability to move things once placed.  You need to destroy them back into their componenets.  This will probably be addressed as alpha moves on.\n\n-Building is a bit hmm...awkward to me.  Again something I think will be addressed.  It is sometimes hard to get your blocks to snap into place...and the are large and it can be hard to see where you are putting them.  Along with the above issue it can be a little tricky to get the hang of.\n\nReally I'm struggling to find cons.  I could list more but it's just stuff that will improve as the game is fleshed out.  Give this a try.  I don't think you will regret it.  It costs about $15 to go to a movie....$50 if you buy a snack...and that's 2 hours tops of entertainment....Even at full price you will get far more out of this game than a movie...and virtual snacks...made out of seaweed...\n","May 15","true","8.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

We've been getting quite a few sandbox games lately. I even wrote an article just pointing out whether or not they can be fun here[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]. So what is it that makes Empyrion different than the other dozen or so sandbox games that came out recently? I'd have to say the scope of the world. Much like the much anticipated title 'No Man's Sky' the projected scope here with Empyrion is cause for concern and excitement.\n\nEleon Game Studios is trying to do something on a scale that makes me concerned for the future of the title. Currently, Empyrion sits as a great base for a sandbox game. A deep crafting system, mining system, combat system, and survival system. It's all in place. Now it comes down to moving forward into what the game promises to be.\n\nMuch like the aforementioned No Man's Sky, Empyrion promises to make a sandbox game that has many procedurally generated planets to explore and you can travel between them and build bases across the universe. Ambitious right? Even more ambitious is that they plan to bring this all to dedicated online multiplayer servers. Something No Man's Sky has decided to instead make into a single player experience and push all that data to a server for exploration purposes. So is this the multiplayer version of No Man's Sky? Potentially.\n\nEmpyrion so far is promising, with the crafting systems in place to create vehicles, spacecrafts, food, cosmetics. Actually it's one of the deeper sandboxes i've played in early access. I'm having a lot of fun. However, I fear the day it goes online. Poor communities and hackers tend to ruin sandbox games for me.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dz4MNLXJUG8\n\nMost the problems I've had so far aren't really game problems just poor explanation problems. Lacking a coherent tutorial and poor item descriptions makes watching a video tutorial or reading the forums a necessity. This is why my review video ended up being more of a tutorial video. I usually do my reviews live and record what the first 30-60 minutes are like to give you an idea of what to expect. However, I decided to give the game the benefit of being a sandbox game and played a bit more before recording the video. Most games have fairly simple mechanics so an honest first look usually is enough to get an idea. Sandbox games don't really fit that bill.\n\nEmpyrion is a promising deep sandbox title, it already has systems in place for a universe wide galactic space odyssey. Let's just hope Eleon didn't bite off more than they can chew.\n\nFor more Reviews, Videos and the Bi-weekly Indie Game Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nEarly Access YouTube","August 9, 2015","true","18.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","4"

No problem!\n\nUpdates are nice, community still small but helpfull. Really think that this game is capable of killing Minecraft PERIOD!\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeveral bugs have occured while playing. Probably due to limitations within the game. I Spawned near the base-planet while my mate was traveling true the atmosphere. I choosed to spawn at base. Probably because of my mate flying in the "in-between" layer of space and planet, after I logging in his ship crashed.

Look at your PDA for F*cks sake. F1, that's how you enter it. Does no one actually look at computer controls anymore to tell what the keybindings are? I mean seriously.

That being said after several months I got a craving for something different then the floods of same old ♥♥♥♥ different artist. I came accross this because of the sale, 10 USD is pretty damn cheap so I looked at recent gameplay and did  small amount of research on the recent development. I was pretty damn impressed and the reviews were damn good so I took a shot in the dark. I am hella happy I did, the game has fixed a lot of the gameplay issues that were making me cringe before, and I think I am starting to see this games vision. That being said here is my first impressions.\n\nI REALLY needed something to quench my thirst for star citizen, I have Elite Dangerous, which fixes my space flight needs for HOTAS Track ir 5, but, there is no EVA or fps in it as of the moment, this game takes my favorite genre (survival) and although light on the survival potion it produces greatly on crafting and cool game mechanics. Obviously the game is in alpha and some things leave a bit of desire, such as a better flight model, I love to fly in games, I don't really know what this engine is capable of, but they should add in decoupled flight for us dogfighters and proper hotas support, nothing crazy but the basics like being able to use a throttle for adjusting speed and pressure sensitivty for the stick. I see great potential in this game and I hope the developers still have love for this game. As a matter of fact, it gives me reason to keep playing even when star citizen is completed, because this allows me to build and use my imagination, I don't expect the mechanics to reach the scale of other titles but I am actually impressed by the fact that we can all move around with gravity when the ship is moving. I think this game would be one of my favorite titles if they added track ir support and hotas, I can also find find a script with freepie but I bet they would sell more copies to a wider audience if the devs the support in themselves. I rate this a 7/10 as far as indi games go, remember this is a first impressions, I will write another review in the future to give a long term impression.","May 16","true","145.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

From what I have watched (hours of it) and played, this game is absolutely worth your time and money. The crafting is detailed without being burdensome, base-building is fun without being too complex, vehicle-building is a trip, and combat is decent enough. The game is only in Alpha/Early Access, so I fully expect all of these things to become more and more polished as time goes on, but already everything works well.\n\nThe only REAL negatives I have encountered thus far is the flora/monster spawning. Like, it just fades in in front of you, but I think that's an EA thing. I doubt they'll keep it like that.\n\nThus far I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs or any crashes. And while people compare it to Space Engineers, Empyrion is WAY more fleshed out and exciting. So yea, despite being an Early Access game, it's worth the loot already.\n\nAbout time we got a good survival/crafting sci-fi game...","August 5, 2015","true","17.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Space combat mixed with the option to explore new worlds however, one thing was always missing however, the ability to build and create your own vehicles and indeed, buildings. Empyrion Galactic Survival covers exactly this issue and then some.\n\nIn Survival mode, you start from a small crashed escape pod, barely equipped with the bare essentials to get you started and yet, start you must.\n\nYou have enough resources to create your first base, albeit small to start with, soon, you will require additional materials. Thankfully, all the planets in the system have just the items you need but, be warned, not all the materials are easy to obtain.\n\nDuring your first daylight foray into Empyrion, you will face native wildlife, both docile and hostile alike so, be prepared.\n\nAs night approaches and the stars literally come out you may find yourself peering upwards. Well, that will be your next step. Building a Small Vessel capable of extra-planetary travel but, for now, your base needs building.... Live above ground, if you prefer or, tunnel beneath the surface and become a subterranean dweller. Choose whatever suits your needs. Plasma cannons through to Gatling guns, your arsenal will determine your fate. You will also need to consider growing your own food instead of relying on the wildlife. Power, Oxygen are also primary concerns, which should you prioritise?\n\nEmpyrion features some truly stunning vistas. From atop the mountains, soak in the view of Omicron [Desert planet] through to the foreboding Aestus [Lava world]. Each world containing its own risks and rewards but, eventually, you will need to visit them all.\n\nAlthough only in Pre-Alpha 2 [at the time of writing this article] Empyrion has already established a dedicated fan-base. With numerous features yet to come, Empyrion promises longevity rarely seen in games these days and, with multiplayer support, co-operative has a whole new meaning. On some planets, resources are scarce and must be divided among your team-mates if you are all to survive. Alternatively, you may want to become overlord of the planet and destroy any that stand in your way. The choice is yours.\n\nUpdates to Empyrion are VERY frequent. With player input and suggestions read on a regular basis. Empyrion has a [currently] unofficial forum that is closely monitored by the Development team and the list of suggestions that have found their way into the game is truly inspiring. This is not to mention the WIKI that is constantly in development.\nEmpyrion is definitely a game to grab now. With many other games offering early access, it is safe to say there may be issues along the way but, with your help and support, maybe YOU can help shape the future of this truly stunning game.\n","August 5, 2015","true","646.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But good ideas.\nAlso WATCH THE TUTORIALS. Cant stress that enough. Even though some to the things have changed but you will get the basics.\n\n- Can we settle down the bouncing when walking and running. Im not sure about most people but i dont head bang when i walk and run.\n- Maybe add some basic in game direction at the start. Maybe a voice in your head that says, "well any landing you can walk away from is a good landing, but i broke my ship. I better think about oxygen, food, water, and shelter."\n- Cleaning up the building interface would be nice as well.\n- Change the cross hairs, change color or style, or both.\n- Adding a solor panal of some kind would also be nice.\n- Keep recycle of materials at 100%.\n- Allow a creat your own universe options where you can salect the rules for many sort of things. Recycle %, respawn spead of plants and animals.\n- Add in a travaling merchant in space of some kind with a money system.\n-Add a creat your own Space Survivor. Even a basic color option would be nice.\n\nThis game has some real potential and i could see myself spending alot of time on it. I'll have to give it a try in a few weeks and see if it is a smoother play.\nNot worth the 16.19 Sale price, should be around 5 for now. Maybe check out Elite Dangerous. But i spent the money now, i just hope the dont make me regret my buy.\n\nAlso food for thought\nAt the start of the game we should be able to choose- Single Player, Multi-player, and Custom.\n\nSingle Player - Have choises of difficulty Hard, Medium, Easy, Creative modes. This should change the bad guy health and respawn rates.\n\nMulti-Player - Have the same choises plus have a Invite Only, Open, or Teams option\n\nCustom - Hard, Medium, Easy. Single or Multi Player. Invite, Open or Teams.\nAlso allow tweaks like -\nOxygen Use - 200%, 100% (normal), 50%, 25%\nPlant Grow and Respawn rate - 200%, 100% (normal), 50%, 25%\nEnemy Respawn rate - 200%, 100% (normal), 50%, 25%\nOre Respawn - Yes, No - Rate - 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min\nGalactic Trading Ship - Yes, No - Rate - 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min\nOr add a Trading Station Spawn in space\nStarting Credits - 10, 100, 1000, 10000\nGravity on all Planets - 200%, 100% (normal), 90%, 80%, and so on.\nRecycle Rate - 100% (normal), 90%, 80%, and so on.\n\nMaybe add a tweak for more or less of each types of planets.\n\n\nThis way you can make a univers as hard or as easy as you want. super easy to learn on an experiment or really hard for you and a group of friends.","August 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So when I was a kid (80s and early 90s), LEGO was just coming out with their BEST space sets.  Space ships, bases, factions, the works.  The kind of thing the LEGO behemoth rarely does now.  But those sets told the best stories-- exploration, factions, resources, fighting, creative design to overcome challenges.\n\nSince minecraft, I've been looking for a game that scratched all of those itches, including "I should put out some more sensors on the south ridge if I want to know if I've got company."  Maybe I was the only kid whose LEGO landscape looked like a Tribes game, but I doubt it.\n\nThis game?  It hits that spot.  I've only played solo, but I imagine multiplayer this must be BONKERS.  For the solo experience?  This is awesome.  For a PRE-ALPHA?  God, buy this game so they can follow through.  This is amazing for where it is, and I'm looking forward to where it goes.\n\nNotes:\n\n-It's been compared to (and accused of being derivative of) Space Engineers.  I gave up on Space Engineers due to complexity of the UI.  This game does everything a LEGO builder wanted to do there, but is lighter on the micromanagement.  As for derivative?  I didn't start landing on a planet in Space Engineers.  This feels more akin to Space Engineers by way of Starmade.\n\n-It's nowhere near there yet.  It's a great start, but Starmade worlds are tremendous.  Empyrion is promising galaxies.  If they deliver?  This product will be great.  If they don't, it's still a great star system simulator.\n\n-As they develop, I hope there will be a mechanic for us solo (or LAN) explorers to see an AI challenge of a 'faction' type.  They do that, this will be an FPS and Artemis at the same time.  And then Empyrion will win. Forever.\n\n-Again, it's not there yet.  But the balance of survival needs, item creation, the very nice tech/level tree dynamic (your first spaceship?  Not the Enterprise) are all off to very promising starts. Excited to see where this goes.","February 6","true","122.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

I've been so hooked to these survival games and have tried all of them.\nThe first game I played was Subnautica. Loved it. You want to explore, not just for resources, but to see the great mysteries in the deep sea.\nThen I played this.\nI absolutely loved feeling like I am being rewarded for everything I do. First you are stuck on a planet where your escape pod crashes. You have to hunt and defend yourself to survive and eventually build a shelter.\nThen you slowly gain enough resources to help you get around the large world with a hover ship.\nThen you finally build a ship that takes you off the planet and into outer space where you can explore other planets for other resources.\nThen you build a capital ship that allows you to discover other systems!\nThe feeling is so rewarding and makes you feel awestruck when you leave your ship in outer space to spacewalk and do repairs and get dizzy from not knowing what is up or down.\nThis game deserves plenty of praise!\nI haven't yet played multi player because I believe the single player needs to be good for multi player to be any good, and it is very good.\nThere are bugs of course which is expected in the release. When you board your ship, make sure you are on level ground. Because when you get out, you may fall through the ground and into endless sky. This will be fixed of course, but it sucked losing two ships because of it.\nThis is far better than many of the survival games out there. You don't feel as proud as do in many games as you do in this. Accomplishing something has never felt this good.\nThen I went on to try other survival games like Ark, and they do not compare to the sense of accomplishment as this game.\nThere are already so many things you can craft and build, but it seems they stopped. I worked hard at making the final crafting machine, only to find it just builds things a little faster. But these will improve in time, and hopefully more cool ideas for things to craft will arrive.

No regrets whatsoever about having this game, or about having bought several copies for friends. Came in expecting little, and was amazed, frankly, by the depth of gameplay involved in this multiplayer survival title. Survive your first night, expand across one planet, fighting hostile flora and fauna, plus an omnipresent alien force. Mine minerals, collect plants, set up farms for food, manage your oxygen supply, and build Bases, Hover Vessels, Small Vessels, and Capital Vessels. I run a private server for a small group of friends and the PvE is compelling enough that we've built a small fleet and spread amongst the planets in the system. The gunplay is solid: not outstanding, but solid.\n\nThere are the sort of negatives you'd expect from an early access title. There are numerous glitches, like textures tearing and sucking you through the world, landing gear not allowing you to dock correctly, and players sometimes despawning and then being trapped in a cockpit until a server reset. And, while I understand that this title is early in development, I'd like to see the loading screen transition between planets and space vanish. It would be excellent to have a seemless transition between space and the ground a la Space Engineers, though that is something of a monumental task to accomplish.\n\nI would recommend this game if you're a fan of the survival genre and games like 7D2D, Minecraft, etc. This game may not wow you if your'e not a fan, but it damn impressed me.","January 24","true","323.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I didn't think much of it when I first saw it, "another minecraft in space".  But it has its charms, and it's grown alot since I first started playing it.  After I got an idea about what direction the game was going, I was impressed enough to buy into it early on.  I would say I've already gotten value for my investment out of it since I enjoy space games that let me build my own ship and explore the galaxy with it, and while you can't quite explore the galaxy in Empyrion yet, you can explore an interesting star system.  The galaxy is coming.\n\nI only wish the planets were bigger.  They aren't tiny though.  They feel more like planets than Starmade's planets and the game has some very nice graphics for an alpha.  I would compare this game more to Space Engineers than Starmade, though unlike in Space Engineers, enemies don't always try to ram you and the game doesn't crash constantly.  In fact, I haven't had a single crash in my current world.  Surprisingly stable for an alpha.  The documentation is a bit on the lacking side, but that's to be expected - it's still an alpha, and there is a wiki that can provide most of the info you'll need (Empyrion Wiki). There is a tutorial quest of sorts, but it could use some refinement.  Again, nothing out of the ordinary for an alpha.  The fact that there's a tutorial at all in an alpha is worthy of praise, at least these days.\n\nOne thing I think that sets Empyrion apart from its peers is that there is more of a focus on exploration and combat than in other games.  There is a decent variety of weapons and the gunplay feels a bit more solid than in Starmade or Space Engineers.  There are also things to find when you explore - alien bases mainly.  There's a number of different types of alien bases, and they are protected by robotic drones as well as humanoid aliens called Croghom.  The Croghom AI has some trouble with pathfinding and usually they just walk straight toward you and can't shoot you unless you are on the same vertical level as they are, but again, it's an alpha so I expect that to improve.  The bases usually have quite a few of these guys guarding them and they have spawners which you have to find and destroy to prevent them from spawning (this is important since if you ignore the spawners you can easily get flanked and killed quickly while exploring a base).  Alternatively, if you have a vehicle, you can just bombard the base and destroy it all, but you risk destroying the valuable cargo crates and loot inside the base.  The flying drones have better AI and have a habit of sneaking up on you and shooting your vehicle to bits while you're mining or landed somewhere, if you're not paying attention.  In any case, exploration is more fun than in other space survival games in my opinion since there's some challenge to the various bases and things you can find and often valuable loot inside.\n\nCurrently, the game only has one system to explore, although there are a bunch of planets and space objects to find there.  The dev has said procedurally generated systems and an explorable galaxy will be added later.\n\nThe game revolves around exploration and building, which is what you'd expect from a game in this genre.  There's a decent amount of stuff to build, and it's always fun making spaceships.  Since exploration is actually somewhat rewarding, the building doesn't feel shallow.  You're not building a big spaceship for the sake of building a big spaceship.  You're building it because you can use it to find interesting things and have adventures.  I hope the game continues to evolve on this concept.  And if you don't like building, you can just download blueprints from the Steam Workshop, load the blueprint into your personal factory and then spawn them in once you collect enough resources.  I like this feature quite a lot.  It makes it a bit less frustrating if your ship gets blown up.  You can just load the blueprint and rebuild it - although I do wish there was a better way to see damage on vehicles so that it's easier to repair them.  I think that's supposed to be coming as an update to the recently-added structural integrity feature.  You can see damage levels on some equipment in the vehicle control window, at least.  It just won't show armor damage.\n\nIn any case, of all the space survival games I've played so far (Empyrion, Starmade, Space Engineers, Starforge) Empyrion is the one I think has the most potential.  It's in close competition with Space Engineers, but unfortunately I've had too many problems with Space Engineers so I have to go with Empyrion instead.  That said, Empyrion isn't quite as far along as Space Engineers, but I think it will make up the difference in the future, and has been more interesting for me to play so far.  I only wish the planets were as big as the ones in Space Engineers.  I've heard there are plans to make the planets bigger.  I suppose we will see.","May 14","true","90.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's clearly not a finished game, and will need a lot more content and care for me to want to play it long-term, but it definitely was a fun experience for those couple of days.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just another crappy sci-fi survival type game that didn't have any depth or creativity to it. Fortunately, I was wrong, as this game lets you build tiny ships mounted with 14 gatling guns, 8 rocket launchers, and a massive railgun all attached to the front of them if you so choose.\n\nSeriously though, it's pretty cool. If you get the chance to play it for free, definitely try it, or even just buy it if you're really really into the genre.

Which makes it hard to leave a negative review.\n\nIn most ways it's not a bad game and I did have fun playing for awhile. But the newest update  was a turn off for me. They added an xp leveling system and tech tree, most may say thats cool  whats the problem. The problem is no place on the steam store page community disscussion page  or empyrions website did it ever say they where going to add an xp leveling system and tech  tree. I am sorry but for a pre-alpha game to not list that as a major feature that will be  added to the game at some point was a huge fail. Either you want that feature in a game or you  dont that is a huge make or break for a lot of people when deciding to buy or not.\n\nNow before the tech tree I think they where going in the right direction. You start on a planet  and lots of stuff is craftable their is nothing to hold you back in surviving and you could  write your own story so to speak. If you wanted to get to the higher teir tech suff like better  equipment and better guns and what not you had to build up and craft a ship to get you off the  planet to go explore other planets and moons to find rare resources to mkae the higher tech  stuff. Which was great and made sense. Now not so much you have to gain xp to open up things in  a tech tree that you have to spend points on so you can build and make stuff. Pick a bunch of  flowers to gain enough xp to level up then you can pick what you want in the level class to be able to build. Or  shoot a bunch of creatures to get enough xp to again unlock things like thrusters and cockpits  and food proccessors. Sorry I dont want a system telling me what I can and cant build in an  open world sandbox survival game.\n\nThe real problem comes down to that many have a problem with this system in the game to.Some  people are for it and some are against it to be expected. Now I thought early access games was  so us the consumer can buy into the game and test it and leave feedback and report bugs which  should help sculpt the dircetion of the game. I have posted and read a bunch of ideas on the  posts about ways to change this feature or make it work for everyone. One of the best is to  make it an option you enable or disable either you start the game having to level up or you  dont. The devs basicly said it is to hard to do that and it is already in the game and is  staying in the game. Basicly a take it or leave attitude. Now the really funny thing is someone  posted you can use hex or a program like it to go in and make one change to one character and  disable the leveling system. Yet the devs said it is to hard to make it an option.\n\nA sandbox game should have lots of options so we the players can taylor a game to the way we  want to play it. Thats what a sandbox game is all about to me using my own imaganation to  create my own story to emers myself into my own world. This game really has no snadbox options  and by the way the devs talk I doubt their will be options for people to create the type of  game they want to play. No you are forced to play the game the way the devs want you to play  it. Which as it stands is either survival mode or creative mode. With no options to fine tune those modes to the way you want it to be. Having just those two options  does not make for much of a sandbox game or atleast not one I really want to play atleast.","November 10, 2015","false","208.5"," 131 of 249 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","131","249","4","65"

While Empyrion really lacks the technical depth and complexity, it compensates that with some great planetary mechanics; something almost like a story; a little bit of mystery; aggressive aliens; and great optimization.\n\nSurprisingly, when I played the game today, I noticed that graphics was downgraded significantly. The water shader is especially ugly now, making water look like wobbly jelly up close and like a perfect mirror in the distance. Such a downgrade makes me worry about game's future. The textures on Aqua look like they are too pixelated, but I am not sure what causes such effect.\n\nAlso I don't like another new feature - experience based tech unlocks. You have to basically shoot wildlife to unlock new building blocks. It does not seem logical nor it is fun to play this way. Maybe it makes endgame more fun by making you shoot your enemies to unlock powerful blocks, I'm not sure, couldn't get past that ugly water shader :)\n\nAt this point the game really makes an impression as if it is being developed by a single developer, and, maybe, some modeling or texturing gets outsources to cheap third-parties. That's fine, but I really hope that the development process will evolve in future.\n\nI have a few simple suggestions:\n- Concentrate on the game design of the early game stages (crafting of basic blocks and resource collection).\n- Weapons and weapon animations really need to be finished/improved ASAP. The game forces the player to use weapons to survive, so using the weapons must be enjoyable.\n- I don't care about loading delay on atmospheric entry, that's fine, it does not break the game. Loading that data asynchronously and doing crossfade transition would make everyone happy.\n- Add more depth to crafting through more realistic mechanics.  Maybe some blocks could interact with each other to create new functional effects. Maybe resources could vary in "quality" or "purity". Or maybe detecting resources could require orbital survey. In my opinion, any of these ideas is much better than XP-based tech unlocks. Don't limit your game to what other games already have.\n- Add more depth to aliens and wildlife. Inter-species conflicts. Races of aliens. Communication and diplomacy. Trading.\n- Expand the mysterious component of the game. Alien artifacts, hidden stashes of ammo, crashed ships on the ocean floor.\n- Make the jetpack less useless in the atmosphere please. Currently it feels more like Super Mario longjump than like jetpack.\n- Enemy attack waves and base defense blocks (turrets, mounted machine guns, laser perimeter fence, mine fields) would make building your base so much more interesting!\n\n","January 16","true","23.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

At it's core, Empyrion is a sci fi space exploration and survival game, what this means is that it is several games put into one. While most games that attempt something this ambitious don't usually make it through development, Empyrion's approach is to do things simply and let them contribute to the greater whole. To better understand why this works, I will explain each part of Empyrion and then explain how these parts come together to make a greater whole.\n\nThe Survival Game: This starts off in much the same way that most survival games do, you crash land on an alien planet with some basic tools and must address the basic needs of your survival. This involves scavenging for food and mining/collecting resources, if you start on Omicron it also involves managing your oxygen supply, if you start on Akua this is addressed by removing your helmet and simply breathing deeply, Akua has a breathable atmosphere but many planets do not. While most survival games tend to give you the most basic tools by which to accomplish your survival, Empyrion gives you many advanced forms of technology to start out with. This is a shame I think because there could be a whole rudimentary tier of stone axes, bows and arrows to get through before moving on to automatic drills and firearms that would extend this portion of the game, but that is a minor point. Over time you will build a base, stock it with provisions and advance your technology level until you're able to manufacture most weapons and building components, after defending your base from a few drone incursions, you may set out to address the hostile forces on the planet.\n\nThe Action/Exploration Game: Scattered about the planet are a number of installations manned by hostile alien forces and automated defenses, eventually you will seek them out and attempt to raid these installations of their valuable supplies and tech. I will say that while this whole aspect is pretty rough compared to actual shooters (it's no Doom) the gameplay does require caution and a tactical approach. Aliens tend to be pretty accurate with their weapons, so if you try to just stand there and shoot at them you'll probably lose. Ideally you approach them from their flank or take some shots and then heal yourself with a medpack between kills. If you die, it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve your backpack and items, so only bring the essentials and have plenty of backup weapons/medkits in reserve where you can easily access them if you die. Most of the time building a small vessel or hover vessel with the appropriate armaments can help deal with the heavy automated turrets guarding the outside, but usually you'll have to hoof it through underground corridors if you want to secure the delicious loot at the bottom.\n\nThe Space Game: Around the time you finish ransacking every base on the planet you should be the master of your domain, all alien critters who were such a threat in the beginning are little more than cannon fodder now, it's time to shed your earthly bonds, make a small vessel and travel to space. The resources that you're able to mine from the planet don't include some of the more advanced materials to make large spacecraft and heavier weapons. You may salvage a few from the Alien bases, but you're going to need a larger supply. Leaving the planet's atmosphere you'll find a ring of asteroids which contain a material not found on the planet, a nearby moon will contain other such resources. These areas of course present their own dangers for you to overcome, but eventually you'll have what you need to begin construction of a capital vessel, and everything else you need for interstellar travel. This of course brings us to the building game.\n\nThe Building Game: Base building is pretty simple, you can create a rudimentary wooden shack or a full scale armored installation. You can even invade an enemy base, destroy their core, and then place your own core inside and make the base your own. If you don't like to build, you can always download other people's creations from the workshop and construct it in the blueprint "factory" by simply adding raw materials and waiting. At first the construction system may seem a little daunting, over time as you build it becomes more intuitive and you begin to appreciate the new approach they've taken to construction which has veered sharply from the more common Space Engineers approach. At this point I think it's important to differentiate these two games, both of which I deeply enjoy, Space Engineers is a lot more technical in it's building approach, opting for realism and demonstrating a design based on physics. Empyrion is a lot more Sci-Fi, almost completely fore-gos realism for ease of use. You don't need to build a full conveyer system in Empyrion to deliver fuel to your reactor or ammunition to your weapons the way you do in Space Engineers, all you need are the basic components like power, fuel and cockpit, add some guns/turrets, throw in a warp drive and you're good to go. This allows you to make ships with aesthetics in mind over function and as you grasp the basics of the building tools, you'll be able to recreate most of your favorite sci-fi ships for use in your game.\n\nThe Multiplayer End Game: Ultimately a game like this shines the brightest when other players provide the content the AI simply cannot. Here the potential is greatest, you could have factions in a solar system warring over resources with huge fleets of player controlled ships, everything from fighters to capital dreadnaughts. These battles could be decided through the skill of the players or the efficiency of their starship design. Once the fleet has fallen, could the enemy bases then be stormed by soldiers on foot armed with a variety of powerful weapons, would that fight ever truly end? What surprises would lay in store for you in a base completely designed to thwart you by another human being? Once you take their core and plant your own, and the base falls to your faction swiftly followed by the planet, and your fleet hums in orbit, ships designed and built by your own hand, through your own sweat and labor, could you honestly say that any other moment of triumph in any other game could possibly compare? Even Doom?","May 13","true","140.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I really suggest you get both, as they both have much to offer in terms of gameplay.\n\nAs for this game: It’s in early access so there are a few bugs/optimization issues, but from what I see in terms of update history, not only will those bugs be fixed, but there probably will be double the content there is now 3-4 months from now. 2.2 hours in and I haven't experienced a crash either.\n\nI'll update this review when I get further into the game.\n\nA little about the game:  2 modes, creative and survival.  Survival currently only places you in a fixed spawn location in a fixed 3 planet 1 moon solar system.  (Will be a randomly generated universe eventually)  That being said, you have to manage your oxygen and food while scavenging for resources to build whatever.\n\nEarly game, I had to forage for a lot of my food, only to eventually get enough resources to build weapons/ammo to start hunting, and finally grow my food in a greenhouse.  There is a lot of promise in the survival mode of this game, especially if this is one of the more hospitable planets there is.\n\nTL;DNR:\nIf you like Space Engineers, you will like this game.  I'm definitely looking forward to future updates.\n","August 6, 2015","true","29.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

As a survival game is actually pretty good.\nThe building and going to space part is not... when you leave the planet theres an obvious change when you pass the atmosphere, and when youre in space things feel small, the planet, asteroids, moons, all look too close and too small, wich is ridiculous... i mean, im going to space to feel small myself lol\nAnyways, i actually had a bit of fun with it, but went back to space engineers after a while becouse i was looking more for the space experience than the survival experience, still its a good game and in a very early stage so it can get a lot better.","May 4","true","4.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Still, I have not played a game that allows you to go from on foot, to the atmostphere, outerspace, and then back down to the surface of another planet, and set up a new base there yet. Impressive. Combat both on foot and in vehicle is acceptable, and mostly bug free. Graphics could definitely use an overhual at some point, but the engine appears to be DX11 capable, leaving a lot of room for future improvement. Enemy AI needs work too, but again, in pre-alphs state, is very playable, and enemies still provide an irritating challenge, if anything else.

That is the day I got this game. There have been many ups and downs through all the updates. The developers have done so so much for this game, I havent played a game where devlopers had this much dedication in a very long time. The work they do is exeptional. The updates are frequent. The game always will have something to offer. It gets hard at times, things can be unbalanced. But hey, this is only Alpha. I started in Pre-Alpha, and even then the game was spectacular.  I have bought this game for friends, and we have had tons of fun. I have played single player offline on steam, and played with friends when there was the trump wall on the planet. I played when all your friends had to go into space with you. The game has come so far. It will continue to grow, I love this game. Games are meant to be played forever, this game will let you do that.

I just started playing the game a few weeks ago when it was on free weekend. I was already so impressed by the end of the weekend that i went ahead a purchased the game. Since then, I have played mostly the survival  version of the game. I had a bit of a hard time at first learning how the game works but soon was off and playing. Just this morning i logged in to play and there was a patch. Wow what a great patch! The devs are listening to suggestions from players incorporating them into the game. Stackable perishable foods and better factory automation for creating items with multiple parts by only having to click the final item you want to make and it will craft the lower tier items needed automatically if the correct materials are in the factory.

I didn't expect much as the week previously I'd bought Space Engineers and I had huge trouble with that game, I just couldn't get into it and pretty much expected the same from this.\n\nI was wrong!  From the off, Empyrion was totally different, mainly it was fun to play, yes it might not have the best graphics and it might have small issues but the fun value heavily outweighs the problems.\n\nCollecting resources is fine as it usually is in survival games but mining in this is really fun as the landscape deforms as you drill down into the ground in search of precious ore.  Base building is fun and pretty easy to do, I started off with a tiny base but within a couple of days it was like 5x larger with multiple levels, a lift and its own garden growing fruit to keep me fed.\n\nOnce you 'activate' your base it comes under attack from drones after a few hours, these are pretty easy to destroy (base gun or your own guns) and you can collect some nice items from them, there are also random things scattered around the planet you start on, crashed ships to explore and uhm.. rob ;)   alien bases, fortresses full of loot and other stuff.   Making your own vehicles is also great fun, a couple of hours after buying the game I'd build a tiny hovercraft and used it to explore the planet,  later on I built my own spaceship and left the planet, I have to say that being stood on an asteroid in space admiring the view as you drill into it for ores is just amazing fun.\n\nThere is so much to do in the game and in the time I've had it, we've had several large updates fixing probems and adding tons of cool stuff.\n\nMy last ship was a huge one with a hyperdrive fitted..   finally I left the system I started in and jumped to a new system..  landed on this awesome desert planet and died within seconds..  (it was an airless world and I'd forgotten to stock oxygen bottles as the starter planet has oxygen. lol)\n\nOverall I give this gam a huge thumbs up and recommend it to people who like space games, minecraft clones or sandbox games.   its really good!\n","May 19","true","51.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I couldnt look on the wiki as it  wouldnt load so I found it hard to get the info I needed.

When we got there, we raided alien installations we found containers of rare alien loot. Unfortunately the loot is stuff we can already craft so that was a huge let down.\n\nBut in the future, I would hope it be more exotic items or rare crafting materials to make adventure worth while!\n\nLooking forward to the development of this game and what they have in store for it.

This game has a tough learning curve, be prepared to google things the tutorial is good but it still takes a good while to get what to do. over all a solid alpha with alot of potential lost my weekend to it and am looking forward to exploring the solar system and seeing what else is out there, absolutly recommend to anyone who is into space exploration and crafting","May 15","true","22.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Building a basic base, you have to feed yourself, gather resources, and build something to get yourself off the planet. All the while trying not to anger the local wildlife too much.\n\nIt’s also probably a good idea that i mention that the developers on this game seem quite active, and had also let everyone play Empyrion for free all weekend.\n\nAs soon as you start a new game, you are in an escape pod, hurtling toward your new home. You can steer the escape pod only slightly. Immediately a hint pops up telling me to grab my supplies from my escape pod. Underwater i fumbled with unfamiliar controls, trying to access my gear.\n\nWithin my backpack was a basic constructor, which you can place wherever you’d like. At the constructor, you can add resources, which you will have to turn into basic components, which are then in turn made into the machines and blocks that you use to build your base.\n\nThis was about the point that i surveyed my surroundings, and realised that the graphics weren’t the best, but as with any good game, you eventually stop noticing. The tutorial was telling me how to build my base, and with time, lots of building, and about 7 different machines, i had a working base, with a brand new shiny “large constructor”, to make my base a fully functional home.\n\nIt looked terrible, it was a massive noob hub...\n...and to make matters worse, the machines were attacking each night.\n\nYou only start with a small amount of magnesium, which you use to make ammo, and i had wasted it on less important enemies. Knowing that i had to find more, i decided to make a small craft, which i made have made the worst small craft that ever existed. I didn’t know anything about thrusters, so i ended up with a ship that could only go forward and turn. Despite this, i went … well... forward i guess, and after a short search, i found magnesium, mined as much as i could before the machines found me, then headed back to the base.\n\nGet magnesium and make ammo. Ammo is the initial cost to get everything that you need to survive.\n\nAnd if ammo was currency, i had some bills to pay.\nThe important thing to take from all this is that Empyrion is an unfinished game, but a good one. I’ve still not made it off world, but the thought of trying to get there is exciting. The very idea that i can go into space and do everything wrong all over again with a different set of rules entices me to carry on. I have really enjoyed Empyrion, and will continue to do so, and i can only hope that other people will read this and try the game. Just don’t get disheartened, when it all seems too complicated.\n\nEmpyrion is great, and when it is finished, it will no doubt be greater.\n\nGrow a beard, play Empyrion, and instantly become awesome.","May 16","true","23.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

I've played over 600 hours of SE, so don't mistake this for a knock on that game. Keen has done a great job of pioneering the space vehicle building sandbox genre. Empyrion takes more of a holistic approach to game design. From the beginning they built this game to be a complete experience. You start out with an escape pod on an alien world where you have to initially struggle for survival, then slowly gather materials needed to build an escape ship. Once you escape into the atmosphere of the planet you need to build a larger ship capable of intergalactic flight. Then the game really begins!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hectoraf/recommended/383120/","hectoraf","Abaddon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hectoraf/","420 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game still lacks a lot, since it's still in alpha stage, but it suprised me when I found the rather large huge tremendous amount of stuff to do, and I'm sure it will only get better.\n\nI haven't gone too deep in the game because the initial difficulty is too high at the moment, and that's a big setback for me. Here's a little summary to get an idea how the game feels at the beginning:\n\nYou start next to a crashed ship that I understand you have to repair to set off and leave. The ship has several parts, including supply containers, fuel tanks, the cockpit, etc. and you have to start crafting some metal to build a base where you will spend your time around. Then you have to build a lot of devices inside the base that will help you carry on with the game.\n\nThat sounds pretty easy but the only help you get at the moment I'm writing this review (Might change in the future) is a video-tutorial where they explain how to do all that so you can go exploring, and here comes the reason why I haven't even played for 1 hour: You have to spend about 1 hour watching videos just to get started and understand some of the basics in the game.\n\nI'm not a fan of survival adventure games, and on top of that it's not very noob-friendly currently. Those 2 reasons were enough for me to stop playing for a while until a patch introducing a proper tutorial is implemented, but if you like this genre go ahead and try it out because it has a lot of stuff (I actually had fun digging even though I had no idea what I was doing).\n\nThe final verdict: The game is enjoyable but it lacks some aspects to catch my attention at the moment. It's well-done and has a lot of stuff to do.\n\nYou will love it if you are into survival adventure games and hopefully they will introduce an interactible tutorial zone where you build a basic base, power it up, get everything ready to start excavating and go around to find resources and kill a drone or two to access a wreck.","August 5, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hectoraf/recommended/383120/","hectoraf","Abaddon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hectoraf/","420 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game still lacks a lot, since it's still in alpha stage, but it suprised me when I found the rather large huge tremendous amount of stuff to do, and I'm sure it will only get better.\n\nI haven't gone too deep in the game because the initial difficulty is too high at the moment, and that's a big setback for me. Here's a little summary to get an idea how the game feels at the beginning:\n\nYou start next to a crashed ship that I understand you have to repair to set off and leave. The ship has several parts, including supply containers, fuel tanks, the cockpit, etc. and you have to start crafting some metal to build a base where you will spend your time around. Then you have to build a lot of devices inside the base that will help you carry on with the game.\n\nThat sounds pretty easy but the only help you get at the moment I'm writing this review (Might change in the future) is a video-tutorial where they explain how to do all that so you can go exploring, and here comes the reason why I haven't even played for 1 hour: You have to spend about 1 hour watching videos just to get started and understand some of the basics in the game.\n\nI'm not a fan of survival adventure games, and on top of that it's not very noob-friendly currently. Those 2 reasons were enough for me to stop playing for a while until a patch introducing a proper tutorial is implemented, but if you like this genre go ahead and try it out because it has a lot of stuff (I actually had fun digging even though I had no idea what I was doing).\n\nThe final verdict: The game is enjoyable but it lacks some aspects to catch my attention at the moment. It's well-done and has a lot of stuff to do.\n\nYou will love it if you are into survival adventure games and hopefully they will introduce an interactible tutorial zone where you build a basic base, power it up, get everything ready to start excavating and go around to find resources and kill a drone or two to access a wreck.","August 5, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

This game is like Elite: Dangerous and Minecraft combined. Even though it is only in Alpha, it has more content than most released games. If you have 20 dollars laying around, get this game now.\n\nP.S. Developers, it would be nice to have an energy system for the player.

This is one of the best survival games that I have played, and enjoyed from day 1. I actually started playing this game the month it was released, and from the get go, I had seen a LOT of potential for development. Most of the reason that I have enjoyed this game is due to that the Devs are keeping tabs on the interest that players have in game, and the actual development of the game overall. I do not really enjoy playing games like this alone, and have loved the fact that serveral of my friends are now playing as well. The game is extraordinary in adventure, and exploration. The possibilities of what you can build is AWESOME. Bases, hover craft, small vessels, Capitol ships, Space stations (bases), etc,,, The list goes on and on. The 3D environment, and overall optimal visual effects surpass the upper most games that I have played. It just keeps getting better everytime I log in. Game play runs smooth, and any bugs that get discovered, the devs are quick to fix them. Playing a game is one thing, but playing a game and watch it grow, and develop into something wonderful is the best way to spen an evening, morning, or an entire day. I am fortunate that my wife also enjoys the game, so we spend time together in game at home, and help each other with ideas on what to build next.\n\nSo, for the most part, the game is worth every dime that spend on buying it, and I HIGHLY recommend this game as your next survival interest.

At first glance I was skeptical, and since I already have put hundreds of hours into space engineers I wasn't sure I wanted to invest any time in a game that looked at first to be very similar, especially since the visuals in Empyrion are not quite as good.  However this game has a few things that make it a little more interesting and fun than space engineers.  I jumped right into a survival game and went through the tutorials step by step and I was up and running very well.   A really important difference between survival in this game and space engineers is that this game is actually playable in this mode.  Survival in space engineers is far too slow, as collecting resources and building things would take you a lifetime, which is I guess a bit more realistic but far less fun.  So I've only really played it in creative mode, and after you build a ship or base there isn't much to really do.  In Empyrion the game is designed around adventures and exploring a little more, everything is paced a lot better and so it is a lot easier to have fun with the game.  I kind of have a similar feeling like when I first got into minecraft, the game is not visually incredible, however the gameplay is fun for the most part and makes up for it.\n\nI'll make a list of pros and cons comparing this game to space engineers.\n\nPros\n- The overall pacing of the game is good and there is a lot more adventure in this game.\n- Lots of places to discover, various points of interest ( POI ) are scattered all over the place.\n- Alien factions attack you over time, and if you find their bases you can eventually take them over or scrap them for parts.\n- Variety of planets to discover, though I've only been to the local moon so far.\n- Planets are large but not too big, you can get around well enough on foot in the beginning to get the items you need.\n- Building a small ship lets you get around even faster and find more POI as well as collect more resources.\n- Hunger system is cool and wasn't too difficult to manage, building a garden makes it easier to stay fed.\n- Decent XP system and skill/tech tree to unlock.\n- Variety of weapons and new tools to unlock with XP.\n- Mining resources is easier, and especially when you unlock the auto collect drill.\n- Dinosaurs you get to eat?\n- Exploding drones, I like!\n\nCons\n- The save system is a bit wanky, and I've still not entirely figured out what the deal is, so sometimes I loose a little time reverting back to a previous save if something horrible goes wrong.\n- The graphics and models are not that amazing, a little bit cheesy in some cases.\n- Weapon animations are not amazing either.\n- Main character movements are not well done yet, sliding across the ground in 3rd person.\n- AI animations are also not super great but at least there is something unique for each one.\n- AI inside of bases still needs a lot of work, enemies get stuck on walls and it makes them easy to kill ( but I kind of like this since it makes taking out a base not an impossible task ).\n\nSo it's been fun so far, despite the cons I'm hoping the game gets more polish and development continues over time.  There is already a lot to do in this game and all of the tech systems work well, so it seems to me the foundation for this game is already pretty good.  I'm just building my second base now inside the peak of a mountain and it is going to be cool.  Space engineers planets are more of a real world scale than this game, and that is pretty cool but it also means it takes forever to explore, just getting to outerspace from the planet surface is pretty boring and takes like half an hour.  In this game it only takes a minute or so to get to space from the planet in a small ship, and it doesn't take an hour to fly to the moon either.\n\nSpace engineers has more complex systems for builders and crafters, in this game it's not so much about building a crazy space ship with pistons and rotors, as much as it is just to make something functional to help you survive and explore further.\n\nSince I mentioned minecraft, there is one thing this game lacks that minecraft had.  This is the feeling of fear.  When I first played minecraft it was a race to build a little cave to hide in once the night came because of the bad creatures that spawn and come after you, even though they look so simple visually, something was very effective about that experience.  This game has some creatures that will chase you but nothing that is quite as relentless.  Hopefully in the future they make something that comes after you at the night time specifically, if they haven't already done this on a planet I've not discovered yet.  From what I've seen so far, the creatures in the game share the same AI for the most part.  Some creatures are passive and others chase you down and try to kill you once they see you in range.  AI cannot yet climb on blocks, so if you build a base that is above the ground you are pretty safe from them.\n\nCool game, I like it so far.  Good luck developers!","May 14","true","37.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But after getting the basics down I started moving along fairly well.\n\nWhen you start the game you are crash landing in an escape pod, you leave the pod, grab what you can from it and then search the immediate area for a decent spot to get started,  then like most survival games you craft build a base, make sure you are fed and depending on what planet you are on...make sure you have Oxygen.  You discover mining nodes from exploration, you also discover Alien villages fortresses etc, this is where I am very impressed certain alien villages are hostile and spawn drones that will attack on site, if you are winning they then call for backup and troop drop ships come in dropping alien A holes off you make life hell....btw if you decide to attack the friendly aliens...these drones also seem to coem to you're base seeking vengeance...yeah pretty cool.\n\nYou can also discover crash sites, these can be fully taken apart for resources, and have tons of nice loot in them...typically from what I have seen they are massive in size.\n\nOnce you are comfortable with the game the next step is building you're ship, this is a steep learning curve as well...if you play make sure to read the PDA guide...step by step.  Once you build you're ship you can then move into space...discover space stations, land on other planets with new biome types that are more hostile than the starter planets, this is where the open PVP comes in, which I have not experienced so far...but looking forward to it.\n\nThe game is fairly masive and I have yet to see it all, it is a true sandbox and...well a true alpha.\n\nWhat I mean by that is there are bugs in the game, but this is Alpha...and in it's current state I am still having more fun that the countless other games I have tried out over the last 6 months.  at the price its a great buy...but make sure to expect bugs....you can stil enjoy the game, but like many of the negatice reviews here...there not based on much aside from things that are expected in an Alpha state.\n\nI highly recommend supporting this game...its one of the few with a great idea behind it.","May 15","true","52.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It introduces many awesome mechanics, such as reentry effects and water, and is great.\n\nHere’s a video I made on it, showing my little house, a fighter, a hover car and a warp drive ring, for interplanetary travel, as well as showing a few bugs and glitches :\nhttps://youtu.be/zDXNMi_ziHY\nIn survival, you start off in a drop pod, which has just landed on a planet. You need to get resources to build your base and survive, making sure to not starve of death or suffocate (unless you want to of course). You then try to build hover, small and capital ships to explore the galaxy and take it over!\n\nI really like how immersive the game is. After getting used to the weird controls, which I personally rebinded to be like the Space Engineers ones, you really get into building great things. You gets access to a lot of blocks even in Vanilla, like fuel tanks and elevators, but you also get to use lots of decoration blocks, like couches, beds and TVs! These decorations are great for building your own base.\n\nAlso, I’m a big fan of the sheer amount of weapons in the game. There’s something for everyone : pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and even A MINIGUN! How else could you feel so badass?\n\nHowever, much like most Early Access games on the market, it has a lot of bugs and glitches, and some are quite game breaking, like trees disappearing from the world (apparently now fixed) or falling through the ground (sometimes happens). Though, I am sure the devs will work on fixing these soon.\n\nIn a nutshell, it’s a great start for a game which I believe has a glorious future up ahead. I strongly recommend you get it to support the development! Who knows what the devs will add in the next update?","April 22","true","12.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","4"

I must have started about a dozen times now, always finding better way to develop and progress ... or computer crashing in the heat of the action (probably also high outside temperatures helped. This actually brings me to one thing I am really missing: SAVE. Please give us save functionality. Occasionally, on Windows crash the game did no longer recognise the survival scenario of the active game  and thus I ended up butt naked in the wild.\n\nThe hardest part for me in getting started with this game was figuring out how to EAT!! I think I starved to death twice before I had the epiphany of putting food into the direct access key panel. Slow learner, I know.\n\nThe mechanics are great with having to create parts before being able to create machinery. Building a base is an interesting experience and each subsequent attempt made them look tidier.\n\nThere is another thing that would help enjoying the game more: The light of the drill should be less focussed. Since mining takes up quite some time, one usually does that to a good extent at night and trying to find one's way around the bore hole is somewhat awkward.\n\nAnyway, great game and I am glad I bought it. It is good fun and worth every penny spent on it. In fact, over time this could become a game that is really cheap in regards to replay value!

Even at it's alpha launch it's still worth the purchase and only getting better. Why?\n\nFrom the planet you start on you can see 3 or 4 others rotating past through the horizions. You can then build a small/medium spaceship and fly up through the atmosphere and straight to that planet. If you put one of these cruiser sized ships on your capitol ship you can use it as a spaceport.....\n\nYou will have to restart many times but I've never seen anything like this.

With any sandbox game, it has its limitations because you can sometimes run out of inspiration/new things to find/craft. However, despite being very early access, the graphics are good, the movement/shooting is decent, and the ship building/base building is fun and intuitive. Even the music is great, and that's not something you usually find in an early access game.\n\nOn the whole, it's got relatively few glitches even though it's early access. I definitely recommend this if you want a block-style space exploration game, and just remember to be patient as the developers come up with new content and make new changes and improvements (which they have already done quite a lot in the time I've had the game).

It has the basic building style of Space engineers, with the exploration of Starbound. I will try to write a review that would help answer the real questions i would want to know before buying this game. Feel free to skip to the section that applys.\n\n(Pre-Alpha? How are the dev's? Should i get this now?)\nThe devolpers say it's in Pre-Alpha.... It's not. Having expierence as a game designer and programer, i would say this game should be labeled Early Beta, or late Alpha. It's completely playable, despite lacking a few futures. I think this alone speaks volumes of the devolpers. They are not following the typical steam route of taking money for a piece of crap in hopes that it will be completed. The devolpers are designing the game for the community, as they have several polls on what new futures, or what we want them to work on next. There was a poll recently, which the community choose procedural (random generated) planets. It's been about 2-3 weeks and within the next few days we will have procedural planets.\n\nIt's worth getting now IMHO as you can build a base, a giant starship, a regular spaceship and a ground vehicle (there really isn't much reason to build the ground vehicle over the regular spaceship atm as content is lacking on that). Survival is playable now, and you can travel to 3 planets. When procedual planets come out, it will feel like the game is nearly complete to most of us who have played these type of games before. The difference is that the dev's have a ton of features planed for the final game, and the dev's do not considered it to be in beta until most or all of the features are in the game. Make no mistake, the dev's here are good. The are active in the community, have nearly weekly updates and release major new content ever month or so. They arn't just some of the best dev's on steam, they gotta be in the top 3 for indie (top 10 for non indie).\n\nTLDR: Dev's directly ask and implament community idea's, and it's feels way far more complete then the suposed "Pre-Alpha" state. It's worth the money,\n\nCombat:\nGround combat is basicly like a stripped down 1st/3rd person with minimal frills. For a exploration in building game, it engagements can be fun, risky and there is enough combat to keep you on your toes.\n\nSpace Combat is like space engineers with actual enemys that you will fight in all stages of the game. It's challanging enough that most of us will die if we are not careful, especially when you get in to space.\n\nSurvival Mode:\nThe survival mode is easily my favorite part. It encourages exploration, and resource management without turning the game in to farmville. You can usually gather enough materials to build a small ship within 20 minutes or less, though building your base the way you like it could take a life time. You always have to stock up on certain ore's or items like food, however it usually takes 5-10 minute trip to get enough for a few hours of play. You spend 1/4 of your time gathering resources, half your time building and another 1/4 of your time in combat. Though this is extremly subjective, it feels like the perfect balance.\n\nCreative Mode:\nAfter playing many of these games it's hard to comment on this. It's the same as every other game, the difference is that  you can still explore differn't planets. It's basicly build a base/star ship/imperial destroyer/x-wing and its fun. It's also a great place to get use to the mechanics.\n\nThis started as a game that looked ok that i picked up with 4-5 other games to tide me over till Fallout comes out. I have already forgoten about the other games i have bought, and now i think i'll be logging hours on this game even when fallout come outs.","September 3, 2015","true","103.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, if you like games like ARK. . . and sci-fi/space ships are more your thing, you should really look at supporting this game even in it's early state. There is a lot of content here already and it is very playable. I am really excited to see where this game goes. The ability to build space ships, enter space, and go to other planets and stations is just amazing to me. The planets are actual spheres and if someone else is on a different part of the planet, the night cycle is realistic to their position on the sphere. i thought that was really cool. The devs have put a lot of thought and care into this game so far, and it shows. A lot of times I find crafting systems confusing and frustrating. This game has a deep crafting system, but the information on how to build something is readily available. The game seems to run fine on my machine and they have implemented dedicated servers which is a plus in my book.","February 8","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

EMPERION, however, has me so involved i felt the need to say somethimg.  In the 24 days since I acquired this game, I have apparently been playing for over 220 out of 576 hours! Not typical!\n\nIt's actually the 3rd game of it's type that I tried. All are "pre-release" or still in development.  I wasn't sure what to expect from any of them, but for the price, I thought they would be worth a try.  let me start by saying I am a retired designer in the architectural engineering field and a former Army Combat Engineer, so the notion of building and combat in space or other planets was just the sort of thing I was looking to find.\n\nAlthough, the learning curve was rather steep, in my opinion, EMPRYION - GALACTIC SURVIVAL has become nothing less than an obsession for me.  I did find some clues as to how to proceed, but an actual guide or "SURVIVAL MANUAL" is in order. Nevertheless, it's an awesome experience that I can't stay away from.\n\nThis "community" thing is unknown to me and I don't do on-line multiplayer games.  EMPYRION my become the exception as I think I would like to add my two cents into the mix.\n\nI do have some complaints.  I think many of the menu icons in the constructor and player inventory appear too dark and similar (drill, R&R, F&F).\n\nIt would be nuce if weapons and other devices could be removed intact for relocation as an alternative to disassembly for recycling.\n\nWhile the "globe" is nice, a map for planning routes would be better.\n\nBINOCULARS!!!! Something high-tech with range (like the rifle scope) and azimuth as well as ZOOM!\n\nI'll have to quit for now as I want to get back to the game.  i've had highs (finding a Silicon ore deposit) and lows (accidently "removing" my large constructor with all my raw materials lost). For me. this game fullfills a desire I have had since I first played "STAR RAIDERS" on an Atari 400 PC.\n\nAn update to my review of a week ago.  i tried the "Creative Mode". WTH is that about??  Nice ships and buildings.  Very "creative".  But I as a player can do little more than wander around a bit.  their are no resources or components, nor the tools to acquire them either by minimg or recycling. I don't get it.  So how does one create in creative mode?","February 14","true","989.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And while Space Engineers is a better looking game with better building mechanics, it really struggles to make survival fun. I usually just play it for the creative mode. That's where Empyrion comes in. Empyrion can in no way, at least currently, compete with SE's complex building system. However, Empyrion is still a very young game, compared to SE's 2 or so years of existence, so it deserves a bit of a pass there.\nSo you're now probably wondering, why did I purchase Empyrion if I already owned and enjoyed Space Engineers? Well, I was looking for a fun space survival game, not just a sandbox. And boy, did I find it.\nFirst of all, Empyrion's survival system is, at least currently, MUCH simpler than Space Engineer's, despite adding a food bar into the mix. How is this possible? First of all getting what you need to make stuff isn't terribly tedious. In fact, I'd say it's more akin to Minecraft in terms of balance. Just right. Ore spots are spaced out, but most have more ore in them than any one person could ever need or even want. And while getting around on foot can be kinda... slow, you start the game with a sizeable amount of ore in your escape pod, meaning that making your first SV or HV will be pretty easy, even after making a base. Once you have a working SV or HV, getting to those ore spots becomes a breeze. As for food, you'll start out hunting things for meat to turn into steaks or salami, but eventually start growing your own food, and never have to hunt again. And in terms of oxygen, you literally just make a machine, stick it in water, fill it with fuel, and forget about it. It makes oxygen while you do other stuff, so no worries!\nAs for what really makes this an excellent survival game, I'd have to say the "goals". And by goals, I mean attacking alien bases scattered all over the solar system. There are many different types of these bases, some easy to take down, others incredibly difficult. Unlike Space Engineers, these bases have actual alien troops in them, with guns and everything, who will kill you on sight. And they HURT. Suddenly, something that seemed so trivial before becomes something you have to carefully plan out to execute. And a lot more fun.\nAs for the negatives of this game, I'd have to say that currently there are a lot of bugs. Not game-breaking bugs, but bugs nontheless. Additionally, the graphics look like theyre from ancient times with modern lighting. A bit strange if you ask me, but hopefully this may improve with time. If not, I still don't care, the game is a lot of fun! Finally, the current explorable system is rather small, and there's not a ton of variation on the different planets. They're generally the same across the map. I do hope that this too will change with time, and it probably will.\nBut overall, I really like this game. If you own Space Engineers, get this anyways. It's not as good as SE in terms of what you can build, but it's definitely a more satisfying survival experience.

I enjoy "battle testing" the ship and finding what adjustments I need to make (more/less thrusters, weight, defenses and weaponry.)

It just feels too plain/boring in my opinon while the title music is pretty damn cool.\n\nThe starter guide they give you (the question mark when opening all menu tabs in game) is exactly what you need for first time players. Without that thing I probably would be dying from no oxygen or food trying to figure out what to do to make my stuff.\n\nA smaller problem I had was dying to open wounds and poison because I had no resources yet to make items to cure this stuff and THEY NEVER WEAR OFF!!!! So you are forced to die at beginning if you end up getting hit by enemies but at least you respawn near the stuff you dropped.\n\nYou may have a hard complicated time at the beginning but it soon becomes a freaking amazing game once you get on your feet.","March 5","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite being alpha and needing a lot of work yet, this is a lot of fun. I found it enjoyable and since it was also on sale, I've decided to buy it and contribute towards the future development. This game has a large amount of potential just waiting to be filled.\n\nThe beginning was a little frustrating until you learned to read the details of the tutorial missions in the PDA. Then things got much better. You also need to realize you have to right-click with a building component selected on your hotbar to find other shape possibilities. That REALLY needs to be made clearer. Also, for those complainging about having so much to carry around after emptying your escape pod, just put it all in your constructor after you place it. It has plenty of room.\n\nI really love the blueprint system. I've found some great BPs of ships and buildings made by others that look great. I'm especallly impressed with the guy that made the city-ship Atlantis from Stargate. It is classified as a capital ship and is pretty large. Building that will be a very long term goal. LoL\n\nMost have to understand this is an unfinished game and so it still needs work and polish.

Manufacture Everything from basic  elements/components up to complex devices/machinery. Feels like what Space Engineers wants to be. Almost as solid as Rust. It's early on, so hopefully they add tons more of devices, vehicles, ships, alien life, advanced AI, and a slightly better combat system/interface. Right now alien AI seems kinda simple, and most weapons are point and shoot. Would like to see better use of combat ie melee weapons and improvised bombs/explosives/combustibles.

This game offers alot of enjoyment for both survivalist & sci fi fans.

Even if we compare it to big contendors such as rust, planet explorers or space engineers.\n\nFor a full experience of the game, it's best to test the performance and test the game for yourself as it is alpha and may be different for everyone, however, the game is beautiful to play even on intel core processors.\n\n\nPerformance tests:\n\nIntel core 2 quad 2.4 ghz\nati radeon 4650HD  fps 15 - 25 - 40\n3GB ram (With system performance paging 8GB enabled)\n\nIntel core 2 quad 2.4 ghz\nnvidia gts 450 fps 20 - 35 - 50\n8gb ram (With system performance paging 8GB enabled)\n\nIntel Core 2 quad 2.4 ghz\nnvida GTX 960 4gb AMP! fps 40 - 60 - 60+\n8gb ram (With system performance paging 8GB enabled)\n\n\n(Unfinished review)\nI may change or update this review until final release.\n","May 15","true","81.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The initial start is kind of rough, though the in depth tutorial (which I feel is a bit OP) goes through everything from making basic items to building vehicals and ships.\n\nNot for everyone, this game starts you out with basic survival resources that do not last very long. I recommend playing first a 'scratch' game to get the feel of how this game works, follow the tutorials to their letter when they pop up and don't do much else beside gathering needed resources when needed.\n\nOnce you complete all the lessons/quests/tutorial THEN restart the game with a fresh start and go at it full force with a good understanding of the game. It is fairly easy to master and get use to while in solo mode. I have not played multiplayer yet.\n\nFor the $10 purchase while on sale, I feel it is well worth the purchase.

When my friends and I first got into the world I felt a feeling of regret as the game did not look very well, but it didnt stop me from trying it out.  After I learned the basics, I got hooked.  Played for nearly 13 hours the first day and had a blast.  The next day I broke my record and played nearly 15 hours,  even in pre-alpha this game has so much to do and I am very excited for the upcoming updates.  This is by far one of the best games I have ever played, though there are some glitches/problems\n\n1. Not being able to leave a planet without having every player inside of the ship (Though they are going to change this)\n\n2. After leaving space, into a planet.  Your character still acts like he is in space and you can basically fly anywhere you want (Though can be easily fixed by toggling the jetpack key)\n\n3. After leaving and joining back into a server near an Alien base, It will shoot at you even if you are not in range (This happened to one of my friends,  when he joined back his ship was being shot at by nothing)\n\n4. Randomly falling through the map,  while I have not had this happen to me,  it is a common glitch for my friends when they're connected to my server (Though you can just disconnect and reconnect to fix it)\n\nWhile I'm sure there are many more bugs,  these are the only ones I found/noticed throughout my 32.5 hours of playing.\n\nI would rate this game a 8/10,  probably one of my top 5 games.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that looks beautiful, this is not the game for you.  But if you are looking for one that will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours,  then I would definitely recommend it.","February 14","true","50.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't know about the endgame content because I didn't get there, however, The early game is fun and you can tell the developers have put time into the crafting system and the building system.\n\nIf you want to build an item but you don't have the required parts you can que up the parts you need and then que the Main thing you wanted to build after it and it will build in order, which is simple and awesome. Having the ability  to build a plane of blocks with a click of a button instead of individually placing each of those 1,000+ blocks is a HUGE timesaver.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to survival enthusiasts when it's on sale. I also feel a large amount of people will find the game worth the $17.99.\n\nCons:\n\n1. You can fly from the planet into outer space with no cutscene, however, you do suddenly get teleported into outer space, there is a very obvious change in the backdrop that kills the immersion.\n\n2. The game runs fairly well on my pc. I have a GTX 970 and a i7 920 @ 2.67 ghz. I believe if I overclocked my cpu the game would run much smoother.\n\n3. Depending on the server and other player's connection to the server, you will frop frames. I normally have around 30-60fps and when I joined different servers, with only one person remotely near me, I dropped to below 15fps.\n\n4. You cannot explore the entire planet, while being quite large, there are playable zones that you cannot walk/fly past.\n\nEven with all of the cons this game is still very enjoyable.\n\n\n","May 16","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes SE has better/more technical blocks but it doesn't have a decent survival system and the AI is pretty crap.

"The Devs just keep on giving," I watched one guy who has played since the beginning and he comments on how it has progressed, going from strength to strength. I would advise anyone wanting to try any new game, to check them out on Youtube everytime, that is were the truth lies.\n\nTo sum up, yeah I might only have a few hours playtime on this game, but for me it was an excellent few hours.

Community was great on every server, a lot of people ready to help a noob.\n\nCaution for some players though, graphisms are ♥♥♥♥, like 80's ♥♥♥♥ ^^ But if you value game mechanics over that and are a big Sci-Fi fan then its a game for you!","May 16","true","99.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Definitely recommend it, but it is seriously lacking in any proper tutorial sense. The online guides are still very new, but they help somewhat. A few of the guides tell you the first few steps after arriving on a planet.\n\nSuffice it to say, many people will play this game in build/craft mode even though the survival mode has massive potential for interactions and intelligent playthroughs. It seems to be a great game from what I played and what I have seen content and mechanics, etc.\n\nThe only major problem I had was that it kept crashing my computer. I am playing on a computer that is a few years old, but I play many other games on it without issue, including some more particle heavy ones that are both new and very old. So, it bothered me that this particular game had a crashing issue, but the gameplay and such are excellent. Lots of potential. 8/10 would recommend for anyone who likes craft, survival, or exploration games (especially space-themed ones).","May 16","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still in Early Development but it has great potential. It is a little hard to get started but if you stick with it and learn the basics it becomes a great game. You must have a creative mind and a want to explore in this game. There is a lot of tedious mining but it becomes easier to manage later in the game. The crafting is fantastic, i personally live having to craft the little bits to make the largers bits to make my items. Feel like im actually starting from the basics and going furthur from there. Anyone who says they've "fully explored the potential" of this game and hasnt put more than 15 hours into is BS.

I play Space Engineers and think that is a good game, this one in my view has all the elements that SE doesn't have. .. Yes SE has better/more technical blocks but it doesn't have a decent survival system and the AI is pretty crap. This game even though is still in early access is very good and looks to be heading toward the Great Game status. I've watched gamers playing on Youtube and all seem to be in the same mind. "The Devs just keep on giving," I watched one guy who has played since the beginning and he comments on how it has progressed, going from strength to strength. I would advise anyone wanting to try any new game, to check them out on Youtube everytime, that is were the truth lies.\n\nTo sum up, yeah I might only have a few hours playtime on this game, but for me it was an excellent few hours.

The mechanics are clunky.  The learning curve is steep with little to no ingame direction.  Things as simple as building your initial base taking hours, just because direction is so vague like hitting Y to turn on your base's power or the use of RMB in tooltips.  I spent at least 6 hours and banging my head against the wall to figure out how to even place thrusters correctly on my hover/ship.  Once I slowly and painstakingly figured out different controls mostly by sheer accident or trial and error then I have an "oooooh" moment.\n\nI have to assume the "quest" system is currently broken, as I got to the build o2 and food production and no matter what I built the check box was never satisfied.\n\nNo joke with "survival"...  The drone base attacks sucked but were manageable, the open world attacks were verrrrry hard to deal with.  First many times I had no clue or indication where they were coming from either a long range drone, spider, plant creature - grass up to my eyes and out of nowhere I'm getting attacked and I'm dead before I really manage to counter. Respawn near by, try to reach my backpack and re-equip my weapon before my backpack goes flying again and my body hitting the ground.  I feel like this is probably super punishing in the early game and less so once you have ship access and can soar over the terrain and keep back up equipment on board in the event of a death.\n\nBase construction is TEDIOUS!  I will say I did not dig into the blue prints which might make this process easier and more attractive.  I also have never played minecraft etc which I assume has similar building mechanics.  I completely restarted the game twice just due to realizing early I made errors in base placement.  Even after around 15 hours on my current base it still looks like a big black squarish blob with parts sticking out of and a large growing plot off on one side.  Rotating blocks/pieces took me what felt like a lifetime to figure out,\n\nShip construction just as tedious.  You just kind of need to figure out the items you have to cobble together to make a square flying box.  In addition your craft is most likely going to flip over at some point while building due to being top / left / right heavy, which means placing the rest of the parts including the cockpit can be hard.  This will likely lead to needing to finish building try to turn the ship upright blasting off pieces that are not weight balanced and then rebuilding those parts.\n\nThe last negative that I can see, and one I don't see being changed much is the low end graphics.  Some of the models are reallllly well done, but a lot of the alien life and your character in particular are very poor currently.\n\nThe only true bug I encountered was my first trip off planet, I landed on the nearest moon as i came under drone attack.  I hopped out of the ship, popped on my helmet and fell through the world.  I eventually had to suicide, and when I tried to resurrect nearby I got stuck on a loading screen and the game crashed.  This was the end of my play time, since the limited event ended and I could no longer open the game.\n\nOverall, with all of that said, this game has a TON of potential.  Being in an early alpha state, if the developers push hard to improve the final product could be downright amazing.  I got sucked in and personally plan to buy this soon in early access to get this at such an affordable price.","May 17","true","171.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Way to go Eleon! I have played Space Engineers and Starforge as well as many other space exploration and building games and after 16 hours of play I am impressed and excited at what I see.

Besides that it was solid and had pleantly of content to keep me enjoying myself.\n\nI love the long day/night cycle and the feel of the game at night.  It can get wonderfully tense with the minmal lighting and occasional surprise visit from  something that wants you dead! I just finished making it home after getting trapped in the downed spaceship rear section surrounded by drones. I was low on food and ammo and I was hurt. "But wait! these cargo containers have loot in them. I'm saved!" Beautiful scenery and sounds along with great lighting effects.

Right now they still have a lot of work to do on basic gameplay issues.\n\nAfter my demo license expired, I still felt I wanted to play this game, so I'm going to buy it, but at least I know what I'm getting in to!\n\n","May 16","true","54.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Started on a terrestrial planet, shooting dinosaurs and making them into salami. Started building a cabin. Hid in unfinished cabin from hovering murder drones in the dark. Rigged cabin with basic survival gear. Mined ore. Built a hovercraft. Traveled farther in search of ore. Shot down more drones and horrible plant monsters. Built a little spaceship. Mined an asteroid and the moon while trying not to attract drones' attention. Died repeatedly trying to mine cobalt on the home planet. Now I'm assembling a capital ship in orbit, big enough to walk around in, and haven't even gone to the other planets yet. I have also not decided where to install the shower in my cabin, and the farm I built is producing more wheat than I know what to do with.\n\nThe bad: some details seem clunky, like vehicle headlights and my ship's tendency to roll over despite my attention to thruster placement and landing gear. (If it handles badly, it seems to be partly your fault, since you build ships block by block.) Saved games have a hidden catch that the game you last loaded/saved is constantly updated, eg. with you having just lost all your stuff, so whenever you load your first action should be to make a backup save. You also can't name a save file until you're back at the menu. Some other features seem unfinished, like the so-far pointless Talon Temple and a lack of feedback when shooting drones/creatures. The tutorial is still clunky too.\n\nThe good: Lots of things to do and some clear challenges to work towards. The developers have already made improvements based on feedback from the free weekend, which bodes well for them actually updating again.\n\nVersus other games: Way better than Starbound in terms of respecting their Early Access players and making stable updates. Versus Space Engineers it's more of a tossup; the focus here is on planets rather than some of SE's elaborate engineering. I find that this game runs planets easily, whereas planets in SE make my 4 GB RAM computer weep. It's mostly a matter of taste to pick this versus SE; do you want things to shatter impressively and have elaborate conveyor/vent/control panel systems (SE) or grow crops and shoot some aliens (Empyrion)?","May 24","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't know about the endgame content because I didn't get there, however, The early game is fun and you can tell the developers have put time into the crafting system and the building system.\n\nIf you want to build an item but you don't have the required parts you can que up the parts you need and then que the Main thing you wanted to build after it and it will build in order, which is simple and awesome. Having the ability  to build a plane of blocks with a click of a button instead of individually placing each of those 1,000+ blocks is a HUGE timesaver.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to survival enthusiasts when it's on sale. I also feel a large amount of people will find the game worth the $17.99.\n\nCons:\n\n1. You can fly from the planet into outer space with no cutscene, however, you do suddenly get teleported into outer space, there is a very obvious change in the backdrop that kills the immersion.\n\n2. The game runs fairly well on my pc. I have a GTX 970 and a i7 920 @ 2.67 ghz. I believe if I overclocked my cpu the game would run much smoother.\n\n3. Depending on the server and other player's connection to the server, you will frop frames. I normally have around 30-60fps and when I joined different servers, with only one person remotely near me, I dropped to below 15fps.\n\n4. You cannot explore the entire planet, while being quite large, there are playable zones that you cannot walk/fly past.\n\nEven with all of the cons this game is still very enjoyable.\n\n\n","May 16","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As such here we go.\n\nTLDR:\nGreat game. The engine is stable for an alpha, playability is there. At this point in time dedicated servers are not out yet, however ad-hoc direct ip connect does exist, allowing people to multiplay to their hearts content. The gameplay itself is great, if not a little unforgiving (But its survival! We didn't sign up for a good hand-holding, for that I go to my depraved Grandmother).\n\nYou can craft, run around on multiple (yes, multiple planets!), to which the transition is seamless. Build ground bases, space stations, ground vehicles, small ships and large ships! Enemies prowl planetary surfaces and the deep black. As such standard military and navy doctrine is a must (Recon, Adapt, Overcome). Resources are minable and the crafting is intuitive.\n\nPros:\n- Planets!\n- Planets with enemies!\n- Planets with secret artifacts!\n- Crafting (Build ships,bases,groundvehicles, space stations)\n- The worlds are huge... literally.\n- Good graphics (I know they are not cutting edge, but hey even with a large block-count theres no FPS drops, unlike Space Engineers which slows to a crawl at times).\n\nCons:\n- The UI at this time is very clunky. The crafting menu is horrendous, but workable.\n- The usual alpha issues like enemy path-finding, and rough edges like hover-crafts having a few issues with hills.\n- Water is pretty much just static.\n- Lacking a tutorial (Had to look around how to power-on a base (by pressing Y on the generator..))\n\n\nAll in all, I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time. There is SO MUCH potential here, which is already being realised within the early access build. The engine is surprisingly stable, the devs seem to know what they are doing. I am honestly looking forward to its evolution and will be supporting it throughout its infant state. If you are looking for a mix between Space Engineers, Starbound, Starmade and other survivals like 7 days to die, this is for you.\n\nEnjoy, adventurers, I know I will.\nRannekk, signing off.","August 12, 2015","true","71.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even without too much polish or challenge from the NPC (Creatures, Drones, etc...) population you will occasionally die or be faced with decisions on whether to try and make it to a resource with the oxygen you have.  I would love to see some lore and more points of interest on each planet.  For Alpha, the game is very and I've only encountered minor bugs with picking up things.  I would like to see a surveying component added in order to find/trace resources, rather than the random discovery method in place now.  I have encountered issues with running out of Iron and not being able to find any after blindly flying all over the planet.  I think a surveying/resource allocation scheme like from Star Wars Galaxies would be great.  So that you can always find ore, even if in small amounts in thinner seams for instance.

This is probably the biggest con with this game, recently i have encountered ALOT (most even) of early access games that look like ♥♥♥♥ and are literaly unplayable on medium PC rigs, this one dosent have this problem. Some of you might say that the graphics are not amazing, and its true, they are pretty crappy but the animation quality is decent and the graphics aint that hidious to ruin the game for you and the game does compinsate for it by having a rly high FPS.\n\n-Content. This is a Pre-Alpha release (personaly i dont think pre alphas should be even allowed on steam, we have kickstarter and such for that but still) it has alot of ♥♥♥♥ to do, u get 4 planets (1 is a moon) asmall asteroid field and some space stations u can shoot at for your amusment (be carefull tho - they shoot back!)\n\n-Music, the music is really good, the sound isnt, the sound is extreamly buggy and just overlaps, plays in inaproprite moments etc' but its a pre-alpha release so i dont hold it against the game. The music on the otherside is pretty epic and by epic i literaly mean the "Epic music genere" the into theme song sounds like something "Two steps from hell" would have made.\n\n-Crafting, also there is alot of negative things to be said about that, mainly it being a pain in the ♥♥♥ as u need to craft ingots -> materials -> whatever u need to make which just adds pointless fiddeling and annoyence and is extreamly slow and the UI dosent give u enough info of how much of a certain resouce u have (again, pre-alpha excuse, i'll accept that).\n\n-The world - its fairly big, its interesting and its alive also it "progresses" some mobs/plants only start to appear after a certain palytime which adds to the interest when u suddenly get out of ur base in the morning and find a big stomping golem-like creature walking around and crashing ur punny mortal skull that wasnt there before - its fun and it adds to the atmosphere.\n\n-Ship and base building. Nothing much to say really, its fairly intuitive and fun, small vessels are da ♥♥♥♥, u might aswell not bother with the "Capital vessels" which are basicly flying bases and the deffences require manning the station which means u cant fly-and-shoot and the armor/hull blocks really need a balancing since anything tougher then a paper plane breaks them immidiatly.\n\nNow for the negatives, and ill summerize it in 1 word:\nBUGSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\npretty much every bug u can imagine is present, most of them aint really game breaking just REALLY annoying but again, thouse are fairly small bugs and they can be fixed fairly easily i belive.\n\nOverall - game has alot of potential, in its current state it dosent worth 18$ tbh so if u expect to get ur moneys worth right of the bat go buy something else, if the devs stay active (as they clearly are now) this game will be worth ur money in no time.\n\nNote: this game has a very very long way to go before its even remotely balanced in online (Public server not just co-op 2 player game) so if thats your only interest in this game just check up on it in a year or 2.","August 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

As such here we go.\n\nTLDR:\nGreat game. The engine is stable for an alpha, playability is there. At this point in time dedicated servers are not out yet, however ad-hoc direct ip connect does exist, allowing people to multiplay to their hearts content. The gameplay itself is great, if not a little unforgiving (But its survival! We didn't sign up for a good hand-holding, for that I go to my depraved Grandmother).\n\nYou can craft, run around on multiple (yes, multiple planets!), to which the transition is seamless. Build ground bases, space stations, ground vehicles, small ships and large ships! Enemies prowl planetary surfaces and the deep black. As such standard military and navy doctrine is a must (Recon, Adapt, Overcome). Resources are minable and the crafting is intuitive.\n\nPros:\n- Planets!\n- Planets with enemies!\n- Planets with secret artifacts!\n- Crafting (Build ships,bases,groundvehicles, space stations)\n- The worlds are huge... literally.\n- Good graphics (I know they are not cutting edge, but hey even with a large block-count theres no FPS drops, unlike Space Engineers which slows to a crawl at times).\n\nCons:\n- The UI at this time is very clunky. The crafting menu is horrendous, but workable.\n- The usual alpha issues like enemy path-finding, and rough edges like hover-crafts having a few issues with hills.\n- Water is pretty much just static.\n- Lacking a tutorial (Had to look around how to power-on a base (by pressing Y on the generator..))\n\n\nAll in all, I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time. There is SO MUCH potential here, which is already being realised within the early access build. The engine is surprisingly stable, the devs seem to know what they are doing. I am honestly looking forward to its evolution and will be supporting it throughout its infant state. If you are looking for a mix between Space Engineers, Starbound, Starmade and other survivals like 7 days to die, this is for you.\n\nEnjoy, adventurers, I know I will.\nRannekk, signing off.","August 12, 2015","true","71.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One of the best games on PC for its low cost they do raise the price slowy as they add new content so pick it up quickly, similar to the concept of No Mans Sky coming out soon, crashing in a survial escape pod with limited resources in random areas, planets you can choose. The fact you are rushing to survive one hour from hostile alien life or machines the next exploring space just by simply building a ship and leaving the atmostphere. The beginning of the game may not be clear what you need to do and is slow but once you get going the adventure goes on and on. Any fans of sandbox games have to try it out, the graphics may not be all there lol, but the gameplay and community are. The devlopers of this game have been steadly updating adding new content at least one or two weeks at a time so the game just feels fresh with some new content. The largest patch opening into aplha stage as of 4/15/2016 has added the most yet. The game has no minor transactions just one time buy and you get all the content.Overall easy game to learn and play, really fun. Building can be hover vehicles, space fighters, large capital ships, and of course stationary bases in a space or planetside. Also everything in between you can come up with. Good customization. Highly recommended game if you are reading this and are interested you could be missing out.\n\nCons to the game it is early stages and are some bugs some that can be annoying.\nAlot of content is there but not finished.\nNo real tutorials so new players may have a hard time at first.\nBad AI oppenents regardless of what they are.\nPunishing deaths if you arent carefull where you are, such as space, lava planets or inside large structures. Getting your stuff back could be difficult somtimes. Just carry back up supplies.\nGame isnt polished enough where is needs it, little things like guns not have reloading animations, or strange character animations.\n\nBut keep in mind they update the game constantly so all my complaints could change in a week. Not to mention what all they have planned for the future. If you get it good luck and have fun watch out for plant monsters, and 15-20 capital ships surrounding yours like police in mutiplayer lol!","April 16","true","844.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love it.\nIt's still pre-alpha and way better than some of the finished survival games I've seen. I can't wait to see what they have in store for the Alpha release!\n\nSpace flight has never been so fun!\n\nEdit as of Feb 18 2016:\nI hate the leveling system. It almost completely ruined the game for me.\nIf the stats and skills carried over to other worlds then great, but as of right now this is complete crap.\n\nEdit March 7 2016:\nThe leveling system isn't much of a bother after you've hit max level, but starting out it makes crafting incredibly difficult and building decent crafts or weapons even harder.\n\nThis is still one of my most favorite games. Customizing, building, and creating my own bases, ships, and Capital Vessels is truly satisfying. Shooting through space blowing up enemy bases and drones in a vehicle completely of my own design - nothing better. Even just flying around looking for ore to mine makes me feel on top of the world!\n\nThe combat system has really been revamped since I played last. The new AI and enemy mobs is terrifying! I usually play games in a "hardcore" type way so that if I die I just delete the world and start over, and normally I'm extremely careful when approaching enemies, BUT HOLY CRAP. I have never had to be THIS careful! Literally hiding behind destroyed enemy drones to avoid cannon fire, or enemy aliens with machine guns. Sniping from just behind a hill, and finally resorting to flying a ship decked out in rocket launchers just to take out a few ground troops.

You can easily enjoy hundreds of hours of gameplay, especially if you play multiplayer.\n\nPros:\n-Fun exploration, building, survival\n-Runs well, needs an ok PC, nothing super fancy (don't try running on a potato though)\n-Lots of future promise that can be realistically achieved\n-Frequent updates, new features, fixes (no major bugs, minor things occasionally pop up and get fixed quick)\n-Good devs\n-Excellent community, active and helpful\n-Lots of moding/tweaking potential. You can literally design your own planets and planetary system, it does take a little knowledge and research though.\n-You can download ridiculous workshop designs, from any sci-fi universe you can imagine. Walk around on those ships/stations and make them fully functional. I mean the game is the ultimate sci-fi playground.\n\nCons:\n-All cons I can think of are related to current Alpha, as in not enough desired features implemented yet (always want more and want them NOW...).  Though literally all those things can be realistically implemented with time, most of the systems are already in place just need polishing or are planned.\nFor example:\n- Only 1 solar system in game right now, want entire procedural galaxy\n- Don't have some basic items like shields or landing bay doors for cap ships\n- Want better AI, more AI, more aliens, friendly aliens, alien traders\n- Want a story, reason to build, reason to fight, reason to explore\n- Want more rare items (some epic non-craftable items just went in a few patches ago, want more stuff)\n- Need more convenience for tweaking game and running server, like better UI and more options type of deal for admins\n- Want research/science and so on.\n\nYou get the idea, all cons are pretty much planned to be eliminated. If you buy this game you're buying hundreds of hours of fun gameplay as is, plus thousands more promised (and IMHO can be delivered by this dev team judging by what I have seen since very early release on Steam).\n\n","May 10","true","522.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The second planet, although I have not tried it, claims to be harder. To start, you come down to the planet in an escape pod that you can slowly steer.

The only slight down side is running out of resources if you are not careful and not being able to get them back at all or without a great amount of effort. I got stuck on the moon because a drone blew up my crafts fuel tank. I had every I needed to craft a new one, but because my crafting station attacheted to my aircrafted was not powered I could not craft a new one. I ended up using console commands to teleport my ♥♥♥ back to the home planet.\n\nI would recommend the game designer allow you to build a emergy fuel tank and power source so you don't get stranded in the middle of no where.\n\nTo counter that one problem if you just have enough resources in the blueprint factory you can just spawn a whole new ship. A quick note on that is the reason why I got stuck in the middle of no where is because I spawned one of those. Their fuel tanks and power supplies are not well protected. I would not recommend flying a prebuilt ship to far away from base. It is a good idea to spawn one to get an idea of what or how you should build, but I would not recommend taking them into a fight or travel anywhere without first buffing up the defenses and changing some stuff. You can also save your custom built ship or any you built. So that is awesome right there. It is a pain to build ships in planets if you do not know what you are doing. Make sure you put boosters on the bottom so it can hover off the ground otherwise you willd not be able to build under it. There should be a rescipe for solar power panels. Running out of power sucks.\n\nEverything else is pretty alright. Shooting works, enemy strong holds to take over for loot/exp, and a good amount of guns and crafting options.\n\nI just wish I couldn't grind myself into a whole by accident or just get stuck in the middle of no where. It is important to mention if you are prepared enough you can fix up your broken ship. I just hope it doesn't get blown up.\n\nIf you like games like Grave, minecraft, and subnautic you might like this.

It definitley takes the cake when it comes to both creativity and uniqueness.  With its rather complex, but not totally overly complex crafting sytem it makes sense for seems to be a human in a masseffect era universe.  Graphics and rendering are still beautiful albite in what definately looks to be an alpha game.  This isn't bad at all, because while I traverse the vastness of space, I can see such beautiful scenes that make me what to snap them as a desktop background or even write a story.  Animals, enemies, and movine living things all are highly unique and while as of now still need some work on basic things link there hit box, or there method of attack, they are still very well-made.  I do hope to see further improvement which can range anywhere from big stuff like better gamepad compatability to the small stuff like a dinosaur getting stuck in a cave I made and then proceeding to block the way.\n\nThough would be projected far in the future, I would love to see a randomly generated world down to every rock and corn dog it is random.\n\nI would highly recomend this game to people who enjoy survival building games as it has many key elements you don't see in other games from this genre","May 15","true","60.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Obviously it draws similarities to Space Engineers but is strikingly different. While I never made it to space (which was a bummer) the game handled itself quite well. Only sour note was the remote drone you pilot for building is overly sensitive and wonky to control, a shame too since it would be so useful in building. Combat with hostile drones was a tense experience with only an AR and pistol (dont fight Missle Drones with a pistol) and them attacking the base even when your away always leaves a sense of worry. If you keep track of it hunger is no problem but keeps you focused on a sense of human need without being an overbearing issue. Hunting down and mining the ores you need is somewhat time consuming but doesnt feel redundantly so. I did like though how the terrain deformed against my mining.

I have an older GPU (AMD HD Radeon 7870 2GB RAM) and it used to run fine. Keep in mind that while I hope graphics optimizations occur, I think that at an end state this game will require some heavy duty graphics.

The crafting of vessels I have to say feels really polished these days. It has improved since pre-alpha. The survival aspect has also become more polished and believable since pre-alpha, since now you start out with crappier tools, and it is harder to aquire tier 2 weapons and tools.\n\nHere is a short list of things that make the game shine like a diamond:\n-the devs are responsive to feedback and listen to what the players want\n-I don't want to say this is Minecraft in space, although it does have a minecraft feel to it, so if you loved that game, you should love this one as well\n-plenty of weapons to arm yourself, your small ships or your large capital vessels with.\n-you get a great rewarding feeling after completing a build and actually getting to fly it around as transport, raid alien bases with it, and eventually lose it in an epic battle :)\n-The game is what you make of it. You can invent your own story and build your own mega base or star destroying hunk of metal.\n-the multiplayer is decently fun\n\nSome of the bad things:\n-I have lost many builds due to game ending bugs that cause me to have to wipe a save. If you are going to play the game you must blueprint everything you build often and be ready to start over from scratch. It's still in alpha.\n-Ever since they released the alpha the planets Masperon and Austus became much harder to survive on with drones everywhere and wildlife ready to sink their teeth into you. Not that this is a bad thing, but the graphics requirements of the game went up dramatically as well! So now a game that I used to be able to play on the fast graphics setting is now a game that only gets 6 to 7 frames per second on those planets, which makes them even harder. It's my fault since I didn't check the minimum graphics requirements before buying it, but its odd that they dramatically increased the punishing graphics on those planets.\n\nThe game is already great and it is still being developed. I probably won't play it much anymore until I get a computer that is dedicated to gaming (which could be a long time). However, in the mean time I will support the development of the game and could see something like this eventually coming to PS4 or Xbox.

Surprisingly stable and feature rich for a pre-alpha. If it's this good in pre-alpha, I cannot wait to see how good it gets upon release. At $17.99, it's a steal! I've paid $60 for less entertaining and fun games.\n\n----- EDIT---------\n\nOK... I've been playing it a lot and wanted to update my review.\n\nIt’s been said many times in these reviews, but Empyrion Galactic Survival is very much like Space Engineers with a little less engineering and a LOT more fun.\n\nI very much enjoyed Space Engineers but it didn’t take long to see that unless you played multiplayer pvp, you quickly ran out of things to do. No NPCS, no planets to explore, no real reason to continue unless you just want to expand your base. Empyrion fixes all of that and simplifies ship\station\base creation a bit by taking out the tedious bits while maintaining the sense of accomplishment that comes with crafting new gear. With strange alien worlds to explore, alien beasts to hunt for food, plants to gather, food, medicines and weapons to craft, crashed mother ships to loot, bases to build and ships to build and perfect it seems like there is ALWAYS something to do and some new goal to set.\n\nAs for multiplayer, my step-son and I managed to get a game going peer-to-peer and it really was surprising how well it ran at this early stage in development. Last time I tried multiplayer with Space Engineers it was a laggy mess with the net code being in serious need of attention. EGS, however, is showing great promise on this front. No dedicated server or simplified server\friends list yet, but playing in peer-to-peer mode was great with little to no lag and few bugs that we could see. We actually had a great deal of fun.\n\nIn short: This game is amazing. It really is incredible what they’ve managed to do with the Unity engine. I’m quite glad they utilized Steam’s early release program. The developer is very active and responsive to the community and responds to bugs and even some enhancement requests fairly quickly. They’ve even posted polls asking what players want to see be implemented from the road map next. They seem to be intent on crafting a game the players want to play. I have paid $60 for games I’ve gotten less entertainment and fun out of than Empyrion Galactic Survival. Get it now while it’s cheap! Support the development. If it’s THIS good in pre-alpha, I can’t wait to see how good it gets in Alpha and ultimately, release.","August 9, 2015","true","64.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game however is different.  I have already over 40 hours into the game and have enjoyed every minute of it.  This game can have a steep learning curve.  You have to manage resources very carefully at the beginning of the game.  Oxygen and Power are a must.  With out them you die,  and can never recover.  After the first couple of days, so long as your getting the things you need, you never really run out of resources.  I put in a method of mining during the day and doing all the other stuff at night.  I have so many resources now its not even funny. I don't find the constructor screen that annoying.  There are some glitches in the game, like falling through the planet when your mining, and silicon looks soo much like rock that it is hard to mine sometimes.  The building of your ships is a little problematic right now, because you can't access the bottom of your ship until you put everything on and hover it.  The is a max speed that you can not go over, no matter how many accelerators you put on it.  Ship to shp combat in space can be a little troublesome some times.  Even with all the issues, Remember that it is still early access and it was just released not too long ago on steam.  I am hoping the develepers stay with it and put everything on their roadmap into the game.  I think they have a jewel here, just needs to be polished a little.  If there are any gamers out there looking for some multiplayer action of team work and are good people hit me up.","August 15, 2015","true","212.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

I've tried some others but they were more tehnical, had less possibilities or looked too "candy" but at the end, what counts is the gameplay and Empyrion offers a plenty of that. There are more than enough places and planets to visit and to conquer, aliens/drones/animals attacks to survive and what you may build is only limited by your fantasy. Specially in the case of building ships, Empyrion glances with the perfect amount of blocks and possibilities, not too much to be confusing and not too few to be insufficient. Another aspect which works better than in concurrent products is the controllability, in some other games walking on planets is like floating in space but with an obstacle beneath you - that's not the case here, everything is smooth and quite realistic.

Before I would not have recommended the game but it has matured very well in a short time frame. Now the game keeps getting into better shape and additions are coming at the expected pace which is very fast compared to the empty promises of almost all other early access games. I say expected pace, don't take that as a neg. All early access games promise to develop at this pace and I say again nearly all early access games don't deliver. Cannot point that out enough.\n\nTo put a review of this game short, it's Space Engineers with less focus on pure building and more focus on a playable survival mode where you gather resources, manage your own life support, and attempt to build and thrive in a hostile environment. Basically the stuff that is missing in Space Engineers that makes it a boring sandbox, this game focuses on that stuff. And it's still a great building, station, and ship builder much like Space Engineers with lots of possibilities. For anyone who hasn't played Space Engineers but have at least played Minecraft this is like a sci-fi version of Minecraft, except the world isn't blocky and instead looks much more natural and it is based in sci-fi instead of medieval quasi-magic-whatever. A key difference is in this game you can make functional vehicles out of blocks, vehicles with weapons to boot.\n\nAnother important aspect for any gamer out there is the ability to fly from space to a planet and have a large map for said planet and move around on the planet with freedom. Not many games achieve this. In fact as I type this review all I can think of honestly is Universal Combat, that game also allows you to fly, swim, walk, or ride across the landscape as you will and transition into space and go to other planets. Empyrion is nothing like Universal Combat in any way except in sharing a sci-fi vibe and the planet to space transition, but I got the point across. This sort of transition has been the goal of gamers and devs since at least 2000 if not prior. Empyrion does it. So far you only have the one system to stay in with a few planets and some stuff in space, supposedly we are going to get randomly generated systems in the future which would be great. As it sits now there are finite resources in the entire system, once out they are out. Do not fret though, there is more than plenty enough resources sitting around to make a lot of stuff with. I mean a lot, it's not likely you will dry up the entire system currently in the game.\n\nAnd do not freak out about the Prometheum fuel, yes everything you do pretty much uses up energy and the only form of energy is an ore that will dry up on you. The past update Prometheum was made more abundant and lots of people keep talking about adding solar panels for long-term low power draw purposes like simply running water pumps, oxygen pumps, and grow lights for plants so you can survive and explore safely without constantly drawing on a finite fuel supply. Cannot say it enough, once you get to the first moon or another planet you will realise there is a lot of Prometheum and it's not really a worry, you will be bored long before you truly have a hard time getting fuel.\n\nDevs have shown good support for a while and I am a hard person to please when it comes to early access, I'm one of those who are still upset about Starbound and have been of the opinion for a long while that overall early access is a failure. Empyrion and a very few other games do early access right. It's a blend of Minecraft survival, Space Engineers construction, and sci-fi combat against aliens and creatures on land and in space. Would I recommend this game? Yeah, it's under $20 and keeps getting better.","October 1, 2015","true","17.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This game does seem well thought out. There are many diverse types of plants, planet terrains/environments, and the survival aspect is well thought out, needing to eat, sleep and stay hydrated. There are many different weapons to choose from, a lot of food options (space pizza anyone?), NPCs , and lots of construction options.\n\nThat being said, it took me a good 20 minutes to even start playing, due to my world name. There is no check for illegal filename characters when creating a new save, and my save title just happened to have a colon in it. Rather than give me a simple warning about my filename, I ended up getting "Internal Error Occured".\n\nOnce I got that worked out, I joined a game a few of my friends hosted. The best FPS I could achieve was about 15, on the lowest quality setting. When we started exploring new bases we all ended up dropping to 1-5, resulting in a major migraine. There was also a lot of rubberbanding, but that could just be due to the game hosts being in NL and myself in the US. I also found the very low quality skybox to be somewhat depressing. I can't see it being playable at all in a large-scale populated server in its current state. Planets/moons were also way too unrealisticly close to eachother. Does gravity even exist yet?\n\nI will go ahead and recommend this game. Content and gameplay wise it does look good, but performance is subpar for the time being. I will give this game a little more time to bake before I dedicate time and resources to it.\n\n~Vl4dim1r, Extra-Terrestrial Technologies","August 9, 2015","true","26.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/383120/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1508 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival is not only an 3D open-world game, it is in fact a multiple open-worlds game! After surviving a crash landing on your choice of two planets (initial difficulty choice), you must find some way to survive. With each world being procedurally generated based on the selected seed, you will always be able to start fresh on a new unknown world.\n\nGameplay\nCurrently just freshly entering Alpha, this game already has a lot to offer. You are able to explore the surface of the planet you are on. During your adventure you will find resources you can harvest, alien structures to explore and creatures of all shapes and sizes freely roaming around. This is all very visually appealing. The hospitable world looks lush and vibrant; the dessert planet looks desolate and inhospitable and these are just your two starting planets. Once you manage to cobble together a capital ship, you will be able to blast off and visit other worlds. The most notable of the additional planets is a lava covered volcanic planet. You definitely don’t want to go swimming there!\n\nSpeaking of swimming, you are able to enter the water in this game for even further exploration. So long as you are wearing your helmet you will be able to stay down until you run out of oxygen. Here you can harvest blue crystals and plants, both of which are very useful to your survival. Once you are finished exploring the surface and underwater, you will want to start exploring underground.\n\nUnderground is where you will find the majority of your useful materials. Luckily, unlike a certain popular procedurally generated diamond hunting simulator, as you explore the surface, your scanner will notify you of any mineral deposits located beneath the surface. Hopefully you will find some iron fairly quickly because iron is going to be your main resource for a while. Other deposits are quite useful too, but you will likely want to set up your first base near a nice lake and an iron deposit.\n\nBase building is something I always enjoy. Being able to shape anything you want out of the elements given is always fun. You are not limited to just building a base in this game though, you can actually build yourself three types of vehicles too! The first being kind of like a hover car is better than walking. It allows you to get around much faster so long as you are crossing even terrain. The small aircraft is my vehicle of choice for planetary surveys. Unlike the hover vehicle, you are not limited to the surface so mountains and potholes can’t stop you. You can even take it out to orbit if you are so inclined, but you really can’t get anywhere in space with it. The last kind of ship is very much like the aircraft I just mentioned except this one is much bigger. While my design could land on a planet and take off again, it burned through fuel like crazy. Luckily in orbit of my home planet, I built myself a nice space base. That’s right, you are not limited to just building on a planet! My small vehicle, as it is called in game, flies between the surface and my space base. It lands in the hanger I built into my large capital ship. The capital ship itself is like a mobile base. It can do everything my planetary base and my orbital space base can do. I can fabricate, refine and grow anything I need. The only thing my planetary base can do that my space base and capital ship can’t do is harvest water and oxygen. Luckily I have massive oxygen and water storage capacity on my ship and space base.\n\nNow why do I even want a mobile manufactory? The reason for that is quite simple! Space is vast. You are not limited to just one planet or one solar system in this game. There are multiple systems already available in this game. The warp drive found on my capital ship takes me and my small vehicle hitchhiking though the galaxy. It’s admittedly kind of a pain to have to build a new base on every single planet you land on so having my capital ship being capable of doing all the refining and manufacturing saves me time. I just take my small vehicle down to the surface of the planet; fly around until I find useful alien buildings, crashed ships or unique resources and then land. After I steal everything that isn’t bolted down, I just fly back up to my capital ship to head off on a new trek through the galaxy.\n\nSadly, space is very, very lonely. Even though you find friendly aliens and creatures, none of them talk to you or help you in any way. Sure shooting them or hacking them up with a chainsaw gives you some supplies, but that is about as much interaction as they are willing to do. Luckily, this game supports multiplayer! Now when you venture off into space you will find other people willing to co-operatively play with you… or willing to kill you and take everything you have for their own. Multiplayer is probably where this game will shine down the road. Exploring in single player will eventually make you realize that no matter how cool you make your base or ship look… you are only doing it to impress yourself or anyone who happens to take a look at your screenshots…. Well that’s not entirely true either! This game already supports Steam Workshop! There are plenty of player made blueprints available right now for those of you who are not creative enough or patient enough to build something yourself, or alternatively, you can share your awesomeness with the world.\n\nThe game currently offers both Creative Mode and Survival Mode. Creative, as you might have guessed, gives you full access to everything the game offers right off the bat. You don’t even have to take a single step before you have built your very first capital ship. Survival is where the real fun of the game comes in. You have to scavenge, harvest and mine for everything. Your food and oxygen levels need to be maintained as well. Depending on which world you start in, you might be able to breathe the atmosphere so you can survive without your helmet on. On another world, you will suffocate quickly if you don’t swiftly set yourself up an oxygen reclamation plant. Hunger will always nag at you. You will need to hunt the creatures of the world you are on and hope you can cook their meat into something edible. If you are a vegan, you can also just live off the plants that are scattered around too. You will eventually be able to farm for your own food if you are so inclined. The last stat that drops is health. If you fall too far, run into violent creatures or eat something that doesn’t agree with you, your health will fall. If it hits zero you will die and drop all the stuff you are carrying. You are given the option to respawn near to where you died in the hopes of reclaiming your backpack, or you can respawn at your base if you have a cloning chamber installed. You will have to manually find and build everything you want, or at least collect everything you need to build the blueprint you have.\n\nUnlike most games in Early Access or that are in the Alpha phase, Empyrion is already full featured and well-polished with minimal bugs. There is already a tutorial in the game that optionally holds your hand by guiding you on what you should do next until you have built your very first base and vehicle.\n\nPros:Despite being in Early Access and in Alpha, it already has fairly solid gameplay. Many features are already present\nVibrant looking landscapes that are procedurally generated make each world look unique even if you are replaying the game\nComprehensive tutorial that lets you figure things out on your own with the option for it to spell it out to you if you are stuck\n\nCons:\nSome glitches do occur, but this is forgivable due to the Alpha status\nGravity is weird! You can sometimes defy gravity if you turn off the power to your ship\nHover vehicle is kind of useless as it tends to easily get stuck. The small vehicle costs pretty much the same to make and can fly","April 17","true","15.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

Very solid game at the time of me writing this review, haven't encountered many bugs and the game itself, even being a "pre-alpha", is still a game with a lot of content. Try the game, you'll probably like it. You get to build stuff and survive, the game has a good way of leveling it self ,so to speak, so you don't do everything in the first few hours. At the time of writing this review, I have barely scratched the surface of this game, a pre-alpha. The devs are ontop of development on this game, the game is likely to grow and quickly, especially when compared with other Early Access games. Only real con is that at the time of writing this, you will want to run the game on good or fast if you start making a base with a lot of lights, if you run it at the highest graphics, the game will lag IF you have a base with a boatload of lights.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReaperEvolved/recommended/383120/","ReaperEvolved","ReaperEvolved","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReaperEvolved/","221 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe following is copied from my review on http://pressa2join.com\nThis preview is for an "as yet unreleased early access title"\n\n[Disclosure: Game copy supplied by Developer]\n\nEmpyrion – Galactic Survival is a 3D open world, space survival adventure game with construction and shooter elements. Published and developed by Eleon Game Studios, Empyrion is currently in Early Access on Steam.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you find yourself stranded in an alien world beside your crash landed escape pod. Your first task is to build a hovercraft, thankfully there are some essential materials stored in your pod. This however will only get you so far, as you are running low on food and oxygen you will have to build an oxygen generator and scavenge the local flora and fauna for food. Players will eventually be able to build a base and either repair the crashed escape pod or build a new one of their own design (probably with a weapon or two). There is also the option to leave the atmosphere and explore the different local planets and from there build the capital vessel.\n\nFlora and fauna are numerous and planet specific (some resources/ores are also planet specific). Meaning the player will have to explore the various different planets in order to obtain the resources they require to build the more advanced items. As with most survival games there are a number of passive and aggressive creatures as well as a seemingly cybernetic race in the form of the drones and turret emplacements. The player will be provided with meat and healing items from the animals, various food from plants and crafting resources from the drones and turret towers, to add a decent reward to the risk of taking on a tower, the player will usually find some difficult while also expensive to craft items inside.\n\nDespite being in pre-alpha as mentioned earlier, the gameplay is solid but understandably restricted. The crafting system is surprisingly well structured and fleshed out. However it should be noted many of the recipes are likely to change, with some recipes feeling a little bit over powered, this is likely to give players a feel for the game before perhaps a more complicated system is introduced. You are given a full set of tools that will aid you in your endeavours which are: a mining tool, remove & repair tool, a filler & flatten tool and of course everyone’s favourite, the colour tool.\n\nYou can also construct a number of extremely useful and often essential devices that will allow access to more advanced crafting materials which will in turn lead to more advanced blocks and machinery. Unlike most survival games there does not appear to be tiered tools, it is unknown whether this will change, however there are tiered weapons. There is a substantial farming mechanic in which the player can plant seeds and grow various plants which may also be expanded.\n\nI had a different number of weapons to choose with machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles and even the futuristic pulse and laser rifles. The choice is similar when it comes to the weaponry for vehicles, there is a choice between standard mounted weapons, versus turrets for larger bases and a spacecraft. Whilst certain weapons such as the rocket launcher are a little bit buggy they, for the most part work perfectly fine. The enemy drones and emplacements have of course access to the same, if not better technology so care should be taken when assembling the different vehicles in order to protect the various modules such as weaponry, engines or indeed the “core” which, if destroyed will disable the vehicle. One thing worth noting is currently vehicle and turret weaponry does not use ammunition, which will be changed in a later update. Speaking of ammo, the ammo for the tools I was able to use is a little on the expensive side, care should be taken to not waste it too much.\n\nOf course being in Alpha there are the occasional bugs. In my playthrough I didn’t notice very many, but the bugs I experienced included falling through the world infinitely, which was fixed by exiting and reloading. A strange bug that caused my first small vessel to glitch and not allow any further blocks to be placed on it nor allow the use of the removal tool, this may be part of the known core-block issue, a reload however fixed this and lastly a bug that causes the game to crash upon exiting. However obviously being a pre-alpha these issues are to be expected. It’s worth noting that other players are reporting a number of different issues that I have not experienced.\n\nOnce I got into the game a bit more I discovered that the mechanics and gameplay that currently exist are extremely fun. This is obviously where the developers have implemented most their time. I found I barely noticed the lack of graphical fidelity due to this which more than compensated for the said lack of graphics. Obviously being so early in development the developer may improve the graphics further down the line. The soundtrack that is provided is again because of early development but quite basic, but works well. The machines purr nicely in the background, the music is good and unobtrusive.\n\nOverall, whilst this isn’t my first ever pre-alpha game that I’ve played it is definitely the first I’ve properly reviewed. I must say I’m exceedingly impressed with how stable the game is as well as how extensive the crafting and building mechanics are. Whilst there is a wiki and tutorial provided there is currently no in-game tutorial beyond a few help messages that sometimes appear. Of course as this is a pre-alpha there is noticeably more work needing to be done on this title than any other that I have currently reviewed. All being said I have no qualms about recommending this title. Especially if you have enjoyed titles such as Space engineers or one of the many other similarly themed games.\n\nStill very early in development, but defiantly one to keep an eye on.","August 26, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that you can just exit and enter planets feel so great. Almost every mechanic seems stable so far. There is the infinite ammo glitch on small ships (SV) and the fact that alien Base turrets still attack you even though you've shot down their power supply? (unless they run off their own power but im not so sure} Hopefuly the devs can finish the gamebased off what was promised *Cough* Starforge* Cough* because if they do finish they may actually take the space survival genre by storm!","August 28, 2015","true","77.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no real end game content at the moment apparently, as it is in early access, but once procedural planets are implemented, there will be a tonne to explore.\n\nThe crafting is simple, but very well done. There is none of the very deep crafting of for example Space Engineers, but it benefits from giving us a more complete survival game at this early stage. The game is well balanced, and gives you time to enjoy the pace and pressure of gathering and building without being neurotic about your oxygen, water, food and so on.\n\nI can't wait for procedural planets, but apprehensive as to how it is implemented and what there will be left to do past 20 hours gameplay.\n","August 29, 2015","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rated almost 5 stars, and justly deserving.\n\nFor a Pre-Alpha game this lil gem is just that, a gem.  After reading the reviews I figured I would go for it, and I'm so glad I did.   The building is in-depth and fun.  Planning of resources, expanding, and exploring a hostile alien environment... all with the knowledge you have to survive with the small amount of resources you have, in your now crash-landed escape pod.

There is also the option to leave the atmosphere and explore the different local planets and from there build the capital vessel.\n\nFlora and fauna are numerous and planet specific (some resources/ores are also planet specific). Meaning the player will have to explore the various different planets in order to obtain the resources they require to build the more advanced items. As with most survival games there are a number of passive and aggressive creatures as well as a seemingly cybernetic race in the form of the drones and turret emplacements. The player will be provided with meat and healing items from the animals, various food from plants and crafting resources from the drones and turret towers, to add a decent reward to the risk of taking on a tower, the player will usually find some difficult while also expensive to craft items inside.\n\nDespite being in pre-alpha as mentioned earlier, the gameplay is solid but understandably restricted. The crafting system is surprisingly well structured and fleshed out. However it should be noted many of the recipes are likely to change, with some recipes feeling a little bit over powered, this is likely to give players a feel for the game before perhaps a more complicated system is introduced. You are given a full set of tools that will aid you in your endeavours which are: a mining tool, remove & repair tool, a filler & flatten tool and of course everyone’s favourite, the colour tool.\n\nYou can also construct a number of extremely useful and often essential devices that will allow access to more advanced crafting materials which will in turn lead to more advanced blocks and machinery. Unlike most survival games there does not appear to be tiered tools, it is unknown whether this will change, however there are tiered weapons. There is a substantial farming mechanic in which the player can plant seeds and grow various plants which may also be expanded.\n\nI had a different number of weapons to choose with machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles and even the futuristic pulse and laser rifles. The choice is similar when it comes to the weaponry for vehicles, there is a choice between standard mounted weapons, versus turrets for larger bases and a spacecraft. Whilst certain weapons such as the rocket launcher are a little bit buggy they, for the most part work perfectly fine. The enemy drones and emplacements have of course access to the same, if not better technology so care should be taken when assembling the different vehicles in order to protect the various modules such as weaponry, engines or indeed the “core” which, if destroyed will disable the vehicle. One thing worth noting is currently vehicle and turret weaponry does not use ammunition, which will be changed in a later update. Speaking of ammo, the ammo for the tools I was able to use is a little on the expensive side, care should be taken to not waste it too much.\n\nOf course being in Alpha there are the occasional bugs. In my playthrough I didn’t notice very many, but the bugs I experienced included falling through the world infinitely, which was fixed by exiting and reloading. A strange bug that caused my first small vessel to glitch and not allow any further blocks to be placed on it nor allow the use of the removal tool, this may be part of the known core-block issue, a reload however fixed this and lastly a bug that causes the game to crash upon exiting. However obviously being a pre-alpha these issues are to be expected. It’s worth noting that other players are reporting a number of different issues that I have not experienced.\n\nOnce I got into the game a bit more I discovered that the mechanics and gameplay that currently exist are extremely fun. This is obviously where the developers have implemented most their time. I found I barely noticed the lack of graphical fidelity due to this which more than compensated for the said lack of graphics. Obviously being so early in development the developer may improve the graphics further down the line. The soundtrack that is provided is again because of early development but quite basic, but works well. The machines purr nicely in the background, the music is good and unobtrusive.\n\nOverall, whilst this isn’t my first ever pre-alpha game that I’ve played it is definitely the first I’ve properly reviewed. I must say I’m exceedingly impressed with how stable the game is as well as how extensive the crafting and building mechanics are. Whilst there is a wiki and tutorial provided there is currently no in-game tutorial beyond a few help messages that sometimes appear. Of course as this is a pre-alpha there is noticeably more work needing to be done on this title than any other that I have currently reviewed. All being said I have no qualms about recommending this title. Especially if you have enjoyed titles such as Space engineers or one of the many other similarly themed games.\n\nStill very early in development, but defiantly one to keep an eye on.","August 26, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no real end game content at the moment apparently, as it is in early access, but once procedural planets are implemented, there will be a tonne to explore.\n\nThe crafting is simple, but very well done. There is none of the very deep crafting of for example Space Engineers, but it benefits from giving us a more complete survival game at this early stage. The game is well balanced, and gives you time to enjoy the pace and pressure of gathering and building without being neurotic about your oxygen, water, food and so on.\n\nI can't wait for procedural planets, but apprehensive as to how it is implemented and what there will be left to do past 20 hours gameplay.\n","August 29, 2015","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has all the great building aspects of SE but with this additional gameplay, which includes 4 planets to explore, as well as a lot of asteroids, enemy ships, turrets, drones and bases to fight and loot, it has more staying power over SE. Its also only in pre alpha stage and its already great. This game has a ton of potential and will only get even better with time. Highly reccomended, also try playing it with some friends, although setting that up requires you to use logmeinHamachi. If you can get it working its worth it.

My friend and I played this for hours and hours making stupid ships and killing anything in our path.\npersonally i would always back up your saves, because for me when i was in coop  i got stuck in the blocks  on my friends ship after leaving the passengers seat which, when  i quit, an error message popped up after leaving the game. I tried to load back my saved game and it wouldnt work, I kept on trying to load on the loading screen. so the time building stuff went to waste.\nthe price for the game is a steal on what your getting with pre-alpha if your thinking of getting it! i'd get it now while its cheap.\ngreat game and great concept. i'm so looking forward for future updates with this game. well done dev's\n","August 12, 2015","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is still in Early Acess, but its a working EA.  I haven't encountered too many game breaking bugs.  Only a few placement bugs where I had to get creative, or actually go into space to fix.  Also, per this build review, there are only 4 planets to explore and an asteroid field. (Unless I missed some way of getting to another solar system, EA game's are hard to google any useful information about.) But the game works, and its easy to learn and play.\n\nStarting in an escape pod, to the first base, into a ship, then that first flight out into space = well worth the price.  And I see they are still expanding, so lets hope the Devs stay with it, and/or at least give us a full universe.  I haven't tried playing with other people yet, but with such a small solar system to start with, it's a bit of a mute point.  Overall, if they continue development, this game will be amazing.

This game runs great when you can just chill build cool things and explore tell your heart is content.  It could be nice if we could make a self suffient structure.  Survival games that incorporate huge open worlds and then multiple worlds to cover to me seems like the future of most survival games.

I took my time reading up on the game and fully understand that it is in pre-alpha.\n\nAfter an hour of playing I had built my first hub base. This was meant to be a temporary place to survive the night. But after a lot of constructing it has become my home. It now has a landing pad which has my first ship on. Which if you look at my screenshots you can see.\n\nI have not spent a lot of time in space due to not putting enough fuel packs into the ships (Noob Mistake but I was so excited) But space looks cool.\n\nWord of warning watch the towers I lost my ground vessel to one of them due to a mistake I made.\n\nSo in short this game is really good so I would recommend it to anyone that is wanting to be a part of a new thing.

The recent addition of procedural planets was great, and I expect great things from this game in the future. It already had a lot of fun content. I have 88 hours in the game so far and expect many more in the future.\n\nThe game gets stale in single player after a while due to its unfinished state (random planets helped a lot with this, since new games have different terrain and different points of interest) but playing with buddies is a lot of fun. I was playing with a random guy I met the other day and we had a blast for hours.\n\nHere is a sample of a few hours of random coop gameplay: At first we set up a little base and repaired the escape pod, adding a passenger seat. Then we made some guns and flew around exploring the planet, assaulting alien bases on foot with assault rifles and rocket launchers and stuff. Then with the loot from those we made enough parts to assemble a couple of small agile fighter craft, and flew into space with our pod. At that point it was getting late so we stopped playing. The next day we played we assembled our ships (two totally different designs, we each made our own) and went off to kill the space drones and take the asteroid base. The two of us made short work of all the space drones. Then we went after the other big base with tons of guns. We managed to take out all the guns from one side of it and get aboard, then explored the station - shooting the turrets with our personal guns. Soon we had captured it and collected all the stuff from it, and using parts from the base modified our fighters a bit. Then we armed up to the teeth and had a war. I had the advantage since I was hosting (my ship was better too imo, but he insisted it was all because I was hosting lol) and I managed to wreck his. But when I flew up to pick him up he shot out my fuel tank with his handheld rocket launcher. So then we were both stranded way out in space, and decided to call it a day again. We still hadn't explored the first planet fully or explored any of the others in that game.\n\nThe positives:\nProcedural generation. They are still building on this, but the initial pass of making planets procedural is nice - the solar system is currently still set with a lava, desert, temperate, ice, lifeless moon, and asteroid field. Soon it will be a larger system with more planets, and eventually a procedural galaxy full of systems.\n\nNice survival core. You have a constant need for food, but it's not so quick that it gets tedious. You can satisfy it with hunting, gathering, or farming. And you can preserve extra food with refrigerators, or just making long lasting food (canned food lasts for about 6 real life hours, or emergency rations that don't spoil at all). You also need o2. Starting temperate planet is breathable, but space and other planet types require you to collect o2 and keep your meter filled. All planets have o2 you can collect, you just need a generator placed in the right spot and powered. And all your stuff needs fuel, so you have to find promethium ore either via mining or looting aliens.\n\nVarious alien wildlife on all planets except the moon, hostile and docile, as well as hostile alien drones everywhere (even in space). These can keep you on your toes. My first night in the new temperate planet had a swarm of plant monsters roam in on me, before I had built better weapons. So I had to run around shooting them with my pistol and almost ran out of ammo there were so many of them. I have had alien drones come up on me while mining and not paying attention, and blow out my fuel tank on my hover vehicle (which exploded and blew up a thruster too). Leaving me to walk all the way back to my base, construct a new fuel tank, thruster, and more fuel; and walk back to repair it (now I always armor them and carry basic spare parts, haha). And trying to mine on the lava world can be a dangerous prospect, with the dangerous and very aggressive wildlife and large number of drones.\n\nGrowing variety of points of interest to explore and loot. Crashed ships, alien gun towers, complex alien bases. They keep adding more of these, most of which are made by the community. Finding a crashed ship to scavenge can provide a lot of parts to build your own ships, as can looting the alien structures. Currently no aliens actually inhabit the bases, but I believe that's planned for the future.\n\nCrafting is very complex and satisfying. You gather raw resources, refine them into ingots, turn those into components, and turn those into blocks that you can place -  bases, hover vehicles, small vessels, and capital vessels. Putting together your first functional hover vehicle at the start and skimming around the planet exploring is just satisfying, as is taking your first small vessel into space and onto other planets.\n\nThe Negatives:\n\nCrafting can be a bit overwhelming. You have to craft the components (mechanical parts, electronics, reactor cores, etc) before you craft the main parts (small reactor, fuel tank). If you can't do math in your head quickly you may find crafting tedious, since it would then be hard to queue everything up. I expect they will eventually change the UI here a bit to show what's needed to produce the stuff you have queued up instead of it just canceling the job when the item doesn't have parts available. Definitely needs work, but I personally don't find it bad. The latest update improved the UI here a lot simply by improving the look of the windows (more stuff displayed at once, less scrolling required).\n\nSave system. You can't make multiple saves from within a game, you have to exit the current save and make backups of it if you want a separate save. -Edit 9/8/15- They just addressed the main issue with the save system, now you can do manual saves in game without having to exit.\n\nMultiplayer is currently limited to coop, as dedicated servers aren't ready yet. This comes with several limitations, like being unable to move between planets unless you're together. But this is just because the game is pre-alpha, dedicated servers are planned for the alpha.\n\nGame is a bit easy as it stands once you learn it. Alien turrets can be dodged and shot down if you have any FPS experience, and wildlife is easy to take out before it hurts you if you see it coming as long as you are prepared (well armed). This is kind of expected in an early alpha though, we'll just have to see what comes in future updates to up the difficulty (larger, more dangerous wildlife and dangerous alien threats occupying some of the bases would be nice).\n\nOverall:\nIt's a pre-alpha game and is missing many of the planned features, but is already a fun game. I would say if you like this sort of game and don't mind a game in a state of flux (early access, rapid changes), buy it. You'll get at least a few hours of fun from it right now, and more to come as the updates roll in. Is there a risk buying early access games? Sure. But the devs are doing pretty good listening to their fans so far, and as-is I feel I have already gotten my moneys worth out of the game.\n\nIf you don't like early access or playing games that are constantly changing, wait for a later release. Alpha release is set to have larger planets, a larger system with more planets, and dedicated multiplayer without the current limitations. Eventually it will have an entire procedural galaxy and lots more to do. The price is also planned to go up (but then again if you wait long enough I'm sure there would eventually be a sale).","September 5, 2015","true","205.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From other comments I've read, the Developers seem to take the user's view points into account as they shape and refine this game.  If you just want to hit my highlights then skip to the bottom section of my review.  Otherwise I'll share with you my experiences in playing this for over 18 hours straight not counting a couple of hours when I first purchased it.  All of my adventures take place on the Easier planet (with oxygen).\n\nI read part of the recommended starting guide just to get a few basics down, and then jumped right in.  Following the guides advice, I started flattening a piece of ground near a body of water.  I then started building a base.  Along the way, about 2 hours into the game I ran out of ammo for the Flattening tool.  I couldn't find anyplace online that mentioned how to make more ammo, and due to where I had started my base, I really needed to flatten more terrain.  I took a break, did some errands and came back to the computer several hours later.  I still hadn't found any place online that actually told me what ingredients were needed to replace the ammo, so I started a new game.  I did much better on this second one, and found by accident after leveling up my tech tree that at level 3 I could make new flatten tools, which also gave me the ability to make the ammo!!\n\nI played for 5-6 hours, building up my new base but I ran out of iron from my original starting alotment.  I hadn't found any iron deposits yet, so I started raiding the broken Titus ship of useful parts.  I stocked up on first aid, food, and ammo, and went on walk about in a large circular pattern both looking for iron, and also missing parts of the ship.  I found both on my adventure, and was on my last leg back towards my base when I got swarmed by several drones, and dropped troops at the last part of the downed ship.  I managed to escape with my health below half and out of needed medical supplies.  I was swimming across a small sea when I started taking damage from a drone that for some reason had spotted me.  He killed me by following me underwater.  No big deal I thought, I just restarted from near my dead body, but of course when you restart, you don't have any weapons on you, and I couldn't figure out how to swim down to collect my box of gear before that drone killed me again.  Right after this I did a quick search and found out online that by holding the "C" key down, you could swim down, but before I could restart again, my computer crashed, and it was 30 minutes between my last death and being able to log back in again and start another run at it.  By that time my gear box had disappeared completely!!!  All that work on my walk about was down the drain!!!  So I started a new game.\n\nThis 3rd attempt I didn't start building a new base right away.  I went exploring right from the beginning.  I spent two nights in game without a base.  There are plant like creatures that will attack you at night, even on the nicer planet that I have been playing on.  So I found that by staying in deeper water, they won't attack you, and currently (thankfully) there are no sea creatures to attack you while you are in the water (not including drones).  During the night hours when I couldn't see much I read a book while the time passed me by until it was daylight enough to see to continue my exploring.  The start of the 3rd day I found a nice spot within sighting distance of two manmade structures, as well as two nice fuel ore deposits.  Due to being closer to the obvious structures, I was attacked early on by drones, so I build up my defenses.  Sadly sometimes the auto cannon doesn't engage the drones even when they are shooting at me.  I died once while I was busy building something in the large factory.  When I came back to collect my gear then the auto turrent started shooting at the drones!  This time around I built a hover vehicle and mounted a mini gun on it.  I then made a backup of my game before heading out to explore.  I was glad I had because of the following...  Shortly after checking out the first structure in sight, it turned out to be a Epsilon Defense station.  What sucked was while the turret could should at me, I couldn't gain access to the structure.  I parked my HV just out of sight of the turret, and dashed in under the guns to get to the door, but it wouldn't open for me.  So I took out my repair and removal tool to remove the door and got the message on my screen saying that either this was a different faction or there wasn't a core installed.  Needless to say I couldn't even break down a wall to get inside!   So I dashed back to my HV and went exploring the other structure.  At this structure I came under fire from Drones, and shortly there after troops!  I died.  My HV was still firing away at the drones, but my cockpit had been destroyed and so I couldn't drive the HV and died again just as I jumped up into the spot my cockpit used to be in!  So I restarted from my back up.\n\nI went again to the 2nd structure, just long enough to ping the POI (Point of Interest) and then followed the troop transport back the way it had come.  There I found a Drone base and proceeded to kill several drones before again getting my cockpit destroyed and killing me.  I restarted near my body, collected my gear and assaulted the drone base.  I had several higher powered plasma cannons that I had to dodge on my way in.  Once I made it to the outer wall I noticed a troop transport ship sitting on the ready pad and thought to myself, I wonder if I can steal that ship!!  So I proceeded to infiltrate the base, only to be killed right off by the automatic turrets again!!  At this point my gear was unrecoverable, so I restarted from my back up.  Having twice now have my cockpit destroyed while the rest of my ship fought on without me, I made armor covers for my cockpit out of HV walls.  I also added two more mini guns to my design.  Like the base, for some reason the guns don't always fire, even when the drone is right in front of the guns and I'm taking fire from them.  With this added armor, and firepower, I took on the drones and troops at the ship part.  I wiped them out, as well as the additional drones that came at me.  Between waves of drones, I would hop out of the HV, and repair my ship of any damage to increase my ability to survive, and also explore the various parts of the ship, salvaging as I went.  I kept my ship active as a mobile gun platform while I explored the ship, keeping an eye out for more troops.  I have salvaged all the various component parts (computers, science stations, medical stations and engines) for their interesting components.  Due to what I was able to salvage, I can now build rocket defenses at my base.  I had been missing a key element that I have so far been unable to find in it's ore stage.  This is where I am at now.  I haven't been able to get back to playing it yet as I had to drive 10 hours yesterday, but anticipate playing it again tomorrow.  So my summary is this:\n\nIf you can't find a recipe for some ammo type, look in your tech tree.  If you can eventually build it, then the ammo recipe will come with the tool recipe.\n\nJust as drones can come after you in water, you can shoot at them from under the water as well (at least so far using guns)\n\nThe landscape will sometimes go Glitchy and you will fall through the ground.  For me it was usually after I placed lights outside on the ground and then walked near them.  But I found that as I was falling, I would just hit escape key, and then resume game and all would be well again.\n\nNot sure why in a single player game you can't access bases, yet the base can still shoot at you.  Seems unfair, but maybe this is just a glitch?\n\nAutomated defenses don't always shoot at the enemies, even when those enemies are shooting at you!  Glitch or ?\n\nI guess there is a character limit to my review :*(","December 11, 2015","true","146.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lpxGamer/recommended/383120/","lpxGamer","GreenGamingFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lpxGamer/","24 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a very good start. A lot of games don't have this much development after a month of Early Access. Of course the term is meaningless, it's indie marketing for, “give me money now!”, but I digress... I hear that one guy complaining about how it's the best way for poor indies to make games and it supports a growing market. I'd say niche market but whatever... I'm an AAA fan but the indie is growing on me. Ah yes, review... right...\n\nIt clones certain aspects of Space Engineers fairly well, though I haven't gotten to the space game on my own yet, it plays nice. The main difference I've noticed is that there is something like a plot. (Well, other than actually having planets!) The classic crashed [escape pod] story. Space Engineers fails at any real story but then again it's highly [in world modifiable] and has a scenario system. It'll be very interesting to see the two develop side-by-side.\n\nThe atmosphere is good and the look was OK. It didn't really make me go wow... which can be a downside to many games like this. The graphics are, and should be, very basic and improve over time. But unless the developer saves the big REAL graphics update for last we never get that big WOW factor when discovering a beautiful game for the first time. It just kinda grows into it rather than hitting you hard with visual candy. Graphics don't make games though.\n\nI don't think you can get FPS type controls wrong without the gaming community locking a middle finger on you, then quickly turning the other way. This game is good in the First Person, lacks a little in the third person on foot, but works pretty well in vehicle mode. At least you can tell that kinda thing in 2 hours and get your monies back if it's a big deal. It is pretty cheap considering that there are hours of exploration, stuff to kill, and the ability to craft your tools, bases (both ground and orbital), ground vehicles(hover craft, no wheels... yet?), and ships both large and small.\n\nThe thing I don't like, and it maybe just most games like this, is the crafting. Bare with me, I want to point you to an [example: Fantasy Life]... OK, there's that one guy who can't let a person finish complaining again. I know it's apples and oranges but it's more for the sake of a stale mechanic... just let me finish. Fantasy Life, on the 3DS, has a very engaging crafting system (look it up on youtube if you haven't played or will never). You move from station to station, pushing buttons actively, quickly, and your performance effects the quality and outcome. I'm not saying do this but do something new and engaging. Like, I dunno, a game! Most games crafting systems are exactly the same as copying files in your Operating Systems Desktop to folders and waiting for them to complete. That's all and there is no game there. It's like having to do something very dirty to get your fix. A game should always be a game, simple. No work, just game. Someone please hear this and change the crafting mechanic for games. I know someone disagrees, but they are wrong. They just haven't experienced anything better. It's like that old Apple commercial where the lady tosses the hammer into the IMAX screen. Someone toss their tool into the lazy crafting mechanic, PLEASE! You are working not playing when you craft stuff in this game and others like it. At least make some kinda puzzle out of it or something that makes the players' brains work in an interesting way and not force tedium. It's fine if you automate it in mid/late game but it's the early game that people will play first. Make a good first impression and do something different for a change!\n\nThe overall game-play experience is this: Someone turned down the lights, lit some candles, and put Space Engineers and StarMade in the indie honeymoon suite. The babby was formed, got mommy's brains and daddy's good looks, but it's still very sticky and wet with amniotic fluid. If you want to see the space/survival/sandbox/etc. genre excel then I feel this has potential and is worth tossing dosh at, but we have to raise this one right.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter going alpha 1.0 (don't get me started on the new age of development and distribution, I'm old school on that... I'll just leave it at that) I'm putting a little comment here. I really like how things have gone. I got a bit mad when leveling was introduced but I have grown accustomed to it. The addition of wood and concrete, are frankly what I miss in building material in Space Engineers. That's very cool. Still, none of these games get crafting right. I like how you have an assembler/techno crafting table that makes the per-requisite stuff but it's far to later game for me to be satisfied. Seriously, this game needs an entry tier assembler to do the work for you. Make it 50% slower than the current base constructor, I can ping dinos until my stuff is done. But seriously, tedious isn't game-play. Gamers who like that tedious stuff need an option to get off on, sure. But no. I refuse to jack to your standards. It's numbing. It's re-doo-doo-donkys. The survivalist constructor can do that but once I work to get a large scale one it should make whatever item I want, make the prerequisites for me, make a damn placable/usable that I need in one go, and then I work to make that faster over time. I'm really turned off by inventory management these days as an engaging game-play element. I've said it once, for most crafting games, and I'll say it again now: "This is just an Operating System GUI trying to be a game element!". Only OS devs generally try to make things easier with batch files or scripting and actual solutions that make sense. I really wish devs would stop that crap. I mean it makes sense, albeit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rip off sense, in a game that is pay-to-play like a "SAGA" title puzzle bullcrappery... to bank off hypnoses but I don't fall for it and it bugs me raw and makes me not play this game for months on end. Please do something new and cool for crafting! PLEASE!","September 1, 2015","true","67.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has to be said that this is easily one of the most engrossing games i have ever played. It's one of the most exciting, fun and time consuming (not in a bad way) games i have ever played but at the same time it is unforgiving for stupid mistakes.\n\nIt takes quite some time to get a grasp of the basics for surviving, but once you've got those down the game opens up massively and you begin to realise just how large the game world is. At the time of writing this review, there are only 5 worlds to play with, all with unique resources, gravity, inhabitants and scenary.\n\nThe world seems huge to start off with, like you'll never be able to travel the entire planet on foot, so you gather a few resources and build your first basic hover craft to get around easily. From there you're able to gather resources more efficiently and speedily to then be able to build a small vessel, which you can then use to fly around the world or even fly into space and onto another world!\n\nIt's my understanding that the game Devs intend to expand the universe and the size of the planets, meaning the game world will be infinitely huge! It has already taken me roughly 30 hours of gameplay to explore those 4 planets and gather enough resources to take over my home planet.\n\nAll in all this game is absolutely worth anyones time and money, the graphics are beautiful to look at, the gameplay is extremely engrossing and unforgiving yet fun, the sounds are a little bit off but acceptable and satisfying for the most part. I would 10/10 recommend getting this game and just enduring the first few hours of learning the basics. Brilliant game.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours just designing my underground base and ships; I’ve hardly scratched the surface in survival. It’s like a cross between Minecraft and Space Engineers. Farm food and process it to feed yourself, install those farms on space stations or a capital ship and sail out across the galaxy discovering all sorts of different and detailed planets with their own environments and life forms. You can create smaller hover craft and space ships that can then dock onto capital ships. And if you don’t feel like spending the time to build out your own huge capital ship, there’s tons of content in the workshop. The list goes on.

Hang out with us, get help, share pics, chat with us in the Mumble server, and join our PVP raiding parties!\n\nMy Updated Review with a few Starter Tips:\n\nI have over 500+ hours into Empyrion so far, and I do not plan on ever stopping playing this game completely.  I have played a couple building/survival games here and there, but this is really the first one that I fell for; hook, line, and sinker.\n\nDo I wish the graphics were AAA? Sure! there a lot of things I could wish for in this game, like when it becomes night, there should be more Xenomorph attacks like in Aliens or Starship Troopers, to make it a little more tower defense like.  I could go on and on, or maybe just on...But bottom line is, IF YOU ARE NOT A SHORT-ATTENTION-SPANNED-BUTTON-MASHING-THREE-YEAR-OLD (Thanks for letting me get that off my chest), and like Science Fiction survival/building games with lots of crafting, you probably will enjoy this game.  Star Wars Galaxies crafters who enjoyed crafting, surveying, building etc. will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nSurviving - You have to manage Food, Oxygen, and Health levels.  Some planets have breathable atmospheres, others don't.  If you are on a planet with a breathable atmosphere, hit U to toggle your helmet on and off to save O2.\n\nYou can hunt for food by killing animals for meat, you can pick edible food items to consume, and you can grow your own food at your base with grow plots and starter seeds. Personally, I grow lots of tomatoes, pumpkins, and durians, which are the main ingredients to make a canned vegetables.\n\nCanned vegetables give you max. amount of health of any food item in the game (150), and its totally sustainable since you grow it, and you dont have to worry about finding meat if you are in a sparsely populated area).\n\nSurviving in Empyrion can be tough at first, but it can also be a walk in the park later on.  If you are newer, I recommend starting on planet AKUA, because it has a breathable atmosphere.\n\nThere are all types of NPC entities in the game, from Aliens to Xenomorphs,  Wait, those are the same thing. Ok, there are all types of NPC entities in the game, from Animals to Xenomorphs.  Better.  Some NPCs are not hostile, and some are KOS. Killing different types of mobs will give you different types of loot of course, but basically animals give meat and other organic pieces, plant monsters, etc. give other types of resources, and drones/vehicles give crafting components and parts, etc.\n\nOnce your base is created, drones will eventually start coming in incremental waves at your base, and they want to kill you, and destroy every piece of equipment you own. Make sure you are ready to defend your turf with an upraded weapon, and a turret on your base for defense.\n\nOf course none of that matters in creative mode because that is strictly for building, and you don't have to worry about food/oxygen, etc.  You are free to work on your creations without having to worry about survival.  But what is the fun in that?  For the rest of us, we crave a little ACTION!  And that's where things start to get interesting in Empyrion.\n\nPVP in Empyrion brings your stress levels to a whole new level when your precious ship you have been working on for two weeks gets shot down in your over-confident bid to attack an enemy players base!  Good thing they have a full templating system in place you can simply throw in a stack of resources into the factory, and any templated ship or base you have stored can be deployed without having to rebuild it from scratch.  Plus you can use many of the templates from the Steam Workshop in your library as well!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun if you are looking for a fairly in-depth survival/building experience in a sci-fi setting.  Personally, I wish the graphic engine were something a little more robust, such as what they are using in Star Citizen, but hey, the Unity 5 graphics are still fine as far as I am concerned.  PvP is showing to be an interesting experience in the Empyrion world, I have already had a lot of fun attacking, raiding, pillaging, pirating and building in space, and I can't wait until they release larger galaxies/sectors, etc.  I have so much more to tell you, but I will have to stop editing now as my friends want me to start playing Empyrion right now!","December 12, 2015","true","634.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Add this to the fact that you can build not only in different planets, but also in space, and you have a game to consume hundreds of hours with always new content.\n\nAt its current stage (alpha at the time this review was written), the game already offers a great amount of weapons to fight creatures, blocks to build bases and ships and different planets to explore.\n\nThe graphics are not the best around, but are very pleasent to watch and provide a very smooth gameplay, even with not high-end computers.\n\nLast but not least, the fact that you can earn experience by doing various things, like mining, collecting plants, killing creatures, etc., which you can then use to unlock new technologies, adds a RPG experience that is simply amazing.\n\nLong story short, if you like this kind of games you should definitely try it and, if you come to enjoy it, buy it to help the developers.

It has a great multiplayer feature that is very easy to link up, the enemies provide a challenge, while the crafting and building are almost limitless in nature. The creators of this game seem very in tune with what people want. Hopefully they will develop more content with empire building in mind and npc citizens for their already complete faction system.

If however you can understand the words Pre-alpha then if something bad happens have a good laugh and start over. If the latest game update means all your saves are gone, have a good laugh and start over. If you spawn right under an alien outpost and die within 2 seconds, have a good laugh and START OVER. but if you cant do any of that and want to complain about (and its ok to report bugs IN THE BUG THREAD ) the game then so-long we wish you well, come back in a year and it will be a much better and different game.\n\nActually this is an amazing game with regular up-dates by the publisher ( remember updates can break things but they are quick to fix a bad update) so give it a try but if your going to complain go away!!!","October 12, 2015","true","125.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pre-alpha and bugs pop up here and there, but it's completely playable and very addicting.

If you're new to the game I suggest you play in creative mode for awhile.

Hang out with us, get help, share pics, chat with us in the Mumble server, and join our PVP raiding parties!\n\nMy Updated Review with a few Starter Tips:\n\nI have over 500+ hours into Empyrion so far, and I do not plan on ever stopping playing this game completely.  I have played a couple building/survival games here and there, but this is really the first one that I fell for; hook, line, and sinker.\n\nDo I wish the graphics were AAA? Sure! there a lot of things I could wish for in this game, like when it becomes night, there should be more Xenomorph attacks like in Aliens or Starship Troopers, to make it a little more tower defense like.  I could go on and on, or maybe just on...But bottom line is, IF YOU ARE NOT A SHORT-ATTENTION-SPANNED-BUTTON-MASHING-THREE-YEAR-OLD (Thanks for letting me get that off my chest), and like Science Fiction survival/building games with lots of crafting, you probably will enjoy this game.  Star Wars Galaxies crafters who enjoyed crafting, surveying, building etc. will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nSurviving - You have to manage Food, Oxygen, and Health levels.  Some planets have breathable atmospheres, others don't.  If you are on a planet with a breathable atmosphere, hit U to toggle your helmet on and off to save O2.\n\nYou can hunt for food by killing animals for meat, you can pick edible food items to consume, and you can grow your own food at your base with grow plots and starter seeds. Personally, I grow lots of tomatoes, pumpkins, and durians, which are the main ingredients to make a canned vegetables.\n\nCanned vegetables give you max. amount of health of any food item in the game (150), and its totally sustainable since you grow it, and you dont have to worry about finding meat if you are in a sparsely populated area).\n\nSurviving in Empyrion can be tough at first, but it can also be a walk in the park later on.  If you are newer, I recommend starting on planet AKUA, because it has a breathable atmosphere.\n\nThere are all types of NPC entities in the game, from Aliens to Xenomorphs,  Wait, those are the same thing. Ok, there are all types of NPC entities in the game, from Animals to Xenomorphs.  Better.  Some NPCs are not hostile, and some are KOS. Killing different types of mobs will give you different types of loot of course, but basically animals give meat and other organic pieces, plant monsters, etc. give other types of resources, and drones/vehicles give crafting components and parts, etc.\n\nOnce your base is created, drones will eventually start coming in incremental waves at your base, and they want to kill you, and destroy every piece of equipment you own. Make sure you are ready to defend your turf with an upraded weapon, and a turret on your base for defense.\n\nOf course none of that matters in creative mode because that is strictly for building, and you don't have to worry about food/oxygen, etc.  You are free to work on your creations without having to worry about survival.  But what is the fun in that?  For the rest of us, we crave a little ACTION!  And that's where things start to get interesting in Empyrion.\n\nPVP in Empyrion brings your stress levels to a whole new level when your precious ship you have been working on for two weeks gets shot down in your over-confident bid to attack an enemy players base!  Good thing they have a full templating system in place you can simply throw in a stack of resources into the factory, and any templated ship or base you have stored can be deployed without having to rebuild it from scratch.  Plus you can use many of the templates from the Steam Workshop in your library as well!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun if you are looking for a fairly in-depth survival/building experience in a sci-fi setting.  Personally, I wish the graphic engine were something a little more robust, such as what they are using in Star Citizen, but hey, the Unity 5 graphics are still fine as far as I am concerned.  PvP is showing to be an interesting experience in the Empyrion world, I have already had a lot of fun attacking, raiding, pillaging, pirating and building in space, and I can't wait until they release larger galaxies/sectors, etc.  I have so much more to tell you, but I will have to stop editing now as my friends want me to start playing Empyrion right now!","December 12, 2015","true","634.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do have some things I hope they add to the game.\n\n1: active drones on more planets, the drone bases are too easily defeated and then you have no more drones = boring.\n\n2: A uniformed inventory, by this I mean on your ship I would like to see the contents of all containers of a type, even in a multipage window. It sucks to search through all your cargo boxes to find something. OR be able to lable individual items, IE a cargo container labled iron ingots etc.\n\n3: The ability to not only see the resource cost of a blueprinted ship but an itemized list of what is needed to build it, incase you want to speed up the process but dont remember what you put into it.\n\n4: Drills for sv/hv PLEEEAASSEE!!\n\n5: A more threatening entity, since 95% of hostiles are melee range and we use guns its kinda easy unless you mess up badly.\n\n6: the ability to terraform water (I cant imagine this isnt being worked on)\n\n7: and Lastly but not least Workshop access for modders to add items to the game with functions, this honestly should be #1 by far. It would help the game devs a ton to allow modders to help design items and just toss their name in the game or somethin. I would be pretty happy if my name was something similar to a 'modder assistance' area for credits or somethin.\n\nAnyway, great game, still early but huge potential. Almost 70 hours into the game and only owned it for a few days. Thumbs up!","May 17","true","129.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a great game, I was a bit confused at the start but now i'm used to it and constructing things its great.\nYou can make your base, make a hover vessel, small vessel ( That can fly into space) and a capitol vessel which is a huge spaceship that can go into warp drive. You can add onto the CV making it look how ever you want or making it look like a home inside the possibilities are only limited to your imagination.\nBut yeah its your common crafting game when you find food/resources and cook them all that sorta stuff. You can mine asteroids and deposits in the ground with a drilling machine and refine that ore into ingots which makes items. Its really good considering its early access and only around $20. Im hooked on this game at the moment its awesome.There are a few bugs but not many at all (keeping in mind its still early access).\n\nOh and you can pvp with a range of weapons and spacecrafts and weapons for spacecrafts.

The dev team is contently working on new updates and making improvements as well as listening to the players on what is good and bad.\n\nIf you enjoy space games and you like to build things with your imagination then this is a great game for you. Games such as minecraft and space engineers seem to be huge influences on the game.\n\nOverall i give the early access of this game currently a 8 out 10.

I now have a lot more insight into the game so check below for my current stance on the game.\n"Not great yet, but this game has a LOT of potential. I just pray they don't end up like some other Early Access games."\n\nThe game is still quite bugged, and lacking features, but the possibilities are huge. Not only can you leave the planet but in upcoming versions you'll be able to leave the solar system you start in. The game is just challenging enough to be fun. Having large parts of your capital ship destroyed in a raid, limping away to fix it and coming back with improved armament and armour is a LOT of fun.\n\nTaking over NPC bases is so far quite useless, but I suspect it will have an imprtant role later in the development. It's still fun to do though.\n\nThe controls feel a bit.. unwieldly when on foot, and a bit too responsive when in a large ship. Shooting has no recoil, enemies always see you when you are in range, regardless of light level. All these things detract from the game and I can only hope these will be improved, but I'm not so certain as I am with other aspects of the game.\n\nNPC animations is another area that is currently very weak. There is also a total lack of friendly NPCs, even in the "Trading Station".\n\nAll in all I would give this game 5/10 points, but I suspect this will go up to 5/7 when the game hits release.","May 16","true","92.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now with dedicated server support we were able to start doing all of those things together.\n\nEleon Game Studios has done a marvelous job at developing this game! They listen to the community, answer feedback, fix bugs, adjust PVP and PVE to diminish griefers and hackers. The workshop support from in-game is an awesome achievement as well, allowing newer players or players who don't want to design a ship access to basically whatever structure or vessel they desire.\n\nLike I said, I've been into this game for a long while now, running my own server, playing many hours of every aspect this game has to offer, and haven't gotten 'burned out' yet.

But there you have it folks... I find myself getting up before the family, making some coffee, and tip-toeing to the computer just to get in an hour of pure indulgence.\nEmpyrion: Galactic Survival\nAs a new friend of mine put it, this game picks up where MineCraft leaves off. Crash land on a planet, and get through the quest driven tutorial, learning how to survive on an alien world with very few supplies and materials in a single player, open Solar System. Not an open world,... a WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM to explore!\nThe graphics are fantastic. While you can make your structures completely boxy as hell; you are not cornered into it. Different tools you can make can give you a VARIETY of shapes of blocks to craft with, colors to pigment, and letters to work with. The higher up the tier you go in technology, the faster and better tools you can make.\nGather your friends, and watch your game play fly as you build team skills, fight enemies, strategize, and coordinate. The sky is NOT the limit when you hop into your Starship and warp to other planets. Or even BETTER. Hop into creative mode to have unlimited resources, and make blueprints of any vessel OR* structure you create. (Sometimes, it's both... Just saying...) Simply put in the required resources in the "Factory", hit the button, and wait a pre-designated time frame for production, and Viola! Instant Base/Hovercraft/Small Plane/Star-Class Vessel. And if it's really good, share it with the entire Steam Community or your friends!\nI can't say ENOUGH good things about this game. It's my new favorite, and you'd think Drilling ore for 15 mins straight (or more depending on the size of the vein) would be boring right? Guess again. It's thrilling. Fear of patrols, Fear of keeping your base, your gear, and your vehicles (hovers, Small vessels, and Star Class ships) keep you on the edge of your seat. And visiting other planets? Forgetaboutit. This is one experience you can't live without if you like MineCraft, Subnautica, or even 7 Days to Die.\nUnlock Technology! Find Rare ores, catalog alien life, Be the Frontier Astronaut you've always dreamed of. Just set an alarm for getting off the computer, or you'll get sucked into this world...\nI've mentioned this game before, and recently. But I've been to busy playing the damn thing to put together any tutorial videos or write a review. And normally, I can't WAIT to write about stuff.\nIt's in Alpha stage still, so buy it cheap now, because I'd pay way more.\nThis game is only going to get better. And it's a worthy game now. A few glitches, but I'm sure they'll fix them before release. For an Alpha stage game, this is IMPRESSIVE.","June 5","true","120.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a sucker for early access survival games, so it was a toss up between this and two Zombie titles. I am glad I went with Empyrion - Galactic Survival.\nI put up my own server and before long there were other people playing. It was fun, we all began building our bases and getting familiar with the game. I logged off to go and do some chores, and when I came back a bit later I noticed one name on the server, the other people were all gone. I logged on, said hi and he left. Fearing the worst, I checked out my early base. All my starting metals gone, everything I had gathered, and a huge hole bored by my doorway. I mean... I know that these games allow you freedom to play how you want... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSOOOO ANYWAY... I started the server fresh and locked it down. I needed to get my head around the game without griefing going on at such an early stage.\n\nI just want to say that I'm 17 hours in and loving it. I have made my first crude ship, which looks more like a Space-Ambulance lol. My base has turrets set up which I hope will deter griefers (but probably won't).\n\nThe crowning jewel of my early game experience so far was the moment I too my ship into space for the first time. It is very rewarding, blasting through the atmosphere and into the void. On my second excursion I went to the closest moon, and discovered.... well you will have to see for yourself.\n\nI'm giving the game 9/10, it can only get better. Grab it in this sale, it is the best value for money you will find in the survival genre.","January 4","true","49.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In my opinion this is the easily the best EA survival/construction/exploration game that you can buy.

It has a lot of (brace for it) potential, HOWEVER it's still a great deal of fun as it is now.\n\nI wasn't sure whether to go for it at first, I don't have as much time nowadays for learning complex builders, but I'm glad I made the plunge, as it proved very accessible and didn't require a great deal of alt+tabbing to read the forums for help.\n\nIt is worth noting there are a lot of bugs, none massively game breaking. Things like accidentally exiting a moving ship in space will mean you'll watch your last several hours/days/weeks worth of work disappear into the dark recesses of space. This wouldn't be a massive issue if it were not for the saving system being very ropey at best, so you'll likely have to suicide and start again with what you have left on your home planet.\n\nBut you know what? Out of all the similar games I've played, so far I've been okay with that clean reset, the potential for pouring your new ideas into designs is really good fun and keeps me coming back.\n\nIt's a simple, unpretentious and fun builder/explorer, and the devs seem active enough that it gives me hope for the future.","January 4","true","27.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The cool thing is that this game is only going to get better. The devs are really big on community feedback and implementing what it is we want; this is the way games need to be made!\n\nGameplay itself is really fun, your first few hours are pretty much scrambling around trying to get all your basic needs met. I actually had to start a new game because my first time I wasted all my fuel crafting before making any replacement fuel cells first.. oops. Of course that's the point, you have to manage resources and survive. I'm happy to say that once I restarted with a little bit more knowledge I was better able to adapt to life on Omicron. Of course staying on just one planet is pretty boring, and I have had the opportunity to explore some of the space stations and loot them for all their goodies :). Every time I leave my base it feels like a completely new adventure. In fact today ill be heading to Omicron's moon to see what there.\n\nI highly recommend you try this game. Especially when it's under $20!!!!

This game is definitly in Early Access! The bugs and glitches can be awful, like building a small space vessel then having yourself fall out of it for no reason well it hovers around in the sky. Other than the sucky bugs/glitches the game is pretty good. You can build massive ships in space to fly to different planets or build a massive space station. I also suggest not rushing to get to space, while its worth it there are more important things to do on your starting planet like gather resources, which you always need, get food, and create a base.","January 3","true","65.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Survival games are not my forte, I'm terrible at crafting in almost any game, the only survival game I've ever had any luck at would be MineCraft, if that counts.\n\nDespite the complexity of this game, going from merely surviving to eventually building bases and even starships to colonize other worlds, the game has a nice enough guide/tutorial in the PDA feature that can help one learn the ropes and build the basic facilities and supplies to survive\n\nCrafting is complex in scope but can be simple enough in practice with a fair crafting UI that while it has filters to make finding specific recipes easily, badly requires some manner of sorting, be it player-chosen or automatic, the inventory could also benefit from a sort feature.\n\nBesides the usual hunger and health functions, Oxygen is also a feature. Oxygen is needed to survive the vaccuum of space or going underwater but on breathable worlds, one can easily just doff their spacesuit's helmet and enjoy native air.\n\nUnforutnately, at this point in time bugs seem to run mighty severe. My first game I gave up on when my Large Constructor, a neceessary device needed to make a 'real' base functional and allow one to go beyond making the bare basics, basically disappeared when I dared to put some walls near it. My second game ended with my character falling through the world forever while I was mining.\n\nAll in all, it's got great ideas and scope but it needs work. Hopefully it will overcome it's errors and bugs.","May 15","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played this game off and on for several months and whenever I check it out again, new features have been added, controls have been refined, etc. The pace of development is overall pretty fast too. The most important thing with game development in general, and early-access games in particular is whether you maintain an active cycle of game design and play testing. The devs seem to know this and are doing a good job on that front.\n\nI have played a lot of early-access survival sandbox games and the core thing that makes these games fun is depth of exploration, broad creative ability, and facing a variety of core survival challenges. The game isn't complete, but as it stands, it hits those marks. To boot, it has a fairly straight-forward interface, and maintains a decent learning curve so you feel you're actually getting better at the game and improving your strength and ability. It's increbily enjoyable to explore your surroundings, find hostile alien bases, defend against monsters and drones, build your base and spacecraft, conquer the hostile alien bases around you, and finally build up to the point where you can make a capital ship to explore other worlds.\n\nSome stuff that's cool about the game:\n\nSomething I like about this game is that you can actually screw yourself over - if you're not careful with your resources, let all your stuff get blown up by drones, etc, you will be stuck, especially if you choose the harder planet to start on. This lends a little bit of urgency to the game. Some people will find the game easy, some people will be frustrated.\n\nWhen I first played this game (in a far earlier version) I let some core resources get blown up. I lacked basic resources to survive and had to attempt an assault on a nearby crashed spacecraft that was guarded by drones. I survived barely by the skin of my teeth. Frankly, I was just being stupid, but the fact that I needed to actually think about survival was cool.\n\nAnother example of the difficulty in this game is that if you get too cocky and leave your stuff undefended, it can get attacked. For instance, there have been a couple of times I left my craft to explore an alien base and had a rocket drone sneak up on me. I've read a couple reviews complaining about this happening to them. Is this annoying? Of course! But, what do you do? Whine, moan, and give up? Or, do you hike back to your base, learn from your mistakes, build a better ship, remain more vigilant, and take revenge on the base that killed your stuff?\n\nLike any game, some people will find this easier than others, and once you have a nice network of bases and ships built, you're not going to\n\nA few notes:\n\nI personally think the new tutorial system they set up is pretty good. That said, I have never played a survial game where you shouldn't read the wiki.\n\nAlso, the multiplayer component of the game is pretty fun, but not super-built out or populated yet - I haven't done any PvP, but working on builds with other players is cool.\n\nStuff that still needs to be better:\n\nMy main complaint about the game is that depth of play still needs to be massaged. You will probably max out your tech tree before you even leave your first solar system. It would also be nice if there were more cases where tech improvements unlocked further ability to explore.\n\nBlock placement in construction is still in need of some refinement, but it's quite workable.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if there were easier ways to work with and interact with terrain voxels.\n\nFinal word:\n\nIf you're into survival/creative games, get Empyrion!","May 14","true","173.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even though the game is in early access there is already a lot to do. You can raid enemy outpost which are guarded by turrets. Once you finally get past the turrets and make your way into the base you will be greeted with spawners which you have to take out or enemies will continue to spawn. Now that you have made it all the base to the end of the base and destroyed the core you can place your own core down and use the enemies base as your own.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game is the ship building. Being able to download blueprints from the workshop is awesome since I rather suck when it comes to building things like that. There are a ton of amazing ships people have created.\n\nOverall this is one of best early access games I have played and I have played quite a few. I hope this game continues to grow and becomes even greater.","April 29","true","87.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have recently returned to playing after I purchased when it initially hit steam EA.  This game is so much better (not saying it was bad before but when it first came out it was VERY barebones).  The progress from the devs has been amazing. There are still some minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking.  If you love building (block style) and exploring planets/space, crafting, mining resources etc then I highly recommend this game. It has great immersion.\n\nThings I'd love to see in the future even if some of the items on this list are in progress (please read devs :)):\n-More planets/asteroid types/shipwrecks in space/space stations etc (would require larger sectors)\n-Trading/Dynamic economy\n-More Loot/items/ores (especially more unique  rare/legendary drops that can't be crafted, therefore making the find more exciting).\n-More creatures (and perhaps a taming/pet system.. hello ARK).\n-As above but maybe introduce certain rare/hard to find species and have a beastiary of some sort to document your creature discoveries.\n-Blocks need a little more hitpoints or maybe a shield system with it's own resource.. it's a little too easy to have hours of ship building get blown apart by a couple of plasma/rocket hits... Very sad when this happens haha.\n-More Factions/Faction wars in single player\n-Multiple saves\n\nOnce again, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and can't wait what the future has in store for the game.","May 3","true","53.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has planets, moons, asteroid belts and lots of stuff to do and explore on all of those things. It has enemy AI for PvE lovers and special PvP systems for those that love that as well. It's a great game to play co-op too, with plenty of things to keep you occupied.\n\nThe survival mode features things such as a food and oxygen system, farming, building, mining, exploring and scavenging. Planets have randomly generated POI's to explore that include things such as crashed ships, scary abandoned mines (you will see why they were abandoned :-)), space ports and all other kinds of cool stuff. Enemy natives, drones and aliens are also thrown into the mix (something severly lacking from games such as Space Engineers).\n\nCreative mode allows you free reign over everything you create and gives you unlimited resources to do so. The brilliant thing here is that you can design, create and test something there and then create a blueprint of it to bring into a multiplayer/survival game.\n\nThe building mechanics are superb - you can create some wonderful things - just see the workshop for this game to give you an idea. Bases, small ships, hover ships and capital ships are all buildable. It also features a brilliant blueprint system, whereby you can easily save and upload your creations for future use and to share with others.\n\nIt has multiplayer (as mentioned above), with dedicated servers which are a snap to set up. There seems to be a fairly large online presence for it too (although I host a private server). Single player works well too, if you are so inclined.\n\nSimply put, this could well be my favourite early access game. It's a true joy to play, even in its early state. The developers also seem to be on the ball with frequent updates - and actually communicate with their community well (unlike other EA games). So, if you are a fan of the survival genre, sci-fi and building things - this may very well be "just the ticket".\n\nJimbo Rating: 9/10","June 2","true","40.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Yeah... moved on to a different game after that but I'm still recommending this one anyway and here's why:\n\n1. This game doesn't hold your hand and that is a huge plus over a lot of survival/builder games these days. It was my first go, I was un-prepared and cocky with my shiny new ship... I quickly learned you need to assume everything you do can be undone and resources are finite at the moment in this PRE-ALPHA build. I hope that doesn't change too too much as the game develops but maybe give us a bit more leeway on a couple of things... Armored cockpits? Disable my ship, fine, but knock out the cockpit and leave the ship in the air? Problem.Lock-ons for ship weaponry? Think Armored Core. Not complicated, very effective.Optional health bars for enemy units? I'd like to get a better feel for when to let go of the trigger.Friend or Foe programmability for base turrets? Sitting in my livingroom listening to a barrage of rocket fire at a single plant creature walking behind a hill and out of sight was funny for about 5 seconds.\n2. It's still pretty new for an Early Access title and there's a LOT to do. Like if I stuck with it I could easily sink 100 hours or more into this game as is and it only promises to get exponentially larger with further updates down the road. I've seen enough to know its going to be great, personally. I'm satisfied shelving this one to let it grow for a bit so I don't feel like I'm repeating the same content too often during the process but I have far from given up on it. If you can't tell by now I'm in fact very optimistic about it.\n\n3. Price hikes as games in development move along are the norm. If it has your attention NOW then support the devs and help speed along the process before you see it selling for twice as much. As a lifelong gamer with a mortgage and approaching middle age I know first hand just how it gets harder and harder to justify spending $70 on a game that I may or may not even like just because it has a fancy label on it. This one's still relatively cheap for the moment and you only have to buy once ;)","October 17, 2015","true","26.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For starters the game is like space engineers and i guess part minecraft, but it has the fps point of it and space exploration, planets, gun, passive and aggressive AI's, bases, ground vehicles to huge mother ships. You can do creative and if you are like me and prefer survive then do it, its challenging and you can play just to kill time or play with friends for hours and the amount of AI's in the game now is nice for a alpha and much more to come! All in all its a very good game as is but when its released it will be better then space engineers and minecraft and so on combined so i highly recommend this game if your trying to decide on it. On a side note the game is 64 bit only and i personally like that, i saw neg reviews that its slow frames and it cant run but if you have at least a half good computer then your fine, i run the game at max setting and get 60+ frames even when stuff explodes and yes stuff douse explode if you shoot the fuel tanks so have fun with that.","August 7, 2015","true","58.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(more on that later)\n- You will get the chance to build yourself a good deal of things including a space ship from all the materials you harvest from the planet\n- - Recommend a Ship over a Ground Vehicle as your first Vehicle in the game.\n- - - Ship flight is a little wonky especially when you attempt to dog fight in space (second hand account on this)\n- - - Ship fighting is combat by fixed mouse control. (would be a bit easier if you could fly by mouse pointer direction on the screen)\n- - - Atmospheric flight to Space flight is kinda fun to switch between but you gotta make sure everyone that is playing with you is on the same ship as you.\n\nFor such a PRE-Alpha Early Access build of the game its got a good deal of Polishing needed, but contains plenty to keep you busy for a little while when you launch your own game.\n- When you launch single player and have your ports open for 30,000 other players can join you in your saved game session for single player.\n- You will find that you keep needing Oxygen and Food like you would any survival game, but this will always be a ticking clock to get enough of the right resources.\n- - If you get the right things build together and put a few things into a Priority correctly and you can keep chugging along in the Galactic Survival.\n\nGet this game early if your interested - because its worth it.\n- if your not interested in an unfinished game then think about getting it early.\n- if your not interested at all - then at least you took the time to read this Review.\n\nWorthwhile for Pre-Alpha Purchase.","August 16, 2015","true","46.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I just got this game recently, but I have enjoyed every minute of it. My game started out like anybody else's. I don't really know what I expected to happen. I quickly built a base and tried to figure out what to eat. Sometime later(much later) I had finally finished my HC or hovercraft. I decided to go adventuring and I said "Hey those strange alien towers look pretty cool, and they have awesome decorations". I got to find out what those decorations were later... I sped up to one and thought "I wonder what kind of loot is inside". That's when the first explosion made me throw my mouse halfway across the damn room. I tried to escape in vain. Those "decorations" were missle launchers. I hovered away across a clear blue lake, only to hear another explosion blow my thrusters out. I plummeted down into the lake, still taking missles and screaming hysterically. The missles had also destroyed my oxygen tank and now I had two choices: Suffocate, or get incinerated by magic green death balls. I hopped out and swam as fast I could to the surface of the lake. I cringed when I saw what those magic balls had brought upon my hovercraft. I wept at the thought of all the resources, and time I had spent making it, only for it to be repeatedly slammed by missles. I sprinted away as fast as I could, trying to run back to my base all the way on the otherside of the world. When I got out of range of the destruction of those cursed towers, a flock of wild minigun drones glided majestically over a mountain, raining hell and fire upon me. I had to run back, only to find myself trapped between two fates. I said quite heroically "Screw it" and ran full head on into the alien tower. I caught a brief rest when a giant dinosaur walked infront of a missle, and was turned into rasberry pudding. I made it to the tower and dug under it with my trusty mining tool. I rejoiced at the sight of all of the bountiful loot inside, guns, materials, and even rare minerals. I collected all I could, ready for the next stage of my epic adventure. I stepped outside into the sunlight, weapon in hand, ready for anything. Wiping away the tears of sadness, at the lost of my hovercraft, I smiled to myself. Then I frowned because I starved to death after neglecting my hunger for some time. :C\n\n\n11/10 would starve again.","September 27, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

As I said, I got about 16 hours out of it so far, so it payed for itself , but I want to see them reach their potential.","August 16, 2015","true","17.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"How is that" you say?  Read on:\n\nBuilding -\nIf you like to build, and I do, this game is light years (pun intended) beyond Ark.  The mechanics, logic and lack of snapping in Ark are horrible.   Apparently someone in dev for Empyrion realizes that to be a good survival game, the building aspect has to be superb.  While it's not 100% perfect, it is pretty dang good.  Meaning, you can (and I have) built some impressive building, ships...or whatever with out wanting to gouge your eyes out with blunt, hot object like you would in Ark.\n\nYou can also build in zero G in space.  Put that in your dino pipe and smoke it Ark.\n\nWorld -\nArk, so limited, so repetitive, so...boring.  Once you've played Ark servers you realize the variety is well...primordial.  Contrasted to Empyrion, you have not only islands and continents you have an entire world.  Oh...and that's just the beginning, because once you finally get to a point where you're not stessing over food and energy and say "OK, I'm not going to die now" you realize you need to build a ship and get off planet.  THAT's where it begins :).  What awaits you are other planets, moons and asteroid belts all with their own PVP or PVE attributes.\n\nSpace -\nOnce you've tamed or killed all the dino's in Ark the only and I mean ONLY other thing to do is to try to avoid being the server gank wh0r3 by the stronger groups on said PVP server.  Or if you're on a PVE server, the only other thing to do is build...but then why in Ghandi's yoga pants would you want to torture yourself like that?  Seriously, if you find yourself at that point in Ark, I suggest you just find a donkey and let it kick you in your meat n 2 veg.  No kidding.  Because you must seriously have a psychological issue that meds won't fix, but a swift kick by a pi$$ed off donkey will.\n\nPerformance -\nArk expects you to sacrifice your hard earned money for an uber machine, your soul and a non endangered fowl sacrificed on the alter of low self esteem and boredom and will in return give you graphics that only look slightly better than Minecraft with a good shader.  People say "but the graphics are so great in Ark".  Even if that is true it's subjective and furthermore if the game play sux but it's pretty...that's like saying you have the most spectacularly beautiful and awe inspiring majestic dog turd in the world.  It's still...a...turd.\n\nBalanced PVP game play -\nBalance in Ark PVP?  I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.  Unless your one of the first players on a newly wiped server AND you team up with other like souls that hate spending your time playing a fun game, then you have about as much chance of surviving as does a jelly doughnut at a Weight Watcher meeting.  Empyrion has PVP and PVE areas you can play and with the weapons and armor being reasonable to attain (unlike in Ark) you can defend yourself and survive very easily.  But, keep in mind if you go to a PVP area, and there are other factions there, you're fair game, so tread lightly and be smart.\n\nSo...if you like pain and disappointment and a seriously unbalanced game that will make you want to put your head in vice and scream Metalica lyrics all the while pondering why did I waste a nickle on that game:  then Ark is for you.\n\nOtherwise, go get Emyprion, enjoy the game and realize, it's Alpha pre-release game that is still in galaxy far far away (and better) than Ark.  </end puns>.","January 18","true","417.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","4","7","5","1"

Keep this in mind while reading reviews, and if you're thinking about buying the game. There's bound to be countless bugs or limitations as it currently stands. This is bound to change, and improve, so this review may or may not be misleading and outdated.\n\nFirst off, I think Empyrion - Galactic Survival has great potential. The devs are active both community wise and update wise.  So I believe the game is going to shape up quite well. However, there are things to keep in mind.\n\nIn the current state of the game, it is enjoyable, and most of all, playable in singleplayer. I haven't played much of the game alone yet, since I prefer playing most games with a partner, which is what I did in this game aswell. After playing for two days, we had to stop. Every so often, my partner would lose everything he had in his inventory randomly, giving us massive blowbacks. We lost all our ores, and decided we'd wait for further updates before resuming playing this game, and exploring the surrounding planets and moons. Just going to say, I think the game is great for multiplayer.\n\nPros+\n+Crafting\n+Exploration(Captial ships and smaller ships)\n+A decent amount of weapons available\n+Creative mode\n+Interesting wildlife/enemies (Dinosaurs, hellish creatures etc.)\n+Survival (So you need to prepare if you're going to explore the surrounding planets)\n\n\nCons-\n-Poor AI\n-Only a few planets and moons\n+-You die fast(can be taken both ways. I think it's alright, since getting stranded is an interesting predicament to be in)\n-You cannot leave a planet without all players being in the same spacecraft.\n-Poles are inaccessible\n-Inventory is randomly cleared\n-Crafting can be fidgety\n\n\nTL;DR:\nGreat potential, it is fun, but has restrictions in it's current state. A decent amount of content, however I do expect more. Troublesome in multiplayer. You cannot leave a planet without bringing everyone. Items are randomly erased.\nRecommending the game because I actually do find it fun, however it might be wise of you to hold off on buying it, which is what I usually try to do with early access titles, but with this one I couldn't help myself. Wait for it to be updated some more. I certainly will wait until I try playing this game again.\n","October 6, 2015","true","33.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It expands upon and adds a lot of elements Space Engineers should have had.  Planets have alien bases that are challenging to attack rewarding to pillage. Survival elements are fantastic with the need to gather food and keep a steady supply of oxygen. Base building and ship building is a lot of fun. Overall I've had more fun with this than Space Engineers.\n\nWhy the thumbs down? It's really frustrating to build something cool and lose it all because of bugs. And this is bound to happen to you. If you play this game and want to create a large ship or base with all kinds of interesting areas... just understand that at any point you can hit a really stupid bug that will wreck all your hard work. It's really frustring to dump 15 hours into a game and to lose everything you built to some stupid bug.\n\nPlay at your own risk.

Access Review\n\nBest EA game on Steam right now !!!\n\nBefore I begin:\n\nNEVER BASE YOUR OPINION ON REVIEWS WRITTEN BY LITTLE KIDS WITH 0.5HRS ON RECORD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH HAPPENS A LOT NOW THAT THIS GAME IS FREE TO PLAY FOR THE WEEKEND.IF YOU DO THAT THEN GOOD LUCK FINDING A GOOD EARLY ACCESS GAME TO INVEST YOUR MONEY ON.\n\nDEVELOPERS\n\nWhat can I say about this devs...they are just awesome,updating the game at least once a week with a very nice update,(this week we had updates every single day).Best thing is that they are doing exactly what they told us they will do when this game launched for the first time.And their roadmap is fascinating…I will tell you one thing they plan to add in the future:infinite procedural galaxy with many unique planets, each planet with its own flora and fauna,(yeah like no mans sky=which basically single player ooops), and every server will be connected to each other and will represent a small part of this galaxy.Yeah I know that it sounds just empty words but based on what they told us this game will have in the first alpha version,(like 1 month ago…before that it was in pre alpha),they actually implemented every single thing they said.So I can say that they are trustworthy.Trustowrthy devs + game with potential = ♥♥♥♥ yeah\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSingle Player:\n\nFirst of all,Empyrion in this stage,(early alpha),has more content than any other EA game on steam.\nAlso don’t even thing trying multiplayer before learning the game in single player…you stand no chance.\nSo when you start a game you are clash landing in an unknown planet with some basic resources to begin your adventure.Generally what you do is Survive-Explore-Conquer...Although base on the story you are in a quest to find the planet Empyrion in the Andromeda galaxy cause this planet has everything people on Earth need to survive cause they are in some sort of a crisis.This planet is obviously not implemented yet.So first you are trying to survive against the hostile creatures and some high tech aliens that “rule” the planet.You search for food and resources then build a base and then build a small spaceship to get out of this planet and go to the nearest planets or moons you see and gather some rare resources that cannot be found in your planet.With these resources you can build a huge spaceship and a warp drive machine so you can travel to other planets that are very far away.Every planet is unique with its own flora and fauna.Trust me,building YOUR OWN spaceship and flying it out of your planets orbit to space and then entering an uknown planet or battling in space with aliens or other players is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Even if you are a bad builder you can make a ship right from the workshop which has tons.All that wont be that easy cause aliens will hunt and battle you both in planets and space.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nHere things are a little different.In most of the servers you are landing on a pve planet and everyone on this planet is trying to make a spaceship and go to a pvp planet,(most planets are pvp),or space which is also pvp cause pve planets wipe very often.Now the best servers have concept too like the star wars server were you choose either to be republic or imperial or other star wars races,or the hws server where you choose to be a pirate or bounty hunter or trader and things like that.So in this servers you are trying with your race to destroy your rival race…you know planet and space battles with unique playerbuild  spaceships and big guns,all that boring stuff.Also most servers have usually have more planets than single player.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nI know that for most of us graphics are important and I myself am a graphics enthusiast.Empyrion has nice graphics on high and 1080p (which is not even that demanding)…Not the best graphics but I like them and they keeping evolving fast so its all good.Trust me I have seen this game when it first launched and graphics were horrible.When this got into alpha though we got a big graphic improvement and now the planets are beautiful and they will be even better…cant wait .Also you don’t need to have a super computer to play this…I am mostly playing this from my 4years old laptop with a gt 540m graphics crad which is discusting and in most planets at medium settings I have about 30 fps and 40-60 fps on space.Many times though I play it from a stronger pc (not mine) so I can enjoy the nice graphics.\n\nCommunity\n\nBest community I have ever seen till now.Everyone is willing to help or just be friends and play together.\n\nCons\n\n-Starting may not be that easy at your first time,although now if you press f1 it opens you a tutorial or should I say a whole encyclopedia about how to play even if you have lower IQ than a caterpie.\n-Bugs.Like every other EA game Empyrion has bugs too.In single player they wont bother you at all cause they are few and not that game breaking.In multiplayer though you will experience more bugs and some rare ones may ♥♥♥♥ you off like losing your ship and that happens mainly cause people spawn pre-alpha ships from workshop that break the playfields,so never spawn pre-alpha blueprint and you wont lose your ship.Multiplayer needs some work but its playable dont worry.\n-AI is pretty basic right now and especially the animals but they said they will change that\n-I would prefer faster crafting\nCONCLUSION\n\nEmpyrion may look like other survival games but it isn’t.It is in his own way unique,beautifull and super fun with friends.So don’t hesitate and support this game so it reaches its full potential.Thats how an early access game grows you know…by supporting it.Not waiting till it dies or till it even manages to release and then say “oh it isnt as good as I expected to be”.Thats the problem with EA games,yeah I know many developers only care about money and they take your money and go away forever but there are a few that don’t do that so do your research and if the devs seem trustworthy then take that small risk and support them.","May 14","true","192.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review

Now you have a premise: survive at all costs."\n\nFirst-day log: What happened? I only remember to wake up in a pod approaching a forest and mountains. A planet, survive at all costs I said. I crashed into a small lagoon. I could manage to take everything from the pod and swim to the surface. Nothing there except some local fauna. The temperature was OK but I was alone.\n\nSecond-day log: I knew I couldn't live with the emergency and water rations, so I started to work. That night was not cold but I was frightened. I could create my base thanks the things I got from the pod. A hard work day. Also, I found some kind of dinos. I realized the babies were the most simple to knock down than the larger ones. After finishing some drill of iron and other minerals, I built the constructor to create things. Cooking, crafting some bullets, etc.\n\nThat night I couldn't sleep so I decided to walk a little. I was afraid when I saw a reptilian humanoid. He or she saw me too, but wast¡n hostile. I tried to contact the reptilian. No chance and he continued his walk. I picked up some plants to further investigation. After two hours walking, I found something strange, a massive force field I couldn't penetrate. Didn't hurt me but I was a little afraid. Alone there. And then a noise, a noise of a machine. My sensor tracked a drone or something like that. I had to run from there, something was watching that site. I marked it on my map. I arrived at the base that morning. I had to survive another day and another and another...\n\nIntroduction\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival is a very realistic survival game in an open world. This game will ask for a great patient gamer if you want to create a big base with all the things you need and then explore for other enemy bases. yes, there are enemies. The planet the game and I suggest to start is Akua, the forest planet. You won't have the need of oxygen for example, and the food is easy to take. Beware of the North East places, there are enemies. Just try to be cautious, and you'll enjoy this game a lot. Also, you can create your own vessel! And don't forget, not all creatures are hostile.\n\nI had to restart the game several times due my failed approach making a proper base. You have to take care of the resources very well or you will fail. Stay away from enemies the first levels and nothing that moves there is food, some things are poisonous, don't forget that.\n\nI suggest to drill for resources and kill some baby dinos for food. That's a good start. Then use the tutorial to help you out about how continuing playing the game.\n\nI have to confess I hate reading tutorials but you may know this kind of games the tuts are a must, so I had to read for more info.\n\nGameplay\nYou'll notice the Inventory is not so big so I suggest to collect things and leave on the floor of your base so you don't have to carry them out the whole map. At the left you can put things and use them, just click the keyboard number to change the items. A suggestion, if you are drilling keep some extra refills. You won't want to get stuck in a big hole. Honestly, happened to me and I had to restart the game.\n\nThe interface is very easy to understand and manage, that's a pro. Another suggestion, save your stamina you gonna need it in the case of enemies!\n\nPros\n+ Great graphics\n+ Great ambience sounds\n+ Realistic experience\n\n\nCons\n- Lack of a background story\n- The difficulty of the game bases in the managing a base and escape from enemies only\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI liked this game and I going to continue playing it. Empyrion - Galactic Survival worths every buck, don't hesitate to buy the game. You'll have an astonishing experience playing it. It's an open world so you won't regret.\n\nThanks for the chance of playing this game!\n","April 29","true","2.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","5"

I cannot currently reconmend this game in its state.\n\nI do feel that this game could be great and if done right rival the popularity of space engineers and other survival games. I do really want to like this game and I do plan on trying to play this game at a later date and hopefully edit this review in time.\n\nMy experience has been completely bug ridden and save corrupting where I could not even build a base before the game either crashed to desktop or bugged out hard.  I've had save's seem to "mesh" together and the locations of where I was in both save seem to combine on load resulting in some very deformed terrain. I've had save files corrupt so much that even after sending the data to the developer as per their request they couldnt even open it.\nSome harvestable plants are incredibly easy to find as they glow when you shine a light on them. Cannon and Gatling drone's getting stuck and becoming invincible (Fixed with new patch)\n\n5/5/16\n\nGame has come a long way, a lot of bugs have been fixed and none of the issues i used to have are there any longer.

I like the fact that it has a lot of content.\nBut the only problem is the vehicle physics that needs to get better. For example when we turn the ship, the trajectory dont change. It would be better if it were simillar to airplanes physics.\nIt would also be more fun if it was possible to have a kind of warp speed and that the vehicles performances could be more adjustable byb the desing.","November 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Patches have had thier ups and downs but overall the game is better now than when i started.\nYou begin crash landed on an alien planet with minimal resources. you may start on one of two planets, Omicron being the harder to begin on as it has no breatheable atmosphere. Not only is the environment hostile but there are also hostile AI Aliens to contend with. You will have to forage or grow food, gather resources all the while defending yourself from aliens and Hostile flora and or fauna.\nThere are multiple planets in the starting solar system along with alien bases, crashed starships and asteroid belts to explore. You may build hover vehicles, small spaceships and capital vessels or starships. there are no places to go with a starship at the moment but the goal is a procedurally generated galaxy. Patches and updates are frequent and you will find yourself often on the ragged edge of survival. The game as it sits is worth the price of admission and of all the early access games i have played recently, this one seems the most likely to reach its goals, and the goals seem to be worthwhile.\nAs far as survival games go this is definitely a better one. it is also a fairly competent building game. There are playable multiplayer servers although they are in the very early stages and are very wild wild west at the moment. The alien presence on planets scales upwards with the value of the resources usually and the various types of bases also ramp up in effectiveness and difficulty. The aliens will try and take out your vehicles and bases whether you are in them or not, although at later stages they are little threat if you are actively defending anything.\nYou will find this game challenging at the beginning and less so as you progress, Although they are still patching and improving so that it is likely to get nothing but better and better as it advances towards completion. There is a rather pointless type of character leveling where you must gain experience to get research points to  unlock better parts and machinery but currently you will pretty much level up faster than you will actually require the advances just by doing what you must to survive. Overall this is the best early access game of its type i have played. Well worth the price.","November 21, 2015","true","167.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a minecraft-like game where you are dumped on a hostile planet and have to survive.  You have to keep food and (if you're on a planet without breathable atmosphere) oxygen supplied, and can mine different ores in order to make stuff.  You start out in an escape pod, a few rations, and a pistol... but you can build a base with automated turrets to defend yourself, make better weapons, and even make vehicles.\n\nOn vehicles:  We're talking about things as small as a simple buggy to get around and as large as a capital ship able to fly through space and get to other planets.  That is one of the things that makes this game really interesting is that, unlike games like minecraft, the game doesn't really "end" once you've conquored your immediate environment.  You set out into space and land yourself on a (much) more hostile planet if you want.\n\nIt is still in Alpha when I'm writing this, so it could fizzle out and amount to nothing... but so far it has been a fun little game.","March 23","true","16.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not normally a big fan of the open-world-survival-with-crafting-elements genre and tend to shy away from Early Access - but seeing a prominent youtuber play this, the potential clearly on offer made me buy it.\n\nI've just finished my second permadeath survival play; 5 and a half hours in, I got one-shot killed from an unexpected place whilst attempting a sneaky landing near a spoilery location - destroyed my cockpit but left the rest of my craft intact.\n\nIf the developer manages to make these ships and encounters random so that there's no notion of whether you're safe or not from prior experience, this could be one of the best games in this genre.

I've played it a bit now, and it's fluid, frequently updated by devs that actually care, and generally a fun experience. And this is just the pre-alpha! It's totally worth the $18, and if you can't spare that much, at least grab it on sale. It's worth your time.","August 10, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Po-ten-ti-al.\n\nActually it lack content, you can do everything the game has offer today in 5~10 hours. It is fun until you do these things, after that you can keep building for no reason or, as I did, stop and wait updates.\n\nEmpyrion didn't worth the price as a game, but as a Pre Alpha game with a lot of potential it worth for sure, to help the devs finish what can be a great adventure.\n\nAll content thay said exist today in Pre Alpha is there and work, so I'm giving a positive review, hoping for the future updates come fast.","October 12, 2015","true","29.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
