So I picked it up, not thinking too much of it. I was thinking to my self, "how hard can it really be to avoid your past self while solving puzzles? What could they possibly throw at me?"\n\nThis isn't a long game, which is nice considering the "perma-death" aspect. I beat the Normal mode in about 16:10 on my third or fourth run through, first time recording it. I actually really enjoyed playing through it and having to solve the puzzles on a clock. Most of the time I look at timed puzzles and am dissappointed, but these were different. They were easy enough to not take long, but hard enough that I actually had to put some thought into them. Pretty decent design.\n\nOne of my first thoughts while playing this was "hey, this might be a good game to speedrun.." It incentivises it, actually. The faster you can get through the puzzles, the better. I personally plan to speedrun it, and I hope others do as well.\n\nAll that said, the game has a few issues with it. None really game breaking, but just inconvenient. The physics can be a bit slow and unresponsive, I've gotten stuck between a litteral rock and a hard place, and the camera would randomly jump to a different direction. There's probably a few other minor things I've yet to run into, but those were the most major.\n\nIf the game were to have a bit more polish, fixing the physics and camera issues, it'd immediately be significantly better in my eyes. I'd love if the developers could go back over and just clean it up a bit, put a little bit of effort into a better play experience. That would be amazing, especially since this game supports VR and those who use it would benefit even more than I.","May 8","true","4.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

With a new ghosted version of yourself appearing every two minutes, you need to work quickly to solve the puzzles and move on to the next area, without being spotted and causing a time paradox, which ends the game. This is fun and exciting, and also a bit nerve-wracking!\n\nFortunately, the puzzles can be better understood each time you play, so you can get through them a little faster each time. The longer you take, the more doubles you create, and the harder it gets to avoid them. This builds a lot of tension organically and keeps you on your toes. It's really a great concept for a game and it's well executed.\n\nThis isn't a long game, but considering it will take you several run throughs to complete all the puzzles, plus there are a variety of difficulty levels, you can get a decent amount of enjoyment and replayability out of Yon Paradox. For $3, it's a steal.\n\nThe visual style of this colorful cyber dimension is bold and unique. I look forward to checking this out in VR someday, but it's plenty of fun to play on a regular PC for now. It ran very fast for me and frame rates were great. There are a few puzzles in the starting area that were a bit glitchy for me (devs, I'm thinking of the shapes and gear stacks here). And this gets frustrating when you're trying to complete them as fast as possible. A bit of polish in that area would make this a better experience for me.\n\nI look forward to seeing speedruns of this game. Or hilarious speedrun fails.
