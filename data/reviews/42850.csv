While DH added more actual game content (including WW1), AoD focuses more on improving upon what already existed in HOI2. The result is that the WW2 you fight in this is a better experience than the vanilla game, and that was an excellent game already. With that said, I prefer Darkest Hour to this simply because there is more stuff there even if it is not quite as well-polished as it is here.\n\nStrategy nerds and fellow psychos will find much to like here. It's old, but still good. :)","December 6, 2013","true","54.0"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","50","53","2","0"

Being able to escape the confines of history by going into the 50's and 60's gets crazy with the Cold War gone hot.  Plus the tech tree is much more fleshed out, and you can more easily (with time and patience) play as micro powers. Politics are also a tad more interesting.

AoD focuses very much on domestic and economic issues (repairing provinces, civic investment as a means to alleviating dissent as opposed to simply cranking out consumer goods). It's really sliders galore. The implimentation of over-arching, nation-wide policies is also nice.\nWhat this game could use, however, is a bit more UI polish. To use the technology tree as an example -- colors seem stark and non-period while useability refinements such as historical years within each tech's respective title should have been implimented. The AI also makes questionable ahistoric decisions, leaving history-minded players stuck. If you're open-minded and wanting unpredictablity though, that might be right up your alley.\n\nAll that being said, I recommend this to players wanting diplomatic and policy-heavy gameplay without losing military action.","October 18, 2014","true","27.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/42850/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Very thorough remake of Hearts of Iron 2 - it is wider and deeper than original game, which itself is very wide and deep in terms of every fan of turn-based global strategies.\nIt was released not as mod but as a separate game due to significant amount of gameplay changes above the original HOI2 game. And it is still under development! Get me right - Arsenal of Democracy is a finished product, yet there are always room for some improvements and additional campaigns and stuff. And yeah, community is friendly, and welcome for any newcomers, but...\n\nBut I won't recommend you to start with Paradox games from this title. There are way too many options, details, charts and graphs to sink in... So you'll get by better starting from Europa Universalis 3 or even Victoria 2, than with Arsenal of Democracy.\nSo I do recommend the game - but only for prepared ones, who grown up above the basic things Civilization taught us, and ready to spend dozens or even hundreds of hours on single separate scenario, making his own history. There are so many scenarios and mods to prove yourself on... And if you'll be not getting enough, you can always make some of your own.\n\nFinally, I must inform you that there are a major bug still troubling some players - a flickering screen problem. For some people the game works straight out of box, some have to go to Paradox forums and download patches (Steam is releasing 1.04 version now, and current patch on Paradox is 1.09 or maybe 1.10 already). And for some systems flickering goes on forever, like how it goes with my laptop. So I warn you! There is a possibility that this game will be unplayable, no matter how great it is...\n\nMy mark is 8/10. I'd like to give the game more, but flickering bug is still a big issue, even after 5+ years after game release.","February 7","true","84.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Sadly the latest patch is not available on Steam, but it can be downloaded from Paradox forums, where you can register your game and get access to the patches https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/arsenal-of-democracy.462/\n\nThere is even a 1.10 patch in early alpha stage, the patch will attempt to adress the ancient bugs and problems with the game engine.\n\nGraphics arent anything wonderfull, but this is about grand strategy, not fancy fireworks.\n\nGame in itself is straight up Hearts of Iron, if your a Paradox fan, then you will love AoD aswell. Multitude of variation in strategy, tactics, diplomacy, large techtree, plenty of unit types and so much little details to think of that after years of playing, you still learn new things every now and then. It has the best replayability value that I have ever seen in a strategy game. If you have not played Paradox games before, then you are up for a long and hard path of learning the game, but it is very much worth it.\n\nThe AI is not terribly challenging once you master the game, the difficulty setting just grants it more bonuses rather than intelligence, but luckily there are alot of mods that improve the AI and gameplay generally, such as my own mod which can be downloaded here:\nhttps://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/improved-1936.673291/\n\nBest way to enjoy this game however is in multiplayer, there are various forums where you can sign up and try to find an MP game to join, Paradox forum is a good place to start. You need GameRanger to get access to online game as the game itself has no lobby function anymore.\n\nIn multiplayer the game springs to life, as you can co-op as Axis or Allies, or a desperate struggle as Poland/Czechoslovakia with your friend, the choices are limitless. But best games are the ones where all the major powers are controlled by a human player, that is where things get real. The games progress relatively slowly due to amount of players, but in also forces you to cooperate with your allies and form plans and strategies which can be equally fun as playing the game itself.\n\nAll in all, this is my favourite WW2 Grand strategy game and has been since its release. No other game has come even close, so I can recommend it with all my heart.","October 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","3"

The hint is in the title, a Hearts of Iron game. This is not really a game however, Arsenal of Democracy is a free mod available to all Hearts of Iron 2 players and this retail version only has a few minor advantages over the free version.\n\nIf you want to know whether this game is for you then you should not be reading this review, rather you should find a review for the regular Hearts of Iron 2, everything said in there is true for this game. With one notable exception however, none of the Hearts of Iron 2 mods will work for this.\n\nIt is a strange sense, to pay money for the retail version of a mod only to be denied access to, what is otherwise one of the strongest modding scenes around. Arsenal of Democracy does have some mods available made specifically for this game but they are few and far between and none have the scope or polished quality that is readily available for Hearts of Iron 2.\n\nAll in all, do not buy this, simply don't. If you are such a big fan of the genre that you must play every incarnation out there then save yourself some money, go get Hearts of Iron 2 instead and download the Arsenal of Democracy mod free of charge, you won't be missing out on much and should you want a slightly different total conversion of the World War 2 Grand Strategy experience, you simply download another mod.","May 31, 2013","false","140.4"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","33","58","0","0"

The only thing that keeps it from a full 10 is that there is no editor for AoD like the first Hearts of Iron and the worst part is that the description is a lie. There is NO editor with the game nor is there a seperate editor tool, the only way to edit is the old fashioned way, screwing around with save game files using wordpad and/or notepad.\n\nEven without a real editor however you can still accomplish a great deal with wordpad editing with hoi 1 and 2, something hoi 3 lacks is the freedom to edit with wordpad (most hoi 3 files, mainly the save games and scenario files, are   in a file format not compatable with wordpad.)\n\nOverall it is better than the successor, hoi 3 in every way except map graphics, particularly because the regions in hoi 3 on the US dont take into account the accurate shape of the states where in all hoi games precedding, the states are accurately shaped by region and province shape.\n\nThey should remove from the list of features that (or at least rephrase it to point out that the files are wordpad editable instead of insinuating a non-existant editor) the hints of an editor that doesn't exist before someone decides to bash them with false advertisement OR solve the problem altogether by making an editor for AoD much like the first Hearts of Iron Scenario Editor which had an interactive map in which to set province ownership and the like.\n\nIf an editor exists for AoD then I would appreciate anyone messaging me or leaving a comment on my profile if the former is not possible with information on where to get it.\n\nAside from the lies about an editor however the game is great and is both historical and ahistorical as the AIs don't always make the same choices every game, meaning a lot of "what-if" scenarios can happen (Like the possibility of Germany mobilizing late, Stalin deciding not to purge his officers or Japan not attacking Pearl Harbor, though the major historical events the AI usually chooses the historical outcome often.)\n\nSo all in all, great game, 9 out of 10, if they put in a user-friendly editor to make the lies not lies, then it would be a 10, until they decide to do that however, it remains an imperfect yet high 9/10.\n\nI highly reccomend this game with or without an editor due to the large array of choices you have at your disposal when managing your country (such as taking steps to turn america into a dictatorship, or being a non-insane hitler who focuses on the USSR instead of world domination or even playing as the Soviets and being the reason for WW2 instead of germany or even the very difficult yet still possible scenario where France doesn't become a cheese eating surrender monkey and actually fights the second world war.)","April 12, 2015","true","56.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, there are some issues here that make it difficult for me to recommend. Most of these issues boil down to learning curve and how much time you're willing to commit to figuring the game out. There are a few in-game tutoials, and the manual is easy enough to find on-line, but it's still a very difficult game to get your arms around. The tutorials are enough to get you started, but probably cover about 1% of the in game scenarios.\n\nThe manual gives a broad overview, but didn't shed any light on issues that I had with playability. I found units behaving contrary to orders that I was giving frequently. I had no doubt that the behavior was rational given the rules of the game, but became frustrated trying to figure it out without any feedback from the game. This was a shame, because the level of effort put into historical accuracy is impressive, as is the amount of control the designers are trying to offer.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but after three hours of wrestling with the interface, I decided to try something else. Maybe I gave up too soon, but with the number of available games on Steam at this price point, it seemed like I was needlessly banging my head against the wall instead of enjoying myself.","November 9, 2015","false","4.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Do you like WWII games? Then you'll enjoy Arsenal of Democracy: A Hearts of Iron Game being in your library. You start the game either from a sandbox like scenario where you can conquer the world, or a preset one involving yourself in some of history's biggest military operations for either the Allies or the Axis powers.\n\nAs listed on the store page, 'extensive modding capabilities' is true to its word, only if you are willing to shift through thousands of lines of code to make your own stories and/or just want to plain out Save Edit your save.\n\nThere are plenty of cheat codes for the game that don't require any external changes to program itself. For example, here are a few for just fun: 'oil = 5000 Oil; rare = 5000 Rare Resources; manpower = 5000 Manpower". There are plenty more, but I rather show one other example. 'Event 46' & 'Event 47' are listed as 'event cheat codes' where triggering them in the game will do as they say, in this case; these events cause the liberation of Korea and its divide into both North and South Koreas.\n\nGraphically wise, this game more less emulates the charm of older games. When using sprites, it shows that vibe of older PC games of days gone past and the world itself functions fine. Giving commands or doing most actions can be a little confusing at first, but playing through the tutorial can easily clear up any issues.","June 2, 2015","true","99.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
