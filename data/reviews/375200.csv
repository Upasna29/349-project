But the most impactful change with your choices is 2 CG arts within the game you can only get by chosing wisely.\n\nThe story focuses on a female knight in training named Raelin, There are like 4 girls you can romance in the game ( actually 5 if you count r@pe ).\nRaelin has a rare gift known as farseeing, giving her the ability to spy on someone's most private moments without them knowing it. but because of this rare gift, She not well trusted among her comrades. I would say more but this is a game where you should expierience the story instead of me telling you.\n\nThis game will take you about 4 to 5 hours to complete, but if you are trying to get all CG Arts ( which you should ) It'll take about an extra 2 hours to 100% everything!\n\nThis is a fun game ( well visual novel ) filled with tons of sexy fan service and an interesting story to back it up. This is the first chapter of the Sakura Fantasy series so there's bound to be more chapters coming soon.\n\nIf you love Anime, a good story, beautiful art, fan service & hentai ( There are hentai moments in this game but worry not, Nothing besides cleverly censored naked bodies and bondage like moments ) You'll thoroughly enjoy this game.\n\nKeep in mind that this game ISN'T for kids! Overall, This is a fun and enjoyable little gem that's worth a purchase!\n\nAlso this game is 100% Yuri! ^-^","July 27, 2015","true","9.2"," 70 of 80 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","70","80","5","0"

If you've played the other Sakura games, i.e, Sakura Spirit or Sakura Angels, then you have a good idea of what this game will be about, and if you're a fan of the series and or want to see some yuri-boobie-fanservice galore then you should get this game. If you're a first-timer of the series, then this game is a Visual Novel, which means it's just a story that is portraid through pictures and text, there are more choices to be had this time around, but they are few and far between and only make a slight difference on which character's boobies you're going to see.\n\nTL;DR: If you like anime-like 2D story-telling Visual Novels with a decent plot and whole lot of that other type of plot "wink wink" and or you're a fan of the previous Sakura series, then I recommend this game.","May 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 78 of 105 people (74%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","74","78","105","30","0"

I have to say that is has more of a plot compared to the others, you'll also get to make a lot of choices now which is good thing. Really starting to enjoy it now especially since the plot is much bigger this time than just bewbs and the soundtrack is also very well done. Though my favorite in the series is still Sakura Spirit, mainly for nostalgic purposes and the charming characters. This series might actually be as good as it or maybe even better. It's a little weird how they actually reused some of the character models from Sakura Angels but they made quite a few adjustments so that you will be able to think of them as entirely new characters. Definitely recommend this if you are a big fan of the franchise as I am :) I'm currently waiting for Chpater 2 to be released which should be sometime in July as announced by Winged Cloud. There are also rumors that the next 2 games will be called Sakura Dungeon and Sakura Beach. So there is  a lot to look forward to this year from Winged Cloud.","May 30, 2015","true","3.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","36","45","5","0"

I truly enjoyed reading through this and actually having to think about the multiple choices it gave you. I also went into the extra's screen and found that some of the images were "Locked" so I also hope to backtrack and choose the right decisions to unlock those certain images; I'm aniticipating it already.\nI really hope they can release the next chapter very soon beause the storyline was pure beauty, the emotions and feelings I expressed while playing this game were phenomenal. I actually want to know what will happen next in this game. I'm going to check Greenlight every few days now, I really want the next chapter. Will they find the fallen star? Will the slime monster make a second appearance? Who is "She"? So many questions left unanswered is leaving me begging for the truth.

It makes the target audience hide behind that bush and beat it there.\nSakura Fantasy Chapter 1 (for christ's sake, there's gonna be more) is the next game in the Sakura series, with twice as many boobs and 100% more male characters! ...but those are boring because they don't have breasts.\nIn this game, unlike the previous ones, you can actually see your own character, which confused me at first because usually I wake up as a weird Weeaboo-guy from a dream going to school in these games. In Sakura Fantasy you wake up as a female! In the medieval times! But a weird alternative dimension of medieval times where women are allowed to leave the house and reveal more skin than their husbands. You are Rae... Ree... Raelin? A young female knight (yes) in a knight academy, surrounded by more boo- I mean girls. These girls have two personalities: Bossy and "Notice me Senpai". You're training because you're a knight I guess and as the story progresses you meet Waifu Number 5. I mean 3. Some empress lady with a cat sitting on her chest, nothing spectacular.\nAs the story progresses you eventually find out that the town you live in is being attacked (I guess?) and that there's some sort of monsters living in a swamp, presumably Shrek. You go there in a dream for a first time, then wake up, see bossy character's ♥♥♥, story goes on, see boobs a few times and then actually go to the swamp, where a slime lady attacks you and your breast friends. I mean best friends. Later you meet some nature girl, go to her swamp village, an orc attacks, your clothes get torn, you win the game.\nI have to say, in comparison to the previous two sakura games, this one actually feels like more effort was put in the dialouge images of the characters. Instead of just changing their face they eventually move their forearm. And as silly as I described the story, this one seems to be the more explained and sense-making one, but it still gets overwhelmed by the ungodly amount of fanservice. It's literally "chose your waifu" and reading. And since you're playing as a female the game thinks it's okay to show sensual pictures of your character french kissing other females, you know, medieval things.\nI can't say anything else about this, don't buy it, this was a gift (I'll kill you one day, Steve).\nLesbians/10.","June 21, 2015","false","0.8"," 105 of 169 people (62%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","62","105","169","97","7"

If you don't mind repetitive reinforced points regarding a star and outside the walls you'll be fine. The "nude" scenes that were genuinely funny in the first two Sakura games fell very flat this time, and it felt like the developers were attempting to meet an ecchi scene status quo instead of creating rather humorous and absurd situations like the first two. That isn't to say the game isn't as funny as the first two, but rather it feels more like it is attempting to take itself serious which is not a trait that makes these games fun. Ecchi "romance" fanservice sims having that trait makes them feel soulless and frankly rather creepy than the purposefully dumb self-aware lighthearted satiristic elements in the first two games. I hope in chapter 2 the humor of the second game will return.\n\nThe art is improved from both the second and the first. They also managed to prove my long standing theory that women who wear less armor in fantasy games develop skin that is stronger than steel so there's a +1 to you developers.\nAlso, yes there is a "plot revealer" patch: https://www.patreon.com/posts/2708835\n\nThe "gameplay" is a massive improvement with quite a few choices to make and 4 waifus for you to do yuri things with. I only hope that the sequel feels a lot more tighter around the plot department than this game's saggy excuse for plot.\n\nOverall it is a decent (?) VN if you're looking for a short and quick ecchi drive-thru VN experience. Just don't expect anything more than pandering and shallow characters with laughable attempts at character development (which is really what makes these games so endearing. Remember the girl that suddenly covered herself in chocolate because a demoness said that is how you become good friends? Good times.)\n\nCan only recommend to those who find this genre hilarious for all the ridiculous writing and cliches.","June 24, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","7"

It's nothing too complicated, but the writing is better than the previous VNs. Unlike in Sakura Spirit, I didn't have to stop every sentence or so to nurse the subdural haematoma that was forming in my brain, which was a plus.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astraeakisaragi/recommended/375200/","astraeakisaragi","Astraea Kisaragi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astraeakisaragi/","378 products in account","Sakura Fantasy is yet another visual novel from studio Winged Cloud, who are "notorious" for releasing visual novels with strong ecchi content in them.\n\nWISE WORDS:\nWhile I cannot say that I played a huge number of visual novels (yet as hardcore anime fan definitely much more as your average Steam gamer), Sakura Fantasy has one fundamental difference from the most harem visual novels, which is that you - the protagonist - is just such a sexy girl, as your potentional candidates for romance.\nYes, you play as Raelin, a trainee swordswoman (a novice knight respectively) coming from the countryside, who has a slightly perverted mind, which includes peeking on others while they are nude and getting naked herself, without any feeling of shame. Her gift (basically special powers what each girl has and it varies by person) is "farseeing" which allows her soul to temporarily leave her body and look arround. Interesting trivia about Raelin is, that she has a yaeba - a single fang-like teeth visible by opened mouth, which in anime usually characterizes youthful, slightly prankster-ish, overly optimistic female characters. To give a proof about this, is that she uses often her gift to peek on the other girls while they are bathing or changing. At least that it has limited uses per day...\nBeing a character which is at no means worth less on the imagined sexiness scale as the other important female characters, gives a completly different feeling as you chop trough the game compared your classic male VS many girls typical harem visual novel, especially if the main guy is kicked arround by the girls like some soccerball.\nExcept this, another positive thing what made the game enjoyable, that all main characters are very emphatic. Your best friend, the blonde blue-eyed noble Gwynne cares about you a lot. Your instructor, the serious tan-skinned Keira who is very strict on training, cares about you. Empress Ardena, who otherwise shows a cold aura to the outside world - cares about you. (despite that you don't even recognize her at your first guard duty in the palace) Basically everybody who means something in the game cares about you a lot. Isn't friendship between girls fantastic? It makes me even think that the target audience for this game are actually girls.\n\nSTORY:\nThis game is entirely linear with no standalone routes for the different characters. The offered choices have minimal impact onto the game itself - usually only about with which girl you want spend your free time, have a kissing contest or a classic lesbian sex intercourse. Since it lacks particular routes, you can freely switch between the girls and nobody will accuse you of cheating.\nRegarding the depth of the story - it's a working fantasy story with a few ocassional jokes and with no real surprises. A star has fallen from the sky and the empress needs a volenteer group to check it out in the cursed swamps, where nobody has balls to set foot in. Good thing that we are all girls, so nobody has even balls by default... Although the depth of the story is very often shallowed by generic ecchi scenes like slimes eating down the heroines armor or tentacles groping their "finer parts".\nSurprisingly there are even fights and we get a slight cliffhanger on the end - but it's like see you in chapter 2, which also tells that the game is short, a way too short. Let's hope that the new chapter fixes this, though I'm not too much fan of this game chaptering - considering the game lenght, the two chapters should be one game.\n\nART:\nI already gave a few hints that the game has a lot of eyecandy. This isn't only true for the perverted scenes, but generally the girls, the backgrounds, the scene CG's look fantasic. The girls are sexy yet cute, adult yet young, strong yet femine, which not many anime artist can do properly. The responsible artist for this is Waneca. His designs reminds me a lot the art of the famous Hitoshi Oshiki.\nFunnily - while noname characters aren't really important - basically no male characters here are important in any way, art-wise they are at least one league bellow the females. The unnamed female trainee looks somehow comparable to Raelin and co, but males just don't. Even your fellow guardsman in palace (to me the only guy who had some good lines) stays the whole time entirely covered in armor. Don't think I'm some feminist or what, but I didn't really minded this one. Girl power!\n\nAUDIO:\nThe music goes well with the game. It felt good when I was playing, but I will not put a track from it to my phone as a ringtone.\nWhat far more unfortunate - the game entriely lacks voice acting, which is quite the bummer since Winged Cloud managed to hire such famous japanese voice actors for Sakura Angel. It would just feel nice to hear Keira or "myself".\n\nTHE AWAITED BAD:\nOf course this game at no means cannot be compared to professional visual novels. The only thing where it really can stand it's ground it's the professional art design, but everything else is just mediocre. The shortcoming of this game are basically included in the word itself - it's a way too short and has no "comings" meaning that the game lacks choices making a noticable difference to the story.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nSo is the game worth picking up or not? I would say definitely yes, if you catch it on a good sale. If I forget about the "oh wow nude girls let's get it" or the "too linear, too short, not worth" generic opinions this game truly shines by the great cast of characters who grow to your heart. After finishing the game, I felt like I'm Raelin and cannot wait when I can meet up with the others (maybe for some girly fun). Each on his/her own, but for me this can completly change my standpoint to any game, especially when the theme is anime.\n\nTHE UNMENTIONABLES:\nThe game has a uncensored patch which changes some CGs and makes bodyparts - what only girls have, entirely visible. If somebody feels that he wants try the game from the hentai view, should go for it.","April 19","true","2.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","3"

They're planning on releasing a chapter 2, but with this playtime I don't think I'll be paying again for it. I hope it'll be updated as free DLC or something like that.\n\nApart from that, this is shaping up to be quite the story. This Sakura title builds up the world more than previous ones, as well as spending more time to get to know each individual character (backstory wise and body wise).\n\nI'm actually quite digging the story, to be honest. It is set in a world of unrest and there is only one city, the capital remaining of humankind - I know right, apocalyptic boobs?? A mysterious star falls from the sky, and it could change the course of humankind, but only the thousands of years-old Empress knows why. Our heroes set out on a suicide mission (dark eh?) to find the star and find out its meaning! What will they find beyond the walls? Monsters, lots of quality bonding time ;) and maybe the salvation of humankind.\n\nOf course there's lots of walking into rooms when someone is changing, or seeing your best friend naked in the bathhouse.

The characters don't really stand out, and what little of their personalities we see aren't really touched on. The world isn't built up enough, simply going to the old 'World is in turmoil, and we live secluded in a city' plot, that, while it can be an interesting way to set up your story, it can fail hard when not given more depth. If the writer had taken more time to flesh out the chapter, then maybe it could've pulled it out of the blandness that it ended up becoming.\n\nThe art is better than before, giving characters more poses and backgrounds more of an immersive feel, but, overall, it's not really something we haven't seen done better by other developers with less of an art budget. Not to mention the CGs tend to leave something to be desired (and not just nudity, haha). They just seem a bit lackluster for what an artist can really do. They're the images that aren't bound by the need to be compatible with multiple poses and animation, so they can throw a lot more detail in, but they just go for the same amount that we can see in the character sprites, which is disappointing.\n\nThe sound/music isn't anything that we haven't heard before in the previous games, and it's not great, but not bad, either.\n\nAnd do NOT get me started on visual novels that lack complex decision trees. THAT'S where the fun in playing them lies, because you feel the weight of your decisions firsthand, thus making you think about what you decide what to do next, rather than just 'pick your scene/heroine' gameplay, which can be interesting, if the writing and art can make up for it, but referring back to my previous statements, they don't.\n\nWhenever I play one of the Sakura games, I always feel like I'm reading an anime, or rather that Winged Cloud really wants their visual novel to be an anime rather than a visual novel. Others can do it quite well (e.g. Steins;Gate), but if Sakura Fantasy were to become one by some extreme stroke of luck, it would be half-♥♥♥♥♥, even then.\n\nThe developers of the Sakura series need to seriously get their heads out of their asses, and learn from their mistakes, rather than producing more bland wastes of time that just put visual novel games in even more of a bad light than they already are.\n\nAll I'm glad for is that Steam refunds are possible, because this game isn't worth the money I spent to play it, and unless Winged Cloud manages to make something worth my time, I'll never purchase their games again, and I hope that no one else does either, because no person deserves to have to play through a game as boring as this.","June 27, 2015","false","2.2"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","21","34","3","0"

You have many choices to make and they are relivent (diffrent choices allow for diffrent collectible pictures to unlock. Replay value for the 100%ers out there!) It is worth it.","May 30, 2015","true","7.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

Also, I found that the choices I made didn't tend to make much of a difference.

Swim Club has a compressed story but remains satisfying even after I've read through it several times, regardless of the sex scenes. While it was disappointing at first (and my review of the first one still stands) Sakura Beach featured colorful personality to its characters, making it much easier to get engaged once I understood how the characters interacted with one another.\n\nThis though.....this should be a triple-A title.\n\nThe abundance of choices does nothing to water down the detail - even something as simple as a knight on guard duty affects not only your interpretation of the storyline, but has a subtle effect on watching the main heroine's development. I found that I was reminded of two games I deeply enjoy - inFAMOUS, known for tying good and evil into a delicate decision-based karma system, and the Tales series, which once put emphasis on choices that determined who stood by you the most when you were at your worst.\n\nThe rich detail, the improved music, even the choice to go to a visible female lead instead of a background male one - everything about Sakura Fantasy takes the best of RPGs, eroges, and VNs and puts it together in one seamless chapter. I will DEFINITELY purchase the others when they are released!\n\nOh, and my complaint? Only that this isn't a Tales game itself.

Hands down. I think the fact that this is the first game in a longer series made the story much better. The first half of this game is all about introducing us to the characters, getting to known them and their backstories a bit, and just getting a general feel for the setting. The second half is where things get actiony and they tease ever so slightly at what is to come in later installments. The writing in this is so much better than previous games it's astounding. This might be my favorite Sakura game so far, either this or Swim Club cause that one is super great too. The art is perfect as always, Wanaca never disappoints. I'm excited for Chapter 2 and hope the wait for it won't be too long.\n\nI also really liked that the MC is female for a change. It gives the game a much different feel than the other Sakura games. The MC also has a fun little power that lets her basically project her mind and become the best peeping tom ever.

I am not very well-versed when it comes to visual novels. Not particularly a fan of them, either.  Largely because I generally don't consider them to be games. Look at Skyrim, Devil May Cry, or Metal Gear Solid. All of those are games. Because you take active role in what happens in those games. Visual novels, on the other hand, are products where you generally read a wall of text with characters on screen making facial expressions to match their emotions. I prefer my games where I do something other than just sit and read. If I wanted to read, I would read a book. But that's a different topic. Right now, I am going to review Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1.\n\nSakura Fantasy is a game that draws you in with the promise of anime girls in various states of undress and sexuality. And for the first few hours, it seems to be just that. Our protagonist heroine, Raelin, is a knight-to-be, born with the ability of far-seeing that allows her to seeing into places that is not in her line of sight hence the name. Which everyone assumes she uses to spy on other people in their private moments. And despite her denial when asked directly, she actually does.\n\nBut is it truly a boob/yuri-fest and nothing more? It is true that those exist. But it's not all that this novel is about. It delivers a compelling story with an interesting setting. If you can look past the nudity, and are able to ignore that "itchy" feeling you get inbetween your legs.\n\nI don't like being that person but... If you are a fan of anime, like anime girls and/or possess an artistic appreciation for the female body, there is a good chance you will like this game. If you don't like the female physique being treated as a mere object, dislike anime or nudity in any form of media, it's more than likely that you will hate this "game". This is a "game" targeted for open-minded individuals who have no qualms about nudity in their stories/games.","August 23, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of it to go around, including a whole lot of chocolate...\nWell, there are people who dream about literally swimming in cash, so chocolate isn't so far off if you think about it...\nWhat makes this story different from the other Sakura novels currently released, you may ask? A female avatar. That's right, you play a girl in this one! And it doesn't take long for you to realise it either... I must say, putting on underwear isn't that time-consuming...\nBut yeah, you play a woman in a regiment seemingly composed entirely of other women, including a rock-hard drill instructor. (10 points if you get that joke once you start reading.) And of course, you end up on an adventure in a desolate swampland... What is this? I thought this was supposed to be a light-hearted erotica. Oh wait, perverted slimes... never mind.\nBut once again, there's no actual nudity in this game. There are scenes which imply nudity, and some slightly exposing pictures to keep you running. But that's as far as Steam will allow it to go... Oh, and some girls kissing. That works too.\nBut I'm going to stop rambling on now and simply get to the point: A decent story to give some foundation to the more or less erotic pictures you'll come across over the... say, 30 minutes or so it'll take to read through this thing once. But don't feel ashamed if your total time clocks higher than that: There are plenty of routes to take for more (or less) fanservice! Just don't expect any of your choices to have much of an impact on the story... It is a novel, not a "choose-your-own-adventure" game.\nAnyway, with all that said, I'm going to go find something to eat... I wonder if there's any chocolate in the fridge...","July 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It deserves a 4.2/5 for good reasons. There are more choices than previous games, there is a good story going here and the choices seem more relevant. Looking forward to more. The CG as usual great. They keep this up, a 5 might be closer than they think. The idea of the story and setting is quite nice and the characters grow more in but as the story goes it all depends. I look forward to chapter 2.  I recommend it. It has definitely taken steps up from previous games how it goes from here we'll see.\nAs far as this goes, hope more characters join in and the story continues to grow as well unlike previous ones.\nAlso would like to see if they do have an end route after transfer of saves, that helps a lot more crossing fun.\nIf they ever cross characters from previous games though and add them to route and cg, that'd be interesting.\nHowever you got to play it yourself to understand.

My favorite Sakura Game so far.\n\nSakura Fantasy Chapter 1\nA yuri VN with choices that doesn't matter except to get all the CGs in the gallery. Well, here we are, a story about a kingdom suffering from some kind of invasion by dark nature, have you watch Naussica? Well, it's something like that. Somehow a disease has infected the land and is slowly eating everything in its way.\n\nTo stop this the Empress, kind of a authority figure, orders Raelin, a cadet in the forces of the empire, to embark herself and two of her friends, on a search for a fallen star that will help the empire restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAnd that's it, that's the story of this chapter. We play as Raelin in her way to get the star while in the meantime get closer to her companions, and I mean really closer to them.\n\nPros.\n- Art style (Sakura art style). Really nice done.\n- Music. Is not that good but it isn't that bad either.\n- Story. It's really interesting, and not that short as it seems.\n- 18+ patch (I know you want it)\n\nCons.\n- There is some content full of "plot" that damage the story.\n- No news on the second chapter for more that 9 months\n\nThis is my favorite one of the Sakura games and I'm really hoping for a second chapter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GangstasParadise/recommended/375200/","GangstasParadise","FoxyTrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GangstasParadise/","39 products in account","Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 is the second VN of the Sakura series that I've reviewed. It has many interesting changes from other VN's in the Sakura series that are welcomed and make this VN unique. I'll cover some topics, such as the story, characters, and how well it presents the story and characters. TL:DR: It's a good read, lots more content than other Sakura VNs.\n\nStory:\n\nOur story begins with our protagonist, Raelin, struggling to wake up and get her armor on before morning formation at the military barracks she is staying at. From here we begin to learn more about the world and the various problems faced by humanity. There are individuals with powers called gifts, and Raelin's gift is the ability for Farsight, which allows her to see what others are doing or see specific areas. Her gift makes her the target for being called a pervert and we see more than once just what positives and negatives come from being able to spy on anyone. The story gives you many interesting elements and brings them together nicely, but the danger of the Mires really isn't pressed as much as I imagined it would. This however isn't a problem as it ties in well with just how unknown and strange the Mires really are. Since this is only chapter one the story ends on a cliffhanger, but it has a fantastic build up to that point and keeps the reader entertained rather well.\n\nCharacters:\n\nOur main protagonist is Raelin, a young novice hoping to one day become a knight. Raelin, together with her best friend Gwynne and many other novices, is trained by Kiera, a knight with a dark past, and is constantly pushed to get better as a warrior. Raelin doesn't show any huge amounts of growth as a character since she isn't given any apparent shortcomings as we begin the VN, however this in no way means that she's a bland character, which has happened in other VNs from Winged Cloud. Gwynne is a different story however, while she's a very talented and smart individual she isn't as strong or as skilled as other novices when it comes to warfighting. While she improves on this regard it isn't the focal point of her character, she's very caring of Raelin and acts as a mother figure many times. Kiera, the instructor of the novices, is tough on her class. It's brought up many times that she had a pretty dark past, and we eventually learn why she is the way she is on her students. This was done nicely and she was definitely and interesting character to have in the story.\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe visuals looks very nice and the *lewd* scenes are a welcome part. What I liked about this VN the most compared to other VNs from Winged Cloud is that we have a lot more options and our choices do have more impact, maybe that's why we have 50+ save slots. While we do have a lot more options they don't directly influence the outcome of the story but our interactions with other characters. Many people might believe that this is just the illusion of choice but it does play on the "tradition" of the Sakura series that these choices are there for you to see who you consider to be "best girl." I would like to see actual story impacting choices in chapter 2 as well as the best girl choices we have now. I can definitely say I recommend this VN and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Another difference are decision times, which are much more frequent, which gives you a bit more freedom. It has maybe too much fan service, which sometimes ruin the moment, yet it kind of intensifies the bond between those characters. The story itself will probably really start in chapter 2, since this is kind of foreplay. :P\n\nStill can´t wait for another part :3\nOverall rating for me would be 8,5/10","May 31, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I bought it on a whim to see whether I'd like the genre. I would have preferred not to write a negative review out of respect to fans and the devs, especially considering all the positive reviews, but after buying just this one game, Steam now thinks I'm a genre fan and is recommending mostly visual novels. So, unfortunately I have to post a negative review in the hopes that Steam will stop doing that.\n\nThe artwork is nice. The music is rather well done. As someone unfamiliar with this genre, I found the story very short and childish, but that's probably the point. Interestingly, the engine they used is open source and written largely in Python, and it actually allows for very complex dialogue branching and other functionality, such as complex animation and even video playback. The devs opted not to use most of those functions apparently. I suppose, again, that is standard for the genre.","June 1, 2015","false","6.1"," 13 of 48 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","13","48","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/375200/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","OVERVIEWSakura Fantasy (chapter 1) is an almost all-female fantasy anime visual novel with erotic scenes. Being on Steam the scenes are very tame, but there is an adults-only patch available for free download if you're so inclined.\n\nThe protagonist is Raelin, a young female warrior-in-training with a special ability, farsight, that enables her to concentrate and observe events from a distance, unseen.\n\nGraphicsThe scenes are nicely drawn, but often repeated, making the story seem even slower. The characters are beautiful, as you'd expect from Winged Cloud, but again, expressions and poses are often repeated, and the creative use of animation and movement seen in Sakura Angels is not quite as good here.\n\nSoundMusic is acceptable, and sound effects few and far between. The game is almost entirely voiced in Japanese, though, which is great. I don't speak Japanese well enough to know if the voices are sticking to the dialogue, but they sound professional and akin to many an anime that I've seen in quality.\n\nGameplaySakura Fantasy plays like any other visual novel: you read the story in a window at the bottom while looking at context-specific backgrounds and characters, sometimes complete with animations, on the rest of the screen. You make choices at certain points in the story for Raelin, the main character, and otherwise you watch and read. There's nothing new to the genre in Sakura Fantasy.\n\nThe story itself is quite slow and long winded. Raelin Raelin's friend, Gwynn, and teacher, Keira, are the most common characters you'll encounter, and they accompany her when the Empress sends Raelin on a quest into the wilderness.\n\nSakura Fantasy is an adult entry in Winged Cloud's lineup, however, and the story is interspersed with a number of graphical scenes of a sensual, if not sexual, nature, particularly when Raelin makes creative use of her special ability. I found most of these scenes fairly gratuituous, as if the plot took a quick sideline just as an excuse for another bathing scene, and they could have done with a bit more subtlety. But the art is nice.\n\nPROS AND CONS\nPros:\n+ Nice art featuring a host of attractive anime girls\n+ Adult patch available, but not forced on you if you're not into that sort of thing\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- The story is fairly bland and takes a long time to actually get anywhere, and then it stops (end of chapter 1)\n- Some poor writing and a number of grammatical errors\n- No achievements, which would have been a great addition\n\nCONCLUSIONSakura Fantasy (Chapter 1) is not as fun so interesting a story as some other visual novels on Steam, such as Winged Cloud's Sakura Angels.\n\nI'm a fan of anime and enjoy visual novels, but there are better ones out there. I hope Winged Cloud improve the story for the next chapter. I still recommend Sakura Fantasy (Chapter 1) if you like anime visual novels, particularly if you enjoy a bit of gratuitious anime nudity and don't mind installing a patch.\n\n6/10","June 1","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
