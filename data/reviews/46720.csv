It's been years since I played it, so my memory might be hazy, but I did play it to completion and remember it being serviceable, if a bit buggy (IE, one map required me to defend a building with my Hero unit and a few basic infantrymen, and all of the infantrymen died, except for one that somehow got 20 levels ahead of everybody else and became death personified). If you want some kind of RTS-lite type of fantasy game to amuse yourself for a weekend, then go for it, and if you don't like it you're only out ten bucks. Otherwise, stick with Warcraft or Spellforce or something.\n\nI'll reccomend it, but it's sort of a 'meh' reccomendation than a "ZOMG GET IT NAO" one. It works and it's amusing, but other games have done it better.","April 22, 2014","true","14.6"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

You use right click to move.\nYou have to constantly fight your units including your hero to not blindly rush into a large agro mob.   Really hard to figure out how to do combos and really not worth figuring it out.\nOver all its a no go for me!  Beware.","November 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The tutorial is pretty straight-forward and clear but yes, even the tutorial feels like an unfinished product to me","October 17, 2014","false","0.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"
