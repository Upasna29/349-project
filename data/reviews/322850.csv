In the new training schedule you can only see your form,freshness,tiredness and cadance for only like 4 weeks, so you cannot see what your form and tiredness will be in like 3 months if you change something, you really have to think forward.\nYou can also not decide what your team does, even not when you are by far the leader, and your team will do very annoying things like chasing you down when you attack, yes your own team chases you when you attack sometimes.\nIt also happens alot that when I do a little intermediate sprint that my teammate stays in front of me protecting me (even though i'm sprinting) and takes the important bonus seconds/points in front of me.\nIt also happens alot that when you train for example: mountains, that you will get increased hills/sprint stats instead of mountain stats.\n\nAswell in the pro cyclist mode as in career mode the AI trolls you alot, like in a classic when you look 5 seconds to your teammate who is behind, every1 attacks, if you follow the attack, no1 will pace, even though you are not the favourite/fast guy of the group. But when you don't follow, they will pace like mad men, so that you can't come back. Sometimes the right click button doesn't work (that you use to follow somebody or protect somebody), and you have to click like 10 times on it to get it working again.\nThey have also added u23 races, well guess what, 9/10 races are just races with the same parcour of a classic but just with u23 riders participating, the amount of times I have seen races with the same parcour as the gp Camaiore...\nI also suggest to not put the level of vegetation on ultra because then you won't see anything of the road anymore because of the large trees.\nAnd there are also other annoying things but i'm not going to mention that now.\n\nAlso something to mention: all the national championships contain parcours of 2012 (and a very few of them have the parcours of 2013). 2012,really,that's 3 years ago and it's not even hard to make a national championship parcours, you just gotta make 1 lap of 10-15 km's and let the riders ride over it like 10 times. Even I would be able to make a descent nc parcours even though I barely used the stage editor.\nTalking about the stage editor, you can use that to make your own classics/stages, but good luck finding out how to use that thing because there is no tutorial of it at all and it's pretty complicated to use it.\n\nThe multiplayer, oh boy...\n\nWhen you start a race, most of the times you will have like 60 seconds to select your teammates and bicycle parts for the race, that's not enough time at all if you have a lot of cards.\nAlso if 1 guy crashes or rage quits when starting up a game, the game will never start so you will have to restart, this happens like 50% of the times.\nPeople who have played the previous pcm's can link their account to pcm 15 and get a lot of gold, so people who have never played a previous pcm will have to play with their ♥♥♥♥ team against people with legendary riders who are impossible to beat.\n\nThe game also crashes alot and everytime when something happens in a race (for example someone attacks) you will get a huge fps drop, so in the beginning and final of the race you will get that like every 15 seconds.\n\nFor people who play pcm for the first time: alot of the names are fake, you will have to go to a site like pcmdaily.com or pcm focus to download a database there to get the good names/jerseys/better stats.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBeside the "be a pro mode" (that is buggy as hell), nothing changed and the game is unstable,\nI suggest if you have like pcm 13/14 and you don't care about the multiplayer, keep that and try find a 2015 database for it because it's the same game as pcm 15 but less bugs\n\nIf you never played pcm before and you are interested in it, I definitely recommend to try it, but don't expect to be blown away, you can always ask steam for a refund if you don't like it :)","July 1, 2015","false","93.6"," 224 of 258 people (87%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","87","224","258","23","6"

You create your own rider, where you can choose your riders nationality, age, height and weight. You can also choose skin colour and a profile picture for your rider.\nAll in all you don't get a lot of customization options.\n\nThe big decision is in choosing your focus in your career; are you going to be a climber competing with Vroome and Contador or are you competing for the green jersey with Sagan.\n\nYour starting stats are decided from what you chose as your focus, and the age of your rider.\n\nAs you start the game, you get the choice of 3 teams, usually from the country you chose. You can choose the worst team, and become the captain, or choose a higher ranking team, get access to bigger races, but having to ride for your captain.\n\nWhen entering your main hub after choosing your team, you get into the familiar career menu. Only here you have less options. The only thing you can really adjust is your training schedule.\n\nIf you toughen up your training schedule, you will level up at a faster race, but of course you will suffer from more fatigue.\n\nLeveling up increases your stats in what ever area you are trying to improve your rider in. If you are trying to win the Tour de France, you will quickly get improved Mountain, Time Trial and Restitution.\n\nTo level up, you can gain XP by training, finishing races in top positions and getting in the early breakaway.\n\nIn the races you can control your rider with 4 and 8 on the numpad to move him right and left. Or using 5 and 8 to increase or decrease his effort.\n\nUnlike career mode, in Pro Cyclist mode you can't look at other groups other than the group, your rider is currently in, which means if you are in a breakaway, you can't see who is leading the chase in the peloton, and instead have to use other means to figure out how much of a chance you have of winning.\n\nAll in all this game mode is a great improvement to a game franchise which desperately needed a new game mode.\n\nCheck out my newly started Lets Play of the new game mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H98Ce7kUWM","June 19, 2015","true","167.5"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","66","83","11","1"

I really like the 1st player career mode, only a few weeks into the season but it is a great addition to a game that over the last few years hasn't added much. Which is why typically I don't suggest buying the new game until it has been out a while. As always with a new game it will crash occastionally and I'm sure they will put out patches soon as the game as only been out 2 days now.\n\n1st person career mode:\nYou determine what type of cyclist you want to be (sprinter, climber, stage races, et cetera).\nThen pick your team, typically a contentional or contentional pro team.\nYou have a race director or tell you want he would like you do during the race (just like in old career modes you used to give to your riders). So he declares you the leader, or free element, or teammate, and gives specific instructions like don't attack, ride in the breakaway, follow counter attacks, et cetera.\nYou have a small number of points that you are allowed to use to adjust your race schedule during the year, which is nice when you want to get more training in.\nYou select how much workload for your training, which in effect hurts your freshness for when races come up, so you need to decide how many rest days you want.\nOverall just a great addition, and as always if you like the career mode as a manager that has changed a little, they do R&D now on equipment, but quickly other than that I didn't see any major changes from previous version of the game.\n\nSo far I highly recommend this game if you like cycling. I will update if any major issues arise.","June 20, 2015","true","71.9"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","43","54","6","0"

The idea and concept of the game is fantastic. The fact that the AI riders seem to react differently to my rider then the other 199 AI riders is flat ridiculous. Im not the top ranked rider so why can any other rider decide to breakaway but if I do or follow a breakaway the pack is right on my heels? How are riders able to maintain when they are completely out of both bars of energy? If that happens to me my rider drops back like hes sitting still. When is pro cyclist mode I can see my teammates killing themselves to keep up yet still maintain and recover as fast as I do when I keep my bars almost full. Then lets get to the crazy numberous amount of bugs that no one seems to be working on or care about as they are posted and made awhere of. Im into season 4 of pro cyclist and now all the sudden my mouse pointer freezes on the screen and you have to move your mouse around guessing where it is till you get lucky enough to scroll over something with it and the icon changes colors a tad. Yes the game is playable like this but I refuse to waste my time trying to figure out where my mouse is. Ive had the game over a month with alot of crashes and a pop up that asks me to send my data to help the developers work on a fix. I cant find anywhere that someone from the game has responded or gave info on any fixes for the future.

There are two main modes that are commonly played throughout the community (Career, and Pro Cyclist Mode)\n\nCareer-\nThe career mode is great if you like to control a whole team. The pros about this mode are it is easy to understand. You can change every aspect about your team and can master the manager part. It is always hard to choose which team you want to choose at the beginning of a career, and this game helps your choices. You can choose between any of the three   divisions to select your team (Cya World Tour, Contintental Pro, and Continental) You can filter alphabetically or by the amount of stars they possess (Overall Rating) The cons about this mode are, when selecting a team, they should also give you sponsor details (i.e. Sponsor Budget and Length of contract) Also in this mode there are no major advancements from pcm 2014. Overall this game mode is adicting and very fun. I would recommend this mode to anyone who likes a team and realistic aspect.\n\nPro Cyclist Mode-\nThis mode is amazing. You can control everything about your rider during the race and out of race (Height, Weight, Complexion, Nationality, you can even change the picture of your rider) The gameplay of this mode is outstanding. There are no downsides to this mode except you should be able to do something with the money you earn. I would reccoment this game to anyone who likes fantasy due to the fake Cyanide Cups at the beginning and the fact that you are not a real pro cyclist.\n\nOverall this game is the best one out there. The gameplay is amazing no matter what mode you play in. It's super addicting and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not at the controls. This game is for people who truly love the sport of cycling. If you don't know much about the sport, the tutorials will help you further your knowledge about professional cycling. I'll give it a 9.25/10 rating because of the crashes the might happen in the loading screen. Tip: Don't Click ANYTHING during the loading screen of a race.","June 24, 2015","true","92.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","11","17","5","0"

Also the game has crashed quite a few times, and there are some periods in some of my games that I can get past because of this.\n\nOverall I do enjoy the general feel of PCM, but the requirement of a custom DB and the many crashes makes me feel like I have wasted my money.

Both the career mode and pro mode are a lot of fun, but like so many other people the game is crashing for me constantly.  I had hoped that since I purchased it so long after release they would have worked out the problem with patches, but as of Feb 2016 it's still a huge problem.  I've tried loading the game with the default settings as well as the updates and database patches, and have problems either way.  It's too bad a really fun game is ruined by the companies inability or refusal (not sure which) to address the bugs.\n\nUpdate:  after experiencing a few crashes with the original game, I downloaded and installed a new database and "fixes" from PCMdaily.  This just made the problem worse, causing me to be completely unable to proceed in my carrer in PRO mode after about the 4th race.\n\nI decided to start from scratch and uninstall the new database and game, then re-install the base game again without any mods.  So far it's been working fine for me through about 10 races, with no crashes.  Hopefully this time around it continues, but I still can't change my recommendation yet until I see how reliably I can continue to play.\n\nUpdate 2: Well, I made it almost through an entire season with my pro after the clean install, but then started getting the crashes again.

I've spent over 550 hours playing the pro rider version of this game (which is a hell of a long time by anyone's version of addition).  But I haven't actually played it for an entire week.  Why?  Well for the 4th bloody time the game has just taken a huge investment of time and effort and just packaged the whole thing up and dropped a vast turd on the whole thing.  Entire well developed pro rider scenario just GONE.  Two times winner of Spain.  One time winner of Italy.  Fourth placed result in France.  BANG  whole thing gone.  Can see the cdb files in my documents, but the game just won't recognise them.  So I've tried loading them for a week, and now , just can no longer be bothered.  If Cyanide wants to get in touch with me with a solution I'd love to hear it.  But THIS IS THE FOURTH BLOODY TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.  And even though I loved this game, it's just not worth the trouble.\n\nCreating a rider and investing hundreds of hours in their development does not deserve to be greeted with a complete scenario crash.  It is seriously not suitable for windows 10.0. When you've got a 2 Gb graphics card and the game only detects 115Mb in graphics memory, and you spend HOURS trying to fix this...  Too buggy.  Too temporamental.  Too heart breaking.  Yes DC Universe online can be bloody annoying, but compared to this game it's a walk in the park...  Immersing yourself in a senario and gthen having the whole thing just crashing is heart breaking.

Whenever I simulate, I always get near last position, despite my cyclist being already decent stat-wise.\n\nThe second thing is... the UI. It's a disaster, I don't know what the devs were thinking. PCM's 2014 UI was perfect, it had a nice graphics, nice buttons, smart placements, everything.\nNow:\n- the menus are a mess.\n- there are tons of UI bugs everywhere, going from buttons that can't be clicked on because there are UI elements over them, to scrolling pads not working.\n- the new icons are ugly. And believe me, that's stuff that I usually can't care less about. But these look like they were made by a photoshop beginner, while last year's were pretty damn cool.\n- the fonts are simply unreadable. Again, I just cannot understand why there was a need to change things. It was perfect in PCM 2014 but now everything is barely readable, and I'm mostly speaking - unfortunately - about the in-game races.\nThere's an option to expand the interface but if you do that, it'll lose focus, so it's still ugly to see.\n\nI really hope that the patches will fix a few things but unfortunately I doubt that a complete overhaul of the UI will be considered, so this year is done. Sigh. I still can't go back to the old PCM simply because of the new Pro Cyclist mode. However, the reality is that, if it wasn't for that, last year's version is currently better.\n\nThat said, the perfomance of the game has improved, the loading is faster and the races are smoother. There are also some nice little new touches that make the experience in itself a bit better, but so far it's not enough.","June 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","5"

Although I must say that I did enjoy the pro cyclist mod, but that also gets very monotone in the lenght.\n\n+ Graphic\n+ Pro cyclist mode\n\n- No new features, other than the pro cyclist mode\n- Not all teams and riders licensed\n","July 1, 2015","true","181.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ive lost 4-5 save files in 80 hours of gameplay and the national and world champion jerseys are awful. It has some commontary still from 5 years ago and cyclist's faces are all the same.

A mountainous Giro race, with finish on top of a mountain, won by a guy 6 minutes before the second.... the guy had the climbing stats of a rookie, (62 while any decent or good climber would have 70 - 80).\n\nI could live with the boring races, that always end up the same way.... and I played even  through all the bugs.

I love cycling so much that I don't care about the negative reviews. So far Cyanide is the best producer of Cycling simulator game in the market today. There are certainly some bugs and lot of improvements to be done, but I still enjoyed this game as much as I've enjoyed the previous versions.\n\nIt's so rewarding to see your Pro cyclist in a pro mode beating the likes of Froome, Contador, etc. In the mountains and be able to replicate Jens Voigt's "Shut up legs and do as I say".\n\nI will certainly recommend this game to those die hard cycling lovers. I honestly say that this game is quite improving and I hope someday they will hit the mark where we fans will said "well done Cyanide", still hoping for that version to come.\n\nI suggest that you visit the community sites like PCMdaily.com for some realistic databases. So I will give this game a rating of 8/10, for bringing up some new contents.","August 7, 2015","true","264.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And what a sport it is. Pulling everything together to win the big jerseys feels like a marathon journey, and you can blow it on one little mistake. While most of the races are whizzed through in fast forward, its excellent for the multi-screening type of person. I'll easy be half watching the tv and then focus can be switched to the important bits. Running a team is a little daunting at the start, but once your up and running it all can tie in nicely and you can focus on the racing.","January 6","true","99.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But enthusiasm ignited by the tour overwhelmed my fears. I purchased and installed the product, and it crashed on the first run. After looking at the PCM solutions page (in French), I found many recommendations centered around virus checking software.\n\nI personally run McAfee Internet Security. So I decided to turn off real time scanning while running this program. Surprisingly, it has never crashed since. I tried to run it again later (after a couple of days) with real time scanning on, and again PCM crashed.\n\nThus, I am now having a blast with PCM as long as I turn off my real time scanning off while playing.

I bought Pro Cycling Manager 2015 without having bought any of the previous versions. The graphics are pretty nice and the game is just overall great! I've been a cycling fan for a few years now and it is my dream to be riding with the pros. The idea of Pro Cyclist Mode is fantastic. Being able to model a rider after me made the game soo much better.\n\nI am a little annoyed at the loading times for each race if you choose to 3D race all the time. I understand that this is because the world is having to render. Apart from this minor let-down, I would happily recommend this game to ANY cyling fan.\n\nThe game does start to become "not interesting" after a while however all you need to get you going again is creating a new Pro Cyclist.\n\nThe $20 I spent for in during a sale was well spent in my opinion.","February 6","true","187.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pro cyclist mode is fun, it is actually my favorite mode, but not totally complete because even if you are the team leader, you cannot tell your teamates to get bottles, relay at the front, protect you, or not relay at the front if you are tired (which they sometimes do). The AI in this mode sometimes does not understand that you may be going onto a climb, which makes it easier to bring back a breakaway group. For some, the mode looks bad as you "cannot" control your rider as you can only tell him to pace and other actions and move from side to side with the number pad. The normal manager mode is fun but if you are only looking at that mode, the only difference between pcm15 and the older games in the series is the ratings, age, and teams of the riders which you can chage with downloading databases off sites like pcm.daily. The track mode is unchanged and is fun to play if you have nothing to do. The one-off race is like last year and is basically unchanged. The game is very fun, but if you do not understand cycling, then the game will feel very strange and awkward.\n7.5/10","May 18","true","265.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
