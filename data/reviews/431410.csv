The entire board tilting made me dizzy somtimes, but there is a seperate cameramode in the settings.\n\nOverall a decent cheap unity Marble Madness type game, albeit fairly easy. My neices might enjoy it.","February 19","true","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Please take that in consideration when reading this review.\n\nAs a broadcaster, it was quick to setup and get into fullscreen mode and captured into the interface.  The graphics were pleasing immediately and showed a personal quality and original work done on the game.  You can see little qualities in the environment.. the personal touches.\n\nThe feel of the game was very pleasing and made me feel like I was playing a version of Marble Madness from my youth without the crazy frustrating controls.  I enjoyed it a lot and felt like I could continue playing on my own.  The voice over in the beginning was a pleasant surprise.\n\nAs playing the game and viewing the game are different, the only major thing that was brought up as a concern was the potential for a viewer who gets motion sick easily to get sick off of the jerkiness of my poor playing (I was able to get up to the 5th level, and it was surprising me with new features still at that point)\n\nThis game is much easier with a controller, and much more challenging with a mouse.  The controller is implmented very smoothly and provides a superior experience in my mind.\n\nOverall, a game I'd recommend based on the first 10 minutes of gameplay.  Congrats.\n","March 27","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play a ball who's heading out to free his fellow ball friends from the fangs of an evil pyramid...\nRoll through countless labyrinth-style levels, avoid traps and nasty robots, fight bosses and buy power-up in the store with coins that you can find thoughout the mazes. There are some secrets as well and, typical for the genre, highscores based on how fast you finish a map.\nThe power-ups add a bit of depth but also some annoyance to the game since you have to buy them in the store, which can only be accessed by rolling back to the very start of the 'overworld'. Better stockpile them to avoid frustration and map repetition!\n\nThe camera view is top-down, which absolutely makes sense on mobile platforms and their sensor-based controls. Adopting the same camera 1:1 on PC is a bit weird (watch videos), and may cause some dizzyness at first especially since the map is constantly tilting 'head over'. The controls are pretty responsive on kb & mouse as well as gamepad. The level design is a bit repetitive, esp. visually, but the later levels definitely provide a nice challenge.","March 2","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of puzzles to circumvent that get progressively more difficult. It took me a little while to get the controls down but once I did it was lots of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes marble madness.","February 21","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
