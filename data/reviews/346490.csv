"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/recommended/346490/","Sphing","Sphing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/","477 products in account","Intro - About This game has  a lot  of potential. You play as a toy that is being hunted by unwanted and abandoned toys. You can select which toy you play as and, depending on your choice, you will start with unique weapons. Use these weapons to kill a bunch of old barbies, robots and what seem to be abominations of mashed together toys-- probably made by some kid out of boredom. While surviving these relentlessly angry and jealous toys, you must also find your way to their lair with the only help being an arrow showing which direction to go. Not all toys are evil, however, and you will encounter small construction worker toys who will assist you on your journey for as long as you can defend them.\n\nPros & Cons  ++  Pros\n+ Fun and appealing visuals\n+ Easy to learn controls\n+ Good sound quality\n+ Co-op\n+ Plenty of maps\n\n-- Cons\n- Expensive for the content\n- Choppy animation\n- No story\n- Barebones in terms of content\n- Repetitive enemy design\n\nPersonal Opinion I enjoyed this game up to a certain point. The game is great fun and all, even having me on the edge of my seat from some scary moments, but there could be so much more! This game just seems empty, which is a shame given its huge potential. It just seems unpolished and unfinished. The UI is clunky and unintuitive. The controls are easy to learn but they often use weird keys. The graphics are nice, and the game has decent lighting and bloom, But it just doesn't feel immersive. Like I said, this game has no polish and still needs a lot of work, but there is no doubt in my mind that this game will be great if the devs put some more work into it!\n\nFinal recommendation: This is a great game and it will probably get better considering there is a bit of love from the developers, but if I were you, I would wait until it was on sale. I've been keeping an eye on the changelogs, and once it gets a bit more polish, I don't doubt that it will be good fun to play with friends. I give this game a  6.5/10  due to the lack of polish and content, but it is still a solid title and delivers a good bit of fun! If you can get it for a good price, pick it up, or you can wait for more content and grab it full price.\n\nEdited by Frey Cloudseer\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!\n","October 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","2"

However, I am still inclined to not recommend the game.\n\nThe video is here: http://youtu.be/JtZX3sHX24c\n\nHere are some points about the game:\n\nMissing audio options combined with terrible sound design\nNo FOV slider in a FPS\nLackluster variety when it comes to enemies\nBad voiceacting (repetitive and unimaginative lines)\nRelatively bad optimized performancewise\nController settings really bad (d-pad to move mousepointer, no keymap available)\nAnd this is just scratching on the surface.\nAll in all a very disappointing experience.","May 28, 2015","false","4.2"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","36","64","6","1"

The voice acting is beyond hilarious and the movement just feels strange.. Where's the mouse sensitivity slider? How can you not have one?\n\nThis game MIGHT (big emphasis on might) be enjoyable if the devs actually put effort into the UI, sounds and general feel.","July 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I understand making them quite 'jumpy' is part of the game style, but the vehicles do tend to get shaken up A LOT by some very small things, like i got flipped over by just driving over a bit or carpet ect...\n- It would be nice to have a little more direction when playing, ie a pop-up to tell you exactly what to do\n- Being able to change up a few more settings would be nice, FOV, audio ect\n- Some of the toys audio is a little repetitive and annoying\n\nI cant wait to play some with my friends!!!","May 29, 2015","true","2.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"
