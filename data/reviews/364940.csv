Everything that might be fun to do is closed by the time you get off work. Every possible opportunity to better yourself through education and exercise is also closed by the time your day job is done. The only things still open are the most banal of entertainments--your choice of empty, vapid pabulum on a screen, or dancing and drugs, to take your mind away from the daily grind.  Both of which only increase your "sociability" stat, which is useless for actually getting a better job. The jobs that require "sociability" are already taken by the pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥ who was in the same fraternity as the boss's clueless kid, and helped hold his hair back a couple times.\n\nEven if the university, library, etc. were open into the night, there just aren't enough hours in the day to actually go to them. Once you've gotten enough sleep, eaten enough to survive, and worked enough to eat, that's it. The day is over. If you want to get more than that out of life, you have to start sacrificing necessities.\n\nSoon you're showing up to work with less than 20% food, 20% sleep, and 20% hygiene, but no one cares; you're just another faceless drone who can't magically make the coffee machine spit out coffee any faster, nor figure out how to spell "Lundyynn" on the first try.\n\nYou scrimp. You save. You invest in your "garden" at home in hopes of generating some extra income selling "cabbage" out behind the convenience store. Somehow, through incredible effort, enduring sleepless nights, near-starvation, and bad personal hygiene, you save up enough to go to the university part-time. Finally, you think. This is the way out of this hole.\n\nBut as bad as the food-sleep-hygiene situation was before, it's even worse now. Power nap and power bar before work, and once again before class. Lather, rinse, repeat. Sleeping at night, the whole night? Eating full meals? What kind of madness is that?\n\nBut somehow, you do it. Bleary-eyed, gaunt with malnutrition, smelling faintly of sour dairy creamer and BO, you leave the university, flimsy paper diploma clutched tightly in one hoof. This is it. It's all been worth it, surely.\n\nYou check all the businesses in town, flinging job applications left and right. "Not experienced enough." "Nah, we'd rather hire someone from my son's fraternity again." "No, I think we're going to hire some guy who's 8 years from retirement age to fill 2 entry-level positions, instead." "What kind of degree even is this?"\n\nIn desperation, you return to the coffee shop and beg for your old job back. "Sorry, you're overqualified now. We can't possibly hire you, it's against corporate policy."\n\nIt's about then that your food, sleep, and hygiene meters all reach zero at the same time. You can't do anything. If you can even bring yourself to get out of bed, you just end up standing outside buildings, trying to will yourself to go in, to apply for a job, to just go see a movie again, even to just buy a meal. But you can't. You just can't. "Pony cannot do that because: unhappy."\n\nIt's then that you collapse in the street, broken, penniless, and alone; unable to die, yet unable to live.\n\nGOTY 10/10","November 30, 2015","true","4.5"," 205 of 220 people (93%) found this review helpful 150 people found this review funny","93","205","220","150","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psherman1/recommended/364940/","psherman1","Psh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psherman1/","115 products in account","Let me share with you the tale of my pony, a tale of love, loss, and life.  On day one, he entered Ponyland happy, healthy, and ready to mingle.  He struck up conversations with various ponies around town and made multiple friends almost immediately.  However, this was not to last.\n\nThe trouble first began when he visited the pharmacy, and purchased a large dose of painkillers.  While in a drug-induced delerium he entered a restaurant and ordered 3 chickens, and a steak, which for some reason was labeled 'ship'.  Having only just sated his appetite for flesh, my pony discovered the hard way that inflation had hit Ponyland hard.  He grimaced as he paid his $650 food bill and left.\n\nBy this time, night was falling, and my pony had nowhere to sleep.  He wandered the streets by night, striking up conversation with passing female ponies, presumably hookers, until the early AM.  The next day, we traversed the town looking to apply his trade as a waiter, but nowhere he checked had any positions open.  In another drug-fueled fit, he spent $7800 on 13 sticks of bright red lipstick, marking the last of his initial funds.  He had to find a source of income, otherwise he would not be able to partake in any of the overpriced amenities Ponyland had to offer.\n\nAnother sleepless night drew to a close as another day began.  By this time my pony had not slept in 4-5 days, and his beauty, hunger, and happiness were drained to 0%.  Due to his purchase of lipstick, there was nothing he could do, as a crippling onset of depression took hold of him.  In a desperate ploy to boost his morale, he applied all 13 sticks of lipstick at once, caking himself in makeup.  This did not however boost his mood at all.  Having nothing left to do with himself, my pony tried to find work again, this time succeeding in landing a job as a barista at a coffee shop.  But this victory was short-lived, as my pony found himself too unhappy to work.  His income would have to wait.\n\nDay 10 rolled around and still my pony had not slept.  My pony's sullen figure roamed the streets of Ponyland, looking for anyone to talk to.  At last he spotted a girl pony and struck up a conversation.  He roped her into a 13 hour joketelling marathon, after which he found himself falling in love.  As they watched the fireworks together, the light from the display illuminated a wedding ring on the pony's hoof (or whatever).  She was married already.  Devastated, my pony broke off all conversation with this harlot, vowing to never talk to a married pony again.\n\nDay 15, and my pony had explored all parts of Ponyland, still battling his crippling depression, along with his abandonment issues.  FInally, while trudging along the beach, he noticed a lone female pony.  His thoughts raced to past interests and betrayal, but he didn't let that get in the way of talking with her.  This time, he noticed she was single, a good sign.  He repeated his perfect lady-game of telling jokes for 13 hours and watching fireworks until they were madly in love with each other.  He even considered asking her to marry him on the spot, but he was bankrupt from his lipstick binge and had no other gifts to offer her.  Dejected, he reluctantly left her and headed back into town, now more depressed than ever.\n\nTwo more sleepless and tear-filled nights passed and my pony found himself homeless, depressed, disheveled, and broke on the streets.  It was Day 17, a fateful day.  Still unable to participate in any fun activities or work for a source of income due to his unhappiness, my pony decided to call it quits on life.\n\nOr rather, I decided to quit the game.\n\nTL;DR this game is a fantastic real-life simulator.  Battle depression, bankruptcy, homelessness, lonliness, and insomnia in a quest for true love.  I only rated it down because  the menu clipped a lot.\n\nThank you for reading, and RIP my pony.","April 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 287 of 327 people (88%) found this review helpful 313 people found this review funny","88","287","327","313","12"

If you want to read the review before the foreword, just scroll down.\n\n[[Foreword]]\nIt was 2013, my friend was turning 19 or 20, can't really remember. I happened to have his birthday marked on my phone calendar, so I would do what I always do, I'd call him like any other "old-school" timer would do and wish him a happy birthday, instead of writing a non-personal message on facebook. At the time, there was a sale of the "Train simulator - Zombie edition!" on steam. It was for an approximate of 2£ total. And, seeing as me and my friend are not really materalistic people, I thought it would be fun to buy him this as a joke gift, and guilt trip him in to playing it - and of course guilt tripping him for not playing it often enough. We had a good laugh about it.\nFast forward to 2015. We spoke about this specific gift at one of our buddy's teamspeak channels, and he stated that he'd buy me something (even though my birthday had passed), and he'd force me to play it and stream it. Thus began my nightmare that sent me in to "Pony World 3".\n\n\n[[Review]]\n\nSpecs:\nGeforce GTX 980 (4GB)\nIntel i7 - 3.50 GHZ\n16 GM RAM\nWindows 8.1\n\n---SparkleQueef---\n\nSparkleQueef was the name of the pony that I created. She was a horribly looking character with incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures. Right away when I booted up the game, I was greeted with a cute starting screen of a "globe" rotating around showing us the Pony world. The floor was flickering white (game can't handle 144HZ) and it almost gave me epilepsy. The graphic options were limited and It really can't make your game look any better. The textures of this game are HIDEOUS and the UI is dreadful. However, this is a children's game, so, let's dive in to the gameplay itself.\n\n---"You are too dirty to go to the theatre"---\nYou start off by your farm, it creates a Farmville-esque vibe, which must be fun for children. You start off with a good amount of cash to build your farm, or "home area." Pro-tip : Get a shower and a house, seriously, get a shower. The building system reminds me a bit of a incredibly dumbed down version of the sims- which is good, since this is a kids game. Once I had tried out buying a couple of things, I decided to set out in to the world. I went to a beach of some sorts, where I could meet other ponies (who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, by the way.) You can start talking to ponies about your farm, your hair, your job or you can gossip. This will determine weather the pony will like you or not, if this has any impact on the game - i don't know. I never managed to get that far. I really wanted to try out other things. I traveled across the glitchy landscape to the city. The city, is a great place. I mean this- honestly. This is where the game shines! There are no graphical glitches by the city and it is well organized, and there is so much to do in the city! Sparklequeef's occupation was a hairdresser (obviously), so she could apply for a job at a beauty salon. Anywho, I saw a theatre, so, I made my way to the theatre and tried to get in. However, it was closed, and it opened at a later hour- thus i waited. Once it opened, i tried to get in. But SparkleQueef was too hungry to go to the theatre. So, she went to the local Café and got herself some cappuccino. She was really hungry, so she completely gluttonized those cappuccino's. Then, she made her way back to the theatre, but SparkleQueef was too tired to go to the theatre - understandable. So, we went back home, slept, got her restored, went to the Theatre. But SparkleQueef was too hungry to go to the theatre. We went back to the Café, gluttonized a ton of cappuccino's, back to the theatre, then, the message popped up. "SparkleQueef is too dirty to go to the theatre." So, I went back to my farm and tried to shower, however, I had no shower. So, I decided to buy one, however, it cost 2100$. I could not afford it, I had to apply for a job. I went to apply for a job, but SparkleQueef was too dirty to apply for a job.\n\nSo, i closed down the game.\n\nIt's really bad, but, your kids might like it. 3/10","June 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","86","64","74","35","4"

It was such a struggle, to where first, the couple's bright pink fence had to be sacrificed. Then, the Shower. Then finally, a smaller house had to be bought to make amends with the struggles of such a Capitalist Society.  Even with such amends made, Ryu and Ken struggled to survive in such a post apocalypse society.\n\nThis game is one that will last for a many legends, one that people who's blogs tumble will over analyze for eons upon eons of time.\n\nPony World 3 is truly a weapon to rival Metal Gear","August 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","82","36","44","30","1"

After finding it in the survival section of the store she insisted on buying it for me on the understanding that I would clock up an ungodly number of hours on it and no being asleep in from of my computer allowed. Laughingly I agreed - I mean I like cute junky  kiddie games, how bad could it be...?\n\n*sigh*\n\nI got so bored I actually wrote a guide for it. >.<\n\nOkay so you have a pony and it walks around in a vaguely cute environment. Unfortunately everything that comes after that feels like someone sketched a vague idea for it out and then forgot to actually implement it. Instead you end up with a weird game which is "watch the loading bars." Want  your pony to work an 8 hour shift? Watch a loading bar for 30 seconds! Want your pony to enjoy a film? Watch that loading bar go! Feel like taking your pony to university and training in a new career? You guessed it! Loading bar! There actually is no content beyond loading bars to basically everything you do, not even tiny animations. I really cannot stress how devoid of content this game is. Even when you have an entire section of items called "Toys" barring two of them (which are also reused as the only two animation in the social interactions with other ponies) all that happens when you play with them is that the icon that represents them appears in a though bubble above your pony for a few seconds.\n\nFor a while I thought maybe the horrendous lack of content was because frankly little girls play this and all they want to do is decorate their home area, but in order to do that in any meaningful way you need money and lots of it and that means ... mmm loading bar based gameplay!\n\nThere are five minigames. They are probably the least child friendly and most unforgiving and at the same time unutterably dull mini games I have played in a very long time. With low time limits, no rewards whatsoever for a partial complete and ridiculously unforgiving collision detection on the one that requires dodging (getting hit sets your score back to 0 and makes you restart the level) I know plenty of adults that would struggle with these. Aiming them at small children just seems cruel.\n\nFinally of course the game tops this all off with graphics glitches, instability and one area (The Park) where as far as I can work out the UI is displaced half way across the screen for everyone that runs it, rendering large portions of it inaccessible and causing problems for other gameplay elements that attempt to fit around it.\n\nIf you're totally desperate to play with ponies, not only are there better games out there but if you must have this one it's currently free in the Google Play store for you to have on your phone (where at least the UI works).\n\nOh and an honourable mention goes to the idea of having pony children. Searching across all the versions of this game has not allowed me to find out how to do this. It has, however, allowed me to find myriads of other people nearly all of whom are asking how to do it as well (It is actually a requirement for one scenario). I suspect it is a feature they forgot to add along with the rest of the gameplay.","May 12, 2015","false","18.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","29","34","9","0"

The idea of using flashes to send your message from the KGB was well noticed. It also fully aided in killing those epiliptics who we don't want. It also added a little extra flair and spice to the game. The fantastic textures are another great thing that should be taken into account when purchasing this game. I really felt the 3D nature come to life in this installement of pony world. Most people without a High-End gaming PC are going to have a rough time being able to run this game at a soild 60 FPS.

Leading me to believe you are truly cis scum.\n\n9/10\n2015 Game of The Year","May 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","11","19","11","1"

Laugh it up... LoL.\n\nHere is my video first look review of this game...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uET7J643QaM\n\nAnd I gave this game an 80%\n(VALUE 40/40 for its $5 USD price tag, FUN 25/30 considering the games target audience (kids).. I can see this game a lot of fun to them, CONTROLS/BUGS - 10/20 I would like to see game add arrow keys and WASD controls to move and minor glitches but nothing game breaking, and GRAPHICS & SOUND gets a 5/10 for being nothing amazing, pretty simple, but also nothing horrid awful either)\n\nValue and Fun are always my two biggest criteria when I grade a game, and in this game - I have to put myself in the shoes of a young kid.  I figure the target audience here is kids from the ages of 5 to 12 (mainly girls but some boys my like it as well)  The Value is out of the park in this game.  For $5, there is a LOT here to offer a child.  They can make friendships, once those friendships blossom they can do more such as play ball with them or comfort them, and once it blossoms further, they can give them gifts from their inventory, and eventually can marry them!  Add in the ability to have baby ponies, and OMG.. how could a young girl not LOVE that?!!?\n\nThe fun level I believe for the games target crowd is going to be at least a 25 out of 30 because this game offers again so much.  besides making friends as I mention above, the player can get a job, shop, explore, play simple games for money, while all the time needing to keep their energy up, their cleanliness/self appearance bar up, and their hunger bar up.  They get to use their money to build their own stables home, decorate it however they choose, grow crops, and much much more!  Awesome.\n\nWhile I wish the controls allowed for movement with the arrow keys or WASD key movement, moving is as simple as clicking where you want to move, or holding down the left mouse button to have your pony follow the arrow as you move it around.  A few glitches such as sand colored too brightly and a screen that would sometimes be off center but then later correct itself will likely be rectified in a future patch, but I had to score this aspect of the game down a little for it.  It's not game breaking at all, just a minor set back.\n\nAnd the graphics and sounds are really simple but they work is why I gave this part of my score a 5 out of a possible 10.\n\nYou can save the game at any point and go right back to it easily by just clicking the play button.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look to have multiple save spots available for more then 1 child.. I would definitely love to see the developers add at least 3 save spots to this game.\n\nAgain, this game is not targeting 16 year old boys, or 30 year old men.  So don't buy this if you are over the age of 12 and then trash it because it's "lame".

With that quick jab at the vast majority of "Bronies" aside, let's move on the game itself, and what a train crash it is.\n\nFor a start, the textures seem to glitch out at random, and flicker at such at speeds likely to induce seisures. The character models look creepy as anything, like something that was put through a cheapening process, like the vast majority of knock-offs you see in your cheap shops.\n\nIt's like..a sims fan and a "Brony" had an argument over what game to make, and this was the hideous result.

That's what you wanted, right? Well, I've decided I don't like people like you. You've messed with the community of the wrong psychopath. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me angry. I am a hard person to make angry. However, I despise people like you.\n\nYour pitiful hacking skills are hilarious. Hacking accounts and putting up proxies are level 1. Can you hack into encrypted files? Can you tear through firewalls without leaving a mark? Your silly little proxy won't protect you. I've hacked into many computers and spied on the users. I've hacked into games. I have been hacking since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do.\n\nYou have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling.

On the surface, pony society is all rainbows and sunshine but you shortly discover the experience is that of an unwashed, uneducated pony too sick and undesirable to find work, stumbling through a forest at 3 am frantically foraging for edible mushrooms to stave off starvation.\n\nYou need a college education to work as a cashier. You are a pony who hasn't finished grade school. Which, by the way, is neither compulsory nor publicly funded.\n\nGood luck.\n\nAll told? 9/10 for a fantastic political commentary, held back by a couple minor glitches. ...At least I think that's what they were going for with this game.","February 4","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
