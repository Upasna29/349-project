Well, it's safe to say that I do not regret the purchase! It's a neat game with an endearing visual style, story, and the gameplay being tight like spandex. Being one of the first few to play this game is a very different challenge, you don't have any resources on the internet to tell you how much of anything you need for an acheivement. But, however, nothing can spoil your experience with the game, which is SO NICE!!! Something that is worth mentioning are all the references, even though the game's atmosphere is a little tense, and rightly so, the humor in these keeps the game feeling a little more light hearted, which I much appriciated after a certain VERY VERY unnerving part of the game, which, by the way, HOLY BUCKETS THAT'S SPOOKY DONE RIGHT! HOOOOOO MAN I WAS ACTUALLY SWEATING BUCKETS AT THAT PART! It's a truly wonderful game though, that rewards you for doing smaller things throughout the story, some of which I have yet to find! The lots of files helps with completeing the game, you can basically rewind to any point and do some backtracking whenever. The few puzzles that exist in game are very clever as well. I also LOVE the soundtrack, it's just so GOOD! WOW!\n\nTL;DR, This game is great, if you like games with depth, such as Undertale, you'll have fun with this one too!","December 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","1"

You start your journey from a cave in the bottom of a mountain and you fight your way through various landscapes ranging from a icy palace to a volcanic cavern. Battles take place in real time with a cooldown bar between each action. The game has a mix of puzzle solving along with platforming at times. Although the game may have been rebalanced as of now, when I played this game, I was unable to find a spell that was crucial to beating the first boss and I thought certain enemies and bosses needed some rebalancing. I did enjoy what I played of the game though and in my opinion the universe of this game is well thought out. If you are a fan of RPGMaker games, I would recommend you give this game a try, although this game does not take long to beat.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a review key, however this did not influence my review.","December 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It is beautifully made and it shows dedications and declares hardwork. Though the game maybe a bit hard for some new to it and those not used to such inquisitive puzzles the game in itself is well made and the story line is on point and brillant. If I could rate this game with stars I would give it a 8/10. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and turn based combat. If you would like to see how the game is played first off and my impressions to everything and how far I got with the game then check out my review video below.\n\nThe video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRNOO0DGVw\n\nI hope you like it! I know I had fun playing and making the video!","December 17, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

No, not really, for an RPGMaker game its worth towards $3.99 at most.\nThe developer is kind and answers any questions I have, he also updates it and weeds the bugs often.\nEven though I just did the vocal effects I wish the whole thing was voice acted, it could have given it a bit of charm :)\nThe story is beautiful and so is the art, though. Recommended :) Tuomo is a great dev to work with!","December 27, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I have worked on rpg maker myself and it just seems very limited. How ever. I saw this game and was very interested when I saw some of the game play mechanics. Clearly whoever programmed this was very talented. as I played it I though this game is hard and maybe even unplayable. but I noticed that you have to pay attention. for example on the boss fights you have to do things before you even engage the fights.  like finding a spell that can be used against them or an item that helps against their attacks. Although a bit different this game is very fun. Fun enough where I had completely lost track of time while playing it.\n\nPros\n• The Combat is much different than most rpg maker games and I found it very fun.\n• The art is simple but nice. It goes with the story well\n• The story is nice and touching as well it also has some surprises in it and I love surprises.\n• Hard mode is very nice and adds so much to the game and extends it very nice.\n\ncons\n• The game isn't very friendly to those that don't read the story line.\n• The game doesn't explain some things that are needed to progress. like you need to fish in order to get a needed item help during a select boss. (Updates seem to be trying to help fix those issues)\n• The lava mini-game is a bit clunky. but it seems to be more of an issue with rpg maker not allowing free movement.\n\nIll say the game is short but fun. I noticed the hard mode adds a whole new aspect to the game. as you play through the game a 2nd time you have more monsters and it feels like a new adventure.","December 7, 2015","true","10.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Okay, so 1st off I lost track of time while playing. this gameplay is fun. unlike most rpgs when you get into a fight your attacks can attack surrounding enemies. The only problem I noticed is this. The game play is fun. but there isnt enough of it. i noticed i only got into 2 fights during the lava level. 3 in the ice level unless you count the boss.\nplus thoe ghosts were HARD! Maybe weaken them :(\n\nI knew there was going to be a hardcore mode after i beat the game. i tried it a few times but didnt beat it. but there is no save points in hardcore. alot more monsters. but its also so much funner.\n\nit wasnt a long game. and not lots f action. but i enjoyed it. alot.","December 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But it didn't use anything that would justify that. You can't use any rpg style leveling up (not enough monsters), you can't equip different things (only the standard set is available). It's more  of a puzzle game than a rpg\n\n- The fights are just annoying. As you can't level up its always just a game of luck. The ice lady for example has one move that kills you immediately. I had to replay her 6 times until she finally stopped using that attack and i beat her.\n\n- Only 4 levels (yep, thats it), and the levels are also short. Basically per level you have about 3 mazes on each floor with random puzzles. And whats worse: the lava level is so frustrating because you HAVE to walk over lava to get anywhere and you get hurt while doing it. And the casket-Lava-Race mini game is also frustrating because the controls just don't work. Sometimes you press right and nothing happens and you crash into something.\n\n- not much to do: there are hardly any people to talk to. Hardly any side quests, and at the end some guy always tells you how many puzzles you have solved. So i replayed the level and still couldn't find anything\n\nThe game might have potential, but as it is its not worth 7€.\n","December 6, 2015","false","2.7"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","1"

The dev has no idea how to code anything. Look at the fight and tell me if any of my deaths are my fault. This boss has an instant kill attack thats RNG. It can use it whenever... it can open up with a "♥♥♥♥ YOU" instant kill or it can wait until you get her down to 300 hp and use it. It's basically a rush to kill her before she uses it... and this game is being sold for 10 ♥♥♥♥ing bucks on steam. It's not worth it...\n\nMapping is bad\nStory is bad\nArt is unique and it could work if everything was custom and the dev actually had some literary talent. Instead we get anime tropes the game.\nThis isn't fun. This isn't worth 10 bucks. This feels like a rip off. I would play this game for free, and hell I may even pay 1 dollar for it... but no...  not 10.\n\nDon't pay for this game until the price drops significantly. I cant in good conscience even say anything remotely nice about this game at this price... Look at the video and tell me if you think that looks fun and you would cough up 10 bucks for this game. ♥♥♥♥ this... I'm going to play undertale.","December 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","3","11","2","1"
