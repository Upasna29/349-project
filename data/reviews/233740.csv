It's like Oregon Trail, but...\n\nNo, it really is Oregon Trail with zombies. But instead of being a one-note joke, Organ Trail actually improves on the original formula in significant ways. If you somehow never encountered an Apple IIe in school, the basic idea of ______ Trail games is that you have a party of 4 or so travelers on their way to a distant destination. Random things happen on the way, sometimes you get a choice to make, other times not. Settlements give you the chance to shop, barter, or scavenge for supplies. Organ Trail sets this up as you and your 4 pals escaping D.C. in a beat-up station wagon, carrying as much food, ammo, car parts, and fuel as you can. In addition to the random horrible things that happen, you'll also encounter minigames like dodging zombie deer and motorcycle gangs on the highway, or making a clutch shot to save a friend from a kidnapper. These interactive events really help break up the monotony of watching your beater roll down the highway while bad things happen to you all.\n\nSettlements are where the game really shines, because there are a wealth of options for managing your journey. In terms of supplies alone, you can buy and sell for cash, wait for trade offers on your goods, scavenge by playing a little top-down action minigame, and do side missions (also minigames) to get paid in goods. There are additional options for managing the health of your team, for maintaining and upgrading your ride, and even learning new special skills for your player character that help in minigames. Learning how much you need of what resources and what upgrades you should spring for can take time, so be prepared to either lose a few times or start on Easy. The first time I picked this game up I got rather frustrated because my car broke down and I got trapped in a settlement with no way to repair it. But after a few more rounds I learned the power of scavenging and practiced my minigaming and now everything runs smooth... on Normal, anyway.\n\nIt's a pretty deep game for a literal Oregon Trail clone, and the zombie aspect fits the style well without being tired. There are some cute pop culture references that are clever enough not to annoy, and plenty of replay value. As long as the ultra low-res graphics and learning curve don't put you off, this is a grand little coffee break game.","September 17, 2015","true","4.2"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","73","79","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/litvac/recommended/233740/","litvac","Litvac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/litvac/","144 products in account","Organ Trail's pretty damn fun. It's essentially Oregon Trail with zombies and a bunch of Left 4 Dead references.\n\nI had the iOS version before buying the Steam version, and I feel like the game's easier to control on a computer as far as shooting goes. That being said, shooting is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ as far as controls go, and it's difficult to nail on the head. Some of the in-game passersby even acknowledge the problems with the controls by stating, "These controls suck!" (They do.) But having a mouse removed the issue of my finger blocking parts of the screen.\n\nThe writing is often times humorous and references things from the original game to Castlevania. It gives Organ Trail a certain charm and unusual atmosphere. Some of the locations throughout the game are rather humorous as well (one of these being--I kid you not--a strip club), and it gives me the impressions that the developers made this purely for fun, which I find admirable. It's always nice to find a game that convinces players that the people who made it definitely had a kickass time doing so.\n\nI've noticed that, while the overall gameplay is generally difficult (even on normal), it gets progressively harder as you move further down the map, which I found reasonable, in my opinion. That being said, it's very good at screwing you over, as nothing's worse than wasting half your food and all your time stuck on the side of the road trading away for enough scrap so that you can attempt a repair on the car that ultimately fails, causing you to waste all your scrap. That actually happened to me. It's not fun. However, to an extent, the game is as difficult as your are good at strategizing and planning a course of action. You will blame yourself many times for the mistake you've made. Many times, crises can be avoided or worked around if you're prepared enough. Yet, given this, random events still occur, and if the odds aren't in your favor, you could end up doing well to being dead in a few miles. It's always important to be cautious in this game as a result.\n\nThe music is also spot-on as well. Amidst all of the humor and gags, it gives Organ Trail a more solemn tone. Also, it's generally interesting to listen you and combines an 8-bit feel with a more "advanced" (if that's the word) sound to it. I don't quite know how to explain it. But it's really well done, in my opinion.\n\nThe graphics are also very charming and reminiscent of the original games. They work really well. Not sure what else to say here. I like them a lot.\n\nAlso, the Clement's Quest minigame is hilarious. It's essentially a TL;DR Organ Trail where you control the car and run over zombies as quickly as you possibly can. I discovered it on accident and couldn't have been happier that I did.\n\nBasically, to put it bluntly, despite the game's difficulty, I really enjoy this game and always have a good time while playing it. It was worth purchasing it the second time, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and a nostalgic, yet new take on a classic.","November 3, 2014","true","19.8"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","62","65","4","0"

It plays just about the same as the original game did, making it an extremely fun play. It demands a combination of skill, foresight and luck in an environment that changes often, giving this game high replay value. Shooting and escape segments control surprisingly well, and random events feel a bit more balanced than in its predecessor.\n\nCONS: Zombie shtick is very tired. There is virtually no educational value in this, which I felt was half the fun of the original! The game assumes you are familiar with Oregon Trail, so if you are new to this there may be a slight learning curve in properly managing your resources.\n\nWORTH: A single game does not take very long to get through, less than half an hour. However, one or two playthroughs is not what Organ Trail is about. You could easily get 30 hours out of it, especially if you do completionist play. $5.00 is a very fair price for it.\n\nOVERALL: This isn't Oregon Trail exactly, but I'm happy there is some version of it on Steam complete with achievements, cards, twitter options and online leaderboards. It blows Super Amazing Wagon Adventure out of the water and is the current go-to to satisfy this nostalgic desire.\n\nSCORE:8/10","March 9, 2015","true","22.6"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","48","50","5","0"

Organ Trail takes it's primary inspiration from the original Apple II iteration of The Oregon Trail and opens with your character encountering Clement, a fellow survivor who kick-starts your odyssey across a post apocalyptic United States. Much like the game it parodies, Organ Trail is about balance. You will need to ensure that your party is fed, rested and your car in tip top mechanical condition. With every mile that ticks by your parties health degrades as well as your trusty station wagon. Injury and disease are common occurrences on the road as evidenced by the many tombstones that can be encountered on your journey. These tombstones are not only reminders of the peril that face your party but also opportunities for upgrades and supplies. Party members can be bitten on your voyage and may require a euthanizing rifle blast to the head. Of course, if you are a misanthropic sociopath you could always off your healthy party members and not have to worry about keeping them fed and healthy. Dotting the trail to safety are landmarks and cities that allow your party to trade, buy and sell items, upgrade your car and purchase perks for your character. You can also take on jobs to earn some cash or supplies and chat the locals up for information.\n\nScavenging is often the easiest way to stay supplied on your journey. By opting to scavenge an open field pops up with random items spawning. Little green zombies home in on your character as you attempt to scoop up scrap for car repairs, food for nourishment, and cash for additional supplies. It's possible to defend yourself from the zombie onslaught while scavenging with a rifle. You must click and pull your mouse back which brings up a line of site on the screen which you can then spin while in a fixed position to dial your site in on the revolting rotting flesh heaps that converge on your position. Releasing fires and these controls take a bit of time to acclimate yourself to. A couple of seconds to reload between each round ensures a bit of tension as you scramble for goodies. Bosses are also randomly encountered on these scavenging excursions. They are more robust creatures that put up a bit more of a fight than your average walking corpse.\n\nThe jobs that are on offer use variations of these mechanics. Some require you to defend a position by taking cover and killing zombies before they reach your position, some have you locating an item in a scrolling field while zombies swarm and the last variant has you trading gun shots with others humans in fortified positions. These mini games can feel repetitive after a while since your character doesn't receive new weapons and enemy types are limited. The randomness of these events will keep you coming back however. Also, random encounters with biker gangs and hordes of zombie deer mix things up while in your station wagon. Random interactions with other travelers on the road also spice up the core game and offer a little bit of narrative. Prompts will appear that ask if you feel inclined to investigate something on the road. Doing so kicks off an old school adventure sequence that often results in a reward of some sort. This touch adds quite a bit of re-playability to Organ Trail. While the randomness of Organ Trail ensures a new experience every time it can  also lead to frustration. It's not uncommon for tragic events to occur in quick succession and take out a party member or even your party leader. It can be upsetting, perhaps off putting for some, when a well supplied and positioned expedition fails because of a bout with dysentery and broken ribs...\n\nUltimately Organ Trail: Director's cut is one of the best games to emerge from the zombie zeitgeist that has gripped popular culture over the past half decade.","November 25, 2013","true","11.7"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"

Campaign Mode is your quest to Safe Haven, while Endless Mode lets you travel forever (so long as you maintain your supplies and pray that none of your party members survive) while completing challenges that unlock new presets and buffs that add replayability to the game.

If you enjoyed Oregon Trail growing up, and like zombies, you'll find this game worthwhile. I have two general problems with the game though. My first problem is that the achievements are very buggy. Playing through the game multiple times over for an achievement turns from fun to horror when the achievements reset. My second problem is that once you figure out how the game works, it gets boring. Basically, theres generally an 'optimal' way to play it and once you know how, the game becomes less fun because you know exactly what to do in each situation...there are no more surprises. I mean, in the 15 hours I played I learned the more-or-less "right" things to do and got ranked in the mid 300s on the global leaderboards for a playthrough.

Before you start your game, you get to name your character as well as your group members. It is generally advised that you name group members based on people you love/hate (famous people etc) as it will make the experience more interesting as you watch how long they last. After that you get to choose the types of items you will carry along with you like feul, food, money etc. You begin your journey in your station wagon traveling to the next city. Along your travel you may face some random encounters which may affect the game e.g. losing items, more vehicle damage, random stop, members getting sick etc. As you travel you will also consume fuel. Should you run out of feul you can either scavange some or spend time waiting for someone to come along and trade you some. Scavenging involves collecting resources while fending off zombies with your gun. Aiming with you gun is terrible (which isn't surprising because this is basically an android port) as it involves clicking and draging to where you want to shoot and then missing most of the time (It takes a while to get used to basically). When you reach towns you can talk to survivors, take side quests which involves fending against zombies or bandits (which gives you resources as rewards), buy/sell supplies (fuel, food, ammo), heal the group as well as repairing and upgrading your station wagon. Like feul food is also depleted as you travel. You have the option of rationalising the consumption of food. Should it be depleted you and your other survivors will gradually lose health until they die. You also have an option to kill any of you party members at anytime, should you no longer require their company. You basically move from city to city surviving the zombie apocalypse as much as you can until you reach the sanctuary. Should you die, the game immeditaely ends and you are taken back to the main menu to begin a fresh run again if you wish. The game is quite challenging and addicitve so you will play this game a several times.\n\nThe music adds to desloate atmosphere. Whether your in a town, traveling or hunting you get to experience a spooky and lonely soundtrack which helps to instill the feeling of trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. The weapon sounds aren't that great.\n\nThere isn't much story to the game. Basically the intro starts you off with meeting some survivors. You formulate a plan to get to the sanctuary (city free of zombies) and begin your journey together in the station wagon.\n\nThe graphics aren't that great. They do an OK job at presenting a dark atmosphere, but they lack detail.\n\nIf you want a resource management rogue-like game with zombies and don't min wonky shooting controls, this game will appease your interests.","February 17, 2015","true","8.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

You travel from Washington DC, that's about to be nuked, all the way to a safe haven in, you guessed it, Oregon.  The game is faithful in every way it can be to the Oregon Trail, except where it could be made more thematically appropriate to a zombie apocalypse, with multiple additions to improve the simulation and theming.  Seriously, name a feature from Oregon Trail and it's there.  Dysentary?  Check.  Bad water?  Check.  Tombstones?  Check.  You get the picture.\n\nOregon Trail's 'hunting' minigame, being the best part of the original, has become a bit more central to the experience with Scavenging and Jobs using it, with a few others including Defense, Surrounded and Bandit Raid events using the same shooting mechanics.\nWhen Scavenging, you no longer shoot a 2000 pound buffalo to carry back 100 pounds of meat.  Instead you rummage around a wilderness, collecting any supplies that pop up (including food, cash and scrap that you can use to repair your car), while avoiding and shooting zombies that swarm in on you.  Learning to control the flow of these zombies to reduce the amount of ammo I have to spend was a fun mechanic to master (no doubt aided by my recent experience with Gauntlet), and I must say, is probably the best way to ensure your victory at the game.\n\nIn a funny way, Organ Trail is one of the most complete zombie apocalypse simulations I've played, and if you like the genre, you really should play it just because it's a fun game.  If that's not enough to attract you, maybe the novelty of recreating the Oregon Trail experience on a modern platform with a modern genre is enough.  I would happily recommend Organ Trail even at the premium price of five bucks.","October 1, 2014","true","4.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Once in the game, none of that will matter as the solid gameplay, comedy aspect, and nature of the genre take hold of you. You'll be crossing fingers as you push through the hordes hoping they don't take notice. The scavenger side missions are also gratifying, but the controls are a bit awkward, making it more of a flustering challenge than maybe it warrants.\n\nAfter a few runs, things get a bit repetitive, but that's the nature of the game.

The real selling point seems to be that parody. You start out as a party of 5 and work your way from Washington DC headed west. It is a supply and demand sort of game where when you start, you buy your supplies, then at times you'll run low whether it is med kits, fuel, batteries, food or ammo. How do you get more? You stop and trade, scavenge or doing odd jobs.\n\nOrgan Trail is broken up into cities that have places to buy and sell things. They'll also have either combat training or auto repair shops where you can buy mufflers, batteries, tires or upgrades. You can also fix your car at the shops. If you don't have the cash to repair your car, you can always use scrap, but using X amount of scrap only gets you X percentage the repair will be successful. Like 2 scrap will be 20% successful.\n\nIf you can't make it to a city, you can stop at any time to repair your car, scavenge, rest for health regeneration, kill infected party members and use med kits. I seemed to find traders more frequently when I stopped outside of a city. When you scavenge, make sure to pay attention to what the game tells you the zombie activity is. More zombies, more problems. The jobs also tell you the risk factor, anywhere from normal to suicide. Just make sure the reward is worth the risk and play it safe.\n\nThe game is full of mini games. Scavenge has you slowly running around a screen dodging zombies, collecting random things. Sometimes the game will bust out a boss to chase you that is far more difficult to avoid than the zombies. When scavenging, you don't even need to shoot, so much as run and avoid. There are defense mini games that require you to stay put and shoot either zombies or bandits. The shooting feels very imprecise and has you clicking on a zombie with your mouse and dragging it back to your character to aim, then releasing the mouse button to fire. There are a lot of misses even with what looks like a perfectly aimed shot.\n\nThere is a mini game where your station wagon gets chased by a biker gang and you need to run them off the road and there is even a mini game where you dodge reindeer chasing after your station wagon. After you complete Organ Trail, it will unlock a Clemons mini game that has you driving a station wagon left going up triangle hills, jumping off and ramming zombies in a side scroller.\n\nWhen you are on the road, random events happen, such as your characters breaking bones, getting diseases, being mugged, losing items, finding graves, wading through zombies, helping people, looting bodies, injuring your entire party and so much more. Its all text for the most part.\n\nAfter you complete the game, it unlocks an endless mode. The interesting part of endless mode are the modifiers, such as your party can start out infected or they are deep sleepers and recover twice as fast. The sad thing is endless mode is really endless, and I just don't like the thought of being able to play Organ Trail forever.\n\nEven with all of the random events that make every playthrough different, it felt like a chore having to scavenge so much. It was as if the scavenging was the bulk of my play throughs. I didn't find it fun. The random events are really just that, random and rarely benefit you, which is why its more of a supply and demand game. Everything is designed to drain you, but then you need to compensate for it. Please just skip this game, it looks cool, it sounds cool, but there aren't moments of 'yay I did it!' so much as moments of 'how would hitting a bump in the road lose 2 med kits?' Oh well.","June 19, 2013","false","3.7"," 65 of 122 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","65","122","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brightblueink/recommended/233740/","brightblueink","BrightBlueInk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brightblueink/","122 products in account","The game does what it sets out to do--create a version of the classic Oregon Trail game, but with zombies. There's some neat nods and references to other zombie franchises out there, and it captures the feel of the original game pretty well while still having its own identity.\n\nThat being said, it also reminded me how boring the original Oregon Trail really was. Although there's a few neat scenarios and moral conumdrums this is mostly a resource-management game with a few very basic zombie-shooting minigames involved (that have controls that are a little frustrating to deal with). If you play the game for too long it can get pretty repetative, particularly when you hear the same dialogue over and over.\n\nAdmittedly part of my disappointment might be because the version of Oregon Trail I grew up with was Oregon Trail II, which had some pretty campy FMV stuff in it but had more stuff to do overall and felt like a fuller game. I'm also getting a little bored of zombies at this point and Organ Trail doesn't attempt to do anything new. So I'm definitely coming at this game with a bias. It's not a BAD game, just one that I ultimately felt "meh" on once I finished it.\n\nIf you have a lot of nostalgia for the original or just can't get enough of zombies, there's definitely far worse games you could pick up, particularly at the price point. But don't expect anything too surprising, the game more or less plays out the way you'd expect, so if you're on the fence I'd maybe wait for a sale or get something else instead.","March 13, 2014","false","6.8"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","1"

I can tell you that with the expansion, this game is pretty fun.  It's not particularly hard on the normal difficulty, so you might wanna ramp it up a bit if yer a veteran.  Granted, it does take some play time to get used to the swing of things, but one or two playthroughs should do for that.  What controls there are handle the way that they should, so minigame segments are easy enough to get the hang of.  The core of the gameplay seems to come more from being good at managing yer little party's survival.  There's plenty of that to be done and a decent amount of customisation to change things up.  Different road events do well enough to keep things interesting.  A couple different modes and plenty of unlockables and secrets make replays pretty worthwhile.  There are some glitches that I've encountered that can stop the game from progressing but loading the save seems to remedy that.  The soundtrack is equal parts retro, moody, and even epic.  While not terribly exciting, the game can put you on the edge of yer seat.  Content isn't huge but it's big enough to keep ya comin' back for a little while.  For the price, it's a good game.","January 11","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It is hard though and you need some luck here and there.\n\nThe game takes you through a small tutorial at first and lets you get used to the controls. The rest you have to figure out yourself. What is usefull and what not, what is the best option to do, ect.\n\nIt's based off an old game called Oregon Trial. But in here there are zombies and there are some things changed and added. It isn't a long game but it is fun to replay the game and try other ways to beat it and harder difficulties.\n\nThe graphics are old styled. Since the game where it was based off is also in the same sort of style. But in here it looks a bit better. If you aren a graphics kind of person then don't pick the game up. From the screenshots you see on the store page.. That's all you will get.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite nice. If you get annoyed by it after a few times of playing it, you can always put on your own music.\n\nIt doesn't cost much and it's worth picing up if you enjoy a bit of hard and a bit of luck based games. If you don't mind how the game looks like that is. The game is also available for the Android and IOS. If you want to play it everywhere. I find the controls a bit better on there since you have to swipe instead of dragging your mouse. But it is a personal prefrence.\n\nGet it when you can if you like what you see and read.

Simple design, easy access, addicting. I would call it a "retro survival sim": a zombie apocalypse ended the world as we know it. You and your friends try to cross what once was the USA from the East Coast to the West, chasing a rumor known as "Safe Haven", a stronghold where the zombie outbreak seems to have been controlled. Your job is to admin everything until you reach Safe Haven, that is gas, money, routes, including scavenging for food, at what hours you should best do so, keeping an eye out for your ammo, deciding if you should keep going to the West Coast with your bitten friend or if he is a potential menace to the whole group and should be rather put down, if you should risk breaking your car driving for another mile in the hopes of finding a better trading spot, etc., etc.\n\nThese tasks may appear mundane at first, but once you soak in the rather dark atmosphere and realize how close you have become to those pixels with the name of random friends, the game becomes a tragic story of a group just trying to survive and their everyday trying to do so. And you are the leader.\n\nIt's so much fun to experience and imagine the situation you go through. One moment you'll think you made a great deal buying that tire for so cheap, the next you'll curse yourself for not having rather invested in scraps. And while on the road, you'll sometimes encounter little "choose-your-own-adventure"-like events with fellow survivors, some friendly, others not so much, spicing up the experience.\n\nOrgan Trail is impressively immersive, given it's Atari graphics and lack of a deeper canon story. It's one of those video game experiences in which the game only makes the rules, while you make the story in your head, and I think this is the strongest point here.\n\nBut as good as it is, it has some very nasty bugs that can bring you serious frustration. For example, I just was at the end of the game, a comrade died and the game refused to advance until I fed all of them to the zombies. As if this wasn't enough, the game got stuck after defeating the final boss. After having spend my time carefully administrating my crew from coast to coast through hordes of zombies, this wasn't a rewarding pay off. I just wish such issues were patched already, since they happen relatively often with me, let's say, every 3rd or 4th playthrough.\n\nBe it as it is, though, I can only recommend Organ Trail as a fantastic game for those who like just make up and imagine their own zombie stories while playing along.","April 20","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Grabbed him from the back seat of the car and took him. Sure, he was annoying at times. He lost more cash than he ever earned, and somehow got himself shot by a stray bullet, but Sketch was one of us y'know? Us survivors have to stick together.\n\nSo I picked up my rifle and stepped out of the car. I didn't have much choice. I wasn't going to leave him behind. Ottah hadn't looked good for some time since the first Z he saw took a chunk of him. Sleepy got bitten soon after. As for Rabid, I'm pretty sure she was high the whole time. She never got ill, never caused a problem. I forgot she was there most of the time.\n\nSo, there I was. It was an old fashioned stand-off. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was hiding behind Sketchy, holding a pistol to his head. I didn't need to think. I just shot. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139325029\nFrom that moment on, there was no turning back. Anyone who stood between my guys and Safe Haven, dead or alive, I took them out.\n\nIt was tough, but we made it. All of us made it. Hopefully Ottah and Sleepy will be able to live with the bites. As for me, there are more survivors out there and someone needs to help them ...\n\n\nThat was the story of my first adventure in Organ Trail. I foolishly played on Easy, which I wont be doing again, as once I learned my way around the game it wasn't very challenging. I guess I'm too used to recent roguelikes murdering me on my first turn! (I'm looking at you FTL)\n\nI always get an extra kick out of games where I can name multiple members of a party. Naming the characters after my buddies helped me grow attached to them. Or hate them for constantly being ill (Ottah!) or a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (Sketch!). The shooting took a little to get used to, but it was okay once I got the hang of it.\n\nAs for replayability, Endless Mode offers up unique starting scenarios and there are a fair few of them. I'll be making a start on those real soon!\n\nThe sound style matches the graphics, but I'll happily play this on mute and listen to my own music. It's not a problem with the style of the music, I just find it to be quite bad. Also, I'm sure I heard a dodgy distorted version of the 'Happy Birthday' tune at some point.\n\nThe most important thing I have to say about Organ Trail, is that I want to play more. As soon as I finished the game, I wanted to play again. That's the sign of good gameplay. Organ Trail doesn't have fancy graphics to fall back on. All it's can offer is its solid gameplay. If you're a fan of survival games, and don't mind the design this is something that you should pick up.\n\nBottom Line: Organ Trail is fun and leaves you wanting more.","January 2, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's just something really addicting about games where you can name the characters and see what kinds of crazy stuff ensues based partially on random chance while the other half depends on how well you've been managing the trip.  Aside from the obvious of this being a parody of the Oregon Trail games, the game kind of has a sort of "The Walking Dead" RPG game vibe to it, which is pretty awesome.  I highly recommend it for fans of the Oregon Trail games, zombie apocalypse survival scenario fans, and people just looking for a simple game that's easy to pick up and play either for a few minutes at a time or for hours on end.","February 7","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are 8-bit like, it really adds to the game if you grew up playing Atari 2600, Nintendo and older PC games. The music and setting is quite awesome. Instead of a horse and wagon, you are in a station wagon after a Zombie apocalypse. You are traveling across the United States in the "Family Truckster". You have to scavenge and trade for supplies, and of course fight off lots of zombies. The shooting part takes a minute to get used to, but once you get the hang of it you will be blowing away zombies and also bandits like crazy. It plays more like a role-playing game a bit. You have random encounters that adds to the game everytime you play. If you are looking for a completely different game to play, this one is it. See if you can survive, and try for a high score. Endless mode is challenging. There is even a Halloween mode. Also plenty of achievements to be unlocked and other fun stuff to do.

Instead of a wagon, you have a station wagon, and instead of homesteading the west, you are trying to escape the zombie apocalypse... by going west! It might have simple graphics, yet it's fun and challenging. Sadly it does have some boring parts, where you just watch your car move, and terrible things like breaking a battery or someone getting bitten will happen. This makes it very similar to the game with a similar name, where someone will just randomly die of malaria, but the zombie apocalypse setting makes it way better. The resource management is also still there, while instead of hunting for animals, you will be hunting bandits or going for an item while zombies hunt you. Organ Trail is one of those simple games that ends up being pretty awesome. Pimp your ride, ford hordes, survive zombie deer herds, then get your brains gnoshed on by a zombie bear and have to start all over from the beginning... again.","July 9, 2013","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s significantly longer and more difficult though, and has the added threat of zombies.\n\nThere’s not much story to be found in Organ Trail, just you and a group of friends driving west across the United States in a station wagon trying to reach Safe Haven on the west coast. On the way you’re set upon by random occurrences (almost all of them bad) and have to stay alive through resource management and generous use of your rifle.\n\nGameplay wise, your travel path is fixed, and while you can increase/decrease your rate of travel (it affects the rate at which your car breaks down) you will always have the same distance to travel to reach the end of the game (no shortcuts). Just like in the old Oregon Trail game, probably the only part of the game you have direct control over is the “scavenging” missions where you walk around a small area looking for food. In Oregon Trail, you shot at animals like deer and rabbits to collect food, but in Organ Trail you collect randomly appearing goodies while shooting at the zombies chasing you. Pretty much all the old events that plagued you in Oregon Trail are back (dysentery, random weather, losing inventory items) but now you and your group can be infected by zombies (no cure for a zombie bite).\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgia for an old classic game\n+People who enjoy “rogue-like” games may appreciate the randomness of Organ Trail\n\nCons:\n-The game is very hard, even on easy mode because of all the randomly occurring problems. There really isn’t any “skill” involved with beating the game. It mostly depends on how lucky you are.\n-If you’re into high end graphics, you’re looking in the wrong place. This game is practically 8-bit.\n\nI played Organ Trail because my video card died and I couldn’t run anything with modern graphics. It’s a decent way to spend a few hours, but surely there are better games that you’d rather be playing after the nostalgia factor wears off.\n","August 17, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are several, and they aren't afterthoughts. They're actually fun minigames. Unlike the old action interludes they parody, they're designed to frighten and challenge while still giving you a fair shake at success. Despite its appearance, this is a new videogame first and a retro homage last. Its underlying design is sophisticated and graceful.\n\nMuch has been said about the awkward aiming controls, but they are like some ancient forgotten system unearthed by gaming archaeologists. I got used to them quickly, without ever becoming too comfortable. They add a manageable awkwardness to the combat encounters that I enjoyed.\n\nMy one objection was the jarring experience of losing outright when my main character died, something I did not expect after finding myself in a groove of what seemed like a classic party adventure. This game feels more like a successor to Might & Magic, Starflight, and indeed FTL than it feels like like a one-joke riff on a piece of pop nostalgia, and I was a little bummed to just have the story end with four of my party still alive. Then again, there's something to be said for never finding out what happened to those guys. It's a little haunting, a bit more of what we fear about death than usually makes it into a game.\n\nTwo bonus stars for an appropriate and pretty chiptune soundtrack, good production values, modern resolution options, and for somehow being much easier on the eyes than screenshots might lead you to believe.","October 29, 2013","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicalMerlin/recommended/233740/","MusicalMerlin","JoJ The Rat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicalMerlin/","189 products in account","This game can be my vote for the most satisfying game of all time. This is my assinine opinion, but still is valid because of the following:\n\nThe game is my dream in terms of style. Fantastic job with the graphics that may have taken up little to no time to make. I just love the old style that they present. The clicking when you click on something is so important that I click my way to death, literally. Just to hear the click sound.\n\nThe story is pretty loose because it just throws you into it with this cool guy at the beginning but once you learn what the game is about and how to generally play it, it becomes a severe addiction.\n\nIf anyone hates spoilers then cease your eyeballs from moving any further.. Did you stop?... STOP READING!!!\n\nAnyway, the basic format of the game is to drive to a "Safe Haven" across the U.S., roaming from D.C. all the way to the western part of the U.S. It's all fun and games the whole way there. I mean if you wanted to have fun and ♥♥♥♥ around the whole time, you could. The only thing is, you'll pay for it at the end. This is how the game works. Throughout your travel across the U.S. (In a beat up station wagon, I might add) you will encounter either opportunities or events. Events are forceful, opportunities are choices. The choices in opportunity and completion of the events don't affect you, it's how you manage your supply of food, ammo, spare parts, Ect, along the way. By the end, you may have had a ball and assumed that this is it, this is you ending the game. However, the game will throw you this epic curve ball that will suck the life out of all your characters. Now, I will not reveal what the ending is or the objective. That's TOO MUCH SPOILER. However, I will say, that if you play for fun, don't play the end.\n\nFun game for the old souls who need a good sound check and visual revamp. Best thing about this amazing game is the music. I wouldn't have been able to suffer the loss of ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥, and ♥♥♥♥♥ if it hadn't been for the amazing background music.","February 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very fun to try another game at harder difficulties, but if it drags on for too long you eventually become exhausted of the lack of surprises and it's very hard to keep interest. This happened in my first run. Scavenging consists of picking randomly appearing items on a limited map as zombies randomly spawn and get close to you, for 40 seconds. Sometimes you'll need to scavenge many times in a row. Yeah.\n\nMusic is one of the best i've seen around, a frankenstein composed of chiptune music mixed with real instruments, super capable of conveying the emotions of having to put down your now-8-bit best friend after realizing you weren't going to have enough food to make it to safe haven at this pace.\n\nCould have had a lot of variation item wise, and would have been nice to have more things to look at, talking to strangers just consists of a text screen, and you can do it anywhere, even when not in towns. It made you question the solidity of the plot; just how many people are going on the roads at once if you can talk to anybody at anytime? Why is it dangerous then?\n\nOnce you learn the mechanics it's very, very hard to die. Resting can get over any disease, broken leg, or bullet wound. There's no apparent benefit from keeping your friends  alive other than having extra support at finales and the score multiplier. They won't complain about your choices, you'll never be kicked off being a leader or care too much if someone gets bitten, after all, they won't die if they get bitten unless their health goes really low. Which is prevented with resting a few hours per town. Yeah.\n\nOtherwise, the game is really great and the first run you'll be covering your face hoping the scrap you managed to collect before you starved is able to fix your car so you can get to the next town and hopefully buy food. Real tense moments where your hands are tied and you must project into the future to know what to do, maybe Bobby doesn't deserve coming with you guys if he ruined food by sitting on it or throwing your only muffler at a zombie.

Growing up in the US, many of us had elementary schools which bought Oregon Trail because it was educational.

If I had to describe the genre it would be towards simulation where you have to manage resources. Combine that with the quirky humor (and pixel art) you expect from indie games.\n\nMy only complaint is that the gun controls are kind of strange. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I play with an unusual control setup so it's kind of difficult for me.

The gameplay is simple but fun, and the original's Oregon Trail painful aspects (keyboard aiming for an example) have been scraped out.\n\nThe game has many secrets and unique finds, aiming for a good replayability factor, but these events are so rare (i only came across 2 in 8 full gameplays, when the game says there are over 15) that you won't experience everything this game has to offer. The game is also a bit too short.\n\nThere are many, many events and possibilities, but the trailer's makes one believe that this will be also a psychological battle against yourself, with many moral dilemmas and such,  when the largest one you will find is pressing a button to kill one of your crew.\n\n6.5/10 ,only purchasable because its cheap , but not for everyone.","May 24, 2015","false","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Random encounters occur throughout the game and make every playthrough a little bit different than the one before it; but only ever slightly. The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and provides some really cool moments. It’s well worth the price as you could easily sink many, many hours into the game.","September 13, 2015","true","41.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can clearly say that I love this game. Naming your rag-tag group of survivors after friends, and soon letting yourself be more immersed in the atmosphere and looking past the retro pixel graphics, you got yourself a zombie survival game. It's really a huge part of my own personal fun of how I can imagine and experience my friends or certain people coming along to my ride, going through starvation, infection, bandits, zombies, and the like. With the chores of taking care of supplies, you can go at the game with your own pace, either it be conservative, going at a slow pace while trying to save as much food by starving your party, or much more aggressive/safe where you go as fast as possible, pushing your car to limits, as you give a huge buffet for all your party members to keep them healthy. There are two main modes to the game. There's the campaign mode;moving from Washington D.C all the way to the west coast to your final destination: Safe Haven. Then there's Endless mode, with you going as far as possible in the fastest pace for more points, trying to keep yourself, and (depending on your playstyle.) keeping your party alive. This is honestly a great simple game, with an amazing soundtrack along with lots of events occuring along with RNGesus to dicate a slow-death, or a plentiful gold mine of food, medkits, and other supplies. With the complete edition DLC, all your fun with the game only doubles, now adding extras! Such as even MORE RNGesus to give you more ways to death, a lot more choices in what you do. An amazing parody/redesign to the original Oregon Trail. Every dollar was worth it.","May 5","true","104.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game delivers fun gameplay in spades.\n\nYou start off by picking the names of your companions, so you can sentance people you disilke to die or bring friends with you in spirit, after that its pretty much a zombie road trip, bad things will happen, you can try and prepare for it the best you can, but you are on a road trip cross country to reach a safe haven.\n\nThe game has plenty of easter eggs, homages, and is just down right awesome, if you love zombie games, and adore indie games you really need to pick this one up for yourself.","July 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The goal of the game is to make it from the east coast of the usa to the west coast. If you take into cosideration that a zombie apocalypse is taking place while you are trying to achieve that, it certainly doesn't make things any easier.\nThe gameplay is simple but really intense: You and 4 other survivors (which you can name however you like) travel in a car from landmark to landmark. On the way from one landmark to another there are various things that can happen: You get robbed by thieves who steal your fuel, someone gets bitten by a zombie, a horde of deers appears behind you and you have to dodge them, someone gets sick, etc. etc.\nOn the landmarks you get the chance to trade with other survivors for food, fuel, medkits, etc. You get to scavenge for supplies, repair your car or get perks from traders.\nAll in all the gameplay is pretty simple, but awfully intense. The fact that you never know what happens on the road and the feeling you get when you are close to the safe haven but you don't know if you can make it because you are low on fuel or food is really nervewrecking and well done.\n\nOh and the graphics and sound are phenomenal. 8-bit awesomeness from top to bottom.\n\nI'd recommend this game. The replayabilty is also pretty high, since every run is different and there is an endless mode to sum it all up. It's definitely worth 5 bucks. And if you are not sure, try out the free flashgame on the interwebs.","September 12, 2014","true","19.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Organ Trail is a old school adventure game where you travel by car, along with 4 of your friends, to a safe place where you're totally free of zombie attacks and other dangers.\n\nThe art style is retro, so there are a lot of crude pixels and minimal sounds. I guess that also makes the gameplay retro, because it certainly isn't all that easy.\n\nThere are so many things you have to take into consideration. Do you have enough spare tires, batteries and gas for your car, or enough food and medkits for your crew ? Are you prepared to trade stuff in order to get some of these things ? Do you even have stuff to trade ? If not, you have to scavenge for items. But is it safe from zombies or is the place packed ? And do you spend your money on buying upgrades for your car, or do you spend it on buying just the necessary ?\nThere are a few boss fights, too, and quite a couple of random events, like, what are you going to do when a friend is being held hostage (shoot the guy in the face of course !) ? These random factors make this a great and fun game.\n\nThe aiming, however (when you're scavenging or doing jobs), takes some getting used to. It becomes somewhat natural after a while, but doesn't feel quite right. I guess the developer chose this control scheme to keep the game more tense. If that's the case; they have succeeded. Congratulations developer !\n\nIf you're still on the fence about buying this: I can highly recommended it.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","March 28, 2013","true","10.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

That said...\n\nI didn't have a good experience. Some of the mini-games upon leaving settlements are fun (e.g. biker attack, etc.), and the scavenging is interesting for the first handful of times. After that, everything just felt pointless.\n\nResources: While scavenging, you only ever find 3 of the 8 or so resources you need. It quickly became quite boring to always find the same 3 things over and over again. I ended up with uselessly huge stockpiles of these resources to the point that they became irrelevant, and spent days waiting for traders to come by and offer to trade for anything else. This may be better on harder difficulties, but it was my first time through, so "normal" seemed like the logical choice.\n\nParty: As far as I can tell, there's no point to keeping your party alive other than just for the sake of keeping them alive. This is easier said than done, not because it's actually hard to care for them, but because they randomly wander off, and there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe I just had bad luck, but by 2/3 of the way through the trip all but one of my party had died this way. Maybe there's something that happens at the end if you have more survivors, but I never made it there because...\n\nWith just a few stops left, my party saw "something interesting" happening off the highway. I chose to invesitage, and the game locked up. Just a black screen with the music playing and a little decorative pattern at the top. Apparently this is a common problem.\n\nOther reviewers here seem to like it. I found it repetitive, and all the progress I made was too easily wiped out by completely random mechanics and technical problems, making the game more frustrating than fun.\n\nTL;DR: Repeatedly scavenged for the same 3 items in order to feed a party that wandered off and died anyway. Then the game crashed. There are better games available for $5. If you can get it for a buck or two on sale, it might be worth it.","July 6, 2014","false","3.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The premise is that you are in a zombie apocalypse, and Washington DC is going to be destroyed by a nuclear weapon in a few hours, so you and a band of your friends head out for 'Safe Haven,' a land out west said to be free from the zombie infection. along the way, you battle zombies, ram aggressive bikers off the road in your station wagon, and try to keep your friends healthy and alive.\nJust by looking at the title, it's easy to see that its a parody of the game "The Oregon Trail" from the 1970's. The gameplay is incredible simplistic, and the graphics are very minimalist, similar to that of an Atari 2600. That being said, it is great fun. The game has many randomly generated events, leading no playthorugh to be the same, and there is quite a bit of strategy involved as you try to ration out your resources and keep your entire party alive all the way to Safe Haven. I don’t really know what it is, maybe the simple graphics, the eerie music, or the thought of running out of some important material halfway to the next landmark, but this game is also very atmospheric, and you can start to get attached to your companions along the way. However, the game is not incredibly difficult on lower difficulties, though I have not tried out the higher ones yet, and sometimes the events can be a bit repetitive and tedious. On normal, even the jobs with a difficulty labeled "suicidal" are fairly easy to complete.\n\nWith all that said, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested. It’s a very enjoyable game with a lot of content, plenty of replayability and an eerie atmosphere around it, even though it is so simple.\n","November 30, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Probably a better way to get your Oregon Trail fix than actually trying to go back and play the verison this is based off of - it scales nicely and looks great even on my 2560x1440 resolution and the music/sound is retro inspired but won't make your ears bleed after a couple hours like some of the older games will.\n\nIt's also got some cute perks and other modes like a little physics one where you mow zombies down in your station wagon and an endless mode. I probably won't go through and get all the unlocks and acheivements, but if you love it there's a lot here that tempts you for another few playthroughs.","September 5, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I was very mistaken. It's dark, dreary, and eerie, and while some parts are very funny, it's still dark and scary. For instance, there is a possible scene where you find a woman who is sad, because on her wedding day, the outbreak occurred and her future husband died. The way it was written kinda creeped me out most of all, though.\nHowever it's a lot of fun, especially if you've played Oregon Trail before.

It's pretty good.\n\nIt does have one major failing in how combat works. You shoot by clicking and dragging away from the direction you want to fire. Even with the aiming guide on easier difficulties, it makes combat incredibly frustrating, because you're hunting for the magic pixel your mouse needs to be over in order for you to shoot in the actual direction you want. Not sure what wouldn't have worked about just clicking in the direction you want to shoot. You'd think with how much combat is a core mechanic of the game that how shooting works would be a lot more intuitive. It's enough of an issue that I can only give it three stars out of five at best, when it could have been five out of five.\n\nI'm still reccomending the game though because it's still pretty playable even with this one flaw.","June 27, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It'll take some wits, skill, and luck to get across the US. Overall I thought the game was a lot of fun, and it's a game I know I'll come back to every so often.

The playstyle is similar - survival is a priority. Organ Trail encompasses some funny minigames in deserted cities, grim moments on the lonely highways and the constant pressure of scarce recourses. The art style resembles that of "The Oregon Trail" and is, although being outdated, still very nice to look at. The soundtrack is about one hour long and is an 8-bit adventure on its own.","June 25, 2013","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, instead of a covered wagon of pioneers trekking from Missouri to Oregon across the 19th-century American Midwest, replace all that with a station wagon of survivors trekking from Washington, D.C. to California across post-apocalyptic America. From the gameplay to the graphics, everything in Organ Trail: Director's Cut pays homage to the classic Oregon Trail for the Apple II, but it adds its own interesting twists for a unique experience. Multiple difficulty levels, game modes, unlockables, achievements, and other various extras give it a good amount of replayability. The controls are a little wonky and take some time to get used to, but the game is solid otherwise. Amidst a sea of other zombie games, Organ Trail: Director's Cut manages to be unique by creatively merging multiple ideas, both modern and classic, to create a rewarding gameplay experience.","July 20, 2013","true","24.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I have 8 different game consoles going back to the SEGA Master System, and I still play them all. Any game that can offer a memorable experience with a big dose of familiarity is likely to score points with me. Organ Trail delivers.\n\nMy love of zombie lore is well known, so a game that promises cannibalistic carnage is already on the wishlist. But the real reason I'm recommending this little gem is for the mental rush it gives me. I feel like I'm back in 2nd grade computer class, and Miss Eissens said we could stop the typing and play. I spent many frustrating and rewarding hours shooting buffalo and fording rivers, only for Mary to get dysentery and die horribly. The original Oregon Trail is one of those games that everyone has played, whether they're a gamer or not. Organ Trail is a faithful homage and a ridiculous zombie apocalypse yarn as well. The graphics are simple, 16-color pixels, the controls are hair-pullingly difficult to master, and even on the lowest difficulty setting, you are not reaching Safe Haven without taking a few hits. The random events include blizzards, sandstorms, and bandits. You have to keep your party healthy, and you have to make sure your station wagon doesn't break down. You'll also have to ford hordes of zombies, engage in shoot-outs with gangs, and buy and sell food, ammo, scrap, fuel, car parts, and medkits.\n\nThere are loads of references to other zombie games and films, including Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Evil Dead, and many, many more. The game has a juvenile sense of humor and a pleasing measure of self-awareness; it's possible to encounter a stranger in town who simply says "these controls suck!"\n\nThere are nearly 30 achievements and over 300 unique tombstones to find (including... YOUR OWN!), encouraging replayability. Endless mode and Clements Quest are also welcome additions to the formula, and there's in-game "Skulls" to shoot for while playing. Heh. Skulls. Shoot. I'm funny.\n\nOrgan Trail is not going to please everyone. This game is not for the hardcore FPS player or someone who wants an in-depth story and simple controls. This game is for people who remember the ecstacy and the agony of playing Oregon Trail back in the day and thinking "yeah, it's fun, but it could use more zombies."","July 22, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However it gets a bit carried away with the micro transactions, and having to wait around a lot.\n\nAlso I just encountered a bug the moment I submitted this review, so now my experience is soured because I'm stuck in some small glitch that I have no idea how to fix, I'm stuck in front of a hord in the rain, but I can't stop, wait, or move, so I can only assume the creators didn't intend to make their game unplayable and it has to be a bug. It's a small one that not many people have encountered, so I'll give it a pass for now, since they could patch it and otherwise this is a fun game.\n\nIt really feels like a tablet game after you play it a while, and it is coming out for tablet devices so that makes sense. I think it's fun, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price, it's more of a game you want to play to pass some time, waiting at the band or waiting for your meal at a resturant if you're with people you don't want to talk to.","January 27, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But it turns out it's not, and is indeed an original/fresh game.\n\nThe graphics are authentic of what you would expect from a game during the days of the sega master system (and before). Do not be put down by the graphics however, as the gameplay is certainly there. I haven't had so much fun with a pixel based sprite game in at least a decade. There are lots of elements to the game that give you a rush of nostalgia, be it the music, the menu systems, or the animations, it certainly brought back memories of some titles on the sega mega drive; for me.\n\nThe various gameplay mechanics also work well, even though they are fairly simple. It's also quite fun to discover an old gravestone on the road-side (with a personal message that you wrote) on the next play through.\n\nI also have to say that the soundtrack is brilliant. Most games that i enjoy for years to come have succeeded on the basis of the music and the gameplay alone, i think Organ Trail might be one of them.\n\nI ended up with this game after the purchase of a recent humble-bundle, but having played a few hours through Organ Trail, i think it's somethin gi would've paid full price for on it's own.\n\n10/10 from me.

We would spend hours, trying to make it across the new world. Hunting for food, trading for bullets and wagon parts and struggling to keep your family alive, challenged by starvation and illness! Well guess what, If you love Zombies and Oregon trail, this is the game for you! I've already played many stories, seen many things, and have survived many times, but lost a few. Travel to the safehouse across the zombie-ridden United States, scavenging for food, scrap, and money. Trade with locals to get new parts for your station wagon, or more bullets. Run from stampeding zombie deer and fight off bandit attacks! You know those rivers you forded in Oregon Trail? Well now you ford your way through zombie hordes! Still not enough for you? Why don't you go ahead and invite a celebrety to ride in your station wagon with you?

That's not very much.'' I know it might not be much, but it just seem so fresh to me, and saying that I already got 3 hours in it isn't very smart of me, considering I have, by no means, been playing it non stop.\n\nI'm no expert in games like these, but it feels like a lot of content for the price tag.\nI'm gonna give it a 9 / 10 , because it does what it sets out to do very well.\nMy main problem with it is just the fact that the hitboxes when scavenging are a bit messed up. The hitboxes I'm talking about is the players. Sometimes you will feel cheated, or feel that it isn't fair, that the zombie could hit you. Why would you feel like that? Because it isn't fair, the player's hitbox is a bit too large, but it's easy to look past when the rest of the game is so addictive.","July 17, 2013","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game takes care to explore the wonderful word of '80s graphics and user interfaces, but doesn't do the dumb mistake of going all-in on nostalgia in many aspects, opting for difficulty settings and WASD control methods. The couple of things it keeps from Oregon Trail are the basic structure of the game as well as the savage Murphy's Law ♥♥♥♥ery permeating the gameplay.

I do know what makes a good game, though, and this is brilliant.\n\nThe aim of the game is simple; survive in a post-apocalyptic zombie-led world as you and four companions make it across the United States to the last remaining human stronghold.  Riding in a clapped-out station wagon, you'll need to gather what meagre supplies you can, keeping a close eye on your food, fuel, ammo and equipment for your vehicle, while riding from safe zone to safe zone.\n\nAt each safe zone, you'll be able to rest, repair and trade, along with taking part in optional scavenger missions or jobs that put you at greater risk.  The road between each zone is littered with random encounters, from conversation set pieces to shoot-outs, from graverobbing to surviving stampedes of undead animals.\n\nWhat makes this game brilliant is it is the perfect balance of risk versus reward.  Low on food? You could scavenge the surroundings while multiple zombies approach, but if they catch you, it could be all for naught.  Can your station wagon survive until the next zone, or should you stop in no-mans land and attempt to repair it? How long should you keep a valuable companion alive that has been bitten by the undead?  Should you blast through that zombie horde, or wait for it to disperse while your supplies dwindle?  And should you push your vehicle faster, to save on food and get to Safe Haven? Or would you go at a more leisurely pace, and risk running low on supplies?\n\nIt's important to note that this game is a fun diversion, a full playthrough taking no more than a few hours.  The mini-games are varied but very basic, as are the graphics - don't get this expecting anything more than crudely drawn Amstrad style animations.  The companions that accompany you are also nothing more than the name you give them.  It's best, then, to go into this game with a wild imagination, rather than a massive expectation of an epic zombie survival thriller.\n\nFinally, a shout-out must go to the gorgeous music, which is capable of inspiring terror and elation in equal measure.

Instead of putting you in some sort of map and you have to shoot up the zombies, what you have to instead do is travel across the country to get to the safe haven. Make sure you have enough spare tires, enough gas to make it over the states, but whatever you do, don't get bit!

Other than tell tales walking dead, I have not found myself very interested in most zombie games. I hated left4dead, and thought dead island was incredibly medicore. But this game is AMAZING. despite using an "atari" graphical style, and not exactually riviting in terms of music or dialouge ect, I found myself more emotionally attached to my own pixelated characters. Than any triple A zombie game out there.  As you progress, your resources get lower and lower, and things get tougher. The game gave me an odd sense of doom, but hope at the same time. And that hope is what kept me playing. To make it through.  I usually for the most part do not like indie games.  But with it's cheap price, and great replay value, I highly highly reccomended this.  I would hope for a sequel. But maybe it's better off being a stand alone game.  Whoever made this game, I commend you for the great amount of effort put into this simplistic but at the same time, complicated game.\n\nThe game is primarly about resource managment, and going across the USA, in hopes of getting to your final destination, "safe haven" you have to survive zombies, bandits, and get supplies, fix your car, ect, it's based off one of my favorite PC game series, "The Oregon Trail" I might even argue that this game is a tad bit better than the original Oregon Trail games. I'd highly reccomended it.","December 2, 2013","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its really hard to explain so ill try to summerize. there many thing you do so here we go nuber 1 you drive from city to city in those citys you trade for supplies to help you survive. Number 2 you can scavenge and collect supplies so you dont have to pay for them and there are many jobs rainging from getting something somoene lost to killing bandits. This game has much to do about strategy and rationing youre supplies which may become difficult when the game wants to cheat with ya.

I've been waiting to review this game for a long, long time. See, I have a policy of not reviewing a game until I complete it (and get all the achievements), and this game has been a thorn in my side for a long, long time. Readers of my previous reviews will know that I absolutely hate luck-based achievements. If there is nothing more I can do to earn the achievement, it drives me up a wall. This game has a) many, many of those achievments [notably the "Secret" achievement, which took forever as it's based on pure luck] and b) some of the achievements that aren't based on luck have broken counters. This means that whenever you exit the game, your progress is reset; if you want the achievements, you have to keep the game open until you finish it five times, find fifty tombstones, and check out thirty points of interest.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad, but it's glitchy. In addition to the achievements, I had several crashes which (admittedly) aren't that big of a hassle because the game saves every turn. However, I did experience several glitches (on both Mac and Windows) where the game wouldn't let me progress. This essentially means that the whole game needs to be started over, which is a terrible fate if you're playing on one of the upper difficulties and spent a long time setting up this run.\n\nI played Organ Trail when it was a flash game. I want to like this new incarnation. I really, really do. But I don't. It feels like a cheap clone into Steam to make money, with anything that got changed or added (save features, achievements, etc.) unfinished. I want to recommend this to you, but I can't. You may play it, and you may even have fun -- but God help you if you're trying to get all the achievements or get irritated by lost progress.","December 4, 2014","false","42.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savagerx/recommended/233740/","savagerx","SavagerX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savagerx/","484 products in account",""Organ Trail is a retro zombie survival game. Travel westward in a station wagon with 4 of your friends, scavenging for supplies and fending off the undead; Faithfully recreated it as if it were on the Apple 2. Packed full of zombie mechanics, themes and references; this is a must have for any zombie survival fans."\n\nTruer words cannot be spoken. If you have a touch of nostalgia or want to jump in your time machine and go back to the time when floppy disks ruled the earth, then this game is for you. From the midi music to the graphics, the game is retro through and through.Total time it took me to complete it was set at around 3 hours, and by the first 30 minutes you already know the entire game mechanics and how to beat them.\n\nLike with any dubstep song however, you gotta wait for the drop:\n\nI would not recommend buying it unless you are feeling nostalgically retro, $5 is a bit steep seeming as you can get a host of golden oldies off of websites such as Abandonia for free and the only reason I came across this game was because it was included in one of the Humble Bundles.\n\nI say that just like zombies, the modern-retro era is dead and this game serves to merely show us what horrors lurked in the past in the form of 8 bit graphics and midi scores that leave your ears bleeding. The past was great but we have come a long way from it - no point in trying to resurrect it in the hope that it bites a gamer and sets off a retro gaming contagion.","September 11, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But the big problem is that the pace of this game is terribly slow. It takes an hour or two to beat the game, and 90% of that hour is spent watching your car drive with no real interaction from you. The other 10% are buy/sell menus and small minigames that quickly get repetitive.\n\nIt's probably not bad as a mobile game, to fiddle with on your cellphone once in awhile... but as a PC game it's more frustrating and bland than anything else. It might be a whole lot better if there were a fast-forward button.","January 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But...Organ Trail can still be a nice divergion.  I feel like the choices you make while on the road don't quite make a big deal in the long run.  The differences here between this and Oregon Trail is that Oregon trail gives you different paths to take with positives and negatives associated with them plus a mini game to complete the task.  Organ Trail has this too (if you buy the dlc) but the differences are very minute and you don't get to really experience doing the different path.  Your car just keeps milling about on the road without any input from you.  Most of the time I just skip all the messages that pop up because it's all RNG.  You have no input in whether you lose a bunch of ammo or food.  The game just does everything for you while yoiu auto drive.\n\nThe different paths you take just means a faster route plus more hazards, like radiation sickness.  The towns are all the same. Some have trainers and others, upgrades for your car.  Thats really the only BIG difference in choosing a different path.\n\nScavenging gets old REAL fast.  If you buy the dlc, you can fight off humans as well as the undead.  All in all, it's a decent waste of time.  You just wont be coming back to it over and over.  It's more of a 1-2 hr time waster when you're really bored.","October 22, 2015","true","25.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","August 22, 2015","false","7.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

I paid $1.99 for this game and I want my money back.\n\nThe shooting controls are meant for a tablet, and the developer seems to be more interested in making excuses for being too lazy to adapt the game to PC controls than actually doing work to fix it. Sure, I could waste time practicing such a stupid mechanic, but I don't consider it fun. Maybe the rest of the game is fun, but I don't feel like finding out. The game isn't witty enough or interesting enough to grab me and get me to fight past such a glaring flaw.\n\nThe excuse used for not having keyboard controls for shooting is that with a keyboard you can only aim in 8 directions. If they honestly believe that, they are terrible programmers. Even if that were true, it would be a thousand times better than what exists currently.","November 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

I'm too young to have ever played Oregon Trail, which Organ Trail is based on. Others can tell you the pros and cons, because when I try to think of pros and cons, I can only think of personal experiences i've had playing the game.  Like the time Michelangelo from TMNT was bit by a zombie and I didn't execute him for experimental reasons. (Mainly because I wanted to see the effects of a zombie bite on a mutated turtle.) While I was resting healing up my party, he turned and bit the RED Spy from TF2 and infected him. After putting Michelangelo down, I heard the RED Spy in my head.\n\n"I don't wish to die and turn into one of those. Kill me."\n\nTruly, it was a hard moment in that playthrough. I think that is what's so fun about Organ Trail: the personal experiences and stories that derive from the gameplay. Very, very few games can say that many stories and reviews about the game derive from the gameplay.\n\nTo put it in a short way: It's an old school, road trip zombie game that can't be missed, even for just one playthrough.\n\nAnd I guarentee that most players will have many more playthroughs than just one.\n\n10/10 Would experiment with a zombie bite on a turtle again.","February 10, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stays true to what Oregon Trail was except it is now a zombie survival, without big guns and swearing every two minutes. And I am not going to forget the pop culture references, there is Shaun from Shaun of the dead, the four main characters from Zombieland, and the most noticeable is the trader from Resident Evil 4. The soundtrack is also pretty good. When scavenging, it will play ominous music, when a boss fight occurs, the music speeds up and you want to do anything except fight the boss because it will take a lot of your ammo to kill it. And the one thing that I enjoy most is the fact that you can shoot a person in their groin and kill them instantly.\n10/10","January 14, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/233740/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","Zombies are IN for quite a while now and this game has been around for a few years as well. It was originally made as a parody of Oregon Trail, a really old game that had numerous re-releases (it was made in 1971 and had like 10 incarnations so far) that allowed a player to experience the settling in western United States. Organ Trail was a free flash/browser game that had a lot of fans, so the creators started a Kickstarter campaign to make a Director's Cut as a fully commercial title. After the funds were collected the game was made and is now available for Steam and mobile devices.\n\nAs the game starts you are given a station wagon with some limited supplies (food, scrap for car repairs, a few spare tires, mufflers, car batteries, medical kits...) and 4 companions. Your goal: reach safe haven at the west and survive the zombie apocalypse. The whole game is set around random events that occur as you travel from one city/settlement to another while scavenging supplies, trading with other people, fighting off zombie attacks, escaping gangs that are after your supplies etc. Each hour that passes (in a matter of 2 seconds) is a possible trigger for a random event and they vary from simple weather changes that can slow you down to encounters with all kinds of people (these trigger classic text adventure kind of stories).\n\nSettlements offer a place to rest and trade and you can also get a job to earn some more supplies or money (arcade shootouts with zombies or bandits). Each city has a car shop that can upgrade your station wagon or a combat school to enhance your own abilities. Don't forget to refuel as well or you will get stranded in the middle of nowhere and forced to trade when you don't really want to.\n\nThe game looks and feels as if it was made in early 1980s and that gives it a specific charm. But don't let it turn you away! Seriously, it's kinda cute to have such a game in 2014 (or 2012, when it was made), a game that relies on gameplay rather than on awesome graphics. It's a lot of fun with all those events that may or may not occur, but it does have its limits. I completed it 4-5 times and it lost its charm - once you figure out the best way to gather supplies, when and where to sell them and what to buy instead - it gets real easy. True, there are difficulty levels but even the hardest one is hard only at the start. As for the zombie combat, I'll give you a tip: when you want to shoot a zombie click on the zombie and hold the mouse button as you drag it towards your avatar. It's a direct hit in 95% of cases.\n\nI haven't played the mobile version (I got it as well, but I just never cared much for mobile games) so I can't say much about it. From what I saw online it's quite popular and people who own it love it! Give this game a chance, it's fun even though it's very limited.","May 12, 2014","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice chap saved my life and we were happy. We got to a place which I didnt read cus f*** that. He found my friends Arya,Lara,Anton and Harry. We set off strong with plenty of medkits after shooting Clements in the face cus he got bitten.\nWe go for a way until disaster strikes. Lara breaks their arm and leg during 20 miles. This leaves her incapacitated. Shortly before we reach the next area she dies as I had run out of medkits. Next we reach the next area a bit shaken by the loss but the moment we leave Harry is bitten by a zombie. I still had no medkits so I was forced to kill him leaving me Anton and Arya.\nIt was then that disaster struck. Arya was hit by a stray bullet and is incapacitated. He dies quickly as I had no medkits. Me and Anton go far and are very close to the end with us being very healthy. Then Anton is hit by a stray bullet. He is not incapped and we continue but shortly after he is hit again by ANOTHER stray bullet. This incapps him and he dies when a blizzard strikes. I make it to the safe haven with low ammo but full hp. I fight through the zombies and am finally safe.\n\n10/10 would watch my friends die again.","January 6, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The art and music style are old school which I like. The aiming controls are kind of meh but you'll probably get used to them. In Organ Trail you travel along with 4 other people to a safe zone and along the way you'll find many things. You stop at land marks where you can buy/sell things and do jobs. You can trade and talk withother survivors, you encounter bosses (which I won't spoil), you encounter other survivors who you can help or harm depending on what kind of person you are. You have to take care of the 4 other people along on the ride which means you use up food quicker, you may have to kill them if they get infected, they can break supplies/do other stuff that hurts the group, or you can just kill all of them from the start and be a loner if you choose to do so. However what this game has that makes it almost not worth purchasing is the bugs. I know every game has bugs but this game has serious bugs that can break the game. I'm not talking about a zombie break dancing and hurting you, I'm talking about halting your progress permanently and failing the game for you. I encountered a glitch on my second playthrough where the car just stopped. You couldn't stop to rest or fix the car, you couldn't enter land marks, you couldn't do anything. The only way to progress is to restart the game and when you get back in the car drives for a couple seconds and stops again. So you can keep restarting the game to progress but because you can't stop to heal or repair the car you will eventually die and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. So in the end I would say for the low price of $5 it's worth it. It may have bugs but it's still a really good game.","December 6, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can be told that I'm "missing the point," but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.\n\nThe problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.\n\nAnd these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.\nThe game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.\n\nIn short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little "jokes" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me.","July 1, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.\n\nHere's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.\n\nIt's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.\n\nBe warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.\n\nTotal recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it. Just uh... don't play it late at night before you go to bed. You may have interesting dreams. o_o;\n\no_o;;;\n\nthe horror....\n\n/the Horrorrr..../","July 2, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for those that sat in the computer lab, mindlessly clicking away, this game is a rare treat and a crystal ball looking back into your childhood.  Many take to adding in names of their friends, but for me, I always added Spiderman, Batman, etc.  And it's very telling when Bruce Wayne crumples up money and destroys it out of boredom.  Rich b***ard.  While some of the key controls, IE shooting are bass-akwards, it didn't stop me from enjoying other parts of the game.\n\nWhile there is a working form of this game online, it doesn't have half the features of this game.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the full version and support the devs.  They gotta eat too.\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgic look back at the old Oregon Trail game you played in school\n+Interesting easter eggs located at nearly every checkpoint (From Final Fantasy, to Last of Us, to Shaun of the Dead, and more)\n+Randomized events give high replay\n+Interesting Achievements add another degree of difficulty (Can you make it without any money?  What about no trading? etc.)\n+Good soundtrack mixed with old-school sound effects\n+Endless mode makes it so you can unlock new starter modes!\n\nCons:\n-God awful inverted gun controls with no settings to change to normal\n-Glitchy counter, making certain achievements a course in futility\n-Zombie 'Boss Fights' are more of an exercise in running away than fighting off the undead.\n-Clements isn't around longer.\n\nRead all this way?

Organ Trail brings out oodles of bloodthirsty nostalgia in me, with delightful pixel art and appropriately retro soundtrack. The gun-firing mechanics and terrible random events are suitably frustrating, and the simple but genuinely impactful supply system (spend, barter, and stock up carefully) gives players plenty to fret over on top of avoiding the undead while scavenging, and hoping a party member doesn't break an arm, sit on a spare battery and ruin it (seriously, Craig, what the hell?), or get bitten. And the additional cake icing of modern day zombie genre favorites getting artistic nods and references all over really endeared me to the game, paying closer attention to background art and dialogue exchanges lest I miss one.\n\nI'd suggest this to anyone who loved Oregon Trail and is a fan of the zombie genre -- but what kind of lifeless monster would you be if you didn't and weren't?","February 24, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short game that can be completed in about two or three hours if you don't die, but you might be inclined to playthrough a few more times, though not much changes.

Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.\n\nHere's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.\n\nIt's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.\n\nBe warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.\n\nTotal recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it. Just uh... don't play it late at night before you go to bed. You may have interesting dreams. o_o;\n\no_o;;;\n\nthe horror....\n\n/the Horrorrr..../","July 2, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for those that sat in the computer lab, mindlessly clicking away, this game is a rare treat and a crystal ball looking back into your childhood.  Many take to adding in names of their friends, but for me, I always added Spiderman, Batman, etc.  And it's very telling when Bruce Wayne crumples up money and destroys it out of boredom.  Rich b***ard.  While some of the key controls, IE shooting are bass-akwards, it didn't stop me from enjoying other parts of the game.\n\nWhile there is a working form of this game online, it doesn't have half the features of this game.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the full version and support the devs.  They gotta eat too.\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgic look back at the old Oregon Trail game you played in school\n+Interesting easter eggs located at nearly every checkpoint (From Final Fantasy, to Last of Us, to Shaun of the Dead, and more)\n+Randomized events give high replay\n+Interesting Achievements add another degree of difficulty (Can you make it without any money?  What about no trading? etc.)\n+Good soundtrack mixed with old-school sound effects\n+Endless mode makes it so you can unlock new starter modes!\n\nCons:\n-God awful inverted gun controls with no settings to change to normal\n-Glitchy counter, making certain achievements a course in futility\n-Zombie 'Boss Fights' are more of an exercise in running away than fighting off the undead.\n-Clements isn't around longer.\n\nRead all this way?

Me being a fan of MS-DOS, I was really excited when I saw this game. I had to buy it instantly. Man, was I not disappointed. This game follows in the vain of "Oregon Trail". You are stuck in Washington D.C. during the apocalypse. You meet a local man and he helps you get to your friends. You have to kill him as he gets bit but then you get to name your friends and you are off to go across to the country. The whole point of the game is to get to the Safe Haven; which is on the West Coast. You must balance your food and oil usage; while also making sure you have enough food, medkits, and ammo to survive. But for this, you need money. You can earn money or supplies by doing missions and cities or other pit-stops. This game can be challenging. So challenging that I haven't been able to make it to the end yet. But, it is a great experience. You will have fun trying to balance your supplies and the certain events you can come across can be challenging. You can choose how to deal with these situations but make sure you choose correctly; there can be some bad consequences if you don't. If you are fan of MS-Dos games, Oregon Trail, zombies, or challenging games then this is a must buy.","December 22, 2013","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I skipped those because the aiming was always broken and I kept failing them. Combat in Scavenging can be hard at first but becomes easier after you practice.\n-Lack of diversity in the towns. Would be fun to have more stuff to do, different kind of missions, have discussions with people\n[Verdict]\nWorth every penny on this one, get it while it's so low if you're a zombie game/movie fan and like old school RPG games. I give this a solid 8/10. It's a great game for its price.\n\n","July 15, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well for starters this game is a major parody of Oregon Trail, as well as other zombie movies and games. But this parody acually is very fun, and it also has you thinking about how much resources you are using, making difficult choices, always putting you in situations that you never wish you could be in. The journey is quite long, mainly because you are traveling cross-country in nothig but a station wagon, which can also mean that you have a ton of stops along the way. Stopping your travels and seeing a random event that that occurs can go 50/50 : You could either find a large amount of fuel for the station wagon, or you could come across a bandit who will shoot your friend while holding them hostege. Having the largest role in this apocolypse as the group leader, it's YOUR job to manage all of the supplies, as well as scavenge, drive, make choices, and fixing the station wa- really you are the one who does all of the work. Can you make it to Oregon? Can you keep your fellow survivors alive? What will you do if you run out of gas? Who has time to bury the dead in a zombie outbreak? Well I can't answer all of the questions that you may ask, that's up to you to decide. So: should you buy this game? My answer is yes.","June 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of that, there are a ton of nods to just older games in general, which is always awesome.)\n\n-Retro Graphics: (A plus if you like them)\n\n-Replayable: (If you only play through this once, you will only see about 10% of the humor, challenges, etc. Each playthrough yields different things, such as events, and you can take a different approach everytime. You can stock up on different items, strive to do different things, and changing your sense of morality at anytime. The only really linear thing in this game is the path. You go from Point A, then Point B, all the way to Point Z, which is the safe haven you are trying to get to. It is what happens on your way to each point that makes this game interesting.)\n\n-Soundtrack: (This game has a really good sense of approach towards the situations you may be in, and one of the big reasons I say that is the soundtrack. The game always has fitting music, and good music at that.)\n\nCons\n\n-Gameplay: (This is a subjective con. The gameplay is interesting in that it really is true to how an older game like this would play. But that doesn't mean it is easy. My only complaint on this is the aiming. Considering you must fight off the undead with a ranged weapon, you HAVE to be good at aiming it. On top of that, you can't waste ammo, as it could be out of reach due to price, or the shear lack of it in the zombie wastelands you explore. The aiming is...weird. I suggest looking up a video of gameplay so you can see if you can cope with it. I've gotten used to it, but at the same time I shouldn't have to. Gameplay should be fluid and creative, yet natural. Honestly, I would like just one of those, but aside from this one con, if you can overcome this one annoyance, then this game is definitely worth it.)\n\nVerdict\nEverything about this game is near-perfect, aside from one thing. Gameplay. While everything else is so good, this is a big thing to do deal with since without gameplay, it wouldn't be a game. At the same time, you have to see if it would bother you so I suggest looking at a video of the gameplay to decide. If, afterwards, you decide that isn't too bad, then nothing else should be stopping you from getting this game aside from lacking the funds to do so. Everything aligns almost perfectly for this game but one thing, so decide from all of this if you would truely like it.\n\nP.S. There is also a mobile edition available for Android and iOS, so if you want to try this game but feel playing it with a mouse is a deal breaker, then that is the next best thing. The one thing both editions have over the free, Facebook alternative is that they are much more complete, and have A TON of addition content that adds to the experience of this game. The developer did fairly well on this title, so I trusted the mobile edition would live up to the PC edition here. Long story short, there is no game that really keeps itself consistent across all the platforms it's available on so well like this one!","June 29, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played on normal, and it seemed like the secret was just waiting for trading until low zombie activity, then scavanging (easily getting tons of food, scrap, and money) and trading said supplies for fuel and other car parts. I ended with 40+ fuel, over 1500 food, 20 medkits, and 6 of every car part.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/233740/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","Zombies are IN for quite a while now and this game has been around for a few years as well. It was originally made as a parody of Oregon Trail, a really old game that had numerous re-releases (it was made in 1971 and had like 10 incarnations so far) that allowed a player to experience the settling in western United States. Organ Trail was a free flash/browser game that had a lot of fans, so the creators started a Kickstarter campaign to make a Director's Cut as a fully commercial title. After the funds were collected the game was made and is now available for Steam and mobile devices.\n\nAs the game starts you are given a station wagon with some limited supplies (food, scrap for car repairs, a few spare tires, mufflers, car batteries, medical kits...) and 4 companions. Your goal: reach safe haven at the west and survive the zombie apocalypse. The whole game is set around random events that occur as you travel from one city/settlement to another while scavenging supplies, trading with other people, fighting off zombie attacks, escaping gangs that are after your supplies etc. Each hour that passes (in a matter of 2 seconds) is a possible trigger for a random event and they vary from simple weather changes that can slow you down to encounters with all kinds of people (these trigger classic text adventure kind of stories).\n\nSettlements offer a place to rest and trade and you can also get a job to earn some more supplies or money (arcade shootouts with zombies or bandits). Each city has a car shop that can upgrade your station wagon or a combat school to enhance your own abilities. Don't forget to refuel as well or you will get stranded in the middle of nowhere and forced to trade when you don't really want to.\n\nThe game looks and feels as if it was made in early 1980s and that gives it a specific charm. But don't let it turn you away! Seriously, it's kinda cute to have such a game in 2014 (or 2012, when it was made), a game that relies on gameplay rather than on awesome graphics. It's a lot of fun with all those events that may or may not occur, but it does have its limits. I completed it 4-5 times and it lost its charm - once you figure out the best way to gather supplies, when and where to sell them and what to buy instead - it gets real easy. True, there are difficulty levels but even the hardest one is hard only at the start. As for the zombie combat, I'll give you a tip: when you want to shoot a zombie click on the zombie and hold the mouse button as you drag it towards your avatar. It's a direct hit in 95% of cases.\n\nI haven't played the mobile version (I got it as well, but I just never cared much for mobile games) so I can't say much about it. From what I saw online it's quite popular and people who own it love it! Give this game a chance, it's fun even though it's very limited.","May 12, 2014","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have heard about this game and the original version before but; until my friends recommended me to check it out during a dinner with some Mexican food. I decided to buy it. I cracked up through most of it and I couldn't believe how fun it was. I highly recommend purchasing this becuase of the laughs you will have and the experiences you will tell your friends about. I'll give a short scenario during my gameplay experience.  In the game, I listed my 4 buddies I usually travel with in real life. Micah, Nathan, Anulfo and Dylan. In the game as I we were going to the west coast, a prompt pops up "A Bandit has Micah hostage" Then the game takes you to a screne with a Bandit having a gun to your friends head and you with one shot to kill him. Of course I missed and he killed my buddiy Micah. I cracked up and posted a Facebook comment on it and people were liking up the wazoo. I love the retro style of this game but I would love to see something similar this in 3D. Like Taletell's game The Walking Dead (which was amazing by the way) but with this style of gameplay.

I can be told that I'm "missing the point," but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.\n\nThe problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.\n\nAnd these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.\nThe game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.\n\nIn short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little "jokes" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me.","July 1, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone who spent many hours in his elementary school computer lab playing Oregon Trail, this inspired twist is just as fun and frustrating as the original.  No longer are you worried about illness, but now you are worried about an outbreak.  It is an inexpensive game worth every cent - and if you get it on sale, you will have tons of fun with this game.  I recommend naming the survivors in your team after your friends, and sharing with them the adventures your group has.\n\n","July 1, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.\n\nHere's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.\n\nIt's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.\n\nBe warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.\n\nTotal recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it. Just uh... don't play it late at night before you go to bed. You may have interesting dreams. o_o;\n\no_o;;;\n\nthe horror....\n\n/the Horrorrr..../","July 2, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for those that sat in the computer lab, mindlessly clicking away, this game is a rare treat and a crystal ball looking back into your childhood.  Many take to adding in names of their friends, but for me, I always added Spiderman, Batman, etc.  And it's very telling when Bruce Wayne crumples up money and destroys it out of boredom.  Rich b***ard.  While some of the key controls, IE shooting are bass-akwards, it didn't stop me from enjoying other parts of the game.\n\nWhile there is a working form of this game online, it doesn't have half the features of this game.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the full version and support the devs.  They gotta eat too.\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgic look back at the old Oregon Trail game you played in school\n+Interesting easter eggs located at nearly every checkpoint (From Final Fantasy, to Last of Us, to Shaun of the Dead, and more)\n+Randomized events give high replay\n+Interesting Achievements add another degree of difficulty (Can you make it without any money?  What about no trading? etc.)\n+Good soundtrack mixed with old-school sound effects\n+Endless mode makes it so you can unlock new starter modes!\n\nCons:\n-God awful inverted gun controls with no settings to change to normal\n-Glitchy counter, making certain achievements a course in futility\n-Zombie 'Boss Fights' are more of an exercise in running away than fighting off the undead.\n-Clements isn't around longer.\n\nRead all this way?  You deserve a treat.  Don't bring your friends to a zom-pocolypse.  Bring Chuck Norris.  Seriously.  Bring him.","July 2, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
