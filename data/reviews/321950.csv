Thing is, a tough-as-nails platformer needs tight controls to traverse its [hopefully] difficult levels. But one thing it shouldn’t have are difficult, wonky controls and/or weird physics. Sadly, Yuri has both of the latter, which makes it a hard-for-all-the-wrong-reasons platformer.\n\nStay away.

Any hard as nails platformer trys to keep you going by respawning you instantly or providing a method to instantly restart from the last saved checkpoint, this game does neither\n2. No good soundtrack, what is this music? I guess it is trying to replicate the 80s 8 bit music, but it is almost over trying in an attempt to sound stereotypically 8 bit. This music makes me want to stop playing, not keep trying\n3. Wired messed up physics, I get it, its a hard as nails platformer, thus the physics are usually messed up. But why in the world does the guy randomly slide when I am not telling him to go either left or right. There is a particular part when the save point is such that as soon as you respawn, you slide off the platform to your death, unless you jump the other side and by luck land on another platform, but not slide off that platform\n4. No ability to change the controls. Really? Can I use anything else? How about the giant space button you are ignoring for some odd reason?\n5.  No graphics options, ok maybe you wanted to make a really retro looking 8-bit game, that doesn't mean it should lack features that define games of this century, other wise go and charge the price we would pay for such games, the 25 cents for such a game at a garage sale\n6. Oh and if this is fully english (as marked on the store page), what does the text say when you run into spikes, that doesn't look like english to me). That is false advertisement claiming english is fully supported when a blatant non-english message flashes every time you start to die.\n\nedit: someone has alerted to me the key binding of r to restart from the last checkpoint, thank you for that, though on that note, why are the key bindings for this game listed anywhere? Just because a game is supposed to be retro does not mean that you can be lazy and not feel obligated to list the keybindings anywhere\n\nFor these reasons, and until at least some of these issues are patched, (and the game works), I am rating this as a 1.5/10","December 11, 2014","false","3.1"," 58 of 86 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","58","86","2","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightrage/recommended/321950/","midnightrage","Rage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightrage/","574 products in account","I would like to say firstly that I voted for this game on greenlight. I rather liked the art style, and I enjoy games like Electronic Super Joy, Stealth B-stard Deluxe and Dustforce. I honestly wanted to like this game, but after 30 mins of frustration I just cannot continue to play.\n\nThe biggest problem that makes this game unplayable for me is buggy/unresponsive controls. I get that it's meant to be one of those impossibly hard platformers, but you'll find yourself sliding off platforms when you're not moving (at one checkpoint it happened every time I respawned) and falling down when your character fails to jump. I didn't even get to face enemies because it was just too painful to get past the second checkpoint. If the control issues were to be fixed, I would probably give it a go again.\n\nTo those saying you can't change graphics settings or controls, you can use the "Yury Configuration" window that pops up before you launch the game, the only issue is it doesn't seem to save your options so you have to configure it every time you launch the game. I had set it to play in windowed mode and changed the jump button to spacebar, which makes it more bearable.\n\nThe music could be better, too. One thing common to the games I mentioned above is that they have excellent soundtracks that make you want to keep playing for that alone. This game is cheap though, so I can't complain too much.\n\nIt does seem that the dev is trying to fix the issues with the game, so I may change my review when and if these issues get sorted out.","December 27, 2014","false","2.0"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","0"

Now onto the Pro’s and Con’s.\n\nPro's:\n\n♦ Old School Platformer\n♦ Concept of Overheating and Oxygen is good\n♦ Steam Cards\n♦ Decent number of Achievements\n\nCon's:\n\n♦ Control physics are glitched beyond belief (Press something and you’ll go way further than pressed)\n♦ Dodgy Collision\n♦ Many many glitches (I got stuck running back and forth at high speeds to name one)\n♦ Way too difficult (Not only do the glitchy physics make it near impossible, the fact that half the time you can’t see the ledge you have to land on, making your jumps “Luck” based ruins it)\n♦ No sound on Main Menu\n♦ Repetitive Music\n♦ Main Menu says “Exit to Dos” (I know this is an old school game, but seriously?)\n♦ Default is the only option in Graphics Options (Should be more for considering it’s 2015…)\n♦ No Sound Options\n♦ Due to the poor physics and glitches it’s almost impossible to finish and get all achievements (This sucks if you are trying to 100% the game)\n♦ Everytime you get hurt some stupid Russian thing overlays the Screen (I know you can turn this off in the Options but still... why add something when 99% of people will turn it off? To me this is 100% stupid. It seems as though no effort was put into the Death Screen Overlay)\n♦ No language options (99% of the game is in English, yet we have to view Russian Text on Death Screen which I’m sure not everyone can understand or even read as like me they wouldn’t speak Russian)\n♦ Graphics could be better, even for Retro Old School Style they really suck!\n♦ Dying takes way to long and is way too slow (I say Oxygen is a nice Concept… but if you hit a Spike for instance, it’ll take a while for your Oxygen to deplete and as it depletes your character is pretty much useless. You can press R to restart which you shouldn’t have to do, death should be faster)\n♦ Only incentive to replay the game is Achievements which is good but once you have those and have finished the game there is no real incentive to replay it as it is 100% the same every time you play it\n♦ No Global Steam Leaderbords (You could easily add these in for number of deaths to complete the game)\n♦ Lags too much when you get the Gun (Shooting is laggy, game becomes choppy and slow, movement becomes even more glitchy)\n\nOverall, I'd recommend against buying this game unless you love broken physics, glitches and a game that is so bad you can’t even finish it, little own 100% it. I’d only recommend this if you were given it 100% free, yes it’s not even worth $3.\n\nTherefore, unless they fix the 99% of problems this game has, BOYCOTT IT and find something worth playing!","February 18, 2015","false","6.3"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","25","36","3","0"

At first time, I want to cry & become rage because of death so many times. And the worst part are sloopy control, that can make slip out the platform easily.  But if you can managed the control, its become playable. Well, the control is not one of the hardest part. The other one is the first phase  of the game.\n\nFrom my experience, this game can be divided become 3 phase :\n\nPhase 1 (Journey from the surface to the bottom of the planet underground)\n\nThis phase can make people anger & rage quit because it's very difficult. Yury can't kill the alien, only jump & dodge the trap and reach the other platform. And be wary of spike trap. When you touch it, you lose the oxygen and then you can die. The only way to finish this phase is going down to the bottom. In my first playthrough, I'll death 250 times in this phase.\n\nPhase 2 (The Action Time)\n\nOnce you get the bottom, and got the weapon. The game become easy, but not an easy enough. Yury can shoot the enemy and kill it with one bullet. In this phase, the gameplay become enjoyable and fun. There is no hardcore platforming trap & jump like the first phase that can make you die a lot. And at the final of this phase, you meet the boss. Its easy enough to kill if you learn the pattern. Btw, in my first playthrough I'll death 50 times in this phase.\n\nPhase 3 (Going Surface & Escape The Planet)\n\nWhen you managed kill the boss. The gravity of this planet become low. This can make you jump higher & higher. And this phase is the easiest part of the game. The only mission is going to surface and find what he looking for before going home. In this phase, I'll death 4 times in my first playthrough.\n\nPROS\n\n+ hardcore gameplay\n+ soundtrack\n+ game design & concept is good as the retro game\n+ old-school retro & minimalist graphic\n+ the game becoming more fun if you managed got the weapon\n\nCONS\n\n- control are teribble\n- sloopy platform\n\nWell, Yury is the hardcore dificult platformer with sloopy control that you can hate or enjoy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/321950/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Context\nYury is an old-school inspired shooter-platformer, trying to be faithful to the old days by having hard as nails difficulty.\n\nWhile it has some aspects that are quite nice, most of the game falls into very obvious design flaws, coupled with very significant programming bugs and inconsistent systems.\nIt's unfortunate, since most of the problems could be easily fixed, and made the game somewhat worthwhile, instead of the unfair and frustrating experience that it is at the moment.\n\nThe game can be completed in about 20 minutes, but I doubt anyone here will manage that the first time! I've taken four hours to beat it, while taking notes and trying to figure out exactly what was wrong in some sections.\n\nPresentation\nVisually, it's very simple looking, with backgroundsonly have 3-4 frames of animation, but aside from the limitations, I found it pretty decent. The pink/purple-ish color reminded a lot of the game Bleed, actually.\nThere are only a couple of enemy designs, but they look pretty good.\nWhile there isn't a lot of environment decoration in the game, with the vegetation being very sparse, I thought it looked pretty cool.\n\nHowever, there's one big flaw right of the bat:\nDeliberate obstruction of the game's view\nFor some reason, the developer thought it would be great to have foregroud elements hidding enemies and platforms. It's frustrating and is just there to ♥♥♥♥ players off. There is a lot of unpredictability in this game, which is a very artificial way of creating difficulty, in the way Yury does it.\n\nThe sound-effects are functional, not much to say about it.\nThe music, however, was pretty good! It fit the old-school vibe, and seemed generally well made.\n\nStructure & Basic Mechanics\nThe game has essentially 2 parts. During the first, you have no gun, making it a pure platformer. There are enemies, making you do some very, very unforgiving dodges, and even take advantage of the game's flaws to beat a certain section.\n\nDuring the second half, the platforming is less relevant (while still very unfair), and the game decides to throw tons and tons of enemies at you. They mostly die in 1 hit. However, there can only be 3 shots in the screen at once. This could be a throwback to the old days, but it feels out of place, here. It also has a very inconsistent rate-of-fire as a result, leading to many deaths, when you're expecting to shoot a fraction of a second earlier, and missing as a result.\n\nEvery enemy kills you instantly when it touches you. Yep, a very minor touch, in a completely harmless body part kills you. They also have a tendency to get stuck in the terrain, unfreeing themselves in the most inopportune moments, often leading to impossible-to-avoid deaths.\n\nThere's one Boss fight with a pretty cool sequence, despite a bit frustating due to huge flaws in the controls.\n\nThe game as several hazards for you to avoid.\nSpikes don't actually kill you, but damage your suit, making you lose oxygen. The less oxygen you have, the less you'll be able to jump. If you run out, you die. This makes death take a long time, while adding nothing to the game.\nAlso, some spikes don't damage you. Arbitrarily so! The game loves to be inconsistent, leading to many unfair sections that simply lead to frustration.\nNow, back to the suit/oxygen mechanic. It could be nice! The game uses it in one instance, where you need to get damage in order to quickly get to a checkpoint. However, it's never used again! The game has a couple of nice, unique mechanics, that it decides not to use more than once...\n\nLava doesn't kill you instantly, but close. It highly increases your suit's temperature. If it gets too high, you die. This could've have been cool, once again. If you fall, you can quickly jump you into a platform and survive. However, it's only used 2 or 3 times to the game's favour.\nAgain, a unique mechanic that's barely used.\n\nThen, there are a variety of platforms. Timed platforms, moving platforms, dodging platforms, etc. etc.\nThere's a huge problem with moving platforms. I'm assuming the developers didn't know how to program it properly, and so, if you fall of a moving platform, your character will keep moving in that direction, even if you fall into the ground... or flying... it makes it impossible to successfuly land, if you slip -- your character will simply be bugged and moving without command.\n\nAnother big problem is how platforms are desynchronized. You'll often have to wait more than you should for the platforms to get in sync again. The checkpoint are also mind-blowingly bad, choosing the worst timing possible -- leading to seconds of waiting for platforms, and sometimes even blind waiting.\n\nControls\nOk, this is an enormous topic, in this game. The controls are awful, for many reasons.\n\n1.Default Unity Capsule hitbox\nRemember how old-school games had a capsule as a hitbox, getting you constantly stuck or slip at the edge of platforms? Right, me neither. Because it's not a good way of doing things.\nI don't understand how this made it into the final game... A capsule player character might be useful in many situations, but not in a precision platformer, come on! Seriously, whenever you land slightly to the side of a platform, the rounded edge of the character (completely unrelated to the sprite, of course) will get you slowly sliding down, impossible to control... leading to dozens and dozens of deaths. This happens throughout the whole game. The hit-detection is completely broken as a result.\n\n2.Slippery movement\nI'm assumming your character doesn't stop moving until the animation ends. So guess what -- you'll let the button go, but your character will keep moving for a bit, reaching the edge of a platform, and consequently fall because of the god damned hitbox! Yay...\n\n3.Unsafe platforms\nYou know what's good after a dangerous jump? Being on top of a platform, finally feeling safe, and getting ready for the next jump. In Yury, however, platforms often run into spikes or into the ceiling, ending up throwing you off. Enemies also have a tendency of getting under platforms (or above), barely touching you, but killing you nonetheless.\n\n...\n\nSo far, this review is really negative. Well, two more...\n\nImpossible to see ahead - Trial an' Error & Unpredictable Deaths\nThe game often has you do leaps of faith. Yep, there's a big pit in front of you -- Jump!\nThen, you miss a platform that was somewhere in the middle, leading to a death. There are also enemies hidden in the foreground. There are enemies that very quickly rush at you from the top of the screen between platforms (where you need to jump)... There's too much of that.\n\nBadly placed platforms\nDo you know the first Super Mario level? That one where everything is calculated to teach the player when the jump, the mushroom mechanics and jumping on enemies? That's really good level design! This game does the exact opposite.\nPlatforms are deliberately placed to making you touch the edge of one (hidden in the foreground, of course), then screwing up your timing -- leading to a death. Making you fall into lava, and then placing a platform above you, making it impossible to get back to the ground safely...\n\nThere's too much of this infuriating design in Yury. Everything is unfair and controls badly -- then trying to pass as "old-school hard game" which it is definitely not. This game is pure trial an' error.\n\n\nIt's very unfortunate, because aside from that, the level design is varied, and the game has some nice sections! If it wasn't ruined by poor placement and controls, it could have been pretty good!\nWhen you have a game where a simple jump to a platform is hard, you have a problem. They've built a game around bad mechanics, and it resulted in a bad game, obviously.","February 17, 2015","false","4.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

The thing that your O2 tank gets ruptured when you hit a spike and you can still go on for awhile and try to reach the checkpoint is just plain bad idea as there are sections where it simply means you wait again and again to get a new retry at that hard section.\n\nIt's painful and rage inducing allright - but the wrong kind of rage is being served here. Why doesnt jump always work when near edges? There is of course the sliding movement but thats ok to me. Controls are tight enough but why is jumping so weird?

The controls are difficult as others have mentioned, but I think it's great for what it is, a cheap platformer for people looking to be seriously challanged.

By which i don't so much mean its a challenging game that rewards careful gameplay, I mean that it is constructed to kill you and be deliberately obtuse and difficult to play. My two principle concerns with the game are as follows:\n1. Often times the window of time you have to perform your jump can be measured in a few frames of animation I'd guestimate you often have a window of less than half a second to correctly jump and land on a platform that is slippery and has a safe zone only about 1 and 1/2 times the size of your avatar. *I am not good at platformers* so while i feel this is relevant to some/many players I acknowledge and pay homage to all of you who have mastered the art of platforming to the point where this is an exciting challenge. For me, it was not. It was merely frustrating when all i wanted was to play this quirky platformer with a nice aesethetic.  My larger concern can be found in the next point.\n2. this game involves a tremendous amount of jumping, in a land riddled with obstacles and enemies that will instakill you. This is to be expected of a retro platformer. What i was tremendously dissapointed to find was that often times, the only way to determine when/where you have to jump is by experemintation. Please don't misunderstand me i don't mean the jumps are difficult to land (they are, hellishly so) as that is part and parcel of the genre. No I mean that literally the only way to know where you have to jump is to jump and pray you land on a safe platform because the camera is often zoomed so close to your player that you can't physically see the next place you have to jump.\n\nI applaud games that are tremendously difficult. I enjoy platformers, even though i'm trash at them (super meat boy is a great example i love that game even though i simply cannot beat it). Yury however is punishing and rewards you for initial reckless behavior followed by absurdly difficult jumps and positioning.  I'm not telling you not to buy it, you may well be skilled enough to play it, i simply want to ensure your aware of what your signing up for.\nGame on Players~","August 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself is very solid and physics are well built but what really makes this game worth to be in your library is how challenging it is; just like those old school platformers where you may die once and once again and then get a ragequit (5 minutes break) and then come back to try it again.\n\nPros:\n-It's a real challenge.\n-Nice retro graphics.\n-You touch a spike, you lose the oxygen and then you die lol.\n-It's cheap.\n\nCons:\n-Forget about it if you have no patience.\n-Enjoyable for old platformers lovers, other public may find it boring.\n\n\nRecommended (8/10)","December 9, 2014","true","2.5"," 36 of 74 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","36","74","0","0"

It has a well made level design. The retro soundtrack is also great and suits the game!\n\nYury is an exercise of patience and dedication: you must learn the patterns of the areas and the behavior of the enemies, and mainly learn to control the character. His movements are slippery and hard to control, and most of the time you have to do precise and fast jumps.\n\nThe character will die a lot, in many ways, and it's very frustrating sometimes, but you need to be persistent! I must say that every time you reach a checkpoint you feel a combination of joy and relief!\n\nIf you are searching for a challenge, give this game a try!\n\n\nReview em português:\n\nYury é um jogo interessante, um ótimo game retrô hardcore de plataforma!\n\nO jogo tem várias seções onde você deve pular plataformas, evitar inimigos e armadilhas, atirar, ou fazer tudo ao mesmo tempo! Ele tem um 'level design' bem feito. A trilha sonora retrô também é ótima e combina com o jogo!\n\nYury é um exercício de paciência e dedicação: você deve aprender os padrões das áreas e o comportamento dos inimigos e, principalmente, aprender a controlar o personagem. Seus movimentos são escorregadios e difíceis de controlar, e na maioria das vezes você terá que dar saltos precisos e rápidos.\n\nSeu personagem irá morrer muito, de muitas maneiras, e isso é muito frustrante algumas vezes, mas você precisa ser persistente! Devo dizer que toda vez que você chegar a um checkpoint, você sentirá uma combinação de alegria e alívio!\n\nSe você está à procura de um desafio, tente este game!","December 14, 2014","true","4.7"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","16","34","2","0"

If the developer can patch these, the game will be just great. Hard, but really good. I suggest you to check back after the following things will be fixed:\n- EDITED: Custom keybindings implemented in v. 1.0.2, yay for that! :)\n- The game have some serious issues - not gamebreaking, because of the sheer number of checkpoints: sometimes moving platforms will continue to push AND PULL you even after you jumped off from them.\n- Given times you don't land properly on any surface, but continue to bounce gently in the direction you're facing. But you can't stop it.\nI'm not exactly sure if I've found another problem, if something comes to my mind, I'll update this.\nI still believe that this is a hard platformer with cool retro style (making it a niche-game) and can be a really unique gem for the retro-lovers on Steam if the developer can fix these issues.  (Game is out for like 3 days, so we can hope in that :) )","December 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","1"

So this game gets alot of flak, but from the little that I've played, it's pretty enjoyable actually!\n\n[Up to the point where I got the gun, then I enjoyed myself more haha.]\n\nThe start of the game, till that gun point, was ROUGH for me. I raged and hated my fingers, but the design and concept was great overall. The game has a nice simplistic approach to it, and even though the music is a bit repetitive from what I've seen, I still like it as well!\n\nI've only experience one sound glitch so far, where the sound just stopped, but the track changed up after I found the gun haha.\n\nI think for $2, you can't go wrong with this game. Check it out. If anything, get the Steam Cards though!

The game possesses all the qualities of any hardcore 8-bit classic:  high difficulty which emphasizes skill instead of grinding or hoarding items, diverse and thoughtfully designed obstacles, and short length.  Because Yury is hard and brief, it tempts you to assay it over and over again to see just how efficient you can get.

Sadly it has a lot of flaws. Firsty the controls are not crisp enough for an unforgiving trial and error platformer, you feel somewhat floaty. Then there seems to be a problem with the engine, because the game gets slower every time you restart or kill an enemy. In the end it slows down so much, that  it will begin to stutter for a few frames every second. Last but not least this games suffers of very bad level design, it starts of pretty good and chellenging but the farer you get, the more tedious and boring it gets. In the end you jump over 200 floating platforms with no background or design whatsoever, just to hit a trap hidden behind scenery or placed stupidly hard, just so you have to jump over 200 boring platforms for 5 minutes again to reach that spot. This game needs a lot of work but could turn still out fun to play for retro platform fans.","January 14, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Nothing quite like getting stuck at a couple of monsters two seconds away from the check point and getting killed constantly. At least in commander keen when I would get stuck I could wander around good sized levels.\n\nNot gamepad comptatable which is unacceptable. Joy2Key is not an excuse.\n\nGraphics are good. What the dev tried to do was admirable, but from a guy who played computer games in the late 80s and early 90s, this game is still pretty unfun.\n\nAlso, on a side note, this game IS Linux compatable. I was able to run it on Linux Mint.","June 3","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No innovation, sloppy mechanics, one of the most boring colour schemes I've ever seen, and zero diversity + crushing difficulty makes for one of the tackiest platform experiences around. Leave it for a couple hours to harvest the steam cards and delete. Shameful.","June 4","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
