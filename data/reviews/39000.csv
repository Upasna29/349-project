"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiiassnigga/recommended/39000/","kawaiiassnigga","tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiiassnigga/","79 products in account","Moonbase Alpha is a marvel of the 21st century. You cannot even compare any other games like Gears of War, Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, or even Assassin's Creed to this landmark in human intelligence. If you were to put a average Joe into this kind of enviroment, his head would implode from the amazing graphics, story, and gameplay. If you were to play this game, your feeble monkey brain would not even be able to understand the deep, complex and twisted story of Moonbase Alpha. NASA's masterpiece of 2010 shows us how far America has come in understanding space and lifestyle in space. Moonbase Alpha shows that even through NASA, we can learn much more about space and the human psyche. Moonbase Alpha follows the story of astronaut John Madden and his daily life on Moonbase Alpha, NASAs experimental base on the moon. If John fails his secret mission objective, his family and status in the NFL will be taken away and soiled by NASA. Moonbase Alpha brings us this harrowing story along with intense gameplay elements such as fixing carbon dioxide leaks, repairing solar panels, and driving robots. If you even attempted to finish such a hard, cruel game, you would be hailed as a god among men. Jesus would bless you with immortality and wealth beyond comprehension. The graphics in Moonbase Alpha top even Crysis 3 and have made many a computer catch fire. Even my IBM Super Computer cannot handle such a masterpiece as Moonbase Alpha. Many will look back to this game in the future, and smile as they remember their glorious past. NASA will forever be hailed as the wunderkind of this millenia. Thank you, NASA, for creating such a wonderful and exciting game.","February 1, 2014","true","15.6"," 224 of 274 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","224","274","6","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwarnedyouaboutstairs/recommended/39000/","iwarnedyouaboutstairs","Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwarnedyouaboutstairs/","408 products in account","Set in Iraq, Moonbase Alpha is a hyper-realistic war simulation, rivaling ARMA in terms of AI, graphics, and controls. The game's main feature is its well-tuned multiplayer, which I noticed no lag while playing. Moonbase Alpha's amount of customization is simply astounding -- you can entirely adjust your character's appearance, which ranges from the clothes they wear depending on the weather, their face, the tint of their skin, how shiny their skin is, their skin color, how rough their skin is, how dirty their skin is, so forth. The character generation can take years to finish due to how complex it is. Alongside its extensive multiplayer, Moonbase Alpha also boasts a story that's Shakespearan in breadth, questioning the very morality of war and the existence of humanity. All of this is topped with an extensive soundtrack done from the incredible Jesper Kyd, who gives his best performance here. His soundtrack is diverse -- ranging from opera, electro, heavy metal, and dubstep. Going over everything that makes this game simply the greatest game ever made would render this review too long for Steam to post, so I'll end the review by saying that Moonbase Alpha will change your life.","March 15, 2014","true","6.1"," 293 of 373 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","293","373","9","6"

Houston, we have a great game\n\nNASA really did good with this one, ESPECIALLY since it’s free.\nYour job is simple, fix Moonbase Alpha's life support systems using various tools and drones.\n\nI have always wanted a great space simulator, and stupidly I left this gem untouched in my games library for over a month believing because it was free, Moonbase would be garbage. I was wrong. Very wrong.\nSo to start off with, you choose how you want your game to be set up from the menu, this includes map size, if there’s a time limit or not, the name and password of the server, and even if you want it to be single player if you desire. From there you’re shown a brief cutscene, followed by a simple 'tutorial' telling how to get things done.\nThe goal of the game is to repair the base as fast as you can. This is done by repairing solar panels, replacing broken couplers, and attaching disconnected tubes.\n\nFrom pulling down solar panels, to using a computer operated drone to repair oxygen filters in hazardous areas, this game is very pleasing, especially the slow, awkward movements. Taking forever to walk thirty feet is defiantly more pleasing than it would seem, and you genuinely feel as if you’re on the moon. Making it better is that almost everything is silent, with the exception of your footsteps and the beautiful soundtrack.\nYou can even team up with some buddies online to try to beat your previous time records, and the Text-to-Speech option can create some hilarious conversations.\n\nNow, if there were more levels you could choose from, and some minor bugs worked out, this game would be a true masterpiece.\n\nPros:\nentirely free\nshows off some pretty cool NASA tech\nyou’re on the moon\nsoundtrack is amazing\nmovement feels as it should for being on the moon\nonline servers or single player\nText-to-Speech\n\nCons:\nonly 1 map (with multiple sizes)\noccasional bugs\nif online you're most likely going to hear some naughty things\n\nRate: 8/10\n\nIf you love space in anyway at all, get this game. Heck, even if you don’t like space get this game!\n\nCurator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/","May 8","true","3.1"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","40","43","7","0"

The year is 2020 and you are the survivors of a horrible moonbase accident. but the story is not important, what really makes this game excellent is the stellar gameplay, when i first played this game i was reduced to tears by its sheer radiant perfection, mere human words cannot begin to describe the euphoria that i felt as i fixed various electrical cables, and drove around in a moon rover. But, BUT the most excellent, amazing, and earth-shattering part of this game that will forever set it apart from all other games, and what catapulted it to the top of the Triple-A market, is the text to speech portion, hours and hours lost simply experiencing the greatness taht is the text to speech chat, each and evrey word i typed became real, "John Madden" i cried "Football" i screamed. "Astronaut gayness" i shouted from the top of my robotic voice modulator, into the inky black void and to the cardboard cutout of the earth so far away.

You have 25 minutes to get the oxygen system repaired or it is game over. ** Has VOIP and Text to Speech Chat system. **\n\nYou can play on online multiplayer co-op maps.  Mostly those servers that are usually playing online are playing with console mode cheats and nobody helping each other or really serious playing the game, everybody chating with the Text to Speech enabled and VOIP, saying silly and stupid things, while doing wild and crazy things with the gear.   "John Madden" is a popular saying.  With the lack of oxygen, you start to see things.\n\nTry it, it will be a out of sight and funny game.  You might die laughing before you die from lack of oxygen.\n\nThe graphics, gear and game play looks ok.\n\nYou, the astronaut, is slow moving, and maybe hopping would be faster. You can drive lunar rovers, use 2 tools, use 2 repair drones, carrying things, setting beacons.  Everything you do requires time, so you need more people to split the work up, and need to work with efficiency.  Has a minigame in the repair mode that tests your coloring in the lines skills, earns you time off the repair. You needed to recruit a bunch of serious players, train together then launch a competitive server.  Will require teamwork and training to finish in time.  You can practise the game by creating a private server and pick freeplay mode.    I guess the repairs needed change each game run.\n\nWish there was more to it than just fixing the Oxygen supply.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qPzLX2IwEk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUUzxmzS38I\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nxpN4oCk7I\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbase_Alpha_(video_game)\n\nhttp://www.moonbasealphagame.com/\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/ltp/games/moonbasealpha/index.html","July 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","21","25","4","0"

(http://store.steampowered.com/app/39000/)\nIt was supposed to be a tech demo/simulation to test ideas to be used in Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond, NASA's massively multiplayer online game (successfully kickstarter funded August-October 11, 2011 where they were looking forward to a matching government tax credit matching all donations up to $700,000 with an additional 500K. But that is a different mia issue.)\n\nWith a mixed reception, MA is an exercise in text to speech functionality and repetitive gameplay where one to six people try to shorten the time it takes to accomplish the repair O2 mission. One person can do it in 30 - 40 min, the curent record time is like 6 min (likely he had five other people helping get that time.)\nNo obvious way to submit bug reports in this four year old game: hacking of audio files to intentionally irritate fellows on the map, intentionally obstructing completing the mission with no way to kick the person besides a password protected instance, and mouse click that subdues the game to task bar...\n\nNot sure what NASA/Army Game Studio has been doing on this for the last four years (the Unreal 3 engine MA uses came out in 2004. UE4 came out 2012) but they have not really put effort into updating this MA exercise.\nAs a free game and only 1.1GB install, it is a fun passtime, you can even compete against another team for fastest completion time... sabotuers not withstanding!\n141211\nThere are ALOT of problems they REFUSE to address much less correct:\nhackers can insert code disrupting the game or irritating fellow players, often the game forces to task bar on mouse click, wasting time especially in timed matches getting the game back to full display, they REFUSE to allow bug reports indicating they have no intrest in problems four years after they released the game.\nApparently Moonbase alpha was just a proof of concept to get money (kickstarter + govt matching funds) for the "astronaut" mmo (e.g. they have abandoned that game's web page http://www.astronautmmo.com/)  even though they got almost twice the $ pledged they were goaled for... THREE years later still no actual Astronaut mmo released. They took the $ and ran.

When I finished and turned off the game I went to sleep, but in my dream somthing strange happend I found my self on a table tied lying on my belly a few minutes later I saw john madden in front of me, I was confused mostly due to not being intrested in football but I knew everyone on the game always spoke about him, john then told me that he will turn me into the savior of the moonbase, I didnt understand, suddenly I was sorrounded by aliens always say "aeiou" and "ayy lmao" the one of them pressed a button on a console next to the table I was tied to, I heard something behind me but I couldn't see what it was but moments later I realised what it is, it was a probing device, the machine then quickly penetraded mt butt it hurt I was looking at john madden and cried for help but all he did was watch. after some moments of painful probing i started to fell dizzy and I was about to faint, right before I fainted john told me that now I am "Space Jesus" I woke up and looked at the clock next to my table it 15:20 in the afternoon. I then went to my computer and booted up Moonbase alpha I joind a server and continued screwing around with other players but I felt diffrent when playing, I heard john again saying to spread the word about him and he called me again "Space Jesus" I did as he asked and felt enlightend by john madden,whenever other playes needed me I would help them immedietly and told them that I help them by the name of john madden,all was good in moonbase alpha until one day I gave life, not gave birth to a child or anything but I discovered that the rover I drove started to have sentient, I was happy but I quickly discovered that foul thougts were inside the rover, he tried to use me for his own needs and didnt let me go, the other players saw this but couldn't do anything the rover was too powerful, I then yelled "BY THE POWER OF JOHN MADDEN I, SPACE JESUS WILL DEFEAT YOU" I felt john presence again and sealed the foul beast behind markeres all was good and I became "space jesus gaurdian of the rover" all was peaceful until one of the players thought he'll use the beast to his own good I tried to stop him but I failed, I failed john madden, the rover quickly awoken and became wild I tried killing it but I couldn't it was far too powerful, but then suddenly a man came in and fought the beast using aeiou and a hose, the beast died and I declared him as my son but I was old and I failed john madden I felt john presence again he told me to take my place as the new the space jesus I did what john wanted and took my son to the hill on the defeated rover but he couldn't do it he wanted to go sleep and he went away.....and thats how I met your mother 10/10 DEEPEST LORE!","September 15, 2015","true","7.7"," 30 of 51 people (59%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","59","30","51","40","0"

You can tell the creators of this game were all very experienced at creating games. This piece is beautiful. The game boasts an amazing landscape varying from white moon dust, to rocks, to the black abyss that is space, and even the earth from afar. The shadows are also very notable as they all move very fluently. Along with the environment, the game has a wonderful soundtrack. Three songs on loop that really bring out the emotion of every moment. Weather you be waddling around on the moon, dragging pipes around, driving a robot like it is a NASCAR race, or just spewing crap out of your mouth there is a song for it. The story is also wonderful. Plot twists kept me on my feet and the incentive kept me playing for a whole 3 hours. The voice actors are also all-star. The game has my favorite voice actor of all time in it... A speak and spell. The game has too many features to list there so I will choose some of my favorites. Markers can be placed and can say things such as "Communist" or "John Madden". You can pick things up... Only to drop them when you realize there is nothing you can do with the item you are holding. You can also communicate with other players through text like "aeiou" or "John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden".

This game takes place in post-apocolyptic russia in which an ex KGB officer named John Madden must deal with the death of his family, as well as many other personal problems. Infinity Ward really hit it out of the park with this latest game and it shows as this game has recieved critical acclaim such as winning GOTY for 4 straight years in a row 2 Oscars, and 7 Emmys. One reason why this game has earned such praise is the variety of servers, weapons, game modes, weekly updates, and the immersive story. And a huge plus is that when you download this game you recieve a free copy of the beta of the upcoming, highly anticipated, Madden NFL '95.\n\n10/10","August 7, 2014","true","8.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","5","5","4","0"

I was messing around one day when my friend freaked the ♥♥♥♥ out, he said he saw in the corner of his eye a old man with no space suit on that dissapeared as quick as he appeared. Now what weird about this is that no one else was on the server. So I was of corse sceptical and told him he was seeing things. I was curious though and started to look around more, then while i didnt expect it I saw a man in a space suit fly at me realy fast with his arms out and disapeared. this realy scared me. So we when off exploring and started seeing more and more weird ♥♥♥♥, we even herd and saw a little girl with no suit. I sware we arnt going crazy, my freind recored his screen arter a little while and caught some of the things happening. I dont know if this is supposed to be in the game becuase im very new but I looked this stuff up and found noting.\nIf anyone knows anything about whats going on pls tell.\n\nI think this game is ok but i dont know if this is supposed to be a horror game. cuz i think it is with all of the jump scares.","February 14","true","8.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","8","11","10","1"

This very realistic RPG MMO is the best i've played of its kind in years. You can spend hours and hours (in my case an hour) without even knowing; that's how good it is. You can fly in massive fleets like a scene from star wars and have huge 500 v 500 player battles. I have never seen anything like this before. You play as an astronaut called Timmy Wiseau who crash lands on the NASA space mission aboard the 'I did not hit her' and the lunar lander 'I DID NOT.' The soundtrack of the game is great featuring all your favourites  such as the Bob the Builder theme song and Biggie Smalls Thomas the Tank Engine and don't forget the Youtube sensation Chocka Block. The story, better than the Last of Us, lasts roughly 5 minutes until you realise what you just wasted your time downloading. I definitely recommend that if you have a spare five minutes that you download this game because the time you spend downloading you have more fun than the actual game and the download screen has a better storyline than the game itself.

There are many unique things about this game, such as the 3D solids implemented into this. This game reminds me of Gene Endrody's Moonbase (by Maid Marian).

His mother Sarah Madden had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the leader of the human astronaut resistance against AEIOU, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a Moonbase and imprisoned at a mental hospital under the supervision of Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. Skynet sends a new asterisk, designated as "T-1000", back in time to kill John Madden. An advanced prototype, the T-1000 is composed of a "mimetic poly-alloy holla holla get dolla" aka liquid metal that allows it to take on the shape and appearance of anything it touches (short of complex devices such as guns or bombs or rovers or john madden), and transform parts of its anatomy into knives and stabbing weapons and wrenches as well as wall-e. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills an astronaut and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Madden has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. Huhahahaha.\n\nThe admin and the T-1000 converge on John in a moonbase, and a chase ensues in which John and the admin escape together by rover while the T-1000 steal the only other ♥♥♥♥ing rover and chases after them, but ends up crashing into a canyon he couldn't get out of. Fearing that the T-1000 will copy and kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the admin to help free her. They encounter Sarah escaping the moonbase after severely injuring Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU's staff and himself. The three escape the T-1000 in a rover. The admin informs John and Sarah about Spooky Scary Skeletons, the artificial intelligence that will initiate a nuclear war on "John Madden Day" and go on to create the machines that will come over come over come over come over. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is not gay if its on the moon.\n\nSarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to EARF, but after having a horrific nightmare ♥♥♥♥♥ beacons she awakens and sets out to kill Miles Dyson to prevent "John Madden Day" from occurring. She wounds him at his home but finds herself unable to kill him in front of the server. John and the admin arrive and inform Miles of the consequences of his ♥♥♥♥♥ beacons. They then learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged power couplings and the right arm of the previous wall-e. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the power station building and retrieve the CPU and the arm. The space po-po arrive and Miles is shot, but stays behind to trigger the explosives that destroy his lab and his research. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in that one ♥♥♥♥ing canyon.\n\nIn a climactic battle in the mill, the T-1000 succeeds in severely damaging and shutting down the admin. However, The admin's emergency backup system engages and brings him back on-line. He surprises and shoots the T-1000 with a JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN!, causing it to fall into a vat of molten lololololololololol, where it is trolled. John throws the arm and CPU of the original admin into the vat as well. Just as Sarah felt relieved that the whole ordeal was over, the admin then explains that it must sacrifice itself so that its dance moves cannot be used to create Sppoky Scary Skeletons, and asks Sarah to help lower it into the lololololololololol. John begs for the admin to stay, but he says goodbye to John and Sarah and promises to dance again before it is lowered into the vat. The admin gives a tearful John an encouraging thumbs up as it disappears into the lolololololol to go alien hunting. Sarah looks to the future with hope, adding, "Because if a machine, an admin, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."\n\nOne small suck for man, one giant tug for mankind.\n\n10/10","July 21, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Also, state of the art text-to-speech technology brings moon communications into the 21st century.  No more having to read like a ♥♥♥♥ing nerd.  Ride around on solar powered rovers and do sick moon jumps - basically like any skating game ever made, but on the moon.   When its dark, you begin to hallucinate in the real game, and when you play more than 15 hours, you begin to hallucinate in real life!  For this reason, I give Moonbase 5 stars and 12 thumbs up (The highest score possible).  Poonbang Alpha is not the game of the year, or even the decade, but the best game of all time.  All time.

It gives the player a realistic feeling of practicing the skills necessary to join the space program at NASA. This game has many features that allow you to hone your skills before you even graduate High School - imagine how well your application to any college will look like with first hand experience in equipment management in zero gravity conditions. This game allows you to ramp the barren landscape on the moon in rovers that were designed to slowly travel across the ground and you can take advantage of them to fly off rock piles going at least 10 miles an hour. While this game is a serious perspective on the moon, it also features a dark side. Unknown aliens trying to communicate to you, kids somehow landing and trying to communicate, I believe I even bumped into someone who was singing but burst into a fit of coughs before he could finish. If I could go higher, I would, but I'll settle and give this game a solid 10 out of 10. Definitely life changing yet eye opening at the same time. With a game like this, you have to ask yourself. Do YOU have what it takes to be a whaler on the moon?","January 11, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This game lets you be a real astronaut on the surface of the moon! You even get to simulate the exciting day of an astronaut on the moon with others with the amazing multiplayer mode!\n\nThis game lets you do anything you desire; from remote-controlling robots with tools to remote-controlling rovers; it all works out, just by sticking your backpack into the modules! You also get to repair awesome moon things and you can even build your own moon base! Sort of. This game is highly competitive with the new competitive gamemode they have introduced. Never before have I felt like a real astronaut before!\n\nOn the technical side of things, the game boasts with an amazing graphics engine that 2005 PCs could barely ever run. The sounds are highly realistic, as there are no sounds in space! However, in the multiplayer, you get to turn on the amazing text-to-speech feature, that pronounces everything you say and makes communication and survival on your very own moonbase much easier!

But Far Cry 3 all in all, has better graphics and better gameplay.

The compelling storyline of this masterpiece tells the tale of Annah the Barbecue and his son Johan the Stinky. They embark on an epic phylosophical journey on the moon to find the ultimate truth which lies within the discovery of the Holy Weapon. The race is on and the entire universe's survival will depend on the outcome of this battle.\nBreathtaking visuals rendered on Xbox 224 hardware are enabling the player to experience the vacuum of space in person and [JOHNMADDEN] see the Moon from a brand new post-post nextgen point of view.\nThe award-winning soundtrack (orchestrated by WhoCares Mike the Elevator) perfectly reflects the alien atmosphere and gives an extra layer to the experience.\n\nIn a nutshell it's an epic game, 15/94, try it out now!

This is my favorite game in my Steam library, if you do not have it, get it NOW. It's made by NASA, who wouldn't want a game made by NASA?\n\nMoonbase Alpha is like Grand Theft Auto on the moon, done professionally. You can repair and drive space vehicles, carry tubes with your friends and play tug of war, jump around with low gravity, and so much more! The gameplay of this game will immediatly get you addicted.\n\nMoonbase Alpha also features an amazing communication system, with ultra-realistic text to speech playback. If you don't feel like talking in game with your microphone, no worries! You can customize your voice so you sound the way you like when you type!\n\nNo but seriously, I don't think anyone really knows how to play this game.","July 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

After the events of the second episode, Sonic and his friends got trapped on the moon and now have to communicate and work together to keep alive.\n\nNot gonna lie, this story is dark. Dr. Eggman is nowhere to be seen; the player can only assume that he is either dead or left Sonic for dead. The way it tells a story without words is beautiful.\n\nThe game is sort of a spiritual sequel to Seaman in that you have to communicate with the other characters using a voice to text program. The AI is sort of terrible, though. No matter what I try to say to Tails, he always replies with some weird nonsense like "John Madden" or "aeiou."\n\nI also don't get why Sonic games still insist on using vehicles. I shouldn't be driving a moon rover if I'm the fastest thing alive. On that note, Sonic does run kind of slow in this game.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely an improvement over the first episode, and much truer to Sonic's roots.","June 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There was some educational value to be had, but not much. The game play is also not very intuitive and could benefit from tutorials. The game seemed to be very stable, however it had issues in multiplayer missions due to children constantly attempting to grief players by undermining the work of those attempting to accomplish the mission within the allotted time limit.\nIf there was more content, specifically missions, or perhaps there was a sandbox mode available during Alpha in which players could use to simply build with, this would have real value. As it is, it's simply a toy for wasting time.\n\nI am recommending this for younger children or anyone who has an interest in real life space exploration, as these are the individuals most likely to enjoy this. That said, I do not think it will be able to keep anyones attention for very long unless content is added.","December 2, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only winning move is not to play.\n\nAfter playing this for some time you'll find that many people will just sit in servers and mess around using the DECTalk-powered Text-To-Speech to make interesting noises or sing songs. This can be both funny and entertaining for quite some time if done correctly...On the other hand it can also be ear-shattering annoying.\n\nFrom a game perspective, the maps are short, fairly straightforward, and when given some practice are fairly easy to complete in a timely fashion. There is only a small handfull of them, but some can be very competetive (given you have enough people who actually want to complete the objective).\n\nOn the other hard, you get what you pay for...So to be honest there's nothing really to lose (other than about a Gigabyte of storage space).","February 14, 2014","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, no this is more than a game, this life-changing experience, thrusts you into the life of the greatest astronaut of all time, John Madden, to explore the inner-workings of human language, and the foreign landscape of our very own moon. This is tax dollars at work! NASA has truly revolutionized the standards for modern video games with this masterpiece. This is an experience that should not be passed up, the mind-altering effect that this game is comparable to only that of a psychoactive drug such as LSD.

There was some educational value to be had, but not much. The game play is also not very intuitive and could benefit from tutorials. The game seemed to be very stable, however it had issues in multiplayer missions due to children constantly attempting to grief players by undermining the work of those attempting to accomplish the mission within the allotted time limit.\nIf there was more content, specifically missions, or perhaps there was a sandbox mode available during Alpha in which players could use to simply build with, this would have real value. As it is, it's simply a toy for wasting time.\n\nI am recommending this for younger children or anyone who has an interest in real life space exploration, as these are the individuals most likely to enjoy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corber/recommended/39000/","Corber","Denning","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corber/","100 products in account","Where to begin....can I even begin to describe the epic that is, Moonbase Alpha? Yes, actually I can.\n\nEver since the beginning of time, there have been bad games and good games. Sport games such as "Madden" and "Fallout: New Vegas" and point and click FPS games such as the lovable "Call of Duty" franchise and the much appraised "Football Superstars". Now for the first time, we have something that we, collectively, as the human race can use to reach enlightenment. Moonbase Alpha isn't a game, nor is it a video - it's an experience. An experience that when encountered, will change your life forever - increasing your intelligence, trebling your strength and ensuring you will not only get laid, but maintain your virginity simultaneously.\n\nOn the face of this 'game', the 'player' takes on the role of an astronaut attempting to maintain oxygen to the NASA station situated on the Moon - but this simply belies the true nature of this experience. In reality, this is just an allegory and subtle reference to many circumstances and crucial scenarios which have occurred throughout human history. One event many interpret this experience as referencing is in fact, the Cold War which although is argued, is quiet plausible. The 'player' obviously represents the US with the depleting oxygen being subtly inferred as being a Russian sabotage and when it finally does deplete - the cinematic of the station exploding into millions of pieces is representative of how if the Russians had won the Cold War - they would have dominated the world and forced the entire populace to speak Russian as well as worship Russian heroes of Communism such as Marx, Lenin and Richard Nixon.\n\nAnother popular interpretation is one of an Apocalypse scenario, which reverses what the 'player' is initially led to believe. The 'players' are in fact establish a colony on the Moon to subvert and oppress the invisible Moon aliens in order to gain moon rocks which will be manufactured into weapons for the U.S.A. in order for them to begin their universal conquest. Though even more subtle, one could see how this is credible. In the game, one of the rooms has seemingly no purpose except to monitor the entire Moon which would mean logically, it is in fact to monitor and subvert the invisible aliens. More importantly, all "players" do not have proper voices, but in fact an unknown, voice which is strangely unmechanical in any way and is so heart-warming that it must be the alien language being utilised by the "players" in order to bring the aliens out of hiding in order for the player to enslave them.\n\nWhatever the scenario it represents, one thing is certain. If you do not play Moonbase Alpha not only are you ridding yourself of your one chance to be rid of the dreary-ness of 21st Century Life and allow you to reach enlightenment but you will probably get some sort of illness of some sort like typhoid or something I dunno.","February 2, 2013","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I don't know how things could've gone so wrong with the AI development program. We began testing their motor-skill coordination with an old Sega Genesis and a copy of "Madden NFL '95."  They became obsessed! Any moment free from performing maintainence tasks they spent playing that outdated video simulation. We started finding large rocks arranged in the shape Johns Madden's portrait. We thought this behavior was harmless....but we were wrong. The droids went rampant! "JOHN MADDEN! JOHN MADDEN!", they howled. They demanded to see their football god; a demand that we had no means to satisfy. Lt. Jenkins immediately made a run for the airlock, but was promptly shot through the skull with a mining laser. "AEIOU!", they shrieked. We're been held captive in our own base until their demands are met. Conner predicts that our life support will only last for 5 more weeks.

You'll lead a squad of the most battle hardened space marines as you retake every sector of the moon from the seemingly invisible, stealthy, and numerous aliens. The combat is amazing, the speech options and sounds are outstanding, and the multiplayer is downright addicting.
