I would estimate that I have somewhere around 1000 hours into the Once Upon A Knight disc version, and I am not sure of the differences between KnightShift and Once Upon A Knight, other than that KnightShift is the European version. I would recommend this game if you can stand to not have the latest graphics, but do enjoy a sometimes humorous RPG. The campaigns are decent, but I could have spent days turning my enemies into cows in the skirmish mode. On top of that I do not remember any game-breaking bugs or issues of any kind from Once Upon A Knight, other than being addicted to it for quite some time. The game can appeal to different players, through the main story line campaigns, the rpg modes, skirmish battles, and the editor mode allowing you to make your own scenarios and maps, providing many, many hours of milk-spending entertainment! (Yup, "milk-spending", milk is one of the currencies, isn't that great?) While the graphics might not be up-to-date, which is what should be expected of an aging game, I feel that the gameplay greatly out-weighs that. I highly recommend this game!","April 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 94 of 119 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","94","119","0","1"

This game sure has aged a lot, but it still has the unique feel and setting that isn't present in any other game (even the Witcher, which is also heavily based on Slavic mythology).\n\nOf course, it is very dated. Graphics may be ugly (but seriously, what do you expect from a game made in 2003?) if you compare this game to other, more modern ones. This game doesn't support any other display modes but letterbox (4:3). But since I'm not that kind of a guy who pays attention to graphics, it doesn't really bother me. The game's interface and controls are very intuitive and easy to learn, so both hardcore and "casual" (no pun intended) players can, IMO, enjoy it, provided that dated graphics won't distract them. I know I enjoy this game, and I've been a gamer since I was born. That's 19 years of experience.\n\nIt has RPG and RTS modes, but they aren't very advanced (that is not a flaw to me, though). It also has a built-in editor - the kind that is fairly easy to learn to use - which allows you to create and share custom content. The possibilities are endless. Even if you are too lazy to make your own stuff, you can still look for some fan-made content on the Internet.\n\nThis game has its' flaws, of course. It is not perfect. There are more complex RPGs and RTSs out there. There are games with prettier graphics. But since I am the kind of a guy who likes games that are simple to learn and present you with something challenging (not the gameplay, but the setting and/or story), I actually like this game.\n\nPersonal rating: 7/10.","April 7, 2014","true","10.1"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","59","72","0","1"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\n\nOverall Game\n----------------------------------------\nKnightShift is a unique blend of RPG and top-down adventure.  It can be played as a strategy game, an RPG, or a hybrid mix.\n\nSeemingly very low-budget, KS still brings an interesting, if not intricate, gameplay to the gamer.  For those who can tolerate the lower-end graphics and quirkiness of the game (I find it cute how the prince takes a nap, for example, as odd as it is), KnightShift will bring a good round of exploratory gameplay in an indie package that I'd recommend for a fun few hours of Princedom.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10\n\nGameplay\n----------------------------------------\nWarning: There are a LOT of keys/key combinations to remember for this game.\n\nIf you're undaunted, the next hurdle to overcome is a slightly awkward mouse control that seems to be reminiscent of Windows 98 mouse acceleration insanity.  Once familiarized with it, the mouse awkwardness stops detracting from the interface.\n\nI'm not sure if there were audio cues for some things, but I learned haphazardly that the giant withcraft looking areas are healing spas.  This was useful fighting my first few bears.  The lesson here is just to explore the areas, as context tooltips don't really exist to assist in understanding what is around you in the game.\n\nAlthough rough around the edges, the quirky gameplay and level-matched quests can catch you and lure you in for more from this game.  The random encounter fights contribute a little to exp farming and provide a balanced challenge as you build up your equipment set and character.\n\nOverall Accessibility\n----------------------------------------\nKnightShift has dialogue that is not subtitled, making the plot a little inconvenient to follow.  I don't blame the developers, who, as a small indie group, made the game because they wanted to, and did so as best they could.\n\nBecause I was unable to properly test multiplayer, the overall rating is based on only the subtitles category.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nSubtitles/Text\n----------------------------------------\nKnightShift is an indie game on a unique platform.  That said, it's not subtitled or captioned.  Deaf/HoH players can still read the text of what was said after by hitting F2 a few times, which cycles through the 'mission log' and flavor text/mission text.\n\nAt first I found it annoying, but I find the workaround tolerable and am happy they included it.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nChatting/Communicating\n----------------------------------------\nWhile KS has multiplayer capability, I did not test.  Based on the keyboard options, I saw no key for chat.\n\nRating: N/A","June 20, 2014","true","0.7"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","46","54","0","3"

"\n\nWell.. so far, i was leading three cows to the south-east of the village ( Martha, Hilda and Getrude ), but they refuse to follow me. ( 11/10 )\n\nAnyway, it's a realy nice oldschool RPG game. Gameplay is simple.\n\nIt has two game mods. (  multiplayer is also available )\n\n( My personal opinion at the end )\n\nRTS Mode.\n\n"In this mode the player is faced with three campains. Each of them plays in a different geographical area and always offers the player new challenges ( Rescuing the Princess or fighting the Dragon. Classic, but i love it ). During the campains the player develops his character and gains access to new weapoms, special armor and magic items. He also has the possibility of creating new charackers or building new structures. Priests, priestesses, sorcerers and knights appear...\nAll characters gain experience and level-up, increasing their combat potential and magical abilities.\n\nRPG Mode.\n\n"At the beginning of the RPG mode the player selects his character from a list of totally 8 characters including Barbarian, Amazone Sorceress, Wizard, Knight, Priestess, Spearman, Archer and Skeleton. Each character can be modified the player has the possiblity to personalize his character by selecting the hair color, the clothes color ( Well, it doesnt have the best character customization, but come on, this game is old ) and by distributing points to basic or special abilities, individually at each character.\nEvery character has basic skills - the magic characters: stamina, mana and magic power, the non magic characters: stamina and strength. During the game progress the character is able to learn new spells and new abilities and the player has the posibility to invest the points received for each level up into the desired skills of his character.\nWith this option it is nearly impossible to generate two equal characters. "\n\nMy personal opinion ?\n\nThis game is realy old. Made back in 2003, if i am not mistaken.\nGraphics aren't good. Audio too.\nBut if you're looking for a low spec, or an oldschool RPG game, this is for you. I am not feeling like i waste my time playing this game. i enjoyed playing it.\n\nI recomment you to take a look on a walkthrough before buying it.\n\nIt is also have some issues with fullscreen.

This allows you to play different stories and whatnot, as well as customize your character to have a TON of possible combos. There is also a Campaign mode, which is like the RPG one, but a bit more simplistic. Then, there is Skirmish, which is sort of like Civ, in the sense that you build a city and defend it.

The controls are a bit weird, but I guess with a little practice I can manage. I created a priestess and made her walk around for some time. She was cute, called me darling every once in a while. :)\n\nAt one point I got butchered by three skeletons. My fault, you shall not stumble through hostile territory without caution. A bit frustrating was the fact, that the autosave had done the last save in the middle of battle so everytime I loaded it was insta death because I could not click that heal button fast enough. Sure there were two earlier saves, but honestly, you load the current one over and over again and try and try. Just this time you're going to be fast enough... well, you won't, so you give it another try... just this one.... you know what I mean. ;)\n\nSo, I can't say it is a bad game. That would not be fair. But I surely did play better ones. If you get it for a buck just give it a try, you can't do much wrong for such a price. If you are not sure watch others playing it on youtube, that's what I did. I will definately try it again, I want to play all the characters at least once. Just not today...","April 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Stability issues, unusable options, key bindings that don't work, crashes, speed-ups and slow-downs, poorly written script, goofy voice acting, bad quests. The list goes on and on. For instance, I played for less than an hour and completed two escort quests, the worst kind of quest available anywhere. Loot is strewn across the game world at random instead of acquired logically. Enemies pose nearly no real threat at all, just click and watch the fight unfold. Very boring, very tedious, and does not run well on modern systems. Do not waste your time or money on this title.
