It really throw you back in the day by playing it, even if it seem easy.... I died like 10 times in first 5 minutes, which is good and hard, also there is a lot more things that can kill you than it seem.. I noticed that a bit too late. Anyway great small game, I still enjoy playing it, it won\'t just collect dust i my steam library.","June 1","true","0.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

The music is really good.\nBut for me the best thing in this game was the retro feeling from old games.","June 3","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Though I came about far too late to enjoy the arcade experience this game is trying to emulate, it's still an enjoyable scrolling shooter.\n\nI like the novel idea of being able to continue after your ship is shot down (even though it took a few seconds after it happened for me to even realize it; I should probably do more reading before I play a game).","June 1","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

You can see that a lot of love and passion went into the making of this game. The graphics and sounds are just right for the genre, and the gameplay is very fast and fluid. And yes, very difficult! Now all it needs is controller support, but even without, I'd still recommend! Although I got the game for free, I'd easily pay the one dollar for this :)","June 2","true","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The Store front is hard to see at certain times, being a light blue color on top of many bright objects could be a pain to see what of 3 tabs your on. Tabs included Weapons/Ship/Upgrades. As you defeat enemies, \"cash\" is dropped and you buy upgrades when it says it is available to buy via the indicater on the top left of the screen.\n\nComplaints:\nAs of this review, you cannot reassign keys.\nMenus are chunky;The exit menu while playing the game keeps on going leaving you to do as you exit. (Bug/Exploit: Exitting whle playing will remove all points and level area upon returning, but the lives/levels and upgrades are kept)And navigating the store is a pain, you can\'t fully rotate,even though there is 3 choices. Selecting upgrades via an up/down menu is useful, but when getting on later levels, the bottom isn\'t needed, but when you die, your in the same place where you left off, meaning you have to scroll all the way back down.\n\nAlso, Many things are red. MANY THINGS! A coin is both yellow and red, with the red one dropping more. You know what looks like a coin? Those slow moving explosive dots that look like a coin with a trail, palette changes would be nice or a new section to say what upgrades do and what to avoid.\n\nOverAll:\nYou\'ll get a good hour or two worth of fun in one sitting. Steady and fast gameplay. You could get out of your vechile when it gets downed at some point(Don\'t know how or why). It\'s a vertical shooter, with nice graphics and upgrades\n\nAlso Steam Trading Cards, Sell those I guess?","June 1","true","0.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I probably wont be playing it on a normal basis, but for a time waster it really is a good choice. Reminds me a slower paced Raiden X.\n\nDef pick this up, even if its not on sale!","June 1","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While the upside is it certainly feels rewarding to get better the obvious downside to it will be that casuals go "boohoo, mommy!" when playing this.\nYou basically level up by popping meanies from outer space, the higher your level gets the better the items available in the shop will be. While that is certainly nothing new it seems to be done in a very solid way.\n\nKeep in mind that updates bought in a certain playcycle won't become a part of the next, thus you start from point zero each time again, just saying.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n+ comes with a great retro look\n+ lets you know that you are bloody old while still makes you feel great at the same time\n\n~ no co-op, sure I would have liked it but it does not qualify to downrate a game due to it\n\n- only qwerty support, quertz is still missing\n- no menu no config, like in no woman no cry\nThus scanlines can't be turned off or Fullscreen set to standard upon launch...\n- no controller support until the next patch, as the devs already announced that it will be included by players demand\n----------------------------------------------\n\nI am really interested in this so far and eager to see how it continues. Given it's low price tag and the upcoming controller support  I highly recommend it to fans of the specific genre.","June 5","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
