If you are not looking for trouble, trouble will come to you as time passes by and factions envolve with each other by declaring full-scaled wars against each other conquering castles and other key locations that will drastically change the game economically and militarily.\n\nBe either a good samaritan with your army of justice and fight off bandits and free entire villages from rebel control, a evil masterless soldier with a thirst for blood and wealth in the middle of the Caldarian disgrace, or simply a trader travelling around buying cheap and selling expensive, Warband will give you a fair challenge with very balanced rewards and consequences in whatever way of life you decided to take.\n\nThe game difficulty is well balanced, and instead of making things harder just by simply increasing the units stats that you are facing against, the AI gets a lot more rational and fast even during the campaign map as well with the in-game combat, they will almost act as real human players!\n\nRemember that I have mentioning about your character individual role in the game? Get a good relationship with lords by doing quests or freeing close family members from enemy heavily guarded dungeons, and who knows if you can freely marry their daughters unless you convince them with your persuasion skills to run away with you!\n\nThe medieval atmosphere and music has never been so good as it is now; If you enjoyed the previous Mount & Blade game, you will fall in love with this one.\n\nMount & Blade: Warband will be the game that you will be happy to be hooked into to, a fair balanced game between adventure and RPG with a vast variety of content and diversity in all of its aspects.\n\nSome negative aspects.\nBugs, Glitches and some graphic reading failures\n\nDespite being unusual, you will encounter some glitches that will make some of the game items to disappear, or to find everything in a black screen when you return to the world map. There are also some in-game bugs that makes everything blur and unable to see around, although, I found out this can be fixed if you simple minimize the game and open it again!\n\nSome crashes might happen too, but those are rare to encounter.\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game with a 79 out of 100, or 4,0 out of 5,0, a never ending sandbox game that will make players fall in love as they experience the life and atmosphere of what a true medieval age game has to give!","May 18, 2015","true","295.7"," 795 of 833 people (95%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","95","795","833","40","5"

You can be a pirate raiding caravans from the six big factions (Sarranid Sultanate, Kingdom of Vaegir, Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Rhodoks, Kingdom of Nords and Khergit Khanate.) or you can join up with one of the factions or make your own one or just play as a mercenary! Many people that look into the game for the first 5+ hours think that this is a simple game, but it is indeed pretty complicated which i will come to later in these 5 facts about why and how i have played 1400+ hours of this game, enjoy :)\n\n1) *SINGLEPLAYER* The singleplayer is awesome, you will spend a minimum of 100+ hours on it, and once you get the hang of it you just wan't to play it 2-3 times again because you haven't even tried a bit of the possibilities, but once you have tried the most it will get kinda booring but the next facts will fix that problem.\n\n2) *MODIFICATIONS* There are a BUNCH of modifications for the game and they are so simple to enjoy. So when you are tired of the vanilla game go to this website -->\nhttp://store.steampowered.com and download some of the many multiplayer and singleplayers mods for the game.\n\n3) *MULTIPLAYER* If you aren't happy with the singleplayer game, you can always move to the multiplayer. Note that M&B has a very intense fighting system that requires you to play a bunch before you can actually feel like a good player. But once you get the hang of it, it is so much fun just to hack and slash through your enemies.\n\n4) *INDEPTH MULTIPLAYER FIGHTING SYSTEM* The fighting system of M&B is very complicated, for some players it is just a slash/block game, but it's really much more than that, there are loads of tricks to defeat the more experienced players.\n\n5) *EVENTS* The Mount and Blade community is still really active and therefore there are events for most of the of the mods. If you wan't an mod simply full of events i would reccomend you buy the "Napoleonic Wars" DLC and join up with a regiment and play a couple of linebattles with your regiment on TeamSpeak, there are loads of regiments and some in different languages. There are pure Spanish, German, Danish etc. speaking regiments.\n\nThis is simply some of the biggest reasons to as why i still play Mount and Blade: Warband this day. I hope you enjoyed my review, and i really hope that this makes you buy this wonderful game and play the living soul out of it.! :)","November 26, 2013","true","812.5"," 734 of 767 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","734","767","0","21"

If you are actually considering buying this game, I'd recommend actually reading this (and other!) review(s) that are of decent length because this game is not easily captured in just a few words.\n\nMount & Blade: Warband is one of those slightly niche games out there that captures the heart of gamers looking for a medieval world where you play as just another soldier able to pave his legend or die forgotten. There is no storyline, no heroic destiny - you are not Dovahkiin, the fate of the world surprisingly does not rely on your actions, and no, you don't get a magical sword that will vanquish all enemies. Now some people might find this to be a deterrent, but for a game as entertaining as Mount & Blade: Warband, I only saw endless replay value. Having put thousands of hours into both the original Mount & Blade as well as Warband (both of which I originally did not buy on Steam) I can assure you that if this game fits the genre of your preference, you can play it endlessly.\n\nNow what sort of genre IS M&B Warband? You have a lot of choices, you can be a solo mercenary (which is very very hard), lead a group of mercenaries for a noble/king, swear fealty to a king of a faction, or attempt to become the king of your own faction. Remember, M&B Warband is a sandbox game in which you can choose what you want to become. Whatever story you feel like making, embrace it and become. But, for the most part, it is a first-person medieval combat-based campaign of a character trying to make his or her way in the world. Yes, there are some tactics involved, you can create your own little trade caravan and take over the market, you can go around helping all the peasants in the world, and if you have a masochistic streak, you can attempt to work your way into the politics of the game (which like politics, is frustrating). Yet, in the end, it all comes down to fighting your way through life.\n\nLet me jump right into my favorite part: the combat. M&B has a very unique combat system (there are a few glitches here or there, but nothing game-breaking) involving first-person medieval combat on a battlefield that quite possibly may be strewn with horses, people, corpses, quite a few arrows and crossbow bolts (mostly flying at you). You have a variety of weapons to choose, from a heavy siege crossbow to a throwing axe to a mere wooden staff to a glaive to a two-handed sword to... you get the point. Add all of this to being mounted on horses (which have differing physical attributes) for mounted combat and you have the chaos that constitutes a true battlefield.\n\nThere are also sieges in this game, which allow you to actively use the terrain to your advantage... or disadvantage. It is very hard to siege a castle on the hardest difficulties (because I mean, when they are sitting on walls raining arrows on you...) but also very rewarding as you can then claim the castle and its revenue for your own. My biggest issue with sieges is that for most cities/castles, you are given a single ladder/siege tower with which to conduct your siege (infrequently you get 2, of which your/their troops only use 1). No matter on which side, this makes for siege defense quite practical when actually participating as every man on the wall is worth a hundred below it. (The combat simulator, which is activated when you don't feel like participating in the battle yourself, generally is very different from actual combat and tends to make defenders weaker than they actually are. At the same time, your troops will also not be getting orders from you and thus will be strategically weaker as well.)\n\nThe hardest part about the combat system for myself and I'd believe most others was the ranged combat - especially mounted ranged combat. Everything short of wind and air resistance is factored in, from flight time to the drop from gravity to the sway of your horse to the angle of release to the point of impact on the enemy. It is challenging, rewarding, and all together epic. I'd like to say more about the combat, but if I let my thoughts roam wild on this game we may be forced to deal with a book instead of a review. So let me leave you with an image: Picture yourself holding a shortbow, moving at a slow gallop on your horse, faced with fifty knights charging you with lances couched.\n\nMoving on to the AI in this game: The enemy AI is pretty good (if you play on harder difficulties) and their characters are very strong - as strong as if not stronger than you. You also have the ability to deal with merchants, caravans, kings, nobles, ladies, and the odd "adventurer/hero" who may be willing to join you. Unlike the original M&B, Warband also offers you the option of recruiting vassals from other factions into your faction if you choose to start one. This has made attempting to create a kingdom drastically easier since you no longer need to defend your territory alone from the might of five other kingdoms and their thousands upon thousands of troops. The game also factors in your relationship to the NPCs, which can get very messy very quickly (this is something you should definitely experience for yourself, as words don't really do it justice).\n\nThere are also a vast variety of mods for this game (though the vanilla version in and of itself is endlessly playable) that create various scenarios/settings in addition to the vanilla version. Furthermore, Warband brings online multiplayer which (though I personally did not partake in much of) enhances the experience even more.\n\nWarband is unique. It is niche. It is epic. It is the perfect game for a gamer who wants to live his/her own story instead of a repetitive tale created by someone else.\n\nI hope this review helps with your decision making. If you have any questions/concerns or would simply like more information, feel free to leave a comment or contact me.","November 7, 2014","true","70.9"," 263 of 269 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","263","269","10","1"

You can probably see where this review is going.\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY: It is possibly the second best part of the game, the gameplay. It can make or break the game, and it has definitely made this game. The game is easy to play but extremely difficult to master, even people poor at the game's mechanics can have fun (as did I in my early days). The simplest I can put the game is, as a Medieval Combat Simulator, but it is so much more than that. With options to become a King (or Queen) and partake in the politics, alternatively become a vassal under one of the existing Lords. You can become a trader, vying to create a trade-empire or a brigand who preys on the poor farmers and villages.\n\nThe gameplay is, simply put, possibly the best out of any game out there. There is so much you can do, and even more.... The game is created to be easily modded, there are dozens of era-changing mods out there, let alone even more minor or current-era-altering mods. Most of them are relatively stable, even if they are made on old versions of the game. There is simply put, no end to the game.\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS: Not a high-point, but they are not bad when set on the highest options. I myself don't play on the highest options, as all the dust and shadows (and the trees, ugh the trees...) can make me lag terribly in large battles. Especially against horse-archer nomads who gather up a lot of dust. If you're not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ this shouldn't bother you.\n\n\n\nCOMMUNITY: Surprised that gameplay wasn't the best? It's not, the community is the best part of the game. Well, it is the best and the worst part of the game. Just hang out with some mates and have a good time, maybe even join a group of like-minded players, or make your own. If you want a serious group, for competitions and such, those exist too. But they are usually in-group competitions. Like the time I won DOTA 2, and I didn't know it was free... -.- Won't deny the tournament with friends and the absolute chaos of randomness that followed afterwards was worth it.\n\n\n\nEXPANSION: I also own Napoleonic Wars, the expansion for Mount & Blade: Warband. I too, also have had many hours on this and definitely recommend it. It is multiplayer only, but there is so much to do even there. There are also several amazing mods requiring this expansion.\n\n\n11/10 would buy again.","November 25, 2013","true","065.7"," 306 of 323 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","306","323","0","6"

From there you have to build your way to take over the world. Which is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nThere isn't much of a story in this game. Everything said above is pretty much it, it lets you create and do what you want in the game world. All you care about is take over the world kill everyone else. How you choose to do so is up to you.\n\nThere are small "quests" within the game that will give you exp to level yourself up as well as your army with skills that will benefit either you, your army or your entire kingdom.\n\nThis game is not something you buy for amazing graphics or amazing sound, it is a game you buy for its depth and for the fun of leading grand armies to major battles and sieges. I can honestly say after my 460 hours I haven't won the game. Not even once, always made a mistake or didn't capture enough castles or even worse did get too many. It is a game that has a deep connection with the middle and dark ages.\n\nMarry, kill, capture your way to conquer the world.\n\nMount & Blade will live for a long long time and there are amazing mods all the time that get added to make the game even better. The two important things you should add to get an amazing experience -\n\nFloris Mod Pack - http://www.moddb.com/mods/floris-mod-pack\n\nWarband battle size -http://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/1761/\n\nThese two mods make it possible to have battles up to 600 units on both sides and it looks amazing. Seeing your proud army just clash and kill 100´s of other units is fun. They also provide further more depth to the politics and basic gameplay of the game.\n\nAll in all M&B: Warband is one of those games that proves that a game doesn't have to be all about graphics/sounds or any flashy flashy stuff, to make a truly unique and amazing experience that will keep you trapped for years.\n\nSo if you are looking for a game that will take your soul for 100s of hours grab this game for sure. It is one of my favorites and is really one of those games that is 100% what YOU decide and make of it.","July 10, 2014","true","473.7"," 188 of 198 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","188","198","0","14"

But that's okay because peasants of the world multiply.\n\nFrom the ashes of my dead, warriors are born.  I have an army.  I recruit special characters.  They slaughter with glee.  I have herps on my knee.\n\nI go to a castle.  I talk to a king.  I ask to be his vassal; wreak havoc I will for thee!  He laughs in my face.  I haven't won a battle!  Scolded, I flee.  I will make the sand kingdom some tea.\n\nI go to Vaegirs (lol vag).  I recruit an aging hippie tool.  He fights with a butter knife.  He tells me he looks forward to helping people in need.  Dude, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is over there.  He just ate a hair.\n\nA Vaeg lord tells me to kill all the sand peasants.  We kill them all.  Aging Hippie loses morale.  He tells me no more violence, or he will leave.  I tell him it won't happen again.  My fingers are crossed.\n\nI kill farmers, I sell slaves.  Aging Hippie tells me he will leave.  He doesn't leave.  My other recruits are like death machines.\n\nI'm commanded to storm a castle.  We kill every single sand person.  Keep in mind that most of my army is sand people.  I feel the need to remind you of this.  Some of them came from this castle.  They killed their own families.\n\nI am named lord.  Aging Hippie says he is done with me.  He still doesn't leave.  There's a glimmer in his eye.\n\nI'm level 30.  My army is unstoppable.  I go to take another castle.  I run into a bigger army.  Never saw them coming.  I don't want to sacrifice anybody.  So we fight.  In my vanity, I forgot to put on a helmet.  Crap.  I get knocked off my horse.  Level 30 and I still get killed in one hit (srlsy).  We are defeated.\n\nI get dragged around the map for like 10 minutes.  My castle is taken.  My body is dumped in the desert.  I fear all is lost.\nI open the menu.  I am left with only one member of my army.  It's the Aging Hippie.  He tells me he is going to leave me.  He smiles.\n\nI understand what he wants.  I think I've known all along.  I see the glimmer in his eye.","February 9","true","22.8"," 170 of 181 people (94%) found this review helpful 200 people found this review funny","94","170","181","200","12"

By that I mean, you cannot have a more "sandbox" experience in an RPG - there is no story and no real goals; it is entirely player driven. You can join any faction, you can build up your army, you can create a new faction and expand, taking over the others. You can do everything an NPC can do and vice versa. I keep coming back to this game every once in a while and get dragged into it. You essentially rise from a single peasant to a warlord who conquered the whole world, without having your hand held at any time.\n\nOther than the RPG/sandbox mechanics, the game as an amazing combat system which supports enormous medieval battles involving hundreds of characters. The music is really good but after tens of hours it can get repetitive. The graphics are pretty dated but if you can get over it, it's most certainly worth it.","November 25, 2013","true","134.2"," 160 of 171 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","160","171","0","0"

If you do, just make scrambled eggs.\n\nIf you did it right, the eggs should cook slowly. As they start to become solid on the bottom of the pan(but still runny enough to move around the pan, it will be 2 layers), add a layer of cheese over HALF of the omelette(not too much, you will add more later and the grease from the cheese will RUIN the flip). add the bacon and potatos over the cheese, then add more cheese. Once the eggs are almost completly solid, take a spatulla and start to lift up the edges around the side that is empty, this will be the side you FLIP onto the other. once you can move most of the empty side, you will put the spatulla under the middle of the empty side and GENTLY slide it all the way to the middle of the omelette. then you will lift slowly and try to create a half circle by folding one half over the other. turn off the heat and transfer it to a plate.\n\nIf done right, you just made an amazing breakfast THAT WILL GET YOU LAID! Dont ever underestimate a home cooked meal. it will get you in bed with someone 99 out of 100 times.\n\nUse this power responsibly.","May 1, 2015","true","265.9"," 470 of 594 people (79%) found this review helpful 612 people found this review funny","79","470","594","612","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StickyLippy/recommended/48700/","StickyLippy","YNWA- JURGEN KLOPPPPPP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StickyLippy/","1427 products in account","One of the greatest Multiplayer experiences I have ever had. The singleplayer isn't that bad either! I've just been too hooked with M&B MP that I have given M&B SP zero time. I hear nothing but great things from my singleplaying friends though. If you buy this game, I recommend getting the Napoleonic Wars expansion. It's multiplayer only, but that is where I have had the most fun. There are several different game modes. The first is called Siege. In where a defending team must protect their castle from Enemy advancement until the timer has run out, however, keep your head well hidden from them Snipers. As defending team lives are limited to just five. Or less, depending on the time you joined the map. The attackers however, they have unlimited lives but in order to get to you, they must breach a hole in your wall with cannons and then storm the breach; which normally results in your bayonet stuck in their chests as you sing Rule Britannia; or mention the Kaiser if you're playing as Prussia/Austria.\nThe next gamemode in M&B MP is Battle. In Battle, both teams have just one life. And there is no respawning until the round is complete, so if you charge ahead early on and get mowed down by 6 Cavalry who have joined together and created a small posse, then you're going to be waiting 5-6 minutes for the round to end probably. That can be frustrating so I recommend teaming up with your teammates, rather than go lone wolf assasin style. The game also features TDM and DM gamemodes, I don't need to explain these. As they feature heavily in pretty much every game with a gun or sword and has multiplayer.\n\nOverall, I recommend M&B to anybody if you're a fan of the era it's set in, and are war crazy. Or if you like the RPG and open world elements of the singleplayer. The game also has a VERY strong modding community. And you should try out some of the awesome mods. This was a fantastic experience.","November 7, 2014","true","273.2"," 152 of 170 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","152","170","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingOfButter/recommended/48700/","KingOfButter","Meme King Harlaus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingOfButter/","198 products in account","The lords had assembeled at Praven. They had just finished a campaign and were at one of Harlaus's many bountiful feasts. They had little to worry about, seeing as the Sarranids were waging successful warfare against the Rhodoks and Khergits to the south and west. The Swadians had gained more lands under the newest campaign, in which Count Delinard and Harlaus divided up forces and lead groups of nobles about the Vaegir countryside, and took the area from Reyvadin to Khudan. The rest of the already weakened and disorganised Vaegirs were easy pickings for the newfound ally of Swadia, the Nords. The Lords still had one pressing issue: Who would own Ayyike, the village to the south of Khudan? It was hard to tell, as it laid between Dramug Castle and the City of Reyvadin. Harlaus himself had taken Reyvadin, Delinard, the Marshall, Dramug Castle. It was hard to decide, so Harlaus decided to hold a vote instead of the seeminly unusually heated debates about the fiefdom of the village. There were 20 Swadian Lords. They all voted. It was a 50-50 tie. 10 Delinard, 10 Harlaus. Lady Sonadel, Daughter of Grainwad and Wife of Lord Prescan, the new Swadian Lord after Haringoth died of old age, read them all off. The room in Praven fell silent. Not a noise could be heard in the royal hall. Some of the lords and ladies felt anguish, knowing that more needless arguments were to come over this. Harlaus knew what would happen, and decided to put an end to it. But there was one pressing issue - Harlaus, wise as he was on the inside, was a total ♥♥♥♥wad socially. Harlaus pondered at thoughts then and there, before deciding on one. Harlaus, in front of all Swadian Nobility, walked over to the table where the votes were counted in two boxes. He gathered all the Delinard-leaning votes, and placed them into a neat pile on the table. He stepped onto a stool, and then the table from that. Harlaus undid his belt, and dropped his pants and undergarments, before unleasing a torrent of Swadian Royal ♥♥♥♥ on the votes. The room fell silent. Harlaus, whilst still urinating on the votes, stared down Lady Sonadel, then Count Delinard in the eye. Tears began streaming from Lady Sonadel's delicate eyes, landing from her cheeks onto her fur coat. "After consulting with the peers of the realm, King Harlaus has decided to confer Ayyike on King Harlaus." Harlaus stepped down from the table, still naked from the waist below, and picked up the votes with his bare hands, Harlaus walked over to a nearby lantern, urine dripping from his hands, and dropped the votes in. A quick "Hsss!" was emitted from the urine turning to steam and the votes burning, and Harlaus wiped his hands on Delinard's beard. Harlaus put everything back on, and promptly returned to feasting with his Lords.\n\n10/10 would retake Praven again.","January 31, 2015","true","887.5"," 134 of 150 people (89%) found this review helpful 159 people found this review funny","89","134","150","159","7"

You played 3k hours on this freaking game so you should know something about it.\n\nSo... Singleplayer:\n\nAt the start, you can choose "your past", like if you are Veteran warrior or just blacksmith´s apprentice... etc.\nYou can choose your start in one of 6 factions (It won´t have any influence on your gameplay.)\nWhen you start, you have big world to explore.\nOnly one negative thing, it´s not noob friendly.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nAwesome multiplayer! Really! There are no hackers etc.\nAgain there are 6 factions but it´s choosed by admin of server or players poll which 2 factions will fight. In Every Faction, you can choose from 3 classes. 1 ranged, 1 melee or 1 horseman.\nEvery faction got it´s own equipment for every class.\nThere are battle mods like Battle, TDM, DM, Duels, Siege....\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame itself can offer modules which you can download on taleworlds forums.\n\n10/10 :)\n","December 5, 2015","true","380.9"," 90 of 94 people (96%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","96","90","94","30","7"

So i decide to Buy it on Steam. Anyway Back to the Review. (Wait i'm Being very Serious in this Review? Wow...)\n\nWhat this Game is about you ask? Well its little hard to explain it so i will try my Best. Its a Medievel Sim with RPG elements and set in a Fictional World know as Calradia (I can't Proannouce the name either). What really sets it apart from all other games, is that it so fun to Lead your Own Army. ( Which i will Explain that later)\n\nNow i know what your Asking ''Are the Graphics any Good Bro?'' Well in a way no. i know what your Saying Next ''EWWWW the Graphics SUCK! NO BUY!'' Well if you love to Judge a game by graphics then by all means do, Sure it not the Best but hey, the Graphics are better then What you get in Infestation: Survivor Stories right?\n\nNow what about the Gameplay you ask? Well i can tell you that its Really Fun! You Start your Jounery by Filling out your Skills. basicly it would look like this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Patch_1.jpg\nAnd then your off to Createing your character. Which look like this http://elder-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/mb_warband-2010-03-29-19-32-47-72.jpg\nAnd Then your Done! Now let talk about what this game is about. There are Six Factions in this Game: Swadia, Rhodok, Vaegirs, Khergit Khanate, Nords, and the Sarranid Sultanate (Note: You don't join one of the factions when you start the game, you only join them when you are a Merc or a Vassal which i will Explain later) . Now it will be basicly hard to explain these factions so i will let this Page Explain it for you http://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Warband/Factions . Now there is alot to talk about so try to Stay with me. You Start out in some Area of your choice *The Faction Areas* The map is pretty Big, here this pic to give you a Idea what it look like http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110214224212/mountandblade/images/a/a6/WarbandWorldMap.png\n\nWhen you Start out you will be Fighting Bandits, Doing Quests from Towns, and doing small tasks from the Lords (Vassals). The Game goverment system is based on Feudalism, It basicly means that the King shall give you Fiefs (Land) in Exchange for Service (Basicly fighting for your King). Now in order to become a Lord (Vassal) to a faction, You must Do tasks for the lords, bulid up some rep, etc. When you become a Vassal the king of a Faction will give you the poorest village in the faction's territory (Because he a ♥♥♥♥). When you get a Fief (Villages, castles, citys,) you will get Taxes from that Fief and you can bulid improvements in that Village, Castle, or city (But they will Cost you alot and they take a long time to finish and also you will get a castle or city in late Game). Now let talk about your Personal Army. You will raise a army for yourself ( Note: YOU WILL NOT MAKE A HUGE ARMY THE SIZE OF 1000! KEEP DREAMING) You can raise a Army by Hireing men from villages, Saveing Prisoners, or just hire mercs( They will Cost you!) However you will have to take care of your army. You must keep there morale high, Buy Food for your army, Get them Heal up if some of your men are wounded, Pay their Wages, etc. Now in order to make some money you would have to\n1. loot and Sell\n2. Taxes\n3. Get pay from a quest\n\nNow let talk about how being a lord is like. Basicly you serve your Faction to fight aganist other factions that your faction is at war at, Get a alot of fiefs to earn more money, Get the other lords to be your friends, or if get  lucky: Get to be Elect for Marshall. Basicly a Marshall is someone who can summon the lords to fight for him like capture a very strong castle, Citys, etc. This is what it would look like http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120224215032/mountandblade/images/b/be/Following_Marshall.jpg (Note: the Marshall in that pic is not a Human Player)\nOh! I forgot to explain the RPG elments in this game. You can buy armor, Weapons, and a Horse for yourself to protect yourselves when you fight in a battle. Basicly this is what your inventory would look like http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband_10.jpg (Note: The person in this Pic have just start a New Game)\n\nNow let talk about Combat! the way you swing your Sword, axe, etc depends on where you swing your mouse. For example if you move your mouse to the right, the Weapon will Swing right, and so on. The battles in this game really depends on 3 Things\n1. How many Soliders\n2. How strong is your Army\n3. The most Important one!: Tactics and strategy\nThis is just a example of what your Company(Army) Page would look like http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/435317-mount-blade-warband-windows-screenshot-on-the-right-is-my.jpg (Note: The person in this Pic had capture a Castle and is now takeing Prisoners)\nNow what about what the Battles? Well the battles are the fun Part! This is what a battle would look like {LINK REMOVED}http://pulpgaming.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/mount-blade-warband-pc-096.jpg Or this http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/taleworlds.jpg\n(Note: the Land, or environment you would be Playing on depends on where are you fighting at. For example if you are fighting on a Snowy place, then you be Fighting on a Snowy battlefield and etc) BUT BE WARN! you must be careful or elas you would end up like this Poor Soul http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110626205906/mountandblade/images/a/a7/Mb_warband_2011-06-26_22-50-06-18.jpg\nYeah.........\nAnyway what about castle and citys? are there Sieges? The answer: Yes! When you siege a castle you would have to bulid Siege weapons (Siege tower or ladders) but they will take time to bulid. So you got to be careful if the other lord are coming to save the castle or City. You can also Defend a castle of your own or a city or castle own by a other lord. And yes you will be able to fight in these siege battles. Like this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Tutorial-3-Siege-Warfare-Trailer_3.jpg\nOr this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Tutorial-3-Siege-Warfare-Trailer_2.jpg\nor this http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx14/allaboutpics/mb_warband2012-03-2003-44-21-20.jpg\nOh and you can create your own faction! BUT that would be in late game becuase it going to be diffcult. But there ALOT to talk about haveing a kingdom, so i will give you this link to give you more details about makeing your own Kingdom http://mountandblade.wikia.com/wiki/Founding_a_new_kingdom\n\nOh and btw this game have a Great mod support! If you are looking to get some mods, MODDB is a good site. Here a link http://www.moddb.com/games/mount-blade-warband/mods\nIf you don't know how to install mods. Here a video to help you out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJh1-OHORd4\n\nThe mods that i recommend you try is\nPerisno http://www.moddb.com/mods/httpwwwmoddbcommembersmichadrmods\nA Clash of Kings (Game of Thrones!) http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-clash-of-kings\nAnno Domini 1257 http://www.moddb.com/mods/anno-domini-1257\nWarsword Conquest (For those who are a Fan of Warhammer :3)http://www.moddb.com/mods/warsword-conquest\nBrytenwalda http://www.moddb.com/mods/brytenwalda\nFloris Mod Pack http://www.moddb.com/mods/floris-mod-pack\nPersistent World Mod http://www.moddb.com/mods/persistent-world-mod\n(Note: these are the mods that I recommend you TRY.

I can safely, with all definite possibilities, say that this is indeed a great game.\nWhether you're a Lord, a commoner, a hunter, a mercenary, a lady rising to aristocratsy, a trader, a slaver, a crossbowman, a leader, a tactician. No matter who you want to be. This game can make you that person.\n\nFrom fighting atop horses, to fighting on foot, to fighting in sieges, and land-battles. With swords, maces, axes, spears, javelins, bows, crossbows, hammers, picks, pikes, bills, throwing knives, quarterstaffs, even your bare fists - This game will let you do whatever you want  to in a Feudal-Based world.\n\nSet in a feudal-Medieval landscape, the same to it's predecessor - Mount And Blade, named Calradia - There will be much to do with much time to do it in. The continent is torn arift, with six rival faction-states all vying for power. Each with it's only courts, castles, cities and vassals (Of whom have quite the amount of family members, be they father, son, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunty) -- You're character is free to roam, choosing entirely as to what your role will be in this epic-society.\n\nBe who YOU want to be. Act how YOU want to act. Duels, pillaging, fighting, peace - These, and more, will be your weapons in the feudal life that is Warband. Marry for love, or for power. Become a king, queen, emporer, empress of your own kingdom, empire, rebellion - Help rival lordlings cure their hatreds, or help worsen them.\n\nNow, that I've done the whole "THIS IS A GREAT GAME. BUY NOW." salesman-thing. Onto the actual points about the game, and whether I truly believe the game is worth it's £15 (Because, let's be honest. £14.99 is just £15). Yes. It is. Through my long-time with the game, it's safe to say that I've not even scratched the very surface of the game's entire potential. Being a mostly-singleplayer person, though multiplayer is highly recommended - What with the thousands (Yes. Thousands.) of servers for several of the community mods up, I would be certain to tell you - You will not even be able to contemplate just how many new characters I've made.\n\nBut ofcourse, there's the buggy side. In the hundreds of hours I've spent, of my life, on the game - I can say that it's nigh bug-free, and there are only a few that would be of any irritation. Such as the poor use of lances by NPCs, but then again - That's not a bug, that's just the AI right? However, keep in mind that this game is a total sandbox, and the four, maybe five, bugs that exist are (By extreme!) outweighed by the perfection, that is Warband.\n\nIs the game worth it? No. It's worth more, mate.","October 12, 2014","true","778.6"," 76 of 77 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","76","77","3","0"

Warband has impressively combined major RTS elements with immersive third person fighting gameplay, allowing the player to not only command their own army, but fight alongside it as well.\n\nSingle player features a real time ‘click-to-move’ overworld where you traverse the lands with your warband party, fighting enemy parties, visiting castles and villages for trading or recruitment and waging war on the enemy faction’s settlements. The actual fighting is done in a similar style to the Total War games, only you get to participate in the battle yourself. Once you engaged in a fight, you play as your personal character in the field of battle alongside your entire warband to fight the enemy, at this point you can give specific commands to your soldiers as you charge in  on a somewhat-valiant steed and roll some heads for yourself.\n\nSingle player Warband is basically a large sandbox RPG. You don’t have any real objective or direction when you start the game, but you will generally work your way into becoming a mercenary for one of the 5 factions and help them destroy the enemy and take their castles in the name of your King. Eventually you will work your way up the ranks, swearing an oath to the King and making friends and enemies with the other vassals in your kingdom.\n\nThis is when you can start to influence the actions of the kingdom. You can work together with other lords to accuse others of treason or marry into one of the many nobles of the realm which provides different benefits to male and female player characters.\n\nSick of capturing castles for your King only to have them bestowed upon another vassal? Well you can start your own faction! Provided you are strong enough and you can support a war effort on your own, you are free to capture castles in your own name and take over Calradia for yourself! With a little convincing, those Lords you spent all that time sucking up to might even decide to renounce their oath to their King and join you…\n\nMultiplayer Warband has a rather competitive community, most servers run Battle mode which is round based combat, once you die you spectate until one team wins. Since there are 4 directions to block and attack when fighting with melee weapons, the game is quite hard to master, becoming a pro in multiplayer takes a lot of practice. You can’t just hack and slash and hope for the best, you need to pay attention to what your opponent/s are doing and act accordingly.\n\nThere is also huge potential for modding, there are already loads of popular total conversion mods for Warband including 13th Century Europe mods, Musket era mods, Cowboy era mods and some fantasy style mods.\n\nControls and player movement are very clunky, but they work exactly like they should. The game provides skill-based multiplayer and a fun single player that will give you hours upon hours of play before you get bored (I’ve played 700~ hours of Warband and have yet to ‘finish’ a single player game as my own faction). Moreover, there aren’t many games like this out there. Sure there are medieval RPGs and RTSs, but none that combine both into a fun little package that offers such freedom, not to mention the modding potential.\n\nThe game universe goes far deeper than the average player might consider. The Kings and Lords and Ladies of the realm all have a relationship with one another and an attitude towards war which determines who they will pledge their allegiance too, who they will quarrel with and how they will act. Even the minor act of raiding and burning a village can have huge impacts in the game in many ways, the village will hate you (obviously), the Lord reigning over it will dislike you, the city it belongs to will suffer in terms of economy and produce less income, this could cause even more backlash to the player who may one day own these fiefs their selves. With all these variables things can become a little buggy at times, but it mostly works.\n\nThere is a very intricate system at play here and the developers have really tried to capture the political and economical systems that went on in medieval Europe on a grand scale.\n\nWhile the graphics are a small upgrade from the original Mount & Blade, they still aren’t exactly up to scratch with the high standards of 2010 (the game's release year).\n\nThe sounds of battle (weapons, war cries and death) are moderately satisfying, but there are barely any voices in the game. However there is a nice soundtrack to both the battles and while traversing across the land.\n\nThere are many people out there who would find a game like this totally boring, with no given objective to complete it can be easy to get bored... Then there are people like me who come across a game like this and see the potential for adventure in a huge medieval sandbox where you can command an army, fight with your army and ultimately coordinate a war on a large scale. And for others it’s all about the multiplayer.\n\nWhether you are a fan of competitive medieval combat games, or a fan of medieval RPGs and large battles, this is definitely one to try.","March 26, 2014","true","779.4"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","62","65","0","0"

Originally developed by 2 people it is now a full fledge  game developement studio.\n\nEssentially Mount and Blade: Warband is a 3rd/1st person rpg, scalable infantry/squad/empire management game that allows you to largely  play as whatever you want to be which, if I want to give an example includes things like burning down many villages as a brigand, becoming a mercenary for hire, becoming a trader, or even start your own kingdom to compete with the big fishes in the pond. Alright onto the review I suppose.\n\nOptimization & ControlsControls are excellent and everything can be remapped according to your wishes and whims. Well almost everything since the map controls are locked. Don't even try to play it with a controller. It has way too much buttons for the poor thing and I would laugh at you if you even try.\n\nThis is an ancient game and it was released back in 2010 so it might surprise you to hear that it has an extensive option menu that is too numerous for me to list down but rest assure that even the weakest of ultrabook could reliably run this game at 60 fps.\n\nGraphicsIs ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sorry but there is no other way to say this other than the fact that the graphic is completely, fully a pile of terrible, muddy, and stiff textured with animations having few variations and NPC lacking any either with lords and villagers rotating to see you if you engage them in conversation. The overworld map lacks detail and well, lets just say that graphics is not something this game has.\n\nBut the weapons are oh so very shiny and reflective if you turn it all the way up. Woo. Also it does not matter much for this game since the core gameplay is what carries it forward.\n\nMusicAmbient musics is just there to fill the void of silence rather than to enhance the mood with no form of dynamic music system in place at all. But the battle music sometimes fit and sometimes doesn't. Meanwhile sound effects sounds like someone took a duffel bag and swing it repeatedly in front of the mic with no metallic noises at all except when steel clashes against shields. Hardly any variation when people are screaming bloody murder shuffling up towards you trying to cut you up with the results being 20 people all yelling the same noises over and over again like "wheaaaaaaaaaaa!"\n\nIt's funny.\n\nGameplayLets start from the botton. You have your player character, a bunch of stats that you determined by choosing the option at start which you can add on when you level up, your mount, your blade and weapon, and an overworld map to explore. In the overworld map you can move around and find warband of lords and bandits moving around and affecting the world without your help. In this mode you can just go around and find a city or town or engage a warband I don't know just approach something to do anything. You can also access inventory, party, journal and etc etc in this mode.\n\nIn town, villages and castle you can choose to go into 3rd person mode and explore [although there's nothing really to find except the Guild Master who is not marked in the menu and is essential for your later career so go at least once to find him. He's in every town] or just browse for stuff to do using the option menu. Buy, sell, trade, enter tournament, go to see the annoying lords up to you really.\n\nNow for the fun part. When you first enter a battle you will probably consist of less than 10-20 people and you will most likely die attacking, blocking in the thick of it with sieges carrying a wonderful 90% mortality rate [awful ladder] but later on you can command hundreds of men doing sieges and assaulting other lords.\n\nAnd that is the gist of warband. You start from the lowliest of scrubs and work your way up the ladder recruiting companions, training troops and starting your own kingdom or become a vassal to an existing one. Or play whatever way you want I don't care. All in all incredibly in depth and you should probably give it a try at least once.\n\nConclusion and Mods I made a mod list which you can view which greatly enhances the base game with many stuff to do and improvement. At the very least use the first mod because it changes the battle size amount. In conclusion warband is an extremely fun to play with infantry and empire sim but only if it clicks with you. It did for me and while it might sound bias I'm going to go ahead and give it an excellent rating simply because I haven't seen another game like it. Is it worth your money? Yes it probably is.\n\nMod list - http://pastebin.com/SW60XeUJ\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: S-Rank Wait no it is slightly buggy and the dialogues are terrible so B-Rank\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","November 13, 2015","true","39.7"," 93 of 111 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","93","111","10","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/recommended/48700/","samhouston","Sam Houston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/","224 products in account","Mount and Blade: Warband is a tremendous medieval sandbox game.\n\nThe graphics are dated, there is no storyline, the kingdom management is obnoxious and I bounced off it several times before finally pushing through.\n\nThe combat is the most fun I've had in any melee-centric game, and after playing Warband I've not been able to return to games like Skyrim. In particular, the mounted combat (especially with a lance or polearm) is insanely fun. Warband nails the importance of momentum, and nothing in gaming can feel better than landing a couched lance on an enemy at full speed, instantly dismounting (if you aimed poorly) or killing them.\n\nThe tactical aspect is fun but not fleshed out. There were very few times when I ever had to change my standard battle plans. Find a slope, put your archers at the top and a thin line of infantry halfway up, then let your archers wreak havoc on the enemy while your infantry slows them down and prevents them from getting in range of the archers. If your army composition is different, then obviously you'll have to have a different tactic. In Vanilla Warband there are no open field battles you can't win with an adequate amount of Swadian knights immediately charging and demolishing anything that stand in their wake.\n\nSieges are fun but limited. Vanilla only has a couple of different types of maps, and they're almost always identical in terms of how the battles work. The ladders (or siege towers) create an extraordinarily narrow chokepoint at the entrance to the walls, meaning that if you are moderately decent at the combat, you can realistically hold off an army 4-5 times your size by standing at the top of the ladder and bopping the enemy heads one by one while your archers (preferably Rhodok crossbowmen) make pincushions out of the men climbing the ladder. Alternatively, you can just jump down the ladder and start hacking and slashing the backs of the men climbing the ladder, surrounded by the entire enemy army but basically unstoppable. Sieging castles requires a little more strategy, but not by much.\n\nBut the real reason why I've played so many hours of Warband is the modding scene. Warband mods are tremendous, Prophesy of Pendor is a light fantasy setting with significantly larger enemy armies, better balancing between unit types, and  much stronger units in general. I've had battles against armies of over 7k enemies, they lasted hours but were extraordinarily rewarding. I highly recommend it. If you're interested in something closer to histical accuracy, Anno Domini 1257 offers a painstaking recreation of 13th century Europe. Brytenwalda offers a harsh (thoroughly researched) vision of Dark Ages Britain, The Last Days sets you in the Lord of the Rings' universe, and Gekokoju gives you Sengoku era Japan. If you want more of an enhanced Vanilla experience, Floris and Silverstag both offer tremendous reworks of balance, kingdom management, diplomacy, and more. And if you're a fan of D&D, Phantasy Calradia overhauls the Vanilla world to include your standard D&D races, weapons, and offers a tremendous spellcasting system as well. Each of the mods I mentioned could easily be played for hundreds of hours a piece before seeing all they have to offer, and I've just barely scratched the surface of the modding scene.\n\nWhile Warband won't be dropping any jaws with its graphics and many of the mid-late game management systems are opaque, the combat an incredibly amount of fun and Warband offers a modder's playground that will have you hooked for years. Despite my general distaste for third person and melee combat, I would not hesitate to rank Warband as one of my favourite games of all time. I'd recommend it even if you refuse to mod, but when you install mods it becomes a truly amazing experience.","November 26, 2015","true","337.7"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","51","53","2","3"

Warband was developed by TaleWorlds and was published by Paradox Interactive. This highly anticipated indie video game won numerous rewards and also was nominated “Best Indie Game of the Year“.\n\nWhile most RPGs with medieval time setting involving magical events, supernatural entities, Warband strikes you with realistic combat without any fireball spells.  Mount & Blade: Warband is a mix of action RPG and turn-based strategy games. You travel on world map as in turn-based strategy game and fight or explore villages and cities in third-person or first-person perspective. In Mount & Blade: Warband your goal is simple: rule all of the Calradia. You start as a simple mercenary but later you can become faithful vassal or even the king. While there is no actual story other than rule Calradia, you can do various quest to earn gold and improve relations with other lords or cities. Quest differs from simply delivering goods to capturing enemy lords.\n\nThere are total 24 different skills which you can improve by leveling up. You get experience points from battles or doing quest. Those skills affect how you perform in actual battles, travelling in world map, trading, maintaining your army. Graphics are not top quality but in won't prevent you from enjoying the game. In fighting mode you can command your troops with simple tasks such as follow, stand ground, charge and to choose what type of weapon to use. Every field battle usually turns into over 100 troop mosh-pit and picking the retreating enemy troops one by one. City and castle sieges or defenses can be more enjoyable as you can explore city or castle. After capturing or being awarded a fief you can improve it with new building which gives you various bonuses, for example, you can start a production to earn more additional gold. Also Mount & Blade: Warband can be enhanced by various mods from simple textures to total conversions.\n\nThe main difference from the original Mount & Blade is the multiplayer. Default number of players is up to 64. Modded servers can hold more than 200! Game modes include well-known Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Assault (similar to conquest mode seen in Battlefield series) and also Siege (where you need to capture or defend a castle), Battle (last standing man wins) and Duel (one to one combat).\n\nTo sum up, I would recommend Mount & Blade: Warband to anyone who always imagined what it would feel to actually be in a medieval battle not just command your troops from above. Multiplayer mode with various maps both official and fan made can keep you logged in for a long amount of time and total conversion content will enrich your singleplayer experience.\n","December 2, 2013","true","148.4"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","0"

I have finally mustered the men. I can finally take Halmar/London/King's Landing/Rome/Kyoto! I shall charge with my men, I shall burn their buildings of joy, I shall show that we destroy as easily as we build.\n\n*Some time passes*\n\nAwesome! I am finally the lord of all the land. I guess that now singleplayer's completed, i'll go ahead and try out the multipla-\n\n6 months pass.\n\nMust. Rek. Skrubs.\n\nWarband is the best game ever. It has the allure of a lady of the night and the execution of a headsman. Sure it's rough around the edges but it's combat system is the best combat in gaming. It's dynamic, it's easy to learn but difficult to master, and you never have to worry about forgetting something other than your blade before you get into battle. No potions, no bull, and no mercy. Other than getting demolished in Native (vanilla for you skrubs), you can always buy the official expansions (Napoleonic wars and Viking Conquest), which add more depth, the former has a developed community, and Viking Conquest, a newer release, brings more features and improved graphics. The mod community is on par with Skyrim's, bu the difference between Skyrim and Warband is that Warband doesn't just improve the game, it builds a new one.\n\nYou can play dozens upon hundreds of mods that put you in evocative settings in varying degrees of immersiveness. I suggest the A clash of Kings, 1257 Anno Domini and Gekokujo. They are easy to download, simple to play, and bring a level of dynamicism to the game that isn't like any other game out there. Warband isn't just a single game, it's a collection of games all based around a single engine and dynamics. You can guaranteed never get bored. Of course, there is the infamously hard multiplayer. The reason why you probably get rekt is because all of them got rekt. It is your baptism of fire. You learn to anticipate your enemies strikes, read his feints and his movements, find an appropriate move to take him out. Other than that, the community as i mentioned before is one of the kindest around. I have met most of the friends on my steam list via Warband.\n\nWarband is the stirling example that you can't judge a book by it's covers. I currently have over 350 hours invested in it and I don't plan stopping any time soon. Singleplayer gives you a satisfaction, a thirst for world-conquering but in a way unseen in any other game before it. Multiplayer can be brutal, but spending some hours of your day just training in duel servers will pay off in the long term, believe me. There are also Roleplay mods on Napoleonic Wars.\n\nA sequel is in the making and won't be released any time soon. Until then, enjoy this gem. If the price is too expensive for you, it's understandable, but if it's on sale, there is NO reason why you shouldn't buy it.","May 30, 2015","true","589.5"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","46","50","12","6"

Start your own warband in a medival world and emerge as a glorious leader, lord, king, bandit, trader...you name it.\nChoose your destiny amongst 6 unique factions each of them with their own mentality and troops, or assemble a mighty army from all realms, be a trader or mercenary to a faction or become vassal to a King or even become a King yourself - choices are nigh infinite. You can replay this game an infinite amount of times with different settings and it will remain interesting, and on top of that you can modify certain aspects of the game or go for one of the many mods out there ranging from all kinds epoches and additions (i must admit that M&B 1 fares a little better what regards the amount and quality of mods released).\nThere are some downers:\nYou will experience clipping and other graphic absurdities every now and then, it is not perfect.\nThe AI is a bit dumb-witted at times, in terms of field movements and tactical behaviour - the latter does not really exist actually, it is just troops spawning running towards one another and starting to beat each other up, it is up to you to be better than them.\nThere is a saying that "a lot of good work is lost over the lack of a little more", this is found to be true here as the grid for many diplomatic and military game options is actually present - it is just not used well by the vanilla game and left for modders to patch up.\nThe modders in turn often work on their own vision of how the game should be but then lacking the manpower to achieve their conveyed goals.\nGood examples for this might be the "Sword of Damocles"-Series which is wonderful yet stricken with bugs on M&B 1, and in a seemingly eternal unfinished-we-are-working-on-it-but-play-this-in-the-meantime process on M&B:Warband.\nTaleworld wanted to encourage modding for this game, but failed to provide an easily accessible scripting interface for modders to work with. This results in a game that is never 100% satisfying in vanilla, and a bunch of mods that aim to provide that satisfaction but fail half-way due to lack of manpower.\n\nNevertheless i must say i enjoy this game tremendously glad i bought it (M&B Package) as it offers a completly different feel of gaming compared to most more action-oriented games these days. No big explosions or noisy shooting and blurred vision and other mess, just a nice game with nice and sometimes funny NPCs and an eye for the neat things in life as well as a semi-realistic view on what life and war in medival ages might have been like.\n8/10","October 23, 2014","true","118.2"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","8"

This is a tale of victory, of betrayal, of revenge, and of consequence.\n\nI was but a simple lord with a simple goal. To make the Kingdom of the Nords the most powerful kingdom Caldaria had ever seen. I fought alongside my king and fellow lords as equals on the battlefields, and many a heroic battle was fought and won. I asked for very little, but my own slew of personal conquests saw fit to reward me with personal lands. I accepted these fiefs with grace, and invested all of my time, money, and effort into making sure my villages prospered and were safe from enemy attacks.\n\nAnd that's when it all went bad.\n\nIt was a day, much like any other day. I was scouting around my castle for enemy lords who would dare assault me. That's when my weekly budget came in. I gave it a quick glance, and almost tossed it aside when I noticed some error; a village was missing. For a moment, I was confused. Had my messenger tower failed, and my village been raided without my knowledge? No, that cannot be, the village would still be listed. Bewildered, I investigated the cause of this discrepancy on the world map, and noticed that the castle to which my village belonged to was no longer allied to the Nords, but the Rhodoks. How could this be? We were not at war with them at the time, so how did this happen? As I investigated further, I found the cause of my problems.\n\nJarl Gearth. Or, as he is now known, 'Count' Gearth.\n\nThis weaselly dastard has always rubbed me the wrong way, and now all my suspicions had paid off in a most unfortunate manner. He had defected from the Kingdom of the Nords and allied himself with the Rhodoks. With him, he took all the castles he had owned, and with the castles went their adjoining villages. As such, Tadsamesh now belonged to the Rhodoks, and along with it, all my effort. It seemed to me, as a lord who was bound by honor, that there was only one course of action.\n\nLong story short, I murdered Gearth's army and he's currently sitting in my dungeon. 10/10, gonna go take his castle now too, screw whatever peace treaty we had.","January 8","true","167.3"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","88","51","58","36","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/48700/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE:This will include my review of the first Mount & Blade game and the stand-alone expansion Warband as they are basically the same game with added features.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Mount & Blade is the type of game you probably won't see being advertised on TV or on popular internet websites. It's one of those titles who's popularity is mainly spread by word of mouth and by player recommendations based on the game's merits.\n\nReleased back in 2008, developed by TaleWorlds Game and published by Paradox Interactive (known usually for grand strategy games), Mount & Blade is a very unique title who combines the freedom of Sandbox RPGs, the action of First and Third-Person combat, with the micromanagement of Strategy and Simulation games.\n\nPROS:+ Innovative Combat Mechanic: -First-Person / Third-Person Medieval Combat action. This was the first game to introduce me on proper directional attack combat. Mouse directionality will dictate how effective your strikes will be and mastering it will require a lot of practice, especially during mounted combat.\n\n+ YOUR OWN ADVENTURE: -The player is free to make his own adventure. The world is as OPEN as it can get. From a lowly nameless adventurer, fight to be a great Lord, a great General, Mercenary, Bandit, Merchant, Soldier, King or any combination thereof...\n\n+ Your own ARMY (or Warband): -This game provides the closest experience on the thrill of commanding an army in a game. Train your peasants to be the most elite of soldiers until every Lord in the realm seeks your services.\n\n+ Companion System: -You can hire peasants and train them to deadly warriors, but you also encounter additional 'companions' during your self made adventure. At first I thought these were just beefed up AI soldiers with special names but was pleasantly surprised that each character had their own personalities and their own traits. They fight against each other over petty arguments and tend to either approve or disapprove of your decisions as the leader.\n\n+ Very Active and Dedicated Modding Community: The modding community, along with support from the developers, vastly improves the game's overall quality, not just in graphics, but also in other aspects such as sounds, music, game mechanic, world design or even a whole new theme (LOTR, Game of Thrones, etc.). Installing a mod for this game is highly recommended.\n\nCONS:- Art Design (Graphics, Sounds, etc.): -Lets be honest...looking at the screenshots will say this is not the most graphically advanced game out there. Animation, lighting, sound, music and character models are acceptable at best. (Mods improves this a lot.)\n\n- Needs a bit more NPC: -Aside from enemies, the friendly or neutral NPCs that you encounter are not as extensive as I would have hoped. The Cities seem rather small with very minimal activity from the citizens which makes some of the towns and castles a bit 'empty'. Would be nice to have more populated towns where you can get more side quest and requests for help.\n\n- No Advance battle-planning: -The game randomly chooses which troops you are deployed with. This is without the benefit of pre-deployment formations. Although the player can quickly rally his troops in a solid battle formation before the enemy closes in, the inclusion of a pre-battle strategy or deployment would have helped a lot.\n\n- Siege Battle is weak: -Most of the castles or towns will only have one pre-determined breach on the wall or a ladder that was already set up for you. I would personally like it if I were able to deploy siege weapons on my own and deploy them where I want them instead of being forced down a bottleneck.\n\n- Diplomacy and Political Intrigue is a bit shallow: -Aside from the squabble of the Lords and Ladies in the courts, there's not much going on around the political aspect of the game.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but for a niche market. The word 'Innovation' has been constantly used lately that it almost lost its meaning, but here we have Mount & Blade, a game which truly tried, and succeeded, in making a new, fun, immersive and enjoyable experience. MUST BUY for STRATEGY GAMERS who also happen to like RPG games.\n\nIf you're the type of gamer who claims to value gameplay over graphics, then here is a game that will test that assertion.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Travelling from Norwegian village to village, I bought and sold enough trade goods to secure passage to Edinburgh and recruited a small Warband of Viking peasants.\n\nWorking as a Mercenary for the Norse run puppet-state of Northymbre, I cleared the lands of Bandits and helped to defeat the Scottish clan of the Alt Clut.\n\nSelling all my loot, recruiting more Vikings and training them for 3 months gave me the money to buy 3 Karvi ships from various ports.\n\nEnding my contract with Northymbre, I became an armed sea-bound trader, buying wool from Scotland, wine from Frisia and furs, iron, timber and tar from Norway.\n\nHaving saved enough gold to have a mighty Busse Longboat built in Bebbanburgh, I sailed for Ireland, again to take up the life of a mercenary with the Laithlind Norse.\n\nThe Irish Clans proved worthy foes, Dublin was under almost constant seige. Konungr Gudrod Ragnarson proved a terrible warleader and a selfish King. So I hatched a plan.\n\nBuilding my relations with the Laithlind Lords and spreading vicious rumours in the taverns took two years, as well as sending my companions away to spread the word of my prowess.\n\nThe Irish Clan of Mide had captured Gudrod and my Mercenary Contract had expired, the time was right. Sailing from the Orkney Isles to the Isle of Man, I turned the Lords of Laithlind to my cause and founded the Kingdom of Lochlann.\n\nGudrod escaped his prison and returned to Dublin, just in time to see it fall to my new forces.

I have only played over a 1000 hours yet i know people who have hit over 5000.\n\nThe native/vanilla version of this game is really great.  You are in a medieval world where the possibilities are endless, you may serve a kingdom or become king yourself.  Starting with you and a few dollar you can build a huge army and form an empire.  You charge into battle with your men, its like watching a movie wher to huge armies just clash into each other and cut each other to pieces, but as this game is a sandbox it is DLC and mods that make Mount & Blade: Warband a true adventure\n\nThis game is amazing, great for those people who love roleplay, a good combat system and a great modding community.  This is especially made with the DLC Napoleonic Wars, which includes awesome historically accurate uniforms and weapons and have great events called "Line Battles", in which player join clans/regiments and recreate what a battle may have looked like in the early 1800s with huge lines of infantry with drummers and fifers beatting with flags flying and officers commanding, while in the distance artillery batteries will be mowing down infantry and cavalry carving up the kills.\n\nThe modding is amazing, especially with the Persistent World mod and ones similar to that, with some of the greatest roleplaying i have experienced!  There are also mods which will change the native medieval world into say Westeros for example or Medieval Europe,  or even America during the civil war.  The possibilities are endless with this game and i believe it deserves more recognition.\n\nOverall i'd say this is an amazing game with great possibilities, and i'm just waiting for the next Mount & Blade installment, Bannerlord. You will notice Warband has dated graphics, but to be honest when you get into the gameit doesnt bother yoy what so ever.\n\nGet this game u won't regret it!\n\n10/10","October 12, 2014","true","414.1"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","2"

You are able to learn sword fighting as you learn to write. To start with you force the moves and they are often rough and not very good compared to someone with more experience, yet with time it becomes instinct. You are able to execute complicated feints without even thinking about it.\n\nIn Multiplayer the game has two real competitive scenes. Dueling and Battle.\nBattle tournaments such as: WNL and NC bring hundreds of amazing players together to compete for the title of either, for NC, winning country or, for WNL, winning team. WNL mixes players from various countries together and creates a great competition. The NC allows players to feel pride for their country as they represent it on a global stage.\nDueling tournaments allow players to fight as they would never be able to in a battle; some of the unique and complicated feints that people develop can leave you amazed and attempting to figure out how they do it and create your own version. Duels between top players can last minutes, although not often as trying to perform fluent feints whilst also watching for spam and then trying to block instantly after often wears you down quickly.\n\nPeople tell me that Counter Strike requires more skill, and is more difficult to play. I have never played it so I cannot give a definitive opinion but I struggle to believe it. In Mount and Blade you can always get better, and everyone has their own fighting style. Everytime you fight someone they will have their own style that you will have to learn and work around in order to defeat them. This is less true in Battles, as sword and shield fighting at a high level requires that you do certain things in order to win, and far more involves angles and A LOT faster reactions. In a sword and shield fight (If both players are top standard and have the right angles) swings can be many times faster than they would otherwise be and you have to be able to react in less than a second in order to block the swings.\nHowever in dueling, EVERY single person has their own different fighting style. Some people you will find have similar styles, but never ever the same. Different people have different patterns of feinting and swinging, you learn these as you fight them. When you first start being able to compete against duelists of a higher standard, you will find you have to consciously (whilst fighting) note how they are fighting and how much they feint/chamber/spam/kick (being the four main techniques). Once you start matching top duelists you will sub-consciously start absorbing this information.\n\nYou can get an enormous sense of achievement from this game. When you join a clan (You kinda have to in order to get good faster, as you are able to fight regularly with other players whose styles you are familiar with) you will often either be one of the worst or perhaps average in comparison to the other members. When you defeat the best fighter, then start regularly beating him until becoming the best, that is when you get the sense of achievement. (Bare in mind this will probably have taken months of tryng).\n\nThis game has so much to offer, yet has so few players for the potential it has. You genuinally learn to sword fight in the game, as you would in real life. At the start you can do nothing, you find yourself constantly being killed by superior players, but then when you revisit that server in a months time and find yourself far better than those players? That is when you truly start enjoying the game.\n\n100% recommended for players looking for an experience that will suck them in and keep them hooked for years, but only if you have the time and commitment to put 1000s of hours in, learning to block, different feints, to chamber, to kick, when to spam and all the other angles/tricks there are in the game.","December 22, 2014","true","007.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","2"

The gameplay is fun, there's action literally everywhere you go. The battles are intense, and not too long but not too short. It is difficult for your first time. You might get frustrated and quit. Yet, there's this unknown lure bringing you right back to get destroyed once again. In addition to this, the game has great mods. Tons of them, too. A lot of them actually make the gameplay better.\n\nThe graphics are slightly outdated, but the game is still playable. This isn't even an issue, as I think they might've done it on purpose to increase the amount of people who can play it. Whatever the case may be, the graphics really don't matter enough here for people to turn away from the game.\n\nReliability loses a point because multiple people have reported crashing when you alt-tab. Switching out of the game and back in safely is important to quite a few people, so I think this is something that should be addressed by the developers. Besides that, I haven't actually crashed or encountered any bugs at all yet, so again, I didn't factor this one in either.\n\nThe game has an excellent replay value. There is about a million different ways to play the game. I'm not kidding, either. It would be too much for me to explain here. See for yourself! There are also, as mentioned above, many mods to pick and choose from, increasing this value even more.\n\nMultiplayer. I haven't actually played it yet, but I have quite a few friends who play this that have reported that it is amazing. I can only assume it receives a 10 as well.\n\nFor the length of the game, it can really go for as short as you'd like, to as long as you want. Start out a serf, fight a couple battles, then retire? Go ahead. Want to play a 1,000 hour marathon of the game where you slowly conquer the entire land? Probably possible, maybe with the help of mods. I don't know if the game would even still be stable beyond that point, or perhaps there would be nothing left to conquer, but really I shouldn't be expecting more than this.\n\nBut yeah, if you fancy an actual medieval simulator, or perhaps a really fun game, get this one. It is worth it.","October 30, 2014","true","46.5"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","38","49","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SOHOCF/recommended/48700/","SOHOCF","Cold Fushion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SOHOCF/","34 products in account","Mount and Blade: Warband and all of the its expansions and mods has brought me some of the most enjoying moments I have ever had in a videogame. From the brutal medieval battles of class Warband to the 19th century warfare that is Napoleonic Wars, the game never failed to keep me coming back to the battlegrounds for more. This is mostly due to its easy to learn, but hard to master combat system, and its various game modes, factions, classes, and maps. There are six different factions: Swadia, Nords, Sarranid Sultanate, Khergit Khanate, Rhodoks, and Vaegirs. Each faction specializes in their own respective areas. Swadia have very strong heavy cavalry, Nords specialize in having the strongest infantry with the best shields and massive two handed axes that cut through enemy shields and armor like butter. The Sarranid Sultanate is a nice blend of both cavalry and light archers, the Khergit Khanate are the only faction to be affective with horse archers which can be a nightmare to fight if they aren’t approached properly. Rhodoks are renowned for their sharp spearmen and crossbows and the Vaegirs are master archers with pinpoint accuracy even at the greatest distances. The three different classes offer many tactical options and deciding what you yourself want to specialize in along with the rest of your party can be quite thought provoking at times.\nSingle player is a pure joy to play through and being that it is an open world RPG sandbox that you can play around in, you will find that there is a ton of replay value here. Whether it’s the level up system that can be quite overwhelming at first, the pros and cons of the different factions, or the people you meet along the way and the relationships that you form with them, you will always find a reason to hit that “Start a new game” button and play again, but in a completely different way.\nMultiplayer is also quite in depth and a very dedicated community has formed around it. You will be able to find both casual and competitive players who still play regularly. Multiplayer consists of eight different game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Battle, Capture the Flag, Fight and Destroy, Conquest, Siege, and Duel.\n-Deathmatch has you thrown into immediate chaotic action against other players in an all out brawl where it’s every man and woman for themselves. Actions happen very quickly, damage is high and health is quite low so at any moment anyone could die regardless of how skilled they are. It is a great game mode if you don’t have a lot of time to play, but just want to get in some quick instant action against players of varying skill levels.\n-Team Deathmatch is very similar to Deathmatch in that you are thrown right into the thick of the action with no objective, but to kill the enemy at all costs. The difference here is that you have a team to work with and so does the enemy. Coordination is key here unless you are lucky enough to have a few players on your team that are experienced and can cleave through the enemy players.\n-Battle is similar to Team Deathmatch except for the fact that in battle you only get one life per round which adds great tension to each round individually. At first having one life per round can be quite frustrating especially when you’re one of the first people to die before any of the main fighting begins, but overtime you will more than likely grow to like this one life based game mode as it makes you play more carefully and tactfully than you would in Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch.\n-Capture the Flag is quite standard, it’s the same as any other Capture the Flag really. You and the enemy team each have your own flags and your goal is to retrieve their flag and bring it back to your base without letting them get yours. Short, sweet and to the point.\n-Fight and Destroy has two teams put against each other, one faction will be tasked with defending valuable objectives while the other team attacks those objectives in an attempt to destroy them.\n-Conquest is a real test of a team’s ability to work as a unit. In this game mode each team has to capture and hold key points on the map for a set amount of time while they fight it out with a limited number of lives.\n-Siege is the ultimate test of a team’s tactical capabilities on the battlefield. This is easily the most difficult game mode when there are 60+ players on a siege server. One team plays as the defenders who attempt to hold a keep of massive proportions, while the other team plays as the attackers who raid the castle to try and capture it within a set period of time. It is easily the most brutal, bloody, nonsensical and downright gritty game mode that Mount and Blade Warband has to offer. Players of all skill levels participate in sieges and even if one team has veterans it will not guarantee them victory, because there is greater strength in numbers and coordination than one elite player going solo and killing as many people as he can. This game mode comes down to pure team work and pushing enemy fortifications in the right way as the attackers and defending those fortifications as the defenders. Often times classes play a major role in this game mode as every class has its own role to fulfill. For defense inept archers can generally mean instant spelled defeat if their infantry are not solid and. For offense having poor infantry who don’t do coordinated pushes as a group will also end up losing more than half the time. As attackers Siege has the many factors and rules that come into play with how you need to approach the enemy fortress to win and if you don’t follow said parameters then you’re going to die. . . A lot. Overall though it is still my 2nd favorite game mode and I have spent a great deal of time playing it with friends and flying solo from time to time.\n-Duel is in my opinion the most personal and most in depth game mode that Mount and Blade Warband has to offer and I quite frankly find it to be the best. In duel you fight another player in a one on one fight with any weapon of your choice and any class of your choice, but typically it’s infantry with a one-handed weapon, two-handed weapon or a polearm with no shield. Whether you are dueling for honor, fun, or just to win, duel has something to offer for every player in the game. It is also the best game mode for learning about how melee combat works. At the time of this review the majority of my playtime in the game has been on duel and it still has yet to disappoint me to the point where I don’t want to play it. At a high level of play duel is the most fast paced and reaction based part of the game. The margin for error is minimal and one mistake often leads to death especially when using the two-handed Great Sword, which is the preferred weapon of choice in duel. Dueling is a progression through the game’s melee combat. You will first run around like an idiot as you try to figure out how somebody who is experienced at the game keeps killing you in a few seconds without you getting a chance to even swing, but overtime you will begin to understand exactly how the game’s mechanics work. First you will learn to recognize visual cues from your opponent and then you will learn to block. Once through that stage you will learn to feint and how to attack properly without leaving yourself completely open. Then you will learn about footwork, different feinting methods, chambering and several other aspects of the game’s melee combat and if you’re lucky you will find a mentor to help you learn it all.\nAt its core the game is brutal and unforgiving at the worst of times and at the best of times it can be the most rewarding game on the planet.","May 20","true","388.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","1"

For better or for worse, lets start with this 'Good' game.\n\nThe single player for the main game, being the Native module you will get upon buying the game, is very unique in its own way. It's your 'Build an army and go destroy some castles' type of game where you recruit men from villages, earn money from different factions and eventually grow your army into a very powerful force that will make the AI run away. Literally. Earning money is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game but it pays off when you buy your new armour, weapons and earn skill points to level up your character from being a weak nobody to a power house axe throwing, taking 1000 arrows to the face character.  Now for this single player, you need to understand that you CANT care about the world. Why? Because the world don give no ♥♥♥♥♥ fo' you. You can get your ♥♥♥♥♥ kicked, your armies destroyed, castles taken, everything that you have can be taken away and murdered before your very eyes! Combat is driven between three classes but are not limited to Archer, Footman and Cavalry. You can mix it up I dont care, just as long as you know what your limits are then you're fine.\n\nWithin the single player, you will meet 6 different factions with different classes and environments. Its your choice on which one you can side and help take over the entire country or state...I'm not exactly sure if Calradia is a country or a state or if its even part of something else. Eh don't look at me that way, I didn't play the game for thousands of hours. Heh. ._. Its either that or be a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone you meet ever and kill everyone you meet ever for the gold. Raid villages, caravans, castles, cities you name it, if its there you can take it.\n\nI won't spoil the single player or did I? Eh, maybe I did.\n\nMultiplayer is a dream. (Pfft) I won't sugar coat it, you will find so many morons in this game including the DLC, but sure every game has it's idiots in their communities but here, its a little bit special. First off if you're not completely new to the game at this point, meaning you can block and not die after the first hit, then you're going to be okay. MP is definetely still around in terms of the mods that you can get, which are very plentiful. I highly recommend getting at least a couple of these mods to fill your time.\n\nThere's probably a lot more I'm missing, like how the community is. BUT you'll find that out if you buy the game right? Buy the game if you like the medieval genre, fighting random people and taking over land that noone asked you or told you to take. Buy this game if you want to be 'enriched' into the online part of the game where clans and events run wild.\n\nWill I play with you? Lol no, I'm done with this game you can have it. Here take it. Come back to me in 2-3 years and tell me you like this game. If you do, well great. If you find out what I was *Hinting* at then good for you. :P\n\n10/10 best game\n\nReal score 7/10.\n\n'It was okay' ~ Rival","June 10, 2015","true","000.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","24","26","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chucklesnchestnuts/recommended/48700/","chucklesnchestnuts","chuckles n chestnuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chucklesnchestnuts/","81 products in account","This game…..This game is truly one of a kind in overall presentation and style.  Yes there are some games like Mount and Blade but nothing comes quite close to Mount and Blade (or MB for short), or at least none that I know of.  It is too bad I got into this game seemingly towards the end of its popularity lifespan in the multiplayer stage as Bannerlord is soon to be released and I have a notion this game will be not forgotten, but much less frequented once it does.   Let me first say that Mount and Blade does multiplayer VERY well…very well…  Taleworlds got the formula down for simulated ‘sword and shield’ combat on a quasi-ARMA/Total War series style map very well (some of you may or may not agree with that analogy).  The mechanics in this game are second to none in terms of uniqueness and originality.  But be warned…The learning curve for multiplayer is very steep, but very fun and rewarding once you get ‘kind of’ good ( some of you may know what I mean by getting at least ‘kind of’ good in multiplayer).  And in addition, the multiplayer may be highly addictive once you get into it, it is that good!\n\nThe singleplayer gameplay is very nice too, think of the Total War series meets FPS/RPG with a 3rd person perspective ARMA medieval style twist, although kind of generic in terms of overall execution and ‘diplomacy’, but don’t let that deter you this is quite an experience the first, second, and maybe even third or fourth (or even more) time(s) around.  The overall style of this game is something to be remembered for a long time if not forever.\n\nAnd lastly, the character face editor ooh boy, the character editor is something of a beautiful novelty.  Some of the custom faces you’ll see in multiplayer are downright hilarious!  The custom face poser is possibly the worst/best thing I’ve ever seen done this way!  NO GAME has done face poser quite like MB….no game!\n\nBelow is my list of pro/cons:\n\nPros:\n\n-Multiplayer is like no other and the custom faces and characters add a lot of individuality to it.\n\n-face poser (hilarious mechanic…you should see other players faces in multiplayer laughing is half the enjoyment in some aspects!).\n\n-Single player is also like no other in terms of overall execution and style.\n\n-difficult and unique, but very fun and rewarding realistic style ‘sword and shield’ melee combat as well as archery and various thrown weapons you would expect from the medieval period this game seems to be roughly based around in terms of time and technology.\n\n-many, many different character builds, weapons, and a good mix of factions to choose from ( factions seem to represent the middle ages in  Western Europe, Eastern Europe/Russia, Asia, Middle East, and ‘Scandinavia’ pretty well, albeit in a generic fashion).\n\n-Endless options for character customization and playstyle builds.\n\n-The campaign is very much at ‘your own pace’ it’s basically a big sandbox with various things to accomplish and do…all at your own pace and choosing, do whatever you want, however you want adding to the games originality.\n\nCons:\n\n-The diplomacy in the singleplayer game can seem very across the board generic at times.\n\n-There are some fairly minor bugs in both MP and SP where you will get ‘code errors’ (like option to host a feast at your castle once you become married to one of the vassals’ relatives).\n\n-The swing mechanic and combat whilst very good and very intuitive can be very hard and confusing to learn at first to some.\n\n-Some of the SP factions seem to be overpowering at times (Nords, Swadia), although this is arguable.\n\nMy rating breakdown:\n\n-.05 minor bugs that can be annoying to some\n\n-.05 sometimes seemingly unbalanced factions and generic diplomacy with somewhat scant options in terms of directives\n\nMy final rating is 9/10 (1.00 = 10 = 9/10)\n\nI highly recommend this game to you if you like sword and shield style melee combat and, if you like the middle-ages time frame, pick up this novelty!","April 10","true","504.8"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","21","21","4","3"

However, this isn't the case for this game, every nickle I spent was spent wisely on this game, The only thing I've wasted is my time, which is worth a lot more than any paycheck. The singleplayer is good and there are many modders who spend a lot of time on modding so people like me can take advantage of their magnificent creations. A few campaign mods I like(there's many more amazing ones though) are Prophesy of Pendor, Blood and Steel, Floris etc. etc.\nThen there´s the multiplayer, a big difference between this and the campaign is you actually need to block and don't take an infinite number of hits before being"knocked unconscious". Most multiplayer players  know what they are doing but if you want to annoy these no-lifers effectively, aside from teamkilling and delaying, which take no skill, you will have to take the time to learn this arcane art called "melee", (archery is ♥♥♥♥ xd). BUT THEN YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SPEND TIME TO LEARN THAT ♥♥♥♥ AND THE CAMPING ARCHERS AND THE BACKSTABBING INFANTRY AND THE SNEAKY ♥♥♥♥ING CAVALRY STILL KILL YOU.\nThere are some cool multiplayer native mods as well such as Mercenaries(no life=cash) and Persistent World(no life=cash+ RDM).\nNow we arrived at Napoleonic Wars, this game's only worthy DLC. In the beginning this DLC's melee is probably even harder even though there are only 2 block and attack directions most of the time. A good server for beginners is the Groupfighting_Server, after that Killbox and when you're really getting the hang of joining servers and selecting a nation, perhaps even Jailbreak. That said, this mod can be fun but its community can be spooky, so watch out. A really nice mod for this DLC is North and South. Also L'aigle seems to be a good SP mod. Yeah and there are regiments so watch out for those, most of them are Nigerian scammers trying to get you in their army.\nSo even though my opinion might seem vague, I would recommend all of you to buy this game with Napoleonic wars or something but don't get Viking Conquest, it seems ♥♥♥♥ xd.\n\nOverall this is the best game I have every played, together with Neverwinter Nights and The Battle for Middle Earth.\n\n-Melsyo(KIT FISTO)","August 22, 2015","true","630.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","26","31","8","4"

It has a compelling brand of open-world RPG, character story development, sandbox simulation, and strategy aspect that is unlike anything in the market since that classic Darklands, and nothing else since has really come close.  If the idea of play a captain - or king or queen! - of your own medieval empire appeals to you, or even just living amongst it, you owe it to yourself to give Mount & Blade: Warband a look.\n\nRead the full review here: https://www.highlandarrow.com/reviews/165-mount-blade-warband.html","November 27, 2014","true","548.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

They say that time flies when you're having fun, and I couldn't agree more.\n\nThe game takes place in Calradia, and there's a ton of factions that you can join. (Swadia ftw!) The objective is to conquer Calradia by taking castles from the enemy. You can either aid a faction in conquering Calradia, help a claimant conquer Calradia, or you can make your own faction and conquer Calradia! On your path to the throne, you'll have to build your own army from the scratch by recruiting peasants, and upgrading them as you progress.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, nor the worst, but you really learn to play with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/48700/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I bought a CD-version of this game when I was vacationing in the Philippines, and it helped me absolutely destroy any jetlag - I played it for probably 10 hours straight (until 9am), then went on with my day with circadian rhythms now synchronized. I fell in love with this game so hard. The M&B series easily fits into my list of most favorite games ever.\n\nIf you like open-world RPGs, army/inventory/unit/territory management, tiny-to-massive scale battles, and mod potential, then you will absolutely love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good - nothing too crazy or graphic-intensive. There is a lot of detail in the different weapons, armor pieces, and unit types. At the end of the battle, you will most likely be covered in blood if you like to jump into the thick of things with a melee weapon. The music and sounds are amazing - there is nothing quite like hearing arrows soaring over and past you.\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with, however, for a real challenge, I suggest you switch blocking and attacking to manual. If you do this, you will block and attack in the direction you move your mouse (this is essential for the game to calculate proper hit windows). It is totally possible to die from repeatedly blocking incorrectly, and this adds to the intensity of every battle, be it a 10-man battle or a 300 full-scale massacre. You can also select how many units are allowed to appear on the field at a time. The game gives very good feedback on the difficult % depending on the options you select, so you can better tailor your play experience to suit your tastes. The beginning missions provide a nice and helpful tutorial. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - once you have a large enough army, you can take over castles and/or towns. Once this happens, you must then consider territory management, keeping a garrison to defend your lands while you are away.\n\nThe character customization is pretty expansive, and there are a multiude of skills for you to select from. You can specialize in bow & arrow, polearms, sword & shield, horseback riding, commerce, etc. To help strengthen the areas you are lacking in, you may hire bodyguards - their applicable skills will be added to a "party pool," which can boost the effectiveness of your army considerably.\n\nThe open-world gameplay is spectacular! You can side with the different factions vying for conrol of the land. If that doesn't suit you, you can even help different individuals with claims to the throne (each faction has one such person). Doing this will result in the claimant becoming the new faction leader (if you manage to succeed). If you are feeling particularly suicidal, you can even try to leave your own mark on the land by taking over a territory for yourself, however, this is extremely difficult if you do not have allies to call on.\n\nAs you play, you gain reputation, and this will cause faction leaders to seek you out for recruitment as a lord (allowing you to be granted territories if you join them). You may build different sttructures (ex: granary, watchtower, prison) that provide different bonuses, but these usually take an extremely long time to complete. Reputation, among other things, also contributes to the maximum party/army size you are allowed to field.\n\nThe battles are vicious, especially if you can handle increasing the difficulty to the higher end. Fighting an intense 6 vs. 12 battle (in the enemy's favor) can feel so rewarding when you loot the bodies after - the amount of loot recovered is influenced by your "loot" skill, so many items can be lost if you do not invest in this (or if you do not have a bodyguard with the skill). Skills like firt aid and wound treatment will boost your army's recovery outside of battle and minimize the amount of your units killed (instead having them knocked unconscious).\n\nWhen you are besieging a castle/town, the enemy can sally forth, forcing you to meet them outside the walls. The very first time you try to take over a territory will be memorable - you will be racing up ladders while arrows hail down upon you. Since garrisons are fairly large, you may find yourself fighting long battles that last several minutes (if not an hour+). The different unit types and equipment allow you to experiment with different army configurations and loadouts. Issuing commands in batttle takes some getting used to, but once you become familiar with it, you will be able to better dominate the field of battle.\n\nWhen fighting on horseback and/or against other mounted units, you can kill the horses to remove their advantage (works well if you are a mounted archer).\n\nYou can try to court noblewomen in order to be accepted into a powerful family. Participating in tournaments allows you to earn reputation and favor with them (and the rest of the realm).\n\nOn the world map, you can see all units within your field of view. You can attack any army, caravan, etc you see - if two parties are in battle, you can usually join and select a side to help (useful for farming experience).\n\nOne of M&W: Warband's best features is the super extensive and powerful mod support. The community provides just about everything - I suggest you check out the Clask of Kings mod, as well as the Floris mod back (adds A LOT of features and graphical updates). There are even mods that add Warhammer 40,000 themes/units, other fantasy overhauls, and many more.\n\nThe entire M&B series is phenomenal, and I strongly suggest you check it out if the open-world war theme interests you.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 16, 2014","true","41.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","2"

Viking Conquest DLC is actually very good now, since most of the bugs and problems have now been fixed, and the environments are quite historically atmospheric.  The new features like hunting, added a lot to the game, along with the brutish level of injuries.\n\nOverall gameplay play mechanics are rock solid.\nFighting is inituitive and natural.\nHorseback riding just feels right.\nVery addictive in the "just one more battle" kind of way.\nYou may start off as a "lowly peasant" but will eventually rise to glory as a "knight and lord" with a lot of work.\n\nThe number of hours I have played offline, does not contstiute online hours.\nHUNDREDS since its original release, maybe well over a 2000?  Very rare for me as I do not play many games anymore as an "old fart" in my 40s.\nThere are even a few really good multiplayer persistent world versions ("Persistent World" comes to mind), but that was not the games original focus.\nLack of voice chat without using Skype or TeamSpeak makes is less entertaining.\nThe only real downside is the threadbare repeated quests.\nThis game is a "choose your own adventure" style make up your story with a creative mind.\nThe other downside in the lack of optimization of the game engine.\nBattles of over 500 soldiers can cause serious FPS issues, especially on sieges.\nMore than 500 causes frame rates start to just become absurd, especially with large amounts of mounted calvary.\nMore than 1000 (at one time) and the game can actually crash even if you have some type of "gaming super computer", as I stated the limitation is the game engine, not necessary your system.\nFortunately, an external program called "Battle Sizer" can make the adjustments you want.\nI generally run battles around 500, as less than 250 soldiers makes LARGE siege and land battles take between 30 minutes and 2 hours with reinforcements and makes formations nearly impossible to control.\n\nRecommendation?\nDownload Anno Domini 1257 AD, Version 1.13 Angry Peasant Edition. (ModDB has the last version that was updated to my knowledge from Dec 2015, it is not on STEAM Workshop).\nJust do it, you will understand the scope of the undertaking.\n\nIt is just massive in terms of scope, decades will pass before you are able to establish a proper faction to contend with many of the largest countries such as England, France, Holy Roman Empire, Crusader States, and the Golden Horde.  Smaller countries generally never stand a chance and get eliminated and aborbed early in the campaign.\n\nIt actually has significant historical accuracy for the time period both with people, places, castles, cities and equipment.  London is an excellent overall representation of the actual city during the period.  "Take a walk around the town", and be prepared to go, "Holy #!$@, I did not know M&B Warband could do that?" There is no magic, elfs, hobbits, dragons, or plate armor here sorry...\nAn incredible amount of depth in areas like the Crusades, Lance Recruitment System, diplomatic relations and alliance management, challenging tournament singular and team battles, army enlistment versus independent action, sea battles, and expanding your manor and fiefs with actual physical improvements you can see and use, they are not just "eye candy".  All in first or third person views including recruiting from your own fiefs and build up your armies from the historical nationalities.  Nations will fall and get eliminated permanently from gameplay.  Lords will defect to your cause if you have high levels of reknown and honor.  Maintaining your armies, feedng, and paying salaries without proper planning leads to disasters and revolts.  Basically, it is like playing Medieval Total War "inside the world".\n\nYour individual combat actions can actually turn the tide of a battle, or even a war, but you are NOT a "one man army".  You will be easily knocked out a battle if you act like a #@!$tard.\nSome mods result in broken equipment, permanent death or crippling injuries.\n\nThis is not "Call of Duty", you do not recover your health with "health packs", and you cannot hide behind a wall and regenerate.  You have what you have, damage is determined by your equipment and skill or complete lack of intelligence, until you rest over time with wound treatment and surgery skills.\n\nChoose your individual actions and battles wisely or you will have more than you can handle and will "fall and never get up again".\nChoose your alliances carefully as well, as the more factions you have as enemies the more difficult you will be able to maintain your kingdom and crown.\n\nJust think of it as an earlier version of Chivalry or War of the Roses without the full mutiplayer and many less fruitcake player jack wagons.\n\nLet me me know when you score your first perfect headshot with a mongol bow at 100 meters on horseback at full gallop, it is an art and takes practice and high levels of skill.  You don't need a guide.  You will master it with time and go "HUZZAH!"","April 16","true","318.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","3"

At the beginning, you are mostly limited to skirmishing with small packs of bandits for minor loot and gear to better equip your nascent warband, but as your renown and reputation grows, you are able to recruit larger numbers of warriors and pledge yourself as a vassal to a noble lord. With this newfound status comes responsibilities, and you will from time to time be asked to contribute a war party to a campaign against one of the other factions in the game.\n\nProving yourself to be a loyal subject and a capable warrior / leader will bring you to the attention of the leader of your chosen faction, and with it, opportunities to become a lord yourself, with lands granted to you that will provide you with a source of income to maintain your army with. The overall design of the game lends itself to a very Games of Thrones-esian feel, and at some point, you may feel powerful enough to contest for the throne of your faction, have you own vassals, or even try to unite all of Calradia under your banner.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go, this game is solidly an RPG (unlike Medieval Total War, which this game has some similarities to), with both an inventory and stats system for your main character and companions. Combat-oriented stats for each weapon type are raised both by leveling up, as well as through usage in combat.\n\nMain knocks against the game are somewhat janky animations and poorly executed autoterrain generation system.","July 13, 2014","true","143.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

I have gladly dumped over 500 hours in this game and about 200 in the other games, I had another account on steam but I lost it's password, therefore I happily repurchased the Mount&Blade Collection.\n\nTo summarize this game in a few words this game would be : Death, Medieval Times, humongous battles ranging from 2 to 200 men, if you use mods it can reach to 500 men battles, Different Culture Castles, Sieges, Best Combat System and Amusing Horse Deaths.\n\nAlright, now that I've sed all that You can probably picture what Epicness awaits you after you purchase this masterpiece!\n\nAs you start the game you get the Generic RPG choise, a man or a woman, but chose wisely because the Mount&Blade world takes place in a sexist environment, If you choose to be a female character, if you decide to become a vassal of a king you will not be awarded the Fief you would receive if you were a man, and the Lords treat you like a fragile being when you meet them before Battle and can sometimes insult you! But you can get them back with a Mighty Blow to the ♥♥♥♥ :D\n\nYou Start alone on your journey with your goals and reasons, and as you go along the way you recruit men, who will follow you to the depths of hell if you so decide to visit that nice place ;D. You can ally yourself to a king and destroy all of his opponents or Make a faction of your own and Blow them all to hell like I did once.\n\nYou can take part in feasts, tournaments, votations, marriages, Duels for a lady's honour among other things, My favourite Hobby is to Run down peasants with my knights.\nAs your men gain experience you get to level them up to more powerful medieval forces, From A peasant with a stick to an Epic Knight, there are several factions with lots of different units each faction has they're weaknesses and strengths. You get to Destroy and burn villages to the ground and capture castles and Cities if you are mighty enough.\n\nBut the best part by far is the Multiplayer, I have met loads of fun people and... The conversations we had XD\nEvery time you go on a multiplayer server you'll get to experience the chat, I'll give you examples of the best ones I've seen:\nTalking about Indian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and how they are all dirty, The meaning of life is indian ♥♥♥♥, The Prostitution set ups, Putin being the One true ruler of the world among other fun topics.. ;)\n\nYou can play with up to 200 people in multiplayer, The fun is infinite! The endless volley's of arrows flying down on you and your men is something you will always remember ;D\n\nThere is an expansion called " Napoleonic Wars" It is worth getting, adds a whole lot more to the game, and it's like a boat simulator XD but with guns, Boarding ships and Hilarious fights.\n\nIf you had the patience to read all that, I salute you and I will personally Give you weed from my personal stash and some medals.\n\nGet it Now!!!","July 8, 2014","true","534.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","5"

Then I spent a good time talking to other Counts of King Harlaus, gaining favor among half of them. I then renounced my oath to the King for he was a weak king, at this point my army took over the last castle of the Rhodoks, wiping out their pathetic kingdom. I then convinced half of the Counts sworn to King Harlaus to join my new Empire, The Empire of the Stag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/svirt/recommended/48700/","svirt","Svirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/svirt/","618 products in account","This game brings you to the medieval world since 1257, where you start as a regular traveler of that times. You can choose what was your past and that affects your atributes, if you are good leader, fighter, trader, pathfinder, hunter, etc., but you can change and improve your skills in every way as you are getting more experienced (leveling up). Your target is simple, become the emperor of whole realm and rule all the towns, villages and castles in it. The way to it is really hard, you must fight and lead, rob peasant / villages or earn money or collect taxes and offer various food to soldiers to hold your army strong and keep morale high. You have to get known through the realm and get praise of the lords to becoming one of them and then taking the throne. There is also the option to declare your own faction, but to do that is really not a piece of cake. The game is very complex, seems like a strategy, but all battles you are fighting you can fight yourself. Take your bow, sword, spear, crossbow or axe and battle on the fields, siege the castles and conquer them or disguise yourself and fight the defenders from the inside. Quests in the game are changing and have some short backstories, not long and deep, but various kinds (like deliver messsage, kill someone, plunder a village and so on) and the only their purpose is to improve relations with the lords, which can get you what you want.\n\nThere are some things I would critizise. Firstly is the one most disturbing in the singleplayer campain and that is the speed of the game, seems to me too slow, like getting new recruits for example. Other thing is I feel like half of the gameplay I am searching for lords whom I need to find (because of quests or other duties) seems endless, all that running around the map to find them and the last thing is untransparency of many details in game. There are some mods which can change these aspect, but its not in the original settings.\n\nI think this game when you get into it can be fun for hundreds of hours nevertheless my personal rating is influenced by many aspects and I think 7.5 is suitable. This is review only for the basic game.\n\n7.5 /10\n\nShort illustration\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uDuQa_uX5w","February 16, 2015","true","33.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","7"

Mount and Blade: Warband is an interesting combination of strategy and boots on the ground combat in its single-player campaign.  Its depth in multiplayer combat is unparalleled by any other game to date.  When first viewing this game, you may ask why a game that isn't very old has Morrowind-esque graphics, but once you see past how atrociously ugly the vanilla game is, you can start really enjoying it.  The game itself is more of a template for modding than a game, as the module system allows for the easy installation and playing of many mods, which you can seamlessly switch between.  If you can't get over the graphics than wait for Bannerlord, the next installment of the Mount and Blade series that everyone is currently creaming themselves over, but don't expect it to come out any time soon.","May 2, 2014","true","457.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

You then start roaming around the world of Calradia, you will own nothing but the clothes on you, and your weapons, you can then slowly start raising an army and aspire to become a sworn vassal of a king, or even take castles for yourself and claim for the right of Calradia yourself!\n\nAnother great feature added to this sequel, is the multiplayer mode, you can now play online in with fellow players in several different game modes, including Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch and many others. Apart from multiplayer, the game also includes a custom battle mode allowing you to fight any fight you want, against any enemy you want, on any map you want.\n\nApart from the base game being great in itself, this game is easily modable. So if you buy it and you start to think of it as too uniform, there’s many great mods out there. A few I can recommend is the “Clash of Kings” mod, (which gives the game a GoT twist) and L’aige (for multiplayer mode) and finally the graphic enhancer if you simply find it unbearable.\n\nWhen creating a game, developers often have to focus on certain elements and prioritize some stuff over others, and when playing this game it seems clear that the graphics has not been their center of attention, this however does not in any way, make the game unplayable.\n\nA problem I have found with this game though, is  the client crashing, this mostly happens if you have too many saves, the game has difficulties loading the save files I’m guessing and crashes, but as long as you stick to only a few, you should be good.\n\nTo sum up, I greatly enjoy playing this game –as you can probably tell from the hours I’ve played it- even after beating it, I still roam around the world from time to time. I would recommend this game to anybody who’s into the medieval RPG type of game. So overall it’s a gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/10.","August 30, 2014","true","211.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","3"

Logic.\n\nAnyway, being entirely accurate in every way you play as Nelson Mandela in his quest to become the world's best basketball player without being reduced to a quivering load of flesh by a million Rhodok Crossbowman, or a million million Khergit Horse Archers, or just the occasionly Swadian Knight the AI bothers to recruit.\n\nAs well as that you can play in the DLC as a soldier during Napoleon's reign over France and his rather vague attempts to conquer to world and which led to the Germans claiming all the credit for the Battle of Waterloo. In this DLC you sweat out hours and hours of your free time as you try to perfect your melee skills and almost try to improve your shooting, engage in epic line battles over the course of an hour with somebody that keeps telling you to "aim higher" until eventually you fall over due to lack of balance. In the end of course, you can become one of tryhards that you spent so long hating.\n\nOverall, its a good game, so you should buy it. :D","July 11, 2014","true","154.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","4"

Don't trust ads for Chivalry, War of the Roses and such. It may appear rough and glitchy, because it's old (probably older than some of the readers of the review). Players are easily engaged by it, but it bores them pretty damn fast (if we're talking singleplayer). But then again, there are tons of mods.\nAs a multiplayer part, it's fun, but not fantastic. And has the same fast-boredom issue.\n\nDon't expect an epic story (but there are mods containing it, like Prophecy of Pendor), or a deep party management, or something like Shadow-of-Mordor-social-system, or an empire management.

But as death rained upon me from the armies of those factions who I had royally screwed, I knew this was no way to live.\n\n40 days and nights I spent as a prisoner riding with a noble lord. Until the moment came and I saw my escape. Leaving the camp I swore to myself my ways had changed and immediatly sought an audiance with the Sultan of the Sarrinid Sultanate whom had not seen my waves of destruction on his towns.\n\nI beseeched Sultan Hakim, for a place in his court, to be a lord I asked. But he denied me saying I had yet to prove myself. So I set out on task after task after task, pleasing all the lords and ladies of the land of the Sarrinid People.\n\nFinally the time came and I too became a lord. Eager to impress I took my army of horseman and begin to pillage our enemies, destroying economies and lives the like. Soon I moved to castles, now taking swathes of land and claiming them for our Sultan, and of course I got a nice cut.\n\nBut, then came the day when I captured a lovely castle from the kingdom of Vaegirs. I requested it be made mine and stocked it proudly with soldiers. Sultan Hakim on the other hand had a new shining lord who didn't have any land yet, so he decided it better to reward this, Whelp, before anything had even been accomplished.\n\nThats when i ripped That castle and all the others i had taken away from the Sultan and started the Dark Empire. For you see i have now come full circle, laying waste to all, but now, now i have the power to do so, and Lords from all nations flock at my door step, Sultan Hakim, you can bow before me now, or suffer the full wrath of the Dark Empire, all its Lords, and I, the Dark Emperor!\n\n10/10 would ruin the world again","January 8, 2015","true","93.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","12","13","10","3"

Enough said. But because this is a review i spose i have to talk about the game a bit.\n\nThere is an endless world of things  to do everything from traid to training your troops building an empire or just being a bandit.\nYou can fight for one of five factions all have there perks and downsides, or you can make your own kingdom and become king  of the land with your own faction but be carfull not to make enimies early if you choose to do so unless you fell you are strong enough to take on all the other factions on your own. In my opinion it s best to become freinds with the other factions before you make your own kingdom as to avoid early violence. If you never played the game or seen it played there are "special" people that you can have join your party to fight with youlater on you can make them cammanders in your army by making them vassals you will need to give them lands and a title in your kingdom, but be carfull if they do not like you they may turn on you so fight with them for a time and be freindly. Vassals from other kingdoms may want to join you as well  , you may want to get to know some of the lower or less prestigious members of the other factions as they will be the most likely to defect to your kindom and if they like you more well then they are less likely to leave you as well. When you are a lower level taking castles will be a pain in the butt, but if you have good troops and good tactical skill you can easily take them. Cities are the most dificult to take but are the best as they offer the most land for your kindom. When you take a place over remember that you will need to leave troops there to defend it from the other factions. For castles i only leave about 10-20 guys at first if i have no vassal for it and for cities i leave 40+ depending on who owns the land around me and who i am at war with at the time. To become king of all of Calradia you will need right to rule to get this you can send the "Special" people from your party to pread the word that you will be a great king or by sending vassals to let the other kings know you will be taking over for this to for you need a high renown and honor, to get renown you have to fight in battles with odds not in your favor or against other vassals for one of the five factions, to get honor you must be an honorable gent. When you defeat vassals for other kingdoms you will be given a choice you can take them as your prizoner or you can let them go, taking them prizoner will get you a pay day but it will paint a target on your back for the other vassals to try and rescue there fellow, but it can be very profitable if you can hold onto him. If you let him go you will get honor and he will like you a bit more. If you were to capture the leader of the country you are at war with and let him go you will get more honor and he may even call a truece between your countries, and he will accept you as king later on.\n\nIf you just want to be a bandit well that is not as honorable and if you have "special" people in your party most of them dont like to fight villagers and caravans for various reassons, you will also lose honor and the faction or factons that you are raiding will not like it so remember the golden rule in my book the goods you steal need to be sold so dont attack all the factions leave 2 or 3 to sell to.\n\nWell that is my review it turned into more of a "how to" than a review but thats ok. I love this game and plan to log more hours in time. I hope this helps new and old players to becoming king of Calradria.\n\nPs. if you want to get in good with a faction marry the kings daughter or son depending on Male/Female.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 28, 2014","true","405.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Characters, objects and buildings all have low poly counts and low resolution textures.\n\nSound: 5\nBelow average sound, the standard screams, grunts and kills. But impact noises, sword clashes, etc.  Make no sense and don't sound right at all.  But aren't so bad that they distract from the game either.

It does however take lots of practice.  Don't expect to hop on your horse and be the medival rambo immediately.\n\nImpressions:\nThe game drops you in the world and lets you get started.  It gives you no direction at all and it's up to you to figure out what to do.  Such is the nature of a sandbox game.  The poor graphics do break some immersion until you get used to them, sort of like playing an old PS1 game.  The graphics these days are garbage, but if done correctly they can still immerse you.\nThe game starts off very difficult and slowly gets easier as you get better and your character gets stronger.  The reverse difficulty curve can be problematic but also exciting as you feel yourself getting stronger and better at the game.\n\nValue: 10\nAs this is a sandbox game, you will get many hundreds of hours trying every angle of the game.  And your money supports the developers, telling them you want more of these games, more of this niche genre, less AAA garbage.\n\nSummary:\nIf you can ignore the poor graphics, this is a very good game, ready to let you do whatever you want","December 10, 2013","true","282.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Well if you ever get this game I hope you have as much fun as I did destroying everyone who dared cross my path! >: )","May 23, 2015","true","363.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tapestry/recommended/48700/","Tapestry","♛ Sophia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tapestry/","96 products in account","Mount and Blade: Warband is an open-sandbox RPG where the player leads large armies into realtime battles, slowly accumulating wealth and influence as they build their own story. It's similar to games such as Fallout in the sense that the player receives a high degree of freedom over how they choose to act, yet different in the sense that there are absolutely no organized questlines, cutscenes, etc. It's not the type of game spoilers can exist for, as nothing is predetermined. However, the world doesn't actually revolve around the player either, who isn't given unearned accolades and worshipped as a hero barely an hour into the game. Instead, the player must fight up from the bottom rung of the world's social ladder in order to become a significant presence amongst the several other AI warlords and monarchs, each belonging to their own factions with their own ambitions and troops to back them. These NPCs act independently of the player, own actions aren't required in the slightest for the game to progress -- one could sit doing absolutely nothing and watch how the AI kings interact with each other if they wanted to. They'll engage in their own politics, start alliances and declare wars to gain an edge over their enemies, even forming marriage unions and trade agreements as in grand strategy games such as Victoria II or Civilization V; all of this aids in helping the game world to feel "alive". If the player eventually chooses to form a kingdom as well, managing it will likely turn out to be a challenging, yet equally rewarding part of the game with quite some depth to it.\n\nWhile a fair portion of time is spent travelling the overworld or dealing with cities and NPCs, its real depth lies in its combat system. Battles in countless other realtime RPGs often consist of the player marching into an area and single-handedly cutting down hordes in a repetitive and predictable manner, often tanking direct blows from giant axes clearly capable of splitting limbs; these heroes rarely ever face an actual threat. Warband is the polar opposite of such a game, as one would quickly learn the hard way after charging into a castle garrisoned by hundreds, sometimes even thousands of hostiles. Weapons hurt, fighting mechanics consist of more than a few clicks and keys (they're actually quite decent), and in larger battles, the type of strategization seen in a Total War game is imperative. Troops can be recruited from villages or hired as mercenaries, gain their own experience towards upgrade trees through combat and training, and come in several different varieties of infantrymen, archers, and horsemen; yes, mounted combat holds relevance in Warband, and the feeling of leading a cavalry charge across hills and open fields is enough of a reason to buy the game.\n\nStill, Warband isn't without its fair share of flaws. The progression of a playthrough will seem awfully slow for those who'd prefer to accomplish a great deal in a single sitting, as building an army competent enough to fight more than lowly bandits will take some time, and so will diplomatic maneuvering through the factions. Character customization is rather limited, and although not underdeveloped to the point of redundancy, said limits will certainly be felt by players wishing to give considerable detail to their character. Furthermore, the aesthetic and graphics feel somewhat dated, even for a game released in 2010. In spite of all of this, Warband makes up for what it lacks with its replayability. No two playthroughs will end in the same exact manner, and plenty of mods exist to provide the player with additional features and new worlds.\n\nOverall, Mount and Blade: Warband deserves a solid 7.5/10, and is definitely worth picking up during a sale.","November 4, 2015","true","97.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

A typical game that anyone in their young teens from 90s-2010s thinking "Damn imagine a game where you fight in wars", this is basically the best game of that in my honest opinion. This is a great game to replay over and over and over, its great for people who like focusing on one game. It is also great for making many friends in the community and saves money of wasting on typical terrible games that many triple As fail to do nowadays.","September 14, 2015","true","766.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","2"

The game is based on a medieval contient in which you're thrown in to do, well, whatever you want really. Become a king of the land, a loyal vassel, a peaceful merchent, a traditor, and more. It's truly open-ended with you choosing the story that you want for it. The game also contains one of the best combat systems with sword fighting in awhile. It's simple with it's up, down, left, right fighting system but laborious to master. Timing your attacks and blocks in the exact right order as you predict your enemey movements is not as easy as you think. Now, onto my favourite part of the game, the modding. The modding is extremely talented and large. With anything you could think of. Romans, check. Samurai, check. The First World War, also check. Greco-Prussian Wars, check and so much more. Also, the mulitplayer is damn fun with a large varity of gamemodes that will have you hacking and slashing other players for hours on end as well as a pretty freindly playerbase. Now, onto the pros and cons to sum up this review\n\nPROS\n-Amazing Combat System\n-Great Modding Community\n-Open-Ended\n-Addictive\n-Great Mutiplayer\n-Replayabilty\n\nCONS\n-Graphics\n\nOverall score for this game is a 9.9/10.

While the Native singleplayer is not the greatest thing in the world you can (If you're like me) find yourself clocking in hour after hour playing it. The game was developed to be easily modded to fix that issue, and the community does not hold back, you can get mods from American Civil War to Zulu Wars.\n\nSingle player is one thing, but more importantly we have multiplayer, Mount & Blade can boast 24/7 active servers that can hold up to 200 players. You can play Native multiplayer, Napoleonic wars multiplayer, or get a mod for multiplayer like the mod I listed above "Zulu Wars"\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is Warband was actually a low budget game, it is quite apparent hence the graphics are not the most amazing thing in the world, and the animations are a mere decent, but that is more like the cover of a book in this game. What it has to offer inside is amazing and shows overly much potential. Tale World's next game in the Mount & Blade series "Bannerlord" is going to be a high budget game since they got alot of money from Warband. So support this game and it's devs and you can see an even greater game.\n\nWarband and the entire series is definitely a 10/10 and worth every penny.","December 22, 2013","true","691.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","6"

Multiplayer is in my opinion Warband's strongest attribute. The PvP combat is excellent, the maps are well made, and the experience overall is superb. Battles are large and epic, ranging from perhaps 10 people on each side to over 100. The vast array of weapons to use assures a new experience every time you play - everything from One Handed Swords, One Handed Axes, Spears, Bows, Crossbows, Javelins, and huge War Cleavers. Each faction (six in all) has a unique loadout, which adds a unique flavour aswell. Sieges are also quite ferocious and time consuming, some taking almost an hour or more. Combat involves a four-directional combat system, and a simple but practical approach to projectile drop. The community for this game is amazing, although players in Asia and North America may find slight problems finding populated servers due to the majority of players being centered in the EU. The Singleplayer is fun, but very repetitive. Your objective is to have the entire map controlled by one faction or your own. You can do a variety of quests for lords, kings, and villages - but are all repetitive. The character levelling is good, with a good array of choices to make your character how you like. A variety of different mods that are available for this game adds to the replay value of both the Multiplayer and Singleplayer aspects.\n\nPros\n+Intuitive Combat\n+Great Mounted Combat\n+Sounds and Soundtrack are superb\n+Singleplayer has wonderful RPG elements\n+Many mods and additions to add hours of fun to the game\n\nCons\n-Aging Graphics\n-Hit Detection can be a bit sloppy\n-Does not have DirectX 11 support (DirectX 7 & 9 only)\n-Smaller community than most games\n-Singleplayer has many repetitive aspects and quests (which can sometimes be snuffed with mods)\n\nOverall Rating: 8.5/10 (Good game, has a few flaws)","March 9, 2014","true","681.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","7"

Well, the answer is simple. It is Mount & Blade: Warband. Aka, 1 never ending singleplayer sandbox rpg game, 1 200+ player server 700 servers medieval online game, 1 200+ player realistic skillful Napoleonic Wars dlc, and over 27,882 total mod conversions. Yeah, it is like 27,885 games in one.\n\nThe singleplayer game is a sandbox free-roaming medieval RPG that allows you to travel around the world of Calradia, and literally do anything you can dream of. There is no official end to the game so it is limitless. Become a merchant and travel the map selling goods, start up your own chains of businesses in the major cities, fight as a mercenary for your local lord, or become a bandit and harrass peasants. Fight as a soldier in one of the 6 kingdoms fighting for total domination, become a lord in one of these factions and raise your own army, as well as gain your own castle/village/town fiefdoms. Create your own faction and become the sole ruler of Calradia, the choice is yours.\n\nOnline is is a basic medieval game with many modes such as siege, team deathmatch, battle (1 life), etc, with up to 200+ player servers. It was the birthplace for War of the Roses. It is far better than War of the Roses online however with the combat system being so easy to learn yet so hard to master.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars dlc derived from a mod called Mount and Musket, it was made a standalone expansion dlc in 2012 and is a sole-online 200-250 player server multiplayer game set in the final years of the Napoleonic Wars. You can fight as one of the main coalition forces at the time (Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, or Russia) or France itself. There are many game modes such as huge sieges with controllable artillery and destructible environments, Battle with over 200 people on a large map playing life size napoleonic battles, and when you are dead, you are dead. Commander battle where each player controls a squad of bots. And many many more modes. The dlc has musicians which play music orchestrated by real bands for the game and which give buffs to nearby teammates. There are huge amounts of teamwork necesarry with such a variety of balanced classes, and the combat system ensures that skill is the master of the battlefield. If you get bored of just playing on public servers then there are hundreds of clans or "regiments" that have formed and who organise and do events that are like the 200 player battles but where everyone is listening to officer orders and fight as lines, creating a warming community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgWZBo5tciw\n\nThere are also ofc the mods, all of which I would stuggle to tell you about in this review. The main mod I would recommend however is Persistent World. It is a roleplay type mod where you join a server with a large free roaming custom map, with multiple castles and towns, and you and all of the other players roleplay as medieval citizens. You can work in the mines and earn some coin with the balanced economic system, you can become a Master Smith and forge new weapons or armour, or if you feel like fighting you can join one of the many factions in each server and fight in wars for your lord. Maybe even become the lord of a faction yourself? The choice is yours.\nhttp://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,160403.0.html\n\nI would highly highly rate Mount & Blade Warband as it is such a complex yet simple game with more content than any other game I have ever played including Skyrim.\n\nThanks for reading, buy this game!","October 31, 2012","true","117.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It also combines top-down strategy exploration with 3rd person RTS gameplay with one of the best combat systems I've ever seen in an RPG. You can roam around the world of Calradia with your party/army, fight against looters and deserters in open fields and other environments, and even siege/defend castles and cities. It is almost completely build your own adventure (with the exception of the starting mission) so there is no story to follow whatsoever other than the one you create for yourself. This also comes with a fairly decent multiplayer, some cool DLC and heaps of awesome total conversion mods that you can find on Moddb, Nexusmods or Steam Workshop.

Born by a poor, humble and polite hunter living into the woods, raised as a street urchin, you find yourself working in a smith at the years of your adulthood.\n\nSpring 1257. It is dusk and you are on your way back home after a very successful day in the smith when a 10 men force of Huscarls pass from your side marching quickly. "Move along filthy boy or i will be the last face you will see!", says the general before he pushes you on the bushes. You had more than a great day back on the smith with many new clients coming and thus you don't allow that incident to ruin your mood. 20 minutes later you see a great cloud of smoke coming from the direction of your small cottage. Terrible thoughts pass through your mind and you decide to run as fast as you can to make sure that your parents are ok.\n\nYou climb the hill where your father taught you how to use your bow and when you reach the top ... you stay breatheless by the sight! Your cottage, your backyard, your stable are all burning down! With all the powers you have left after a full day and a long run, you decide to bring down your door and look for your parents. The flames are huge, the smoke is thick, you can barely breathe or see but you manage to search the living room and the kitchen for your parents. No sign of them... They must have been hidden on the upper floor where the bedrooms are, you think and run towards the steps. You reach the steps only to realize that they have been burnt down already. "Mum, Dad!!!" you shout desperately when the roof is starting creak ready to collapse under the rage of the fire. You run through the living room, out of your door just before the cottage collapses before your very own eyes.\n\n.....\n\nYou wake up the other day lied on the burnt grass out of your still smoking house with a great headache from the previous night. The scene is so nasty that you can't even look at it so you start searching around the courtyard to see if anything has been saved from the fire. Then you spot a blue cloth wavering out of your stable's door. You pick it up only to realize it is the banner of King Olaf, the king of Nords. Rage feels you and you decide to start your journey on far away lands seeking for revenge!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the ideal game for anyone who loves stories with knights, wavering warlords, throne claimants and legendary battles. Both multiplayer and singleplayer features are amazing and offer many many hours of joy! The variety of mods available on the workshop make the game a necessary purchase!\n\n10/10!","May 3, 2015","true","67.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","17","24","4","2"

(Even if I happen to still be aweful at it).\n\nIn Singleplayer you start of as a lonely wanderer, with a personal background that you customise as you enter the game, but I wouldn't bother to much with that, story isn't barely present in the game, it's basically an all out war between 6 factions who all want to rule the land with you in the middle. After a few moments you'll attract your first followers, most likely villagers from some village that urges to join you in your journey, and that's where the game takes off. Wether you swear yourself to one of the lords of the realm or decide to start your own faction by throwing caution to the wind and attack without any other lords to back you up, Mount and Blade will swallow your time.\n\nThe first time I actually sat down to play the campaign, I stayed up for 3 days straight, with only brief pauses from the game, they were meant as more permanent pauses, but the urge to do just a few more actions kept creeping up on me. To make it even worse, I listened to The Sultans of Swing - Dire Straits for almost the entire time, as it felt incredibly fitting for mounted warfare as I swung my sabres.\n\nAnd if singleplayer sandbox combat isn't your thing the game comes with a fantastic multiplayer scene, where there almost always is atleast one server with plenty of people playing the various multiplayer modes. The amount of players have taken its toll a bit recently, but there's still enough players around to get a few good games out. There's, as I said, many different modes, but the one I prefer most is Siege, which puts you in the role of either an attacker or defender of a castle (I know, who would've thought?) and it's really enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, this game is a fantastic time sink, especially if you're as easily impressed by swords and bows as I am. Allthough the graphics may be a bit on the bad side if you're some sort of graphical mastermind, but in that case you're missing out.\n\nTl;dr : You ride horses and hit people with swords in an open world, I like it a lot, so much so I wrote way to many words to describe it.","February 1, 2014","true","533.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gg9912/recommended/48700/","Gg9912","Extremely Ordinary Gamer™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gg9912/","307 products in account","Note: to see this reveiw with text formating and in-game pictures, go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/07/gamemount-and-blade-warband.html\n\nMount and Blade Warband is a game made by Turkish game studioTaleWorlds Entertainment, it is a large-scale battle RPG.\n\nThe game plays more like a Total War game where you get to fight on the feild. you explore the world using a over head map. then you click on cities/towns/etc and it loads into them. to make it clear there is no real "open world" in the game. you don't not walk to the next city with you and your army rendered, you are simply represented by a man on a horse that walks across the map. when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense, seeing as you can get up to 250 or more troops, it would be a pain to walk all the way with that many people with a system just like skyrim.\n\n\nSo the meat of the game is the battles, you get to watch your army attack the other, and you yourself can engage the enemy on the field of battle. with a handy add-on the Warband Battle Size changer  you can go up to 700 men per battle. however, the M&B game engine will be highly unstable if you use any number higher than 300.\n\n\nCombat in Warband is gritty and fun. you can use all kinds of weapons. they have Swords,pikes,bows, and more. all have different abilities and such. hitting an enemy with a powerful Pike attack, can kill or knock them out instantly. and that brings us to another thing in M&B, the ability to capture people. with some weapons you will knock out people instead of killing them. after the battle you can take them with you as prisoners. Nobles and kings can not be sold, but anyone else can. you can even make them join your army as soldiers. however that will hurt your army's morale.\n\nMorale in Warband plays a big part. lots of things can hurt your troops morale. things like fighting with a companion (a special person you can find in taverns that have backstorys, will speak to you about things.)\nraiding defenseless farmers. not having any food. not paying them. or using captured prisoners as soldiers in your army. if morale gets too low, some of your troops will start to leave during the night and you can even lose you entire army this way.\n\nIn Warband its hard to go alone in the deadly world of  Calradia, as such you will most likely find yourself working for a lord or noble. at first they will give you annoying repetitive quest, but soon you will start rise in the ranks. the Lord/Noble will call you for a grand attack on one of His enemies and you must join him. during this war if you take a castle in a siege your lord/noble may give it you as your own. once you are well known can even marry the daughters of other Lords/Nobles, and get larger amounts of land. of course you can just try to take over Calradia on your own, but then everyone will hate you and try to kill you. but running your own nation and forcing people to respect you is one of the more funnest things to do in Warband.\n\nThe big downside of this game is the visuals. yes i know, graphics aren't everything, but Warband looks barley better than PS2 graphics. however, with all of the crazy fun battles you'll be playing it will be easy to over look the games graphics.\n\nif you like fun combat and huge battles then Warband is the game for you. just don't expect it to play like Skyrim or Oblivion.","July 12, 2014","true","113.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkres/recommended/48700/","lordkres","Lord Kres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkres/","412 products in account","Open-world medieval sim Mount & Blade was, I think even the hardcore aficionados will admit, not a very easy game to like. It was ugly. It was unwieldy. The user interface looked about as nice as a crab with a lecherous wink and it probably took at least three or four hours before anyone mastered the art of hitting things from horseback.\n\nIn that way, standalone expansion Mount & Blade: Warband is no different.\n\nOne other undeniable truth about the original Mount & Blade though was that, once you had spent the time to learn how it worked, the sense of reward you got from actually surviving it made most other games go pale in ashamed comparison. Actually getting the timing and aim right so that you could shoot a charging rider off his stallion with a single arrow offered a sense of giddiness that’s hard to top.\n\nAnd in that way too, Mount & Blade: Warband is no different.\n\nTherein lays one of Warband’s biggest flaws though; that it might not offer long-time fans a different enough experience from the original and that, while there are plenty of improvements, many of them haven’t been pulled off with the level of polish you might have hoped for. It’s better, but not as good as it could and should be, in other words.\n\nThe actual aesthetic is an excellent example of this as, for all Warband’s talk of improved visuals, the game still appears incredibly basic by almost any standard. It’s not so much in the look per se, as the textures are now more or less up to par, but more in the way it moves. The models are still rudimentary at best; animations slower than a slug trying to climb out of a greasy bin bag.\n\nAnd yet, as seems to be a recurring theme for Warband, there are exceptions to the rule.\nHDR has been added in for example and, while in most games that’s not exactly something to get excited about unless you have an unusual fetish for simulated momentary blindness, Warband manages to make it an actual part of the gameplay.\nCastle sieges, which make up one of Warband’s new multiplayer modes, can be won or lost by the placement of archers on the parapet because wily warriors will stand with the sun directly behind them. All assaulting forces will see is a volley of arrows spewing out of the sky; they’ll be unable to draw mark on defenders.","October 10, 2013","true","508.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxwellCromhide/recommended/48700/","MaxwellCromhide","Maxwell Cromhide","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxwellCromhide/","151 products in account","Mount and Blade: Warband is a sandbox RPG with a medieval setting, featuring a deep system of combat for melee weapons, archery, horse combat, and massive battles. Players can do anything from herding cattle and raiding villages, all the way up to becoming the Emperor of Calradia by one's own bloody hands. Somewhere in between, you will likely do a lot of it. There are many things to do in this game. One can go in search of tasks to help out the peasantry, lords and kings in the various factions of the war-torn lands of Calradia. There are tournaments to fight in, wars to take advantage of. It even has a large bandit problem, and someone's gotta get rid of them. If you don't want to do any of that, you can take advantage of the local economies. The game has a functional economy, and by exploiting trade routes and purchasing businesses, you can gain massive profits.\n\nOne can become a lord, put a pretender on a faction's throne, and even do mercenary work. But the higher your ambitions rest, the more you will need support. Bump elbows with Calradia's rich noble class and this will become significantly easier. That's right, there are feasts in this game. Be careful when you enter the courts, for the nobility are scheming and trying to profit as much as possible. Calradia is hardly a land that espouses the values of Chivalry. Despite Chivalry being something of a thing. There is an in-game honor system. It's not a cut black-and-white morality system. Generally, if you make people suffer, you lose honor. If you help people and act benevolently, you gain it. But does the game ever tempt you to dishonor yourself. War is highly profitable, and peasants are defenseless. Moreover, they have very valuable things to take. And it destroys your opponent's economy when you raid, which will help your war efforts. There's a macabre decision making process as to when to be a shining knight.\n\nThe game's combat system as mentioned before has a lot of depth to it. It can take a little time to get a hold of. Especially when you factor in massed battles, mounted combat, and fortress assaults. All of which require different tactics. You can order your soldiers around, tell them where and when to attack. It adds yet another level of this game to be able to fight alongside your own men. The melee combat system is particularly in-depth. It has a basic "Simon Says" system, where you can attack left, right, overhead, or to thrust. And you can both block and parry those individual attacks. Correct timing, and watching your opponent's movements are required to survive the battlefield. The weapons also have functioning speed and reach. A sword is quicker than a longaxe, but doesn't reach as far. So the person with the longaxe will try and keep his opponent away, while the sword user will want to close. You also can't use a big weapon in a shoulder-to-shoulder formation. You won't have the room.\nThere is also the ability to do ranged combat. Throwing weapons, crossbows and archery mainly. In some mods, guns are available, but that will be discussed later. Each of the first three are different. Thrown weapons let you keep your shield up, but don't fly very far, and usually don't have much ammunition. But they can make a huge difference. Being able to throw spears or axes at your opponent before closing on them will give you a considerable advantage. Crossbows fire slowly, only require strength to equip, and are highly accurate. They also break through armor with ease. Bows have a draw system. The longer you hold your arrow, the more inaccurate you are, as you struggle to hold your bow taut. So you pick out your target, lead and arc your shot, and fire. It takes considerable mastery, but a bow can be especially deadly.\n\nMounts are in this game as well, and they add even more to the game. You can engage in combat from horseback with nearly any melee weapon, lances, and even thrown weapons, bows and some crossbows. Horse archery is a tough skill to master, but is highly effective, as one should suppose. Melee combat on the mounts features the same system and strengths that the foot combat has. Charging down enemies with a lance and an axe can be highly satisfying. You can make passing attacks, or choose to charge your opponent. When you're fighting other cavalry, the option to go for the horse is present. It's not only an option, it's highly recommended.\nArmor also changes how you fight in this game. It will slow you down, but it will also protect you. If you plan on getting stuck in a fight, I reccomend lots of it.\n\nThe setting itself is fairly bog-standard medieval setting fare. You have various kingdoms based from our real world peoples, all having different strengths and different tactics. It's somewhat anachronistic, with Not-Mongols fighting Not-Vikings and Not-Italians fighting Not-Russians. But this is explained in the backstory. Which brings us to one of the flaws in this game. The  setting and characters are not especially well developed. This is to leave the game's story open, as so many playthroughs will be different. After the game's start point, the AI factions react to each other and the player appropriately. Meaning that the game's story is precisely what you make it. But the lords and other important characters come off more as tour guides than as real people. The amount of open-endedness also gives you the feeling of being thrown into a pool and being told to swim.  But when you float, and start to swim, you get the feeling that you're creating the story. The ink is the blood, the quill a dagger and all of Calradia is the parchment. Each playthrough will be different. I have had one particular kingdom dominate the game in one playthrough, only to be crushed in the next. And that is part of the attractiveness of this series of games.\n\nThe game boasts a skill and levelling system as well, typical for an RPG. You level stats, and choose what skills and weapon proficiencies to level. There are no classes, and no need for them. Skills run the gamut of things like first aid, pathfinding, leadership, and combat skills like power strike. You can find companions, who can take care of these skills for you. Companions are additional characters that you can fight alongside, level up and equip as you desire. Which brings me to the recruitment system. One can go from town to town, recruiting soldiers for their cause. Whatever that may be. Soldiers will also level up, when given battle experience and training.\n\nOne of the game's largest strengths is the mod support. Modding the game is easy, often times one just has to integrate files to the appropriate folder, or simply install a mod and run it from the launcher. Mods run the gamut of small tweaks, such as Freelancer, Diplomacy and Pre-battle orders and deployment. Which allow the player to fight in someone else's army as a soldier, increase the amount of options for diplomatic actions, and to arrange your soldiers before a battle, taking some of the tedium away from command. Also available are gameplay overhauls like Floris, which keep the main setting, but offer so many tweaks that the game is nearly different. There are also completely new campaigns, in new settings. You can find many different ones. Europe in the medieval ages, dark age britain, completely original settings, and even Westeros are available. Respectively, they're named 1257AD, Brytenwalda, Prophesy of Pendor and Clash of Kings. There are many more mods available that I will not list, since it would take too long to list it all.\n\nBut the game is not without flaws, for all the praise I just showered on it. The game's graphics are extremely poor. As mentioned before, the story leaves much to be desired, same with characters. The game's animations are also quite cumbersome and static. The combat can also feel slow, until you get ahold of it. I would reccomend it. There's a free demo offered here on Steam, if you're not sure you'll enjoy it.","December 2, 2013","true","622.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

If that isn't enough for you, it has dozens of mod that make the game even more unique and fun to play. A mod I recommend highly is the Gekokujo mod, which allows you to play the game from the perspective of a samurai in feudal Japan. This game is truly wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone that has a deep love for RPG games, or just games they can pour a lot of time into. There are a few bugs here and there, and the graphics are definitely dated, but the game is still a wonderful experience that shouldn't be missed.","April 5, 2014","true","225.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirYar/recommended/48700/","SirYar","SirCoolCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirYar/","55 products in account","Oh boy, where do I begin with this game.\nThe Singleplayer is very fun. It's a 2 part RPG adventure - in the first main part your'e traveling around the world map with your band of warriors (which you recruit from villeges) in an almost free style maner - you can pillage villages, battle bandits and faction's armies, visit cities and buy from them, attack castles or cities and even participate in good ol medievel tournamnets. It's a unique RPG experience which I personally really like, however it can be frustrating if you have no idea what your'e doing. You start as a level 1 hero, and level up through killing enemies and completing objectives and quiests. Each time you level up you get to raise your stats (Agillity, Int, strength, charisma, all affect your adeventure in various ways), your skill points which also give many benefits and your weapon proficiencies.\nYou can co-operate with factions and eventually join them and become a lord with lands. Your relationship with each factions affects the others, and if you end up in war with one of them their armies will make sure to chase you around the world map and battle you.\nThe second aspect of the game is the battle mode - here you are in a 3rd or 1st person perspective, fighting your enemies along side your trusty warband in classic medievel combat. You command your troops to hold positions, follow you or charge. The goal is to slay all of the enemy units. Sounds easy, until you find out that you ARE NOT a super unit, and die just as fast as all the other ones. With good strategy and powerful warriors at your side you can win battles and gain glory and loot. The weapons and armour you loot or buy at cities, that you wear on yourself, is what you use in battle, and there is a wide range of weapons to use - pikes, crossbows, swords, cleavers, two and one handed axes, spears, lances, bows and many many more. You can also ride on horses along side your cavalry and slay the enemy with a hit and run strategy!\nBy winning battles, looting villages and caravans and selling stuff you get money (called denars) which you use to buy weapons, horses, armour and food (which is useful to boost your party morale) and pay for your parties wages. A good way to earn money is to take prisoner enemy warriors or lords and then ransom them. I once sold a KING of an faction for 15k!\nNow we get to the most frustrating part of the game - Multiplayer and battle mechanics.\nIt's fun. REALLY fun. But annoying.\nThe multiplayer mod itself is very entertaining. You can participate in many game modes like DM, TDM, CTF, Battle (1 live a round, last man standing) and My favorite - Siegie, where you have to capture the defending team's flag as the attacker. There are many maps to play, and it's a fresh experience.  There can be up to 200 people in one server, which leads to massive and epic battles. You spawn each time with a set weapons and armour, which you can upgrade or replace with money you gain through killing and getting objectives. Each player has a minimum set of money they always have acces to when they respawn which they cannot lose (It's not uncommon to see fully naked peoeple running around with huge battle axes). This, however leads to the problems of capitalism - the rich, who have a lot of money buy the best gear and get only more money from kills and the poor are stuck with bad gear and stay poor because they barely get any kills (You LOSE MONEY WHEN YOU DIE!).\nIn addition, The game suffers from various bugs, glitches, lags and inbalances, which make the otherwise flawless combat a source of anger. 2 Handed weapons are wildly over powered compared to one handed weapons + shields becuase of their much faster swing times and higher damage (+ Many break shields very quickly). Bows and crossbows are insanely effective with low money matches, where everyone has less armour but almost useless when used against very armed people. The hit detection can be broken at time, mostly for the worse - I've had many times when my arrows went right through and my axes did no damage at all. Blocking with weapons (not shields), although hard to master and is very rewarding, simply doesn't work at times. The horses are insanly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and always either stop dead on when you budge into something, leaving you easy prey for infantry with 2 handed weapons, or go compeltly the other direction and end up slaming into an obstacle - again, having you killed by archers and 2 handed axes.\nThe game also has some hilarious glitches like the "Sky Faces".\nOverall, I think it's a very good game and I highly recommend you try it out. You will rage, but the best way to have fun is get better! (Or use 2 handed weapons, which ever works).","February 19, 2015","true","648.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","2"

Expanding your empire or helping a King to expand theres honestly this is a game that needs to be experienced and is one that should be in the library of all gamers.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","April 14","true","306.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetittymittensofdoom/recommended/48700/","thetittymittensofdoom","Tutu Tittymittens","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetittymittensofdoom/","258 products in account","When I was growing up, I played Lords of the Realm 2. Most nowadays might not have heard of it, but you may know it better by the games it inspired; the Total War franchise. In this game, you had to essentially run a kingdom. Make sure there was enough food and ale, set taxes, draft peasants into the military, equip and customize them so they'll function in battle, and conquer neighboring territories. It also included some degree of diplomacy, with you being able to communicate with local kings and lords.\n\nNow I ask you, does this game sound familiar? I have no doubt that this is the game that inspired M&B. It added a lot to the formula that I desperately wanted in LotR2. I wanted to get involved in the action, instead of this kinda boring (to me at least) tactical interface. I wanted more diplomacy and politics. I wanted to woo ladies, serve lords, spite peasants, and live the Medieval life. M&B brought me that, and added even more.\n\nIt's, in essence, a combination of a Medieval life sim with a focus on building armies, and some deep RPG-inspired undertones. When you create a character, you can decide on a background and origin for this character, and that determines your starting gear, starting cash, and stats. And as you continue, you can pretty much play any way you want. Want to be a bandit and rob caravans? How about become a vassal of the king and strike fear in the hearts of your enemies? Maybe try for lordship yourself? How about conquering the world? Maybe be a wealthy merchant with a savvy ear and a sharp tongue? Wanna joust? Join feasts? Ride beasts? This game is more of an RPG than Skyrim ever was. It actively encourages and cultivates player choice. We are not a feather to be blown about by the nearest quest and lazy peasant, we are an active force in this world, and ultimately the world's deciding factor.\n\nCombat will feel awkward to the unitiated. The closest examples would be The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, and Dark Souls. Daggerfall for the directional combat resulting in different accuracy and damage, and Dark Souls with the combat centered around blocking, countering, and timing attacks. It takes getting used to, but it's probably the most realistic combat we've seen in a game yet. As an example, if you swung a spear it'd do next to no damage, you'd have to stab with it. Momentum also carries into attacks, so if you "swing" the camera further back, before spinning it back to unleash the attack, you will get a "speed bonus", which will grant you extra damage. This means that swinging a sword from horseback will net you extra damage, provided you swing the right way. It also works in reverse, if you "swing" the camera against the swing, the damage will be close to nil because you barely moved the weapon. It's not easy to master, but when you do it's about the most satisfying tactical experience you could encounter in a game of this nature.\n\nThe customization also deserves a mention. There's a staggering variety of armors, weapons, shields, bows, crossbows, and horses, each with modifiers that can add bonuses or penalties. A "cracked" wooden shield against a "sturdy" wooden shield. Think Terraria in this case. Each weapon also has their own delay, swing recovery, swing arc, damage, and blocking ability. Crossbows are also viable and different enough from bows to stand out on their own. What they lack in max accuracy they have in damage, and what they lack in fire rate they have in range. Each weapon feels distinct, with its own degree of mastery required.\n\nThe map is huge, with each city, village, and castle having their own attractions. Villages have elders with more minor, easier jobs, peasants to draft, and food and supplies to buy. Cities have taverns (sell prisoners, recruit mercenaries, discover heroes, and learn rumors), guildmasters (more intermediate quests, that pay well and provide decent experience), local forts that house Counts, and marketplaces (armor, weapons, tradegoods, and horses), where you can keep an ear to the local market, to see where you can make the best buys and sell for the best prices (for you at least). Castles just house Lords and Ladies, and a prison, but if you wish to conquer the fief (area) in the name of your King (or yourself), you need to defeat the heavily defended castle and the heavily equipped garrison within.\n\nNow for the faults. The graphics are not bad, but definitely not anywhere close to decent. The UI is pretty rubbish, with plenty of clutter and buttons occasionally hidden in the margins of the screen. There's an overall lack of voice acting, and a huge abundance of text, which may be a turn-off to people who just wanted to play a game, instead of read a book. The AI sometimes outright ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed. Too many times, in the beginning, I had my one mounted unit charge ahead of everyone else and get slaughtered. These flaws were no actual bother to me, especially with the abundance of mods. But I find it unfair to judge a game solely by the content that others have made for it. And speaking of which.\n\nThe mod that I recommend above all else is the Diplomacy mod. I personally do not recommend that Vexxed mod if you desire any kind of challenge.\n\nOverall, my final verdict for this game is an 8.5/10. I normally despise decimals in declarations of quality, but I didn't find 8 sufficient to account for the parts that do work, nor 9 sufficient to account for the flaws. Undeniably, there are flaws, but they are not enough to bring down the game. This is about the best Medieval RPG and life sim that you could find. You owe it to yourself to at least try it, especially while it is on sale.","November 16, 2014","true","125.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/48700/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","After playing Chivarly I figured there wasn't another medieval sword game I wanted to play. I tried Mount & Blade and do not regret purchasing it.\n\nThe reason why I support this game is it tried to take a different approach to gaming. From the user interface (UI) to the actual game play. I'll start with the story in which the game asks you questions in what type of adventurer you are (merchant's son, nobles son, peasants son etc...). From that it gives you a set of attribute points and allows you to add a few extras before you begin the game. I'd like to add that the creator(s) of this game added a great feature which makes exploring the world as well as the towns/castles a lot easier. Pressing select (or some keyboard button I'm not familiar with yet) while in a city/town/village allows for quick options to pop up (which means quick travel). You need to go to the tavern? Boom use your controller to choose it. Need to hit up the noble's hall? Boom hit select and use your joystick to select it. Wanna leave town? No problem. Because of this - the game by itself is notable.\n\nThe game starts with you on a horse on a overhead map you can zoom in or out on. From this screen (which is paused unless you decide to move your character), you can view notes of mission logs, party stats, inventory and so on. This by itself adds an extra dimension to the game.\n\nThere is a lot to do in the game and factions you can side with. You can pledge allegiance to a faction (by approaching the king) and you can start asking for titles of land/castles or become the marshal and lead the king's armies. You can go at it by yourself but it's quite difficult as a faction can start swarming you. The player goes around asking nobles if there is any tasks you can do for them. Sometimes they ask you to pillage villages of other factions to start a war or a fight. Some tell you to go collect their rent. Along the way you may run into interesting characters (doctors, mercenaries, vagabonds) that would be interested in joining your battle party. Individual soldiers can be upgraded and given roles (such as cavalry, archers, footmen etc...). Those vagabonds also can be upgraded to your needs, such as if you want someone to be a good engineer you can focus on that and then have another person focus on training your units. To recruit soldiers you need to go around to villages and attempt to recruit from there. As the game progresses so do what the factions do - meaning villages can be looted by other factions or just renegades. Renegades can also chase you around if you are not careful. You beat them you can win some cool things, lose though and you might become a prisoner for them.\n\nFighting in this game is somewhat comparable to chivalry. You need to be facing in the right direction in order to block or get a hit. Like chiv though, it will take practice to figure out how to properly attack and defend. There is no shortage of variety when it comes to armor, horses, crossbows, longbows, swords, pikes, spears etc... There are tournaments that you are eligible to enter at certain times if not you may enter the arena and go spar (and make some money depending how you guys you knock out). After a battle you can also (depending on your prisoner capacity level) hold prisoners. You can ransom them off in taverns and it is a good way of making money.\n\nI will have to give this game an ....\n\nRATING : 8.1/10\n\n...as I havn't found anything quite like it yet or near it's game play.\n\nUPDATE after 45+ hours : I like the game... definitely worth the buy. After you do quite a bit you'll find yourself trying another game. After you've done it all though you start wondering what else to do. It is a sandbox game keep in mind. If you have a lot of time on your hands you'll love this game.\n\nFOR FUTURE M&B games : after spending quite a bit of time in-game, would be nice to fight for some kind of purpose. How do you create or give a purpose? Create an online multiplayer world where players fight one another's kingdom. Make it their own kingdom, or perhaps pre-make the kingdoms and allow players to decide the fate of the multiplayer clans.","December 6, 2014","true","61.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","July 11, 2015","true","746.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","65","17","26","22","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Firtirious/recommended/48700/","Firtirious","Donald Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Firtirious/","120 products in account","Mount & Blade: Warband is a sequel to Mount & Blade, which both were made by TaleWorlds Entertainment. The game has a great single player campaign.\nThe Mount & Blade: Warband gameplay is just amazing, you have a lot of choice in what to do, who to recruit in your army,  and the quests are lots fun.\nFirst of all, your actions affect what happens in the game. For example, if you raid a village of a kingdom, it is very likely that that kingdom will go to war with you. Secondly, the medieval theme relates perfectly in my opinion to this game. Your army either has infantry or calvary which is just like the medieval times. No guns either of course, just swords, crossbows, bow and arrows, etc. Also, there are kingdoms and the king choses which noble gets the castle they have conqured or the new fiefs they have gotten during war and the fact that you can get married is pretty cool.\nThirdly, there are many varieties of quests from starting wars, destroying bandits' lairs, prisoner rescue, and much more. All of them are very fun but some of them have negative impacts. I try to avoid the ones that will negatively impact you because it could cause you to have to restart the game because no one would like you if you keep doing them except for the person who assigns them and maybe some other people.\nThe controls for Mount & Blade: Warband aren't too complicated. It uses the basic WASD movement controls and the mouse to change the game camera and to perform the actions like swinging your sword. The simple controls makes this game much more enjoyable instead of those complex ones that make you rage sometimes.\nOverall, Mount & Blade: Warband is an amazing game that everyone who likes Medieval RPG's should get it and play it. The score that I give this game is a 10/10.","November 26, 2013","true","176.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

And Mount and Blade: Warband fits right in, from it's management of one's army, to the strategic combat out on the battlefield. It also features RPG elements like a customizable personal character with his or her stats and skills, the skill system is very elaborate and involved with all the different skills with their own unique purposes, encouraging the player to think carefully about what they want to put their points into when they level up. My favorite part about this game being the combat, of course, striking down enemies is ever so satisfying, and it's also most gratifying to loot an enemy after sending your men to mow them down. The factor of appeasement being added onto when it is executed after using a plan or good tactic that works, and learning what strategies are effective. My only major complaint is how frustrating Mount & Blade games can be at times. Like when, in spite of your path finding skill being well leveled and having a good horse, your party travels so slow that even on-foot partys of outlaws can outspeed you, which is just absolutely stupid. Regardless, this game still holds up in it's appeal to me.\n\n9/10 - Impressive.","November 19, 2014","true","130.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Mount and Blade is no exception, though it does manage to make it fun. Years before I bought this game, it was recommended I get it as soon as possible. I did look at it sure, but from the store page it looks like an old RPG that didn't age well and isn't relevant any more. I see now how wrong I was.\nSure I don't have a lot of hours into, but it's been a real blast to play and I've seen people with thousands of hours into it, so I don't see it getting any older any time soon. I bought it during the 2014 Summer Sale, I can't quite remember why. One of my friends was with me and we spent a good majority of our night laughing at how bad the enemy AI was, or the outdated graphics, or the war cries after winning a battle. There was something about riding into battle on a horse singlehandedly against 100 enemy horsemen just to be dragged around for days as a prisoner that was just funny. The entire game seemed like a big joke or parody towards the "European RPG" genre. I put it down not expecting to play it again until my friend bought it himself.\nI restarted and decided to actually do the first quest and not go on suicide missions the entire time. What I was met with was a surprisingly open ended RPG that was fun to invest time into. I can't really explain it while writing it down, so I won't even try. I'll put it in a some kind of faux chart because everyone loves charts.\nTHE GOOD\nOpen-ended gameplay: You can be a merchant or warrior, you can aspire to be a powerful king or feared bandit.\nUnique difficulty settings: You can start off as a declining noble or a penny-less thief or anything in between. Obviously one will be harder than the others.\nAmazing modding scene.\nThe fighting system is easy to learn and hard to master.\nThe world is always changing, and should feel alive.\nTHE BAD\nPretty bad graphics\nThe AI is "quirky" and might get annoying fast\nThe game can be really hard, and rage inducing ( at least for me)\nThe war cries.\n","July 30, 2014","true","129.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Tips don't be with one kingdom too long or else they will be hard to defeat if you start you're own kingdom and make sure to go through with quests and missions it helps with your reputation a lot!  Also at the beginning stay active in making money from attacking bandits to fulfilling quests and such.

It's the most realistic, fun, and challenging part of the game, and whenever I play some other game, I miss this fight system, because it literally ROCKS!!!\n\nYou can attack in 4 direction, based on the mouse movement (or keyboard, even you can set it to automatic like defense, but trust me, you don't want that, that's the biggest challenge in the game), and if you riding a horse, when you hit the enemy with your weapon the speed of impact counts. (It's a multiplier, you can get 300% more damage if you on a horse with full speed, and both the enemy and you are running towards each other.\n\nThe bow simulation is also perfect, it's one of the most close to the bow/crossbow simulation in the game world, just like sword dueling. I've been practicing with bows in real life, so I can say, Warband is SO CLOSE to the term of realistic. It's also a cookie that you can shoot with the bow from horseback in a different, awesome simulation system like none of the game developers implemented in their own game.\n\nIt's an RPG game, so that adds to the FUN. But if you buy it, (and I hope you do, because its developers are not the richest out there, so they need YOUR support to make their game better) expect some bugs, and WTF moments, like when you realize how hard is to get money at HIGH level, or attacking a bandit camp. The bandit lairs above level 40 is literally impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. I wish the developers would fix that.\n\nAnd in online mode, Warband is like Counter Strike. (the equipment system I mean) You kill, you get money. You get killed, you lose your stuff. There are still more to be said about this game, but I'll let the others to do that! ;)\n\n8/10 Game, I APPROVE.","July 25, 2014","true","45.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/48700/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","Mount & Blade: Warband (along with its predecessor, Mount & Blade) is a game so unique it is difficult to fit it snugly into one category. It's an action RPG, it's grand strategy, it's a simulation, it's open world. This game is a whole bunch of things that melt so perfectly together, and it is unlike any other game I've ever played. For anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in medieval warfare, this is the game you never knew you wanted.\n\nYou start out by answering some simple questions about the life your character has lived thus far, and critiquing the way your heroine (or hero) looks. You are thrown into the large continent of Calradia which is split into six unique factions that are constantly at war with each other. The world map is familiar to those of us who enjoy grand strategy games; you can view the land and the castles/towns/villages/hideouts etc. that exist on it at any one time, while your character and her horse moves along it like a pawn on a gameboard. The colors of the names tell you which faction currently owns and controls each piece of land. What you begin to do from here is ultimately up to you. You can try doing favors for lords and kings to win their favor and ultimately work for them, whilst building up a small army of ragtag soldiers that you recruit and hire from various places, or you can be bold and try almost immediately to begin taking over land yourself (which I wouldn't recommend for the first dozen or so hours into the game).\n\nBattles in this game are nothing short of amazing. Both warring sides start out on opposite ends of the map (I've never seen the same battlefield twice, by the way, so I believe they are randomized based on the terrain type you are currently traversing). You can issue commands to your army, and this is fun to mess around with. For example, you can tell your archers to stand their ground and your cavalry to charge the enemy, while giving a different order to infantry. It's all up to you. By default, all units will charge, and for the most part, this is sufficient. You will then meet your enemy in the battlefield, where cavalry can run over infantry, archers can shoot riders off of horses, and you can kill horses while their riders are still living, making them fall face first into the ground before swarming them. Basically, if you've ever seen two opposing sides charge in a movie and have felt that intensity and awe, you can actually play as one of those people involved in Mount & Blade, and each and every time it's amazing. This game is fantastic for nerds like me who love anything medieval; not only are there full out battles like this, but you eventually (and your army) get strong enough to take over castles, towns, etc., and you get to be one of the units that is a part of this, each and every single time.\n\nThe goal regardless seems to be to take over the entire map of land, whether through an existing faction or through your own, which you may create once you have a strong enough army to begin taking over land by force. Lords will double cross you, downright insult you, and even beg their respective kings for the rights to a castle you may have taken over yourself, and depending on the circumstance, you may or may not be jipped out of a piece of land you worked hard for. You can then, however, decide to accept that or give a one fingered salute to your king before renouncing your allegiance and going your own way. It is entirely up to you.\n\nI would highly, highly recommend you play as a woman character, even if you are not a woman in real life. The game is fantastic at reflecting the negative attitudes toward women at the time, and those mentalities can highly influence you during the game. For example, I created a woman character and named her after myself, much like I did for the first Mount and Blade. I set about leveling up my character and recruiting soldiers, and picked up a mercenary contract for a faction. After taking over three castles single-handedly for the faction's king, I spoke to the king, introduced myself, and asked to be promoted to being his vassal. He told me outright that he didn't care what I had accomplished. Because I was a woman, I could not be his vassal, and I couldn't own land. I asked him what would happen if I took an enemy castle by force, and he replied that he would "think about" letting me keep it. This sexist attitude (although very realistic for the time) got me so fired up that I promptly cancelled my contract with the king and began taking over his land by force. After about 40 hours of in-game time, he was exiled from the land, his faction was extinct, and all of his land belonged to a new faction appropriately named "Rosie's Kingdom of Awesome." About 40 hours after that, I was Queen of Calradia. But it all started because of my motivation to overthrow an arrogant and sexist king as the woman he insulted, and no other game has done such a great job of inspiring me to create my own grudges and follow through on them until I conquered all.\n\nThis game is one of the most perfectly put together pieces of work I've ever played. I've seen people question the graphics, but I think the game is simplisticly beautiful (also, I grew up in the 90s--graphics don't matter to me). The game runs perfectly on my older non-gaming laptop, so that's also a plus for those of you looking for a large scale warfare game that can play on a toaster. There are some glitches, although nothing game-breaking (people spawned on the outside of a castle wall in 2/500 or so sieges I played, and I once had to sit out one siege because I fell through a crack in a floor of a castle tower and floated perpetually until my soldiers won the battle without me and I could exit). The character animations are a bit stiff, but I actually like them that way; it brings humor to the game for me, and if any future Mount & Blade doesn't have the stiff animations, I'll miss them.\n\nMount & Blade: Warband took 90 hours of my life away in the past week, and very few games can pull me in so relentlessly. This game is one of my personal favorites, along with Mount & Blade (I haven't tried With Fire & Sword yet, but it's only a matter of time). A solid 10/10 from me. Buy this game. Buy it now, and let it consume you. :)","February 21, 2015","true","159.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Part of this was due to the phenomenal mod community, but the game was no pushover either. When Warband came around, TaleWorlds made it even better. Warband's got better graphics, animations, and sound, and the combat "feels" better. It's also got more to see and do, including becoming king or queen of the lands, as well as courtship & marriage. Throw multiplayer in the mix and you have one great medieval sandbox.

Probably the only medieval RPG/War Simulation/Sandbox/Strategy game that I know of. Wake up in the land of Calradia - Where six factions fight for the land. Find yourself in the lowest caste of the Dark Ages. A deserter, a slave or bandit - Or be a noble lady daringly looking for adventure. Raise an army and pledge alliance under one of the existing factions - Or be bold enough to rebel and create your own faction.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that you can be Anyone in Calradia. If you feel like protecting your king at all costs - then that's your game. Want to be a savage bandit and burn every village you see - your game. Want to play as a useless merchant with a merc army fighting for you - your game. Maybe as the strategist where you sit back with a few of your men on your battlefield, while you carefully execute your plan of attack. I have tried all different roles, and they all give me this excitement for every battle.\n\nYou can choose to become the ultimate killing machine by not training an army but only yourself. You will gain most experience for each kill rather than every battle won, so while you are extremely strong and undefeated - your army might be really weak and untrained. While being the strategist, you might have very well knowledge in leading your troops, but you do little damage yourself. So there are a lot of different ways to approach this game, and you will sink countless of hours into it.\n\nIn the early stages of the game, you pretty much just hunt down bandits for villages and vassals. Slowly you will recruit a small army and gain som renown. Mid-game is all about getting a good relation with one/several of the Kings - to secure your role. When strong enough you can choose to enter late-game by leading your faction to domination, or break out to become the ruler of your own faction: Acquire land and start getting vassals under yourself. All this plus a lot of side quests, such as getting married or starting a merchant business gives countless amounts of replayablitiy.\n\nThe multiplayer scene is Very interesting as well, with huge battles up to 250 players (!). It only consists of battlefields though, and not the coveted co-op/versus mode on the single-player map. Imagine you and your friends fighting over Calradia's many castles and towns. Something I really wish for in Mount & Blade 2.\n\nThis game is for you if you like Medieval/Sandbox/Strategy/Simuator games, and wants to spend 100+ hours on building your army and faction.","March 19, 2012","true","224.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

There is no real story to the game other than the story you decide to create, which makes this a different type of RPG than we've come to expect. I have not had the chance to play the original; However, the graphics for Warband look a bit dated and the slightly wider than normal field of view seemed to give me a little bit of a headache. The open world aspect of the game makes up for the visual limitations, though the tutorial I thought was a little awkward.\n\nMount & Blade: Warband also has a multiplayer mode and comes with the ability to be modded. There are a couple of Downloadable content packs, Napoleonic Wars which is for multiplayer, and Viking Conquest which is for single player. There is also a newly released edition of the game called the Reforged Edition, which is supposed to be an improvement to the game, though I have not had the chance to look into this further. In all, I think Mount & Blade: Warband was fun for an RPG, but I would have liked some kind of story. It has some drawbacks visually, but makes up for it with versatility and player customization.

There is no hand-holding, and even though you can change the difficulty it is still realistic because no matter how well-armored your character might be, you can still be brought down by a well-placed spear thrust or arrow.

A legion of modders have worked to improve the ultra-realistic combat settings and given players even more places and soldier-types to rend, maim, and kill.","August 1, 2013","true","322.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is on his way to London to propose to his veterinarian girlfriend, Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), and his unflappable cat, Garfield, is determined to be there when Jon pops the big question. Of course, Garfield wouldn't go anywhere without his old pal Odie, and soon after arriving in the land of Big Ben, the clueless tomcat inadvertently changes places with royal look-a-like Prince. It seems that Prince's owner, Lady Eleanor, has recently passed away, leaving the care of her sprawling estate Castle Carlyle in the capable paws of her devoted kitty companion. The trouble is, Prince has decided it's due time for a vacation, and with Garfield in charge there's no telling what kind of trouble will befall Castle Carlyle. Despite having a devoted butler named Smithee (Ian Abercrombie) to cater to his every whim and a whole host of fun-loving critters with whom to pass the lazy days spent lounging in the sun, this crowned head begins to feel the sting of deceit as the envious Lord Dargis (Billy Connolly) hatches a dastardly plan to do away with the whiskered heir and claim Castle Carlyle all to himself. Meanwhile, as Garfield attempts to hold his ground against his greedy would-be nemesis, the fun-loving Prince is living it up with Jon and Odie by taking a trip to some of London's most popular pubs. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","January 5, 2014","true","36.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","3"

They're both completely different.\n\nSingleplayer is more a worldmap strategy RPG. Once you get into battle it's a 3rd-person midieval battle simulator. There are many mods for singleplayer to fit it to a theme or playstyle of your liking. It is a very diverse and interesting game, with almost countless hours of gameplay.\n\nMuliplayer is also amazing. The combat is perfect. Simply swing or block -up left down right-. There are more advanced features to sword combat that make this more of a skill-based game. Ontop of that there are archers and cavalry. The game is balanced and broken in all the right ways. It is total caos in the battlefield, bringing many a good laugh along with it. There are also many multiplayer mods that make for an interesting expereince.\n\nOveralll, this is one of the best games I have EVER played. Mostly becuase it gives the user a diverse experience through the differing modes and mods. There are so many things to do in this game, you just have to try it for yourself.","November 25, 2013","true","390.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Intrigued, I booted up the demo and started playing. I must have played the demo hundreds of times. It was some of the best fun I had ever had with a game. It may be listed as an RTS, but it is so much more than that. I can think of no other game that drops you right in the middle of the action, forcing you to charge in at the front lines rather than float above the clouds and click soldiers around a tiled map. Is it perfect? Certainly not. But no game is perfect. And any sort of problems you may run into can be solved by waiting. They usually clear up very soon. The quests, the characters, the world, and the gameplay in general all have a certain wonder about them, making it a must-play for all fans of medieval and strategy alike.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10 - A wonderful game that can suck you in and cause you to lose countless hours.

Warband is basically the same game as Mount & Blade with a lot of new features, fixes and content added, most of which was taken straight out of the various mods available for the original. The only original thing Warband adds, and perhaps the most important thing, is the multi-player.\n\nOne of the first and most sweeping additions is an enhanced skirmish mode as well as a full fledged multi-player. In you were pretty much limited to some preset skirmish maps which have now been replaced with a number of maps, modes and the ability to customize both your army, your enemies and your own character which makes for a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nAnother new addition that gives you something to do outside is the addition of multi-player. Although Mount & Blade was never designed for with multi-player in mind it is something the fans have been asking for since the beginning and much to everyone's surprise, it works wonderfully. The multi-player is reminiscent of a regular big battle in the main game with the notable difference that every enemy and ally is controlled by a real human, something that ups the difficulty dramatically and opens up a number of different tactics to use.\n\nThe single-player additions are all very nice but they also all things that were already available through the many mods available and as such they are not really that big of an improvement except for those players that don't use mods. There is a big graphical overhaul that helps shake off a little of a beta product feel the original game had, the animations and texture quality is still pretty low though. You also get a new faction based on Islamic medieval which is pretty nice but unfortunately it doesn't really fill in any of the unit niches that the other factions do. Politics have been greatly improved by including the ability to create your own faction which was only available through mods before.\n\nAll in all Warband is a great improvement over the original Mount & Blade although I wouldn't exactly go as far as to call it a true sequel, it's a stand-alone expansion. And although all the improvements make for a much stronger base game almost all of these improvements were already available through mods with the exception of the multi-player which makes the game feel somewhat lacking for someone that has played the mods. That being said, the multi-player is an awesome addition and loads of fun and in particular if you get the Napoleonic DLC you will find some of the most strategic hack and slash gameplay anywhere.","January 10, 2013","true","740.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I did manage to progress though and now I have conquered all of Calradia and have started a new game as a woman.\n\nThe multiplayer for Native is also very good as well, you get more money for killing people so evidently, those who are skilled will have the best armour and weaponry, this does lead to some unfair fights but it does provide a good challenge for those who wish to improve. Apart from that I can't think of anything wrong with Native mode.\n\nThen there is that mountain of mods.\n\nI have played a few of mods, Iron Europe, Nord invasion, AZW Reloaded, Blood in the West and Napoleonic Wars. The Napoleonic Wars mod is awesome. The multiplayer on it is the best and the community is great too. It is on this mod where you tend to get most of the regiments and all that, they do massive events which can have a max of 200 people in so of course, lag is inevitable. It's in these regiments were the majority of people rack up their gaming hours and who's to blame, they are genuinely fun things to partake in.\n\nI have not played much of the Iron Europe mod but that is mainly because not many go on it. If more played it then I would definately spend more time on it too. However, the way how people tend to fight on it is mostly through shooting, and if you get too close then people have the tendency to retreat and gun you down or throw a grenade at you. There is definately some good potential for this mod though.\n\nThe Nord Invasion mod is basically you and a maximum of 15 other people against waves of Nords. In order to progress you must make an account on the Nord Invasion website, through this you buy the equipment that you want and even level up. It is rather addicting and the last wave is quite the challenge. The way to win in this mod is through teamwork and also having good equipment. It is not hard to get good equipment as a lot can be picked up in the map for you to use, as well as this, you don't even need to kill Nords to acquire xp, you get it simply for near those who get kills.\n\nThe AZW Reloaded mod, which is a Zulu Wars mod, for me needs a fair bit of patching because, for me it I had great big grey bars coming from the bots which obscured half the screen, however, the mod I believe has plenty of potential once it's fixed. The mod allows you to play as either the Zulus or the British and the maps will be historically based, such as Rorkes Drift etc. In terms of activity there are not many players and even less server.\n\nThe Blood in the West mod is Lord of the Rings based. IT's focused primarily on the single play and the map is of Middle Earth. At the moment it only has the major factions, such as Rohan, Mordor, Gondor, Elves and Dwarves. I think though that over time more will be added. I have been unable to play it much due to the fact that it keeps crashing but from what I have been able to play, it does look really good. The background music is all from the LOTR soundtracks and it even has the main characters and beasts, such as the Fell Beast and the Troll. I have not tried the multiplayer so I shall not talk about that but I would highly recommend this mod provided that you can play it.\n\n10/10","February 19, 2014","true","980.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Warband is an entire genre of its own, merging a sandbox RPG world with feudal politics and a complex simulation of combat. Miles ahead of its competitors, Warband's single-player mode offers a near infinite amount of replayability, and its online mode further emphasizes the brilliance of its combat system.\n\nEasily a 10/10, Warband is further supplemented by a host of breathtaking mods which can be found at the Taleworlds forums and Mod DB. My personal favourites are:\n\n1. 1257 AD: an incredible historic overhaul which brings Warband into medieval Europe, as well as introduces a host of other improvements\n2. The Deluge: a historical overhaul that brings Warband into 17th century Eastern Europe, inspired by Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel.\n3. A Clash of Kings: Fantastic overhaul that brings Warband into the world of Game of Thrones.\n4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGreyPilgrim/recommended/48700/","TheGreyPilgrim","=[EqE]= Gandalf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGreyPilgrim/","13 products in account","Great game! Spend endless hours exploring and adventuring over the war-torn world of Calradia. Choose to join a faction, become a mercenary, or unite the land under one banner, Your banner. Though at times it may seem tedious, or even hard, being able to mout the fastest horse and wear the best armour  to tank through the enemy ranks is one of the greatest glories of gaming.\n\nMultiplayer in this game is... interesting to say the least. Band together with other soldiers in "Battle", "Team deathmatch", and "Seige" modes to crush your enemy into a pulp. If being a lone wolf is your thing, "Deathmatch" mode gives you the opportunity to show your melee skills (Darn archers!) as the greatest there is. However, be ye warned! The multiplayer community is not for those with quick temper or weak constitution; this is because, in short, the majority of players you will meet are rude and will insult you for nearly anything. Racism abounds here.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars DLC is, in a word, wonderful. This expansion is solely multiplayer, which is rather disappointing, but makes up for it in its vibrant community. Choose from five different factions each with historical units that fought during the age of Napoleon's conquests. The game modes are the same as Native, but the battles are truley a sight to behold. Able to support over two-hundred real time players, soldiers can coordinate attacks and defenses to foil the plans of the opposing team.\n\nI heartily recommend that joining a Regiment brings out the full potential of this DLC. A regiment is a group of players that fight together as a team, oftentimes communicating through teamspeak programs. Playing in a regiment has been one of the best experiences in this game for me, and a great host of others.\n\nMods for this game are many; some good, others not so good. I have to say I have two favorites, one singleplayer and the other multiplayer. "1257 AD" is a great sp mod, overhauling the world map to that of Europe. There are many more nations to join than Native, and a larger selection of units. The best MP mod (In my opinion at least!) is North and South, which transforms the Napoleonic Dlc into that of the American Civil War. There are many, many more mods, but I have not the space here to catalog them all, so go out there and look for them!\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 7/10 for the Sp experience, and a 8/10 for Mp.","January 28, 2013","true","951.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You really feel like a glorious warrior that is running down at the battlefield, charging towards the enemy.\n\nIn this game, you can lead your own army. Not in the Total War style, but be down there on the ground fighting as a general. If you die, your unit loses. Simple as that.\n\nEven though this game is old, it still has the amazing feel to it, and it has a very big replayability chance. Eventually, if you get bored of the native Mount & Blade: Warband, I recommend you to go check out Napoleonic Wars, which I have written a seperate review on.\n\nGo on now, young warrior, grab this game and proceed on to the battlefields!","March 22, 2015","true","589.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This would have been one of those games I'd have had a look at in the Steam store and then never considered again, but a fanboy-friend of mine convinced me otherwise, and boy, am I grateful for that.\n\nI usually have a strong dislike for all games that do not feature semi-photo-realism graphics. In fact, I was absolutely abhorred by the lack of a strong character-creation component. I loved Skyrim's and Dragon Age: Origin's character-creation. Hell, I even preferred some MMORPG's character graphics over this game's. I had to force myslef to stop whining and actually try the game. And when I did, I found that the true gem that this game is, doesn't rely on graphics or beautification and landscapes to get you addicted, but rather on the absolutely amazing gameplay.\n\nThe game's combat system trumps that of any other game I've ever played, and the game offers you a wide variety of options to reach any end. Also, it recreates a much more realistic, much less sophisticated view on actual medieval feudal society. It also boasts a great warband combat system, as the name suggests. The options and formations take a while to grasp, but in the end, it's a system better than in any other game, as far as I know.","June 7, 2014","true","143.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The only problem I see are poorer-quality graphics.\n\nThis game is radiculously addicting in general. It is a fun and challanging sandbox that takes place in the continent of "Calradia". Although the singleplayer is fun, multiplayer makes up a large part of the game. The best part about this game, in my opinion, is the community. It is very easy to install mods on Warband, all you really need is Winrar. The first mod I ever tried out was Persistent World in the spring of 2013. I woke up Monday morning, and just like that, I was sitting next to my computer on Friday wondering where the hell my break went. This is a great game. I highly recommend picking it up.

This is a fairly low-budget, open world RPG in which you create a relatively simple player background, leaving much to be created in your own imagination.\n\nWhile some may see this as a limitation, it's also a huge advantage for people who want to create their own identity within the game and focus on role-playing. You also choose one of the regions to start in, all of which have their strengths and limitations, for instance Vaegir are great at ranged combat, but not so skilled with two-handed weapons, although this doesn't effect your characters abilities, simply the types of enemies and available weaponry.\n\nPart of what makes this game so great is the fact that you could literally role-play anything you wanted, an honourable knight, a brutal raider, or anything inbetween. You slowly build up your band of warriors and complete quests, you start earning the real money when you join your first military campaign by swearing an oath to a king. You can lead on to amassing an empire of property and riches, conquering the world map and even become a king yourself! (with enough time of course)\n\nThe combat system is by far the highlight of the game, with excellent sword-play both on and off horseback. It doesn't over-complicate things while keeping you fully invested in the battles. While archery is fun, I find it to be nothing too special, and if the enemies go heavy on shields, it's really hard to hit anything.\n\nThe two DLCs seem to be hit-or-miss however, Napoleonic Wars is only multiplayer, so unless you get really into that it's not worth it. Viking Conquest looks like it could be great, but it's filled with unsolved bugs. [EDIT: Viking Conquest Reforged seems to have resolved many issues, but still, buyers beware.]\n\nThere is also an array of excellent workshop items and mods that completley transform the games setting, graphics and even overhaul the entire combat system with the game allowing you to switch between mods the the original game wth a simple drop down menu, giving immense amounts of replayability.\n\nI highly recommend picking up the core game as soon as possible.","January 5, 2015","true","84.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/recommended/48700/","keenzor","Keen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/","958 products in account","What exactly is Mount & Blade? Partly it is a medieval fighting simulator, partly role playing game and partly a strategy game. All of this is present in this huge chunk of buggy code wrapped in mediocre graphics. But that is little too harsh, because this game has something to overcome all of this. Flawless gameplay.\n\nYou start by creating your character in not too deep creator. There is couple of background choices which will determine your stats. Stats are the RPG part of the game, you get all the basics like strenght, agility and intelligence, followed by skills that determine your abiliy to hold shields, ride a horse or get better prices from traders. At the very last there are the weapon stats, those are here to tell you how well you will fare with different kind of weapons. You can choose between bows, crossbows, short or long swords, spears and polearms.\n\nAfter you are done spending your points, you get a piece of the fighting simulator. You get thrown into an one on one fight without any sort of tutorial, this game is expansion after all, so you should already know everything right? Well, in case you did not play the original... Generally you use left mouse button for attacking and right mouse button for defending. That's pretty common right? But that is obviously not everything. By moving the mouse to either of four directions (right, left, up, down) prior to the swing you determine the manner of the attack. To add more fun to this, you can do the same while defending, so basically you have to check your opponent's movement and react fast enough to block. However if you are not up to the challenge you can use automatic blocking, in this case you will only need to time the block and the direction will be automatically chosen by computer. So that's it, quite simple is it not? Other weapons are similar with small differences mostly in possible manners of attacking. Ranged weapons are even more challenging. There is no aim indicator and arrows, bolts or javelins respect the laws of gravity, so it will take a while to get used to it.\n\nWell, that was quite elaborate description of fighting system, I hope I did not bore you. This leaves us with strategy part of the game. So yeah, after you finish your first fight you get your first quest (yep, another sign of rpg) and end up on a huge map, not too unlike Total War world maps, but way uglier, and move your character around. Everything is in real time, but since the time stops everytime your character stops, in principle the game is more similar to turnbased games. So there you are on a huge map, large groups of enemies moving around you. You may try to challenge one of the groups yourself and find out, that you are no hero, just another warrior who gets butchered when facing more than 2 or 3 enemies at once. At this point you get to one of the villages and recruit yourself a bunch of peasants. Soon enough you will find that peasants are more like meat shields and die a lot, but with a piece of luck and good commander (you) they can make it as far as to knighthood. This all sounds more like tactics than strategy right (wink)? Well, to be honest I am not sure how it works in vanilla (unmodded) game, since after original Mount & Blade, in Warband I started with mods right away.\n\nYes, mods are the greatest thing that could have happened to this game. The basics are great but the game itself needed helluva lot of polishing to become a legend. There are tons of mods ready to be tried and some of them are really robust. I myself am using Floris mod pack (to be find on nexusmods.com) which combines many different mods improving graphics and gameplay alike. And the strategy part I was talking about is part of this mod, since in here, before the fight starts you get to strain your mind by choosing how will your units behave during the battle. You had probably already guessed that I think that Mount & Blade: Warband is a good game, well you are right, but with mods, it becomes a GREAT game.","January 2, 2014","true","175.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It's fairly easy to mod your game yourself with a bit of reading, and there are many existing mods that add so much to the game.\n-Serious multiplayer. It's comparable to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but with a more mature fanbase and more serious people. Also, regiments.\n-Developers of this game are having a nice amount of contact with players through the forums and the beta tests.\n-A great amount of different troops, approaches and tactics. There is something for everyone, charging in with heavy cavalry or laying back with a pack of archers and crossbowmen. In battle, you can give orders to either Everyone, Infantry, Archery, Cavalry or a user-set group of units, giving you the maximum amount of control during battles and using your troops as efficiently as possible.\n\nOnce you start a new game, you might want to build up a force as soon as possible because the bandits will ♥♥♥♥ you up if you don't have a big enough force of men.","February 12, 2013","true","178.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Not much really, This game really is impressive. After playing on it for hundreds of hours I can truly say this is a Go-To game, I'm not doing anything, Mount and Blade, easy as that. While it has its bugs and in some areas shows clear signs of underdevelopement (<not even a word) it truly is something of an innovation so to speak, Napoleonic Wars for instance is my main reason for this, I mean who has seen any other FPS set in the Napoleonic Wars era? While the graphics could be considered lacking the gameplay is the reason this game is what it is. Shooting, Melee, Artillery, Musicians. Whatever you want from a Napoleonic era war game, It's there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/recommended/48700/","keenzor","Keen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/","958 products in account","What exactly is Mount & Blade? Partly it is a medieval fighting simulator, partly role playing game and partly a strategy game. All of this is present in this huge chunk of buggy code wrapped in mediocre graphics. But that is little too harsh, because this game has something to overcome all of this. Flawless gameplay.\n\nYou start by creating your character in not too deep creator. There is couple of background choices which will determine your stats. Stats are the RPG part of the game, you get all the basics like strenght, agility and intelligence, followed by skills that determine your abiliy to hold shields, ride a horse or get better prices from traders. At the very last there are the weapon stats, those are here to tell you how well you will fare with different kind of weapons. You can choose between bows, crossbows, short or long swords, spears and polearms.\n\nAfter you are done spending your points, you get a piece of the fighting simulator. You get thrown into an one on one fight without any sort of tutorial, this game is expansion after all, so you should already know everything right? Well, in case you did not play the original... Generally you use left mouse button for attacking and right mouse button for defending. That's pretty common right? But that is obviously not everything. By moving the mouse to either of four directions (right, left, up, down) prior to the swing you determine the manner of the attack. To add more fun to this, you can do the same while defending, so basically you have to check your opponent's movement and react fast enough to block. However if you are not up to the challenge you can use automatic blocking, in this case you will only need to time the block and the direction will be automatically chosen by computer. So that's it, quite simple is it not? Other weapons are similar with small differences mostly in possible manners of attacking. Ranged weapons are even more challenging. There is no aim indicator and arrows, bolts or javelins respect the laws of gravity, so it will take a while to get used to it.\n\nWell, that was quite elaborate description of fighting system, I hope I did not bore you. This leaves us with strategy part of the game. So yeah, after you finish your first fight you get your first quest (yep, another sign of rpg) and end up on a huge map, not too unlike Total War world maps, but way uglier, and move your character around. Everything is in real time, but since the time stops everytime your character stops, in principle the game is more similar to turnbased games. So there you are on a huge map, large groups of enemies moving around you. You may try to challenge one of the groups yourself and find out, that you are no hero, just another warrior who gets butchered when facing more than 2 or 3 enemies at once. At this point you get to one of the villages and recruit yourself a bunch of peasants. Soon enough you will find that peasants are more like meat shields and die a lot, but with a piece of luck and good commander (you) they can make it as far as to knighthood. This all sounds more like tactics than strategy right (wink)? Well, to be honest I am not sure how it works in vanilla (unmodded) game, since after original Mount & Blade, in Warband I started with mods right away.\n\nYes, mods are the greatest thing that could have happened to this game. The basics are great but the game itself needed helluva lot of polishing to become a legend. There are tons of mods ready to be tried and some of them are really robust. I myself am using Floris mod pack (to be find on nexusmods.com) which combines many different mods improving graphics and gameplay alike. And the strategy part I was talking about is part of this mod, since in here, before the fight starts you get to strain your mind by choosing how will your units behave during the battle. You had probably already guessed that I think that Mount & Blade: Warband is a good game, well you are right, but with mods, it becomes a GREAT game.","January 2, 2014","true","175.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Get yourself good wepons and armor! I love this game so much. Both stratergy aswell as fighting skills is requierd. Not only you get to fight other enemys. You get to command a army that you built up by choosen troops! with loads of commands. And you need money to your army and yourself. How will you make it? However you want! Raid villages. Fight bandits. Do quests. Sell yourself as a mercenary to a faction. Join a faction as a vassal and get a fief! (village,town,castle that you own and get taxex from) You can choose wich faction you want! (And/Or make your own faction! become king or queen take over lands conquer all of calradia!) but its hard to become a vassal. You will need much renown. Get it by fighting enemys. the bigger enemy army and the smaller your army is the more renown you get! (if you defeat them) Theres so much to think about. If you make the wrong choises it might f*ck you up later on. for example raiding someones village and then he gets p*ssed off and attacks you with a huge army. Defeats you and your army is dead or taken prisoners and you loose some of your stuff and money. You need food aswell to not starve your army. Then you need money and you need to buy it at towns or villages. if your troops morale is to low they might desert you (leave your army) so you need to keep your morale up by raiding villages, having good food, defeating enemys, dont just stand still and do nothing ofr a week. And make sure you can pay them every week. Or play the multiplayer! huge sieges on castles or battles with real players. Even though its a pretty old game it's still alot of players online. Up to 200 Player servers thats not always full but sometimes. but atleast 150 players. and it has thousands of mods, and hundreds of great mods, everything from graphics mods, mods that adds a few things, to huge mods that changes the map all the towns and castles and villages the troops and the factions. there are a mod inspired by game of thrones. the a clash of kings mod. and a mod inspired by warhammer. warsword conquest. the american revolution, and TONS of more exellent mods. aswell as it has an dlc. Napoleonic wars. fight with other players in lines. be a commander giving commands to other real players. besiege castles. fire cannons. be a builder and build bridges over water to make your troops able to get into the fight faster. or build sandbags to protect them from bullets. I would give this game 10/10! WARNING: if you really get into this game. It can be really addicting and you wont touch your other games for a while :3 now why are you reading this review still? go buy it alredy.","June 6, 2014","true","363.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I decided its time to say exactly why I've spent this much time playing it.\n\nWarband is a game that attempts many things, being a medieval combat sim, a sandbox, a RPG of sorts, and much more. It has many strengths and a few weaknesses.\n\nPROS:\nStrong modding community. There are hundreds of innovative and fun mods that reall revamp the game and add new life to it each time you play.(To name a few, Blood and Steel, A New Dawn, cRPG(this ones MP), Perisnio, and thats not even scratching the surface).\n\nInfinite replay value. Each time you replay you can do something completly new and different\n\nThe melee combat is somewhat difficult to learn but once you do its innovative and always fun\n\nMultiplayer in just native is somewhat boring, but there are a few mods that add tons of new stuff. Like Persistent World which makes it sort of like an MMO, cRPG which adds consistent characters, and I'm sure there are a few more.\n\nCONS:\nLack of things to do in Native gets a bit boring.\n\nRanged in base game and most mods is very overpowered.","February 1, 2011","true","521.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, this is the game for you.  Pick up your favorite melee weapon and get up close to your enemy so you can see that look on his face just before you stab him in it.\n\nA good analogy for how multiplayer works in this game is Counterstrike without the guns.  You start each round with a set amount of cash and some free equipment and then pick and choose between your nation's weapons/armor of choice and then take to the field and try not to get yourself killed while hopefully taking a few of the enemy out along the way.  In addition to excellent infantry related combat, archery, cavalry and horse-archery are all represented as well if being a ground pounder isn't your thing.\n\nAlso, although the multiplayer is a real blast, the game also features a great sandbox-style (think Sid Meier's Pirates) singleplayer game where you start off as a lowly peasant and work your way up to leading huge armies and ruling your own kingdom. There is no linear storyline or hand-holding you here, the game is what you make of it. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a general from the Total War series from a first or third person perspective, this game will somewhat give you that experience. If you have a high-end gaming rig, you can set the battle size up to like 500+ units on screen at once (with a small third-party tool).\n\nThe game's graphics aren't on the cutting edge of current technology, but they allow for huge battles.  Where the game really shines is in its combat.  It's one of the few games I've ever seen where you control your attack/block directions.  Watching 2 pro's go at it is akin to watching a well coreographed movie fight.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. You just don't see GOOD medieval combat anywhere really. This isn't some button hammering console combat game. Check out the demo!","November 20, 2010","true","181.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Traditionally this is called sandbox - the problem with most sandbox titles is there is literally no direction. Warband avoid that weakness while still allowing you to feel the freedom and be inspired by it.\n\nThe gameplay can be either simplified or incredibly unrelenting. The difficulty settings alone can make two games entirely different in every way. I enjoy playing an unstoppable warlord, a beast of death and carnage, a visage of loss and trauma to all who stand against me (I play on the easiest settings, which makes my troops take far less damage and inflict greater damage to enemy units). Or you can boost the difficulty and turn it into a fairly realistic army game, where your troops are just as easy to kill as the enemy.\n\nMany games will give you a sense of power, but few capture the feeling of charging down a hillside with 50 armored knights at your back and crashing into the enemy formation.\n\nFor the price, you will not find a better game on planet earth. And this doesn't even begin to touch on all the mods created by a hugely inventive and dedicated community. Seriously, buy the game. Give it ten hours to learn the ropes and you will love it.

It takes a lot of time you spend practicing every class to be as good as most veteran players are nowadays.\nSo if you buy this game, play Native or even the Singleplayer at first, then move on to mods like Mercenaries or c-RPG or play the DLC Napoleonic: Wars which costs 10 Euros.\nIf you want to know more about c-RPG, check out the guide I've written!","March 8, 2013","true","902.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I decided its time to say exactly why I've spent this much time playing it.\n\nWarband is a game that attempts many things, being a medieval combat sim, a sandbox, a RPG of sorts, and much more. It has many strengths and a few weaknesses.\n\nPROS:\nStrong modding community. There are hundreds of innovative and fun mods that reall revamp the game and add new life to it each time you play.(To name a few, Blood and Steel, A New Dawn, cRPG(this ones MP), Perisnio, and thats not even scratching the surface).\n\nInfinite replay value. Each time you replay you can do something completly new and different\n\nThe melee combat is somewhat difficult to learn but once you do its innovative and always fun\n\nMultiplayer in just native is somewhat boring, but there are a few mods that add tons of new stuff. Like Persistent World which makes it sort of like an MMO, cRPG which adds consistent characters, and I'm sure there are a few more.\n\nCONS:\nLack of things to do in Native gets a bit boring.\n\nRanged in base game and most mods is very overpowered.","February 1, 2011","true","521.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This medieval RPG, mixes Total War scale battles with action, it's a sandbox game, which means you can play litterly to no end. But the amount of detail put into this game is very impressive and makes it for a very good atmosphere. In general, it's a great game if you like the medieval era, the clash of swords and the strings of bows and especially a good challenge, for the combat system offers challenge equal to none in the video game industry.\n\nThere is a free demo on Steam that you can try, to get a feel for the game.\nIt is indeed a unique product.","April 22, 2012","true","95.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The selection of mods you are able to play is huge, the community great, it keeps you playing for thousands of hours. I myself only play the awesome (most awesome) mod c-RPG which already kept me playing for 3 and a half to 4 years. The thing I, and most of the community, love most at this game is the fighting system which requires a lot of skill if you want to be good and the community which keeps playing this game actively since almost release. So I give this game a huge 11/10 because it is the only game keeping me playing for over 4 years (actively). The fighting system is quite hard at the beginning but if you have someone who's better than you, ask him for training and you'll be a good warrior in no time. And for the beginners:\nDo not be frustrated if you cant reach scores like 20:3 in your first hundrer hours. It takes a lot of time you spend practicing every class to be as good as most veteran players are nowadays.\nSo if you buy this game, play Native or even the Singleplayer at first, then move on to mods like Mercenaries or c-RPG or play the DLC Napoleonic: Wars which costs 10 Euros.\nIf you want to know more about c-RPG, check out the guide I've written!","March 8, 2013","true","902.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not much really, This game really is impressive. After playing on it for hundreds of hours I can truly say this is a Go-To game, I'm not doing anything, Mount and Blade, easy as that. While it has its bugs and in some areas shows clear signs of underdevelopement (<not even a word) it truly is something of an innovation so to speak, Napoleonic Wars for instance is my main reason for this, I mean who has seen any other FPS set in the Napoleonic Wars era? While the graphics could be considered lacking the gameplay is the reason this game is what it is. Shooting, Melee, Artillery, Musicians. Whatever you want from a Napoleonic era war game, It's there. And now I've realised how much I've talked about this game, when I said there isn't much to talk about. In summary. GREAT GAME, If you can ignore the sometimes to frequent bugs and lag which may lead you to die rather abrubtly.\n\n\n\nAlso, If you play musician and expect mercy, It ain't gonna happen, If you surrender and you expect mercy, it definitely isn't gonna happen.\n\n\n\nMelee can be an absolute B**ch sometimes, don't expect to be any good at first.\n\n\n\n\n\nBIG TIP: DO NOT JOIN THE 15TH ROF, I got banned for having a life.

I love this game. Their is so much to do in Calradia. Become a vassal, siege castles, raid villages, build an army, attack others, soo much... but the main premise: Conquer Calradia. This is a daunting task and will take you many 100s, maybe thousands of hours of work to finish entirely. The factions, sarranids, rhodoks, swadia, khergit, nord and vaegirs you must conquer to "beat" the game. Theirs no ending screen, but It will rank you on a score if you retire from adventuring. 0-5000 something(I believe) it scores you on how well you live after an adventure (tavern keeper job, beggar, thief etc)\nI will quickly speak about the graphics, and most people say they arent great, which to be honest they arent AMAZING, but they are pretty damn good. They definitely have good detail on the armor and weapons, and the graphics are fairly decent enough where you honestly dont even care and just think about the gameplay.\nWell worth the $20, to be honest its worth alot more than that and I've seen it on sale dirt cheap, like $3.75.... If you are unsure try the demo or imagine these 2 games combined-  (the game is very unique so its hard to compare it to anything)  I would imagine skyrim with much better combat and battles combined with total war strategy components but alot better- A perfect blend of a strategy game and action rpg. But its not extremely confusing, at all. It's actually very, very simple. It's pretty easy to figure out, with just a quick tutorial, unlike other strategy games which make take 10-20 hours worth of tutorials to figure out all the mechanics, and how to actually play and not be insanely confusing. It's just one of those games you HAVE to play. It's insanely good. I can't express to you how good it is, you just have to play it. I sink too many hours into this game just making new accounts and playing new mods. Seriously. This game is amazing.

This medieval RPG, mixes Total War scale battles with action, it's a sandbox game, which means you can play litterly to no end. But the amount of detail put into this game is very impressive and makes it for a very good atmosphere. In general, it's a great game if you like the medieval era, the clash of swords and the strings of bows and especially a good challenge, for the combat system offers challenge equal to none in the video game industry.\n\nThere is a free demo on Steam that you can try, to get a feel for the game.\nIt is indeed a unique product.","April 22, 2012","true","95.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You create a character that can have many backrounds for RPing. When you start a bandit attacks you and the only little bit of story is started to help guide you. I won't say anything on that because this game is best experienced not knowing the setup/ mechanics.\n\nCombat\nThis games combat is extremely skill based. Each slash with the sword is directional for attacking and blocking. Bows and Arrows are not easy to use and horseback slaying is  satisfying If you have been looking for a game with ealistic medival combat then by god you have found the game for you.\n\nFactions\nI am not going to say much becuase each faction is cool and feels like a working breathing organism and only after playing 100 hours I have only scratched their surface. By the time you have picked one you will become fiercly loyal to their cause/conquests. You will argue over with your friends who is the best as each has its own pros cons.\n\nDiplomacy\nDiplomacy can be conducted by anyone and usually requires knowledge of each npc's likes and needs. This is how you rise through the ranks in factions but in my opinion can only consist of doing a bunch of varied fetch quests. There are mods like Diplomacy that you can find on the workshop that greatly enhance the experince. All these come toghether and make it feel like your character is just another part in a breathing dynamic world. That is why this game succeds and some rpgs dont because by god its addicting.\nMods\nThey are god, really good. I suggest try the ones on Workshop and then venture off into Moddbs hardcore/ original mods.\nSummary\nBuy it, stop reading, buy it. It has first person shooting is has thridperson it has everything.  Now go venture off into Calradia.","May 15","true","111.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bacxaber/recommended/48700/","bacxaber","Bacxaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bacxaber/","186 products in account","Truly an amazing find. Despite being an older game with outdated graphics, the gameplay is unparalleled and very, very entertaining. The main selling point however, is the opportunities the game gives you to create your own deep and intricate story. I've only run into one or two glitches in the game, and neither were crippling. I would definitely recommend getting this. However, this isn't to say that the game is perfect. Far from it. Here's a list of things it could improve on:\n\n1: Less prerequisites for marriage. Unless you're Stud McHotmuffin and you succeed your eloping proposal on the first try, there's like, 20 things you gotta do to marry someone. You need their father's approval, which means doing over ten fetch quests for him (or many more if you've previously fought him in battle, which would first require a hefty bribe to get him to even listen to you). Then, you need to pay him gold for some reason (remember kids, women aren't people in medieval games). THEN, have the father remain in the game for the whole process. Why's this an issue? Well, paying him then sets up a waiting period of like, 13-30 turns. If he gets exiled from the continent in that time (which he almost always does, since you need to be a high level to successfully romance anyone, and by that point, only a few factions remain), your marriage is broken forever. You can't "leave" the relationship, either. So you're f*cked. This happened to me.\n\nNow, I'll explain the whole exilation thing in my second point.\n2: No exilations. See, generals cannot be "killed". They get knocked out instead. This is stupid in and within itself, but here's how the game handles this predicament. EVENTUALLY, a general will anger their king, and they'll be fired from duty. This makes them join another faction. Once they've been exiled from all factions, they get exiled from the continent. AKA they get deleted from the game.\nWhy can't we have, like, a small chance of killing them, rather than this crazy bullsauce? It's arbitrarily complicated.\n\n3: Better fighting mechanics. True, the large-scale battles are the best I've ever seen. That does not mean the game has good combat mechanics. They're just so stiff and awful. It's one of those "jerk the camera to the right to swing right" kinda deals. Attacks that are just clicks with no mouse-swinging are far weaker than other attacks, and most of the time (guaranteed for polearms) they will do 0 damage.  Also, blocking is OP in this f*cking game. It just sweeps anything you can throw at them.\n\n4: More things to do. There are taverns, but you can't drink at them. The most you can do is buy everyone else a round, which gives you a +1 in that city. There are a few instrument weapons in the game's code, so why can't we play instruments? Being a bard is one of the backstory choices, after all.\n\n5: Cheaper costs. It's nearly impossible to get far in this game without loads of gold, and the grinding required to get said gold takes too long (and is too difficult. You can't grind for gold because you don't have that shiny new sword that costs 60 billion Zimbabwean dollars)\n\n6: The ability to give a standard uniform to each unit type that we control, assuming they're part of our own faction.\n\n7: The ability to improve armour and weapons. You see, there are a variety of "tiers" a piece of equipment can be, but it's all randomized. There's no way of improving a "rusty teutonic helm", it's just a low-quality helm forever. However, I like the idea that horses lose tiers by getting killed in battle. That's a thing.","May 25, 2014","true","129.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

In case if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥, and you forgot the title of this game already: this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Mount & Blade: Warband. This game doesn't run off fancy graphics, or modern physics.

I'm saying it's a game for real men. If your balls are low, and blessed with a fine carpet patch of hair, this is the game for you.

You can become Emperor of Calradia, so, are you ready to accomplish it?\nIf that is not enough, you can choose one of these tons of mods, which were created for this game. There is something that will fit your taste. They add so much to the game, it's incredible.\n\nThe Multiplayer mode is great. There is no other adjective to describe it, I spent over 2000 hours of my life on Multiplayer alone. The skill level, which you can achieve, is fairly comparable to Counter Strike, Warcraft, Starcraft, Dota, League of Legends or any other major eSports title. Mount&Blade Warband comes along with an unique melee fighting system, which allows a lot of moves, tactics and all that other stuff you expect. Various game modes increase the replayability of Multiplayer, although Duel, Siege and Battle would be fairly enough to keep you playing, once you grasped the spirit of this game, for months or like me, for years.\nWhat increases the value of multiplayer again is the fact that this game is kept alive by the community, which developed an active competetive scene with tournaments, leagues and clans.\nThere are also mods for Multiplayer, with the DLC Napoleonic Wars and cRPG being by far the most popular.\n\nAll in all, if you've got the guts to climb the learning wall this game has, it will provide you with an incredible amount of fun, replayability and, probably, addiction.\nMount&Blade franchise games are often reduced, so you can grab them for not much money.\n\nGood luck.","October 25, 2013","true","999.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

First off you dont really know what the hell youre doing in the Campaign which is a completley open sandbox to do whatever the hell you want. You can become a thief and prey upon poor villagers or merchant caravans or plundering villages on a whim. Or you could be a lord and fight for your king alongside other lords (you also get lands). You could be a king/queen and start your own faction by conquering castles and recruiting lords from other factions or from companions found in taverns. Each faction also has different play styles. The khergits for ex. are 99% horsemen. Whereas the nords are 100% infantry.\n\nBut my favorite part about this game is the pvp....IT IS NOT A PAY TO WIN SYSTEM (after all you did pay 15 bucks to get the game) Each game you start with a certain amount of money to buy equipment for a certain class (archer,cavalry,footman) Though the equipment does help in battle youu get money by killing enemies, which gets you better equipment in that one game. Next game your money is reset and then off to the killing fields.\n\n-Got run over by a stray horse\n-Got pegged in the face with a throwing axe\n-Got kicked off a wall by a teamate\n-Kicked that teamate off a wall\n-Got impaled by a lance\n-Glitched off a siege tower and got blasted to the moon\n-Kicked a guy in the nuts and killed him\n-Got murdered by a cult of naked men armed with sticks\n-Got a headshot across the map\n-Got headshotted across the map\n-Got brutally murdered by a nord with a giant axe\n-Smacked a guy in the face with a mallet\n-100/100 would play for eternity","November 15, 2014","true","528.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spam1985/recommended/48700/","spam1985","Spam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spam1985/","465 products in account","Wow this is a difficult game to describe. A sandbox action RPG set in a medieval land (fantasy, but realistic- no dragons, elves etc). After creating a character and completing a couple of short quests, the world is basically yours to explore and you can play as you please. You get money and/or xp by hunting bandits, pillaging, trading, selling prisoners, fighting tournaments, completing quests... and much more besides.\n\nThere are 6 factions all competing for control of the realm. You may decided to ally yourself with one of them, serving the King as a vassal, fighting his wars and seizing towns and castles. You may decided to assist a claimant to the throne, creating a rebel faction to usurp the current King, or you may proclaim youself King and create your own faction. Be aware that this is a dynamic and ever changing world- relations rise and fall, lands are conquered or pillaged, and lords may betray their King and defect. Every action has a consequence.\n\nThe game world is presented in a basic overworld map, switching to 3rd person upon entering a town, castle or village, or when in combat. The combat itself is the real meat of the game, allowing the player to swing, thrust or chop depending on the movement of the mouse. Riding on horseback also adds to the fun factor, and learning to time your strike as you gallop towards the enemy is key.\nYou may also recruit militia and companions into your party, and they will join you on the battlefield. They can be given commands (such as follow, hold and charge) and will also earn xp and level up. The command system is simple, but works well. If you don't want to get blood on your shiny new armour then sending your troops ahead to fight without you is often a legitimate option.\n\nThe game does have a few quirks that will annoy some people (such as companions bickering, complaining and abandoning you). Fortunately there is a program available to download (TweakMB) that allows you to easily tailor the gameplay mechanics to better suit you.\n\nBuy this game if you enjoy solid combat, open-ended gameplay and epic battles.","February 24, 2014","true","413.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's just a regular deathmatch, you choose weapons and armor, earn by killing others etc. and your job is to...kill enemy nothing else.\n#2 - Fighting = ¼\nIt's pretty bugged because you can spam with your attack animation making you unable to notice from which side actually enemy will attack. Looks like your enemy tries to strike you from right? You're wrong, he attacks you from above. That's the problem in fighting.\n\nSingleplayer :\n\n#1 - Story = ¿\nI can't actually tell if this game has a story, you're just in " Calradia " and there are few nations that will try to take lands from each other. You have three options - 1.Join nation and fight for your king   2.Make your own faction and try to capture each castle ( it's the hardest option ) 3.Meet claimants and help them recover their position then fight for them ( for some time they will stay in your party and be your soldier ). You can change it at anytime, you can be vassal one day and next day you'll make your own faction or you can help a claimant recover his throne then join a faction and fights against him.\n#2 - Battles = ½\nIt's just a regular battle but if you're cavalry...AI is really stupid, even when you choose the hardest options they are still imbeciles. They maybe have the power to knock you out with one hit when on horse but, it's easy to outsmart them. If you're using cavalry you're mostly impossible to lose a fight ( of course if you use mods to watch fights after being KOed ) since cavalry is OP you don't have to focus on archers or infantry but the problem with AI difficulty comes when you're trying to siege castle. They start to think, use shields and attack you in right time, also they will try to move back or charge at you etc.\nIf you're playing on easy then you just go with your sword like with a knife into a butter.\n#3 - Castles = ¾\nThey look nice from inside when you're visiting towns but... It's really annoying when you're walking around streets for 2-3 mins searching for guild master ( yes there are mods which help with this but still you're supposed to meet them atleast once ) Sometimes when you visit castle and you want to talk with for example a fellow vassal then you have go through all the castle then go upstairs ( Nords )\n#4 - Trading = ½\nIt's pretty nice that you can sell your stuff on marketplace but they have only limitted amount of denars ( currency )\nBut there are bugs like :\n\n-You have armor with 52 body protection and 12 leg protection - It's worth like 5.000 denars to buy but 800 to sell?\nalso buying armor with 54 body protection and 14 leg protection in the same marketplace is worth sometimes even like 80.000 denars so the hell is that?\n#5 - Units = ⅞\nAbout units, it's possible to notice difference in a normal soldier and veteran soldier, veteran has more damage, he moves back, uses block more often etc. while normal soldier is stupid and he just charges at you blocking your attacks like one per ten hits. They all look great and i really love how each faction has their own type of soldiers, for example. Rhodoks = Crossbowmans   Nords = Infantry   Swadia = Heavy cavalry.\n\nI recommend but I don't, use stuff i wrote as help to decide if you want to buy this game.","September 3, 2014","true","195.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Pre-heat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas 7.\n\nMeasure the flour and baking powder into a processor. Add the butter and process until a crumble, then add the sugar. Or make by hand by rubbing  the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.\n\nBeat the eggs together until blended and make up to a generous 300ml (1/2 pint) with the milk, then put about 2 tablespoons of the egg/milk aside in a cup for glazing the scones later. Gradually add the egg/milk mixture to the dry ingredients until you have a soft dough. It is far better that the scone mixture is on the wet side, sticking to your fingers, as the scones will rise better.\n\nTurn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and flatten it out with your hand, or use a rolling pin, to a thickness of 1-2 cm (1/2 – ¾ inch). Use a 5 cm (2 inch) fluted cutter to stamp out the dough by pushing the cutter straight down into the dough (as opposed to twisting the cutter) then lift it straight out. This ensures that the scones will rise evenly and keep their shape. Gently push the remaining dough together, knead very lightly then re-roll and cut more scones out as before.\n\nArrange the scones on the prepared baking trays and brush the tops with the reserved beaten egg/milk mixture to glaze. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the scones are well risen and golden. Cool on a wire rack, covered with a clean tea towel to keep them moist. Serve as fresh as possible, cut in half and spread generously with strawberry jam and top with a good spoonful of thick cream.\n\n\nHow to make Scones, I really shouldn't need to persuade you why to buy this.

This non-expensive sandbox masterpiece brings together the opportunity to do anything, from being a sellsword bandit mercenary trader to a kingmaking politic-intrigued warband-leading vassal, into strange places such as Calradia's three bickering kingdoms, its adjacent horseloving khanate and the neighbouring haughty sultanate. This game is full of surprises as battlefields change depending on your map's terrain and your party's location.\n\nInspiring one of the largest modding communities, Mount & Blade holds a great module system which prevents mod conflicts unlike other games (ahem BGS) and lets you fall on your knees to worship the old gods. You could go on an adventure into 1257 where religious war spreads its flame throughout the middle east and engulfs eastern europe, where the golden horde still scours for tribute in places where no king is seated, and where blood and steel would make a peasant into one of his lordships. This module would be one of my personal favorites.\n\nOf course I've left out one of many people's favorites, the multiplayer of Warband. Whether it be cRPG, Napoleonic Wars, or just the native module, the multiplayer experience is enjoyable. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the multiplayer (probably because I don't have anybody to play with) since there are always other games when I want to be competitive. Therefore, I won't say much on multiplayer.\n\nAre you still reading this? Man, you either must be really bored or really skeptical. I would have bought this game right off the bat after I read the words "non-expensive sandbox" but you know, that's just me. If you're into medieval galore, this game is a must buy. If you love sandboxes or maybe games which allows you to build armies and lead them into battle, this game is definitely for you. If you're into steampunkish or cyberpunkish games like the bioshock series and the fallout series respectively, then this game might not be for you. But who knows? You might like it.","December 22, 2013","true","091.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

HOWEVER.. the story for this is great, and its really fun to have large groups of women, but its a bit to much... every town is practically all women and all fights are led by women. I was looking for a bit more addition of females.. but beyond them taking up the sword for the shortage of men, it becomes amazon territory.  Fun in that aspect.. but not the total aspect I was after.. its not as impressive to be a female leading a band of females if everyone is female...\nBRYTANWALD.. must have!

Of course you will need an army, so gather recruits, train them into cool wariors trough your harsh training or even faster, from real fights, but that may end up getting some of them killed.\nAlso don't get too cocky on opponents, especialy if you choose to play realisticaly like i do (no exit without save, thus no loading back at a previous point). Don't forget to feed your troups otherwise they will starve and loose morale, win difficult fights and get morale and renown, bet on yourself and win in tournaments and get gold, participate at feasts, try to impress a lady.\nTired of being a mercenary? Choose a kingdom and swear a vassalage to the king if you have good enogh standing, and get feafs according to your contribution. You choose your way, whatever it may be, depending on what you like.\n\nI suggest buying this game which would get you over 100 hours in singleplayer. How do i know by having just 20 hours till now ? Because i firstly played this game outside of steam.

Single player is very open ended and will satisfy people looking for experiences as a merchant, a bandit, a bandit hunter, an assassin, a lord under a kings court, a rebel or even a king or a queen to name a few.

In my opinion, it's close to perfect. In the native module single player, the mix between the need for strategy and the way combat works is extemely clever. It's so unique that to compare it to a different game, you would need to compare it to multiple games. The closest I can think of for a single comparasin is a Total War game, but even that isn't not very close. You've got the map and different places you can go to on the map, but when you enter combat you need to comand your whole army as different parts while playing as your character. And that's where the similarities stop. I'd describe the whole game but you can look in the description for that. Don't let the video on the store page fool you. There's so much more to the game than that. It's also very confusing for the first few times you play so don't give up after a few days of playing. Otherwise I just want to recomend the game for anyone out there who likes strategy, medevil, RPG or realistic games at all.

You set your own goal - live a life as a mercenary, become a Lord of one of the kingdoms, join a claimant to a throne in his battle to take, as he/she thinks, his/her rightful place as king, or go against all of the kingdoms and create your own.\nYou start the game completely on your own in one of the capital cities of your liking where you happen to get your first quest. You then recruit soldiers for your troop and either be a good samaritan who takes care of the bandits and helps villages, or be the feared vandal by raiding caravans and villages.\n\nNow, putting together your troop and controlling it in battle is where the RTS part comes in.\n\nAll your soldiers can be put in groups (similar to ordinary RTS control groups which you select with the 0-9 keys) to always only select those soldiers you want, giving you a lot of control over them. In battles you can give them all sorts of commands you could think of, including, but not limited to, telling them to use only certain weapons that they possess.\n\nAnother special thing about this game is the very skill-based combat system.\nThe melee combat system is based on attacking from four directions and being able to block them - of course by blocking in the direction the swing comes from. This can be really tough sometimes when there's a lot of stuff going on or if your opponent has a rather fast weapon.\nYou can set up how you want to swing and block independently. Do you want it to work by going into the corresponding direction? Or only by mouse movement?\nIn singleplayer, for beginners, you can even enable automatic blocking. This will result in you only having to press the block button when a swing comes in, of course you still have to know when to block and when to swing. This setting does not apply to multiplayer though, there it is up to the server wether there's automatic blocking or not - but most likely you'll only be seeing automatic blocking in player vs bot games (there are special modules that are based on fending off enemy waves with other players).\n\nThe multiplayer mode is something that first came with Warband, and I think it's pretty solid for an indie game (except for some minor things, but later onto that).\nIt supports up to 250 players and several modes, including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Last man standing Deathmatch and of course castle siege, similar to sieging a castle in singleplayer.\n\nApart from all that great stuff the game also has an amazing mod support. Search moddb.com for Mount & Blade mods (for both the original game and Warband) and you'll understand what I mean.\n\nAs many pros as this game has, it also has a few cons.\n\nA big problem in multiplayer, similar to other games (like Chivalry, for example), are the trolls.\n\nThere are a lot of times when you have a lot of fun and fight a bunch of great battles, and then there's the trolls' prime time.\nAt that time, things are going to get messy. You randomly get hit, shot and kicked by a teammate just to annoy you and then that person just runs along as if nothing happened. When you try to take revenge, they will turn things around and make you look like the vermin, causing everyone to go at you. Classy trolls.\nThat's about the negatives I could think of and it isn't really the games' fault.\n\n\n\nTo round this review of, I'll give a short summary:\n\nPros:\n-solid melee combat system\n-troop management\n-good graphics (remember that this was and still is an indie game - I think the graphics are absolutely fine despite what others have said. Besides, the graphics in M&BII have been improved by a lot.)\n-great multiplayer with a high number of players supported and several gamemodes\n-mod support\n-always challenging\n\nCons:\n-engine limitations\n\nSo I come to the conclusion that I can clearly recommend this title to others. Also keep an eye out for the upcoming sequel!","November 17, 2014","true","512.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/48700/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","The best way to describe this game, is calling it a "Medieval Simulator". Now, I know that there is an insane amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ simulators out there, but believe me: This one...IS QUITE FREAKIN' ENTERTAINING!\n\nWhat do I have on it? Like 80 hours? 90? I would play more, if I didn't lost my two characters when my good computer went to ♥♥♥♥ and had to re-install everything, losing the save-files.\n\nBasically, you start from scratch: Who you are? From where are you from? How was your family? How did you spend your youth? When you grew up, what the hell you did? And now, here you are, a land with a name I already forgot (not that it matters much), with a few realms, each one being a parody of a medieval glory (excluding the Japanese, those where cut-out for some reason, would love to see them in the sequel already being made). You then choose to go to one of those realms, and them...YOU'RE FREE! This is not like one of those other open-world games, where you can mess-arround, while still having a main story to deal at some point, in this game YOU chose what YOU have to do. Want to be a rich merchant? Want to be the strongest dueling champion? Want to be the leader of an infamous band of bandits and thieves? Want to be the side-kick of a lord? Or do you want to RULE THE WHOLE KINGDOM, BY CREATING YOUR OWN FACTION!?\n\nThe gameplay is rock-solid, as my d#ck. There's a fine amount of weapons, that are usually randomized to have random effects, like attacking a bit more slowly, or not letting you use it on a horse because of how big and powerful it is. It has a flaw, though, and it's that enemy lords don't seem to level up, so at some point you will become an unstoppable force of nature. There are multiple ways to fight: Using ranged weapons like bows and crossbows either at ground or horse, melee weapons at ground or horse, either with a one-handed weapon and a shield or double-handed, using throwable weapons like axes and daggers, using staffs and spears...Anything is viable. Even throwing rocks. The only thing this game lacks, is siege weapons. That would be just balls-to-the-wall. The game also makes you the leader of whatever troops you end up having on your command, and you can make them do follow your orders. Sadly, I didn't felt the need to do it most of the time, the enemy IA isn't that smart. Just tough at times.\n\nSomething that this game does not reach as well as the others, are the graphics. It doesn't bother me, but the game looks aged and old. If you're a graphical ♥♥♥♥♥, you can probably look for texture packs and skins, but whatever...The soundtrack is also quite good, but becomes repetitive after 90 F#CKING GAMEPLAY HOURS. There are probably mods for that too, but I'm too lazy.\n\nWhen it comes to liberty, this game does it perfectly. I had two- Wait, no, three playthoughs of the game. In my first one, I became a Nord lord (called Jarls), and helped the leader of the Nords to crush each and every other faction. And I then became the second in command. My second playthrough started as a bandit, but soon I was able to recluit a good amount of soldiers and mercenaries, and started capturing castles from other factions, and kidnapping lords, kings and their families. After a few months, my own corrupted nation, with a bandit as their Lord and Savior. In my third playthrough, I joined the Arab empire, to then betray them, and take it to my own. Then, I got rich by selling Velvet and other cool stuff, to get a huge-♥♥♥ army, left the Arab empire to rot, and just start my own empire. Again.\n\nThe game also has a multiplayer game, and I got to say, it's quite interesting. First of all, the Siege-maps. One team sieges a castle, the other defends. Even if they're a bit one-sided at times, they're quite fun, specially by defending a castle, throwing axes at the fools who try to climb the ladders. There are a few other modes as Deathmatch, but the mode you should look into, is the Battle Mode: Two huge armies, one life to each player. Yup, one life. Like the elimination mode from Unreal Tournament, but more climactic. And I can tell you, those battles do take long at times, but they're even fun to watch, specially when they're are 100 vs 100 battles in large maps!\n\nThe game also has an expansion, that I will talk about here, because I probably can't review it on it's own. The Napoleonic Wars, I believe it's called. It came along the Sale from where I got all the Mount and Blade games (cost me 5€'s or so, totally worth it), and it's a recreating of a mod from older M&B games, with actual guns and ♥♥♥♥. I did not play it too much, but it was quite fun.\n\nThis game manages to give you the freedom that other games promises you to give, in a fun, almost endless game. If you see it at a sale, and you love medieval stuff, you SHOULD totally buy it. It's worth 6€'s or so, I think.\n\nOh, and if you're going to buy it, I recommend you to start as a nord. They're the easiest faction. Way better Melee-combat weapons, armor, and troops. They lack horse-mounted units, though.","August 23, 2014","true","159.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kolosys/recommended/48700/","kolosys","Seanner Resiak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kolosys/","105 products in account","Charge into battle. Ride into legend. This non-expensive sandbox masterpiece brings together the opportunity to do anything, from being a sellsword bandit mercenary trader to a kingmaking politic-intrigued warband-leading vassal, into strange places such as Calradia's three bickering kingdoms, its adjacent horseloving khanate and the neighbouring haughty sultanate. This game is full of surprises as battlefields change depending on your map's terrain and your party's location.\n\nInspiring one of the largest modding communities, Mount & Blade holds a great module system which prevents mod conflicts unlike other games (ahem BGS) and lets you fall on your knees to worship the old gods. You could go on an adventure into 1257 where religious war spreads its flame throughout the middle east and engulfs eastern europe, where the golden horde still scours for tribute in places where no king is seated, and where blood and steel would make a peasant into one of his lordships. This module would be one of my personal favorites.\n\nOf course I've left out one of many people's favorites, the multiplayer of Warband. Whether it be cRPG, Napoleonic Wars, or just the native module, the multiplayer experience is enjoyable. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the multiplayer (probably because I don't have anybody to play with) since there are always other games when I want to be competitive. Therefore, I won't say much on multiplayer.\n\nAre you still reading this? Man, you either must be really bored or really skeptical. I would have bought this game right off the bat after I read the words "non-expensive sandbox" but you know, that's just me. If you're into medieval galore, this game is a must buy. If you love sandboxes or maybe games which allows you to build armies and lead them into battle, this game is definitely for you. If you're into steampunkish or cyberpunkish games like the bioshock series and the fallout series respectively, then this game might not be for you. But who knows? You might like it.","December 22, 2013","true","091.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

HOWEVER.. the story for this is great, and its really fun to have large groups of women, but its a bit to much... every town is practically all women and all fights are led by women. I was looking for a bit more addition of females.. but beyond them taking up the sword for the shortage of men, it becomes amazon territory.

Also this game does have a bit steep of a learning curve but once you learn how to play it is definetly worth it.\n\nNow as to why I think this game is so good:\nWell first of all there is no story line which some would see as a bad idea but the way Warband uses it, it actually works. It allows for almost any possible course of action to achieve your own personal goals wether it be becoming rich, becoming King, or even marrying a noble lady.\nSecondly, the modding community is huge which is constantly adding mods that can increase your experience in the game or even add even more to said experience such as a mod called the Freelance mod which makes it so you are now able to play as a regular soldier in a Lords army.\nThirdly, the multiplayer can have up to 200 players! How many "next generation" games do you hear of being able to have 200 players fighting eachother the the death in brutal and bloody combat.\nFourthly, there is a DLC for this game which I have taken a particular interest in. This mod is the Napoleonic Wars DLC which allows you to play in multiplayer games as a soldier from the time period of Napoleon conquering Europe. This DLC while not having single player (although there is a mod that is coming out eventually that will have singleplayer) seems to draw you in with its organized communities. While the initial prospect of running around in a line and having to listen to orders may seem daunting especially considering that there is generally no space between each person in a line, I assure you it is actually a lot more fun then it sounds. Imagine being able to play as a artillery unit that is able to shoot at unit such as that or playing as cavalry and gloriously charging your enemy and cutting down any that get in your way. Or getting a reputation as a deadly sniper as a part of a skirmisher or line infantry regiment. With 200 players able to play in one server at once all these units can all be in the same server working together. So imagine marching towards enemy positions with artillery flying overhead and the cavalry charging past you while the skirmishers snipe important enemy personel.","July 13, 2014","true","398.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/48700/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","The best way to describe this game, is calling it a "Medieval Simulator". Now, I know that there is an insane amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ simulators out there, but believe me: This one...IS QUITE FREAKIN' ENTERTAINING!\n\nWhat do I have on it? Like 80 hours? 90? I would play more, if I didn't lost my two characters when my good computer went to ♥♥♥♥ and had to re-install everything, losing the save-files.\n\nBasically, you start from scratch: Who you are? From where are you from? How was your family? How did you spend your youth? When you grew up, what the hell you did? And now, here you are, a land with a name I already forgot (not that it matters much), with a few realms, each one being a parody of a medieval glory (excluding the Japanese, those where cut-out for some reason, would love to see them in the sequel already being made). You then choose to go to one of those realms, and them...YOU'RE FREE! This is not like one of those other open-world games, where you can mess-arround, while still having a main story to deal at some point, in this game YOU chose what YOU have to do. Want to be a rich merchant? Want to be the strongest dueling champion? Want to be the leader of an infamous band of bandits and thieves? Want to be the side-kick of a lord? Or do you want to RULE THE WHOLE KINGDOM, BY CREATING YOUR OWN FACTION!?\n\nThe gameplay is rock-solid, as my d#ck. There's a fine amount of weapons, that are usually randomized to have random effects, like attacking a bit more slowly, or not letting you use it on a horse because of how big and powerful it is. It has a flaw, though, and it's that enemy lords don't seem to level up, so at some point you will become an unstoppable force of nature. There are multiple ways to fight: Using ranged weapons like bows and crossbows either at ground or horse, melee weapons at ground or horse, either with a one-handed weapon and a shield or double-handed, using throwable weapons like axes and daggers, using staffs and spears...Anything is viable. Even throwing rocks. The only thing this game lacks, is siege weapons. That would be just balls-to-the-wall. The game also makes you the leader of whatever troops you end up having on your command, and you can make them do follow your orders. Sadly, I didn't felt the need to do it most of the time, the enemy IA isn't that smart. Just tough at times.\n\nSomething that this game does not reach as well as the others, are the graphics. It doesn't bother me, but the game looks aged and old. If you're a graphical ♥♥♥♥♥, you can probably look for texture packs and skins, but whatever...The soundtrack is also quite good, but becomes repetitive after 90 F#CKING GAMEPLAY HOURS. There are probably mods for that too, but I'm too lazy.\n\nWhen it comes to liberty, this game does it perfectly. I had two- Wait, no, three playthoughs of the game. In my first one, I became a Nord lord (called Jarls), and helped the leader of the Nords to crush each and every other faction. And I then became the second in command. My second playthrough started as a bandit, but soon I was able to recluit a good amount of soldiers and mercenaries, and started capturing castles from other factions, and kidnapping lords, kings and their families. After a few months, my own corrupted nation, with a bandit as their Lord and Savior. In my third playthrough, I joined the Arab empire, to then betray them, and take it to my own. Then, I got rich by selling Velvet and other cool stuff, to get a huge-♥♥♥ army, left the Arab empire to rot, and just start my own empire. Again.\n\nThe game also has a multiplayer game, and I got to say, it's quite interesting. First of all, the Siege-maps. One team sieges a castle, the other defends. Even if they're a bit one-sided at times, they're quite fun, specially by defending a castle, throwing axes at the fools who try to climb the ladders. There are a few other modes as Deathmatch, but the mode you should look into, is the Battle Mode: Two huge armies, one life to each player. Yup, one life. Like the elimination mode from Unreal Tournament, but more climactic. And I can tell you, those battles do take long at times, but they're even fun to watch, specially when they're are 100 vs 100 battles in large maps!\n\nThe game also has an expansion, that I will talk about here, because I probably can't review it on it's own. The Napoleonic Wars, I believe it's called. It came along the Sale from where I got all the Mount and Blade games (cost me 5€'s or so, totally worth it), and it's a recreating of a mod from older M&B games, with actual guns and ♥♥♥♥. I did not play it too much, but it was quite fun.\n\nThis game manages to give you the freedom that other games promises you to give, in a fun, almost endless game. If you see it at a sale, and you love medieval stuff, you SHOULD totally buy it. It's worth 6€'s or so, I think.\n\nOh, and if you're going to buy it, I recommend you to start as a nord. They're the easiest faction. Way better Melee-combat weapons, armor, and troops. They lack horse-mounted units, though.","August 23, 2014","true","159.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","15"

It's difficult to say because it's not the native version of the game itself that is so amazing. Yeah it's fun, and definitely worth the price tag as it is. 60 or so hours worth of fun I would say, but I am rapidly approaching and will definitely surpass the 600 hour mark soon. Why? Because it is like a canvas, the native game introduces gameplay mechanics that have a lot of potential for variety once it's in the hands of the modding community. I'm no modder myself so I can't speak to how hard or easy it is to mod the game, but the general idea of commanding an army on a battlefield in a third or first person perspective lends itself well to a lot of different ways to engage in battle. I had 40-60 hrs in native, another 200 in the viking conquest expansion ($14.95 atm I think) which is a lot of fun and worth the price tag, and the rest in the many various mods of the game. There are mods for just about any sort of warfare from Roman times up to the Civil War. There are mods for fantasy settings and even a LoTR mod. There is so much to offer a person inclined to like this sort of game.\n\nIt can be a bit difficult when first learning the game, so don't let that get you down, just look stuff up and keep at it and you'll be engaging in large (in viking conquest at least with troop on field limits of 750 as opposed to the 150 of native) battles. You have to recruit, pay, train, upgrade your units, manage companions, your own character, villages, towns, castles, and even a kingdom later on if you manage to establish yourself. It's a bit to learn and sometimes it is hard early on to get a foothold, but the game is worth the time getting to know it. The actual combat seems stange at first, but becomes rather intuitive once you get a handle on it, and having tested all the weapon types, they're all useful in one situation or another, but I tend to learn towards swords and pole-arms as being mounted is important for a commander and those weapons lend well to such combat. Archery is fun, too, but that takes a lot of practice to be viable.\n\nI rate gameplay 10/10, look to other reviews for other factors like graphics because as long as I know what I'm looking at, graphics quality doesn't mean so much to me.","February 19","true","733.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Of course you will need an army, so gather recruits, train them into cool wariors trough your harsh training or even faster, from real fights, but that may end up getting some of them killed.\nAlso don't get too cocky on opponents, especialy if you choose to play realisticaly like i do (no exit without save, thus no loading back at a previous point). Don't forget to feed your troups otherwise they will starve and loose morale, win difficult fights and get morale and renown, bet on yourself and win in tournaments and get gold, participate at feasts, try to impress a lady.\nTired of being a mercenary? Choose a kingdom and swear a vassalage to the king if you have good enogh standing, and get feafs according to your contribution. You choose your way, whatever it may be, depending on what you like.\n\nI suggest buying this game which would get you over 100 hours in singleplayer. How do i know by having just 20 hours till now ? Because i firstly played this game outside of steam.

Well, I guess it's time to say goodbye to a life of adventure..."\n\nI rage quited after that... this save is still there, I'm still a prisoner, they simply won't let me free, it has passed about 3 months in game... and still they didn't free me... I guess it's a bug. But still, I intend to free myself and them raise an army to fight Knudarr and to retake my capital Reindi Castle... This game...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gromm_/recommended/48700/","Gromm_","Gromm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gromm_/","120 products in account","Note: I have been away from this game for a small amount of time, so excuse me if some of the information I give you is incorrect.\n\nGeneral\nIf you don't like medieval games, this game is the last thing you'd want. This game is both third person and first person. There are 3 main classes with every unit in the game, including in multiplayer. The three classes are  Infantry, Archers, and Horseman.  the weapon usage varies with each class. The factions are  Vaegirs, Rhodoks, Swadians, Sarranids, Nords, and Khergits.  These factions are constantly at war with each other. You can affect the game in a massive way, or a small way. In both singleplayer and multiplayer, people can affect you and you can affect people in a variety of ways. From covering an archer as an infantry class to covering infantry as a horseman class, the customization is a great part of the game. The graphics are obviously not the best, but that's just what you get with an older game. Don't let that control your whole opinion of the game. There are no real spoilers to the game, as there is no hand-holding, or "missions". There are quests, but you can choose to take them.\n\nSingleplayer\nSingleplayer is a great part of the game that not many people will get bored of right after starting. You start out with a small band of men that are only able to defeat bandits, which can eventually turn into a 300 man army attacking a rival king. You have the choice to do whatever you want. If you allign to a faction for the purpose of destroying it, you can slide your way up the ranks, and get people to rebel from the faction with you, or just work your way up by taking a city by yourself.\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer has a series of game modes, from dueling to sieges. A good amount of the players are veterans, and can teach you whatever you want to know. That's how I got a lot of my experience in multiplayer. Multiplayer is very similar to singleplayer, but in my opinion, better. It actually feels immersive, as you have an actual challenge. I don't feel very comfortable killing AI, as it doesn't feel real enough to me. In my opinion, multiplayer is better than singleplayer to me in every way. Even though there is no map, the battles feel much better in all aspects.\n\nNapoleonic Wars\nNapoleonic Wars, the DLC for Mount and Blade: Warband, is fantastic.  NOTE: There is no Singleplayer for Napoleonic Wars.  Even there is no singleplayer for NW, the multiplayer is great. Most of the combat that happens is ranged, as there are muskets in the game. All muskets are able to switch to melee mode with X, which helps out a lot, rather than having a fist fight in the middle of a classical battle (which is possible as well). Many of the maps are made by the community. The addition of cannons, swivel guns, and mortars really helps out with taking out many men at once. It is unbelievably easy to get attached to. In my opinion, the DLC is at a good price, for the amount of content included in it.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the game is completely worth the price, along with Napoleonic Wars. If you would like to know more about the game/DLC than I explained, just message me, and i'll help you out. Thanks for reading me review on Mount and Blade: Warband and Napoleonic Wars.","September 13, 2014","true","127.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
