"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/388970/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","When it comes to precision platforming games on Steam the market is stacked. However, that hasn’t stopped a large number of indie developers flooding the market with games of various quality. Sadly it is often the games that are ridiculously bad that get their turn to shine in favor of the more well put together titles that deserve it more. Daniel Spruce released his iZBOT game onto the Steam platform back at the start of September. To this point in time he has ignored the early pleas of the indie bundles world in favor of getting his title into the hands of those who will enjoy it most. A sad consequence of this is that it has remained buried on Steam so it’s about time that it got a little of the spotlight.\n\nI generally read Steam reviews before playing a game to help formulate some idea of what I’m getting myself into. There are a lot of knowledgeable players among Steam’s user base and in part thanks to being able to rate someone’s review contribution you can quickly sort the quality from the muck. If you take a quick browse through iZBOT’s reviews you’ll find that platformer fans have generally similar thoughts on the game. The general train of consensus is that the game is one of the best genre titles to be released in 2015 and that it combines super tight controls with the frustrations and the rage that is generated from the best precision platform titles on Steam such as Super Meat Boy. Those are all things that make platforming engrossing to me.\n\nThe aim of iZBOT, much like any platformer, is to defeat each level but you do have an extra challenge per level in getting a gem. This will, most often, slow down your best time (you can defeat each level without getting the gem) but there is an achievement for hunters when you do collect them all, ‘OCD.’ I personally found that this was the most fun in the game for me. I could zip around the levels but if I really wanted a challenge the gem was the real prize. Once you collect the gem you can then restart the level to see how quickly you could have gone had you not bothered to collect the gem. Alternatively, unless you find the gem on your first play through a better idea may be to get the gem on your second attempt.\n\niZBOT is every bit as precision as Ruxar bills it as being. This is attested to by the Steam reviewers and having played it for myself I can vouch for that fact. Thankfully it controls superbly, at least with an Xbox One controller, making deaths never feel as though you’ve been cheated. It’s a game that I genuinely believe people who are scared of playing platformers could jump into and learn how to play. Therefore iZBOT gets a firm recommendation for all platformer fans.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 8","true","4.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

The levels are challenging, the main character is super responsive, the controls are watertight and it’s got this kind of oddball humour to it all. It’s one of those games where you will only ever be held back by your own skill and you will see yourself get better with every play though. Beating some of the tougher levels are true fist pump moments.\n\nHighly recommended.\n","September 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

This definitely isn't a big game. Completing it, getting all gems (although the achievement didn't unlock), and optimizing my time in a few levels took me around 4 hours — and I'm probably somewhere between mediocre and decent at precision platformers.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, the speed is good, and the levels are well-designed, so you can mostly go as fast as the game allows and not have to wait for moving parts of the level to let you through. And most important of all, it's fair. While you may have to play a level a few times to become familiar with it, the game never just kills you for no reason, and there's mostly no blind drops or anything of the sort. You'll still die probably thousands of times just because you know you can do a level just a liiiiittle faster.\n\nSo yeah, if run n' jump precision platformers is your kind of thing, you'll most likely enjoy this — because it's a run n' jump precision platformer and a very decent one at that.\n\n3 very minor things though:\n- the bosses are maybe a bit lackluster. You'll be spending most of your in-game time outside of boss fights anyway, so it's not a huge deal really.\n- hitboxes seem to be a little bigger than you'd expect. It's something you get used to after a while, but it confused me at first\n- the gems seem to only serve to unlock an achievement (which didn't unlock for me for some reason). It'd be super nice if they served some purpose within the game too.\n\nApart from that, a thouroughly enjoyable platformer that should satisfy the cravings of most platforming enthusiasts for a little while.","December 26, 2015","true","68.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It follows the typical structure of repeatedly reaching the level end while avoiding various enemies and environment obstacles, and offers a reasonably satisfying  experience along the way.\n\nThe game is drawn in an adorable pixelated style, and has very retro, 8-bit music to match. But, let's be honest, when it comes to precision platformers, it's all about the controls and the level design.\n\niZBOT has the tight and predictable controls that you would expect out of this kind of game. No complaints there. When you explode after running into ostrich spit (yup... That's in there) you can bet it's your fault.\n\nAs far as level design, there is really only 1 hang up. The game features 3 levels, with over a dozen stages in each level. This is a fair amount of content. I have been playing for about 3 hours and just now reached the final set of stages. Again, no complaints there. My issue in this area is that the difficulty of each stage is more random than progressive. I don't play many precision platformers, so maybe it's standard to throw some really tricky stages in early, and then things suddenly get easier for a while. It seemed a little odd to me.\n\nOne thing that iZBOT lacks compared to leading platformers is story. The game features a boss fight at the end of each set of stages. It is never clear why the boss is there, why we are killing it, or what (other than unlocking the door) we get out of the fight. This see like a missed opportunity to flesh out the character a bit and help keep the player interested in completing more stages.\n\nOverall, fans of the precision platforming genre will want to pick up iZBOT, but new players might want to look elsewhere for the most satisfying experience. It can be picked up on Steam for $9.99 US dollars.

The controls are super tight and its simply a fun game to play.  The parallels with Super Meatboy are obvious but iZBOT has its own unique charm.  I really like how the game encourages exploration - something which I can't recall SMB doing.  And I like that as part of this exploration there is a bit of a "leap of faith" mechanic going on where you aren't quite sure of what is above or below you...you've just got to bite the bullet and go for it (a'la OG Sonic the Hedgehog)\n\nThe tutorials levels are well implemented...\n\nAnd that level music...awesome.  It just makes me feel happy - I can't recall ever bopping along to in-game music.\n\nWell done Ruxar!","September 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You have 2 modes of horizontal transportation. A snails pace that cannot get you over the tiniest jump, and something that is too hard for any perosn to logically control.\n\nIts level design is... well... it seems like the game encourages you to go fast. There's a timer, and the only other speed is unbearably slow, so go fast right? Well then why do they design the levels to punish going fast? I can't see what's in front of me until it's too late. And then the vertical sections, they make you use wall jump which makes you go way too far out and can't be controlled to try to avoid some pixel perfect traps. Okay, not pixel perfect, but they feel like pixel perfect traps in IWBTG fangames do, where I die to them for no particular reason, except it's not satisfying to get past them because I just felt annoyed when I didn't originally.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks that the hitboxes were awful? I could be directly on top of something and die to it. The triceretops boss and the slime boss I would die when I jump on them and I can't tell why. I would often die to something I never touched, so I just don't understand what happened there.\n\nThe boss design was just bad. When the triceretops charges to one side then back to the other, his placing isn't even consistent. Did they not even take the time to make it so that he ends up the same place he starts? And if not why not>\n\nThe music. Did it have one track or are they all just that similar and forgettable?\n\nI stopped playing at leel 3-52 (which should be called 3-12, but they didn't reset the level numbers each world) because it just got boring. I died to things that I know I shouldn't have, and got sent back to the start of the level. I then died again. Those last two sentences are usually in games I find the most fun, but this game the dying was just lame. It means that I was basically speedrunning the level (the only thing close to fun, which is unfortunately discouraged by most levels' design) and then died to something before I could react.\n\nI bought this game on sale for $1.99 and I don't feel like it was worth that. So I do not recommend this game, as $9.99 is then 5 times *less* worth it.","December 25, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","1"

Controls are precise and no death feels cheap. The little bot controls wells both on the ground and in the air, the ability to double jump giving you that "aww yeah" moments when you realise you jumped at the wrong time but managed to correct your trajectory mid air.\n\nThe levels are bite sized but they're well designed and some section can give you some trouble if you're not careful. One very important thing in this genre that iZBOT does right is the speed at which you can restart a level. Fail a jump and die or just press R and you're instantly back at the start, ready to try again.\n\nOnly minor gripe is the music can get a bit repetitive. Overall, good little game for the masochist in you that likes to try again and again until you have that perfect run.","March 19","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
