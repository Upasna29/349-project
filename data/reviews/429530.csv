Honestly, you probably wouldn't want to play this game without the BMS mod. If that's not a big deal, then buy this. You don't need to play it through Steam since there are no achievements or trading cards to get.\n\nOh ... and read the BMS manuals saved to the BMS directory. They're all long, but detailed.","January 9","true","2.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

They've made a total bucketwash of the existing Falcon BMS community by telling them to remove the latest BMS update leaving people like me deprived of the BMS experience I specifically bought this game on steam for.\n\nNot only that, but the game on steam does not even work properly without the BMS mod which mistakenly, they removed when they could have still been rounding in customers which were looking forward to BMS. I feel VERY cheated out of my money because I can't even run this game stock or modded; leaving me to have to press retry and cancel every time I attempt to launch the game. Very disappointed by this company who released this on steam. Bad marketing because they do not understand the real customer needs and wants for this brilliant game which is overwhelmingly leant on BMS.\n\nIf they read this I really recommend putting the BMS installation back up for 4.33 otherwise they are going to destroy a community which have been so hearty and productive in their abscence.\n\nIM TELLING YOU NOW PEOPLE, do not buy this game, because the stock doesn't even work and you're unable to install the latest BMS mod, I have been waiting up to 3 weeks for them to put the BMS mod back up since my 26th of January purchase which misfortunately was the day they removed it. Check on the bms website http://www.bmsforum.org/forum/content.php if you're looking to get BMS for this because it tells you a whole lot about the kind of situation they have pitched on the community.","February 15","false","0.2"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","36","47","0","7"

Image can be found at http://imgur.com/Or3APKm\n\nUpon inspection of the local folder it feels like this release was made in a rush; there are GOG files, a desktop shortcut pointing to a non-existing path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Retroism\Falcon 4.0\falcon4.exe". Even the GOG uninstaller is still there, referencing: SOFTWARE/GOG.com/Games/FALCON-BONUS. So, please if you consider this purchase, best to spend your money elsewhere and go to the source: https://www.gog.com/game/falcon_collection This version works without any problems...\n\nNote: Anyways, if you do buy this game, you can make it work by using the BMS modifcation from http://www.bmsforum.org/","January 9","false","0.1"," 61 of 91 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","61","91","10","3"

The players , developers ,modders , are looking forward.\nBut  they just sit in the place and sales the old dead products.\nWe know they are pushing their licenses policy to the community.\nAnd they didn’t  put themselves into the living projects.\n\nYou can say that is legit, lawful, and necessary.\n\nI say that is robbery as well.\n\n\nSome companies HD-remake their old IPs for profits.
