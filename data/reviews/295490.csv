Although this list is a lot of negatives, I think the game was definitely worth its asking price. It really needed some ironing out, but the execution is otherwise amazing.\n\n+ Voiceacting is good. Cartoony as hell, but good.\n+ Art style is cool. Also cartoony.\n+ Animations are fairly smooth.\n+ The setting and story are both unique and GREAT, and I wouldn't hesitate to describe the whole game as "cute."\n+ The puzzle solving mechanics are very interesting. There's a lot of unique abilties you have, and they each have a different cost. There are usually several different ways to approach every situation, and you have to think ahead to avoid wasting certain resources.\n+ Failure doesn't usually mean a lot of restarting - it usually means you'll have to try again a different way, since you've wasted resources.\n+ The difficulty ramp has a good, satisfying feel to it.\n+ I love and look forward to the dialogue. It can be cheesy, but it knows that.\n+ The characters aren't incredibly remarkable, but they certainly aren't boring templates.\n\n- VERY buggy. Enemies can get stuck in unreachable places, entire areas can become uncompleteable(although you can reset an area if that does happen), green goo is sometimes instadeath, sometimes not(something that I speculate has to do with getting stuck between non-square hitboxes), there are several buggy animations and behaviors in some enemies, and yet other enemies' movement is too wonky for a perfect clear to be worthwhile.\n- Damage is not always properly communicated. If you're not paying attention, you won't notice that leptons and bombs actually do hurt SC. Sometimes, green goo makes it look like it didn't damage you because nothing really happens - but it did.\n- The procedural generation of the main areas is unfortuantely not quite as interesting as it sounds, because you get so many resources that there is little to no challenge in any of the puzzle portions - it's all platforming, navigating and not being chewed up by electrons.\n- SFX are just a tad annoying.\n- Camera movement is awful in some zones.\n- Jumping control takes a while to get used to. You can usually stop on a dime, but you gain momentum in a very unstable manner.\n- It feels like there's a lot of unused potential in the way antiquarks act.\n- Short play length - about nine hours if you're not unrealistically going for a perfect clear. Fifteen to twenty hours in that case.","September 24, 2014","true","10.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","0"

I caught a fleeting glimpse of the title of this game and I knew that it must be mine; it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.  The humor and style of the game feels like a nostalgic take on platformers from the 80's - 90's, such as Earthworm Jim / Gex / Star Fox, while the modern upkeep on the gameplay and art style is sophisticated and smooth.  As big a draw as the wise cracking protagonist, the spiffy art, or the silky gameplay may be the best part of this game by far is the SCIENCE NERD HUMOR OMG!\n\nIf you are a nerd, a geek, a science dork, if you ever knocked someone out with a science textbook before.... this is the game for you!

By combining the quarks with your arrow keys, you proceed through the game - forming platforms, shields and so on...\n\nAlthough this game has its flaws (some minor bugs with terrain you want to explode and which doesn't work properly, and sometimes the controls can be a bit slow), I fully recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/295490/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I would recommend this game as a cautious recommendation at best. The combo mechanic with okay-if-floaty platforming controls makes for a fun, original experience.\n\nThe real question you should ask before purchasing is how much can you stand ear-grating one-liners or annoying personalities? Also, do you like physics?\n\nSchrodinger's Cat: The Procrastinator of Videogame Character Abilities\nLike most cats, they don't do the work but get other people to do the work for them. This is how Schrodinger works with the combo ability system.\n\nHere you combine three quarks (out of four) in order to result in some combination. There are fourteen total and nearly all of them are well-used throughout the game.\n\nYou can make a parachute, a bubble-shield, a missile, a decoy disco machine and even a helicopter. The four quarks are given to you from the start, and they serve as Schrodinger's abilities (besides his attack) and as his groupies.\n\nOn a controller, the shoulder buttons and triggers use one type of quark. On keyboard they have their respected keys.\n\nAlthough cumbersome at first, you'll be able to make these combinations fast like in a fighting game. You'll learn the most useful combos not too long in the HUB world, and the puzzles allow for some failure. If you ever forget them, you have all combos listed in the pause menu.\n\nIn-between the smaller, focused areas, the game has this "HUB-world" (which I use in quotations as there's nothing to do other than collect particles). Besides the optional fetch-quest, the area serves as a means for the player to learn on his/her own pace with the superflous amounts of quarks.\n\nAll of these gameplay ideas sound wonderful on paper, and the tutorial isn't unclear for people not familiar with quantum mechanics nor too long for seasoned platformers. Unfortunately, the HUB areas are my main gripe with this game.\n\nMechanics Are Best When Quantized\nIronic enough, a game about quantum mechanics is the most fun when you set enough limitations on all the probabilities you can have. Only then do you see the game's potential.\n\nThe procedurely generated layouts are a nice touch for replay value, but the HUB environments aren't interesting to explore as the only objective is to collect X amount of each particle.\n\nThankfully, you do not have to collect everything. The only time you need to collect everything in the area is when the game has some arbitrary reason to get progress. The only other thing you need to keep an eye out for are the Charm Particles to finish the game.\n\nWhen you are in those "dungeon" areas with a limited amount of quarks (which is limited by the checkpoints) is where I think the game works best.\n\nThe abundance of quarks offers no challenge to get around the generated HUB. At worst, it means you may have to backtrack if you cannot progress without one type of quark. At best, it makes for a tutorial at your own pace in disguise. This is almost a different game to when you're in the dungeon areas.\n\nWhen limited, you have to think how to make the best with what you got. You learn about some combos' synergy and how to better reserve each type of quark. The checkpoints enforced a difficulty scale rather than some arbirtrary impasse, and because I had so many spare quarks that means there are multiple solutions too.\n\nIf the game was only of these dungeon areas and running-sections, then I think you'd have a well-loved classic. It would be a shorter game, admittedl, if there wasn't more content added in to compensate, but it more polished experience... Until the end boss.\n\nNothing about that fight had anything to do with Schrodinger's Cat's mechanics. Why couldn't the game ended with something that fits the game's focus and its mechanics?\n\nAside from a weak, annoying boss-fight and a game that took the focus away from what works, the biggest problem about Schrodginer's cat is its dumb smart humor.\n\nWant a formula for this game? Η(umor) (WH)Ψ? = i h(ate) to derive Ψ(our) time\nI mean no disrespect to Team 17, but I cannot tell whether you hate your jokes or if you like how bad they are. I love bad humor, if done right, which this game does not. (And I know this is a subjective section. but it's the main thing that turns people away. Not the science.)\n\nFor starters, most of these puns are not puns. At worst, they're nonsensical combinations of words. "Scienterrific", "Phystasticular", "Coola-boola", and "Fists of Feyman" (actually, I like that last one; keep it). Most of them are not funny. Combining physics/science-stuff words with other words is a really, really lame gag. And I think you know this.\n\nSecond, references are not funny without giving some context/set-up first. Why should I laugh about the Schrodinger Equation or Einstein's energy equation of light/photons generated on the map? (Also, where are those photons anyway? And the neutrinos? And the gamma-rays? And all the other subatomic particles that could add in more puzzles and cool combinations?)\n\nI did at least enjoy one clever joke, the answer to "Why do problems always come in threes?", because the game set it up and the answer came at the right time for a good delivery. Not an explanation in the tutorial for how many combos there are represented by a series equation.\n\nThe one thing this game taught me is that there is such a thing as dumb smart-humor. As another user stated,"The game is good and is not good. Only by playing will you find out." Similarly, I cannot decide whether most of the game's "jokes" are self-aware of how bad they are or if they think all these one-liners are "smart" jokes.\n\nIf Poe's Law could ever be applied to science, this game would walk that line and keep you guessing at every turn.\n\nPlease Don't Skin this Cat\nAs much as I'm giving this game a lot of flak on its type of humor, I think people are pushed away by it, not the gameplay itself. If the game's humor is grating to you, I would recommend trying this game on a discount. The gameplay doesn't take long to get into with the first two hours.\n\nI think the one-liner superhero Schrodinger's Cat doesn't have to change. He is amusing as a trope-heavy cliche when he is poking fun at himself and others. His design is a nice color-compliment scheme. I also like how detailed he is when you change his forward direction from left-to-right. (His color-scheme flips.)\n\nThe Particle Zoo is a wonderful setting that captures the subatomic chaos of the microscopic world, if a little bland because of the reused textures and layout of the HUB world. I also felt some of the wierdness, though wonderfully expressed in the setting and characters, could've touched on things outside of the nucleus.\n\nFor example, I would've liked to explore the electron-orbital paths in a spacey-manner with a quantum of energy, perhaps with emitting and absorbing photons. (And because you need specific energy values, you would have to solve some puzzle to get that solution.) That would be a cool QM puzzle idea and educational without being a boring lesson.\n\nWith the quirkiness and seemingly endless potential for a subatomic world setting, I think the core mechanics could still be built upon what we have now for another game. Hopefully then, with a more focused game, we can have a great newcomer for platformers.","October 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

More glitches, more going through walls and overall more cheap deaths from the running sections really soured this game for me.

Decent humor, TONS of physics jokes. The voice acting is fantastic.\n\nThe gameplay is... kind of weird. Like a puzzle platformer with a focus on destructible terrain, and your "mechanics" all come from mixing 4 different kinds of what amounts to ammo. So you get to a spot, figure out what ammo you've got, and that gives you an idea of what powers you can apply.\n\nIt really isn't a puzzle series, though, more like "here is a massive windy platform'y level with some hazards, get through it however you like, and we'll drop some ammo here according to how we figure that might work."

It was a pleasant surprise that the humour in the game too was wacky, corny and physics-y throughout. The writing is good, the mechanics and the concept are very well thought out. If you have played DotA, this is like playing invoker - instead of three orbs, you have to conjure combos of three quarks, and then use them to solve a puzzle platformer.\n\nThere isn't much of "story" to go with this game. You're the cat, and you must navigate your path through the Particle Zoo to reach the control center, AKA Nucleus. There are three baddies: Gluons, Leptons and Bosons. Beating each of them is different and you must go through their respective habitats, which are quite well designed and vary from easy to moderate difficulty. The levels in between are generated randomly, "procedurally", whatever that means. Except for achievement hunting, there is nothing like "easter eggs" in this game, and it's pretty much linear. I would recommend to limit playing this game about 30-45 mins, or 2 to 3 chambers at a time (whichever is smaller). That way you won't feel the game or the jokes to be repetitive, and you'll go through it over ~10 days (my gametime includes the one night I forgot the game in minimize and slept off). Catching baddies and solving puzzles is satisfying in moderate doses, and the 3-4 "boss fights" are also a good change of pace.\n\nImpressive parts:\n-All the voice acting is done by one guy. Whoa!\n-Achievement hunting is fun but non essential, exactly as it should be.\n-The 3 Baddie habitats are tightly designed.\n-Next to no bugs (in fact only one well-known bug: infinite loading at the start, which is easy to resolve).\n-Soundtrack is just enough repetitive to be in the background and just enough dynamic to not be annoying or boring.\n-Press TAB to zoom out and check out the area around. What an amazing way to incentivise pre-planning over hit-and-trial attitude! Really impressed me, more platformers should have this.\n\nNot-so-cool parts:\n-There could've been a tighter story. Something that brings more twists-and-turns in the final aim and the gameplay.\n-The cat when moving in spaces 1 unit in height, must crouch, and it does so automatically too. However, this makes jumping into spaces that are 1 unit high a real pain. It simply can't be done, it just happens when it wants to. I had three such sections in the randomly generated boss runs, and that too near the end. It was frustrating to waste my time just because the mechanic of jumping into crouching is pathetic.\n-Procedurally generated or not, so many platform set-pieces simply CANNOT be repeated. Especially in the later stages when you die more, the deja vu is very disorienting and breaks the whatever-limited-immersion the game offers. Mind you, the puzzle parts are never repeated, but the filler sections are chock full of repetitions.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, if your answer to one or both of these is yes: Are you a platformer fan? If so, this game is definitely a worthy addition to the collection and your experience. ---OR--- Are you a nerd who likes unnecessarily corny but very precise physics humour? If so, buy it for the dialogue and keep the puzzles for some mental muscle flexing. However, unless you say yes to both, I would recommend you to preferably buy this game when on sale. I know it's only $10 but frankly, the price tag is valid only of you're going to LOVE the experience. The content alone is worth half that.\n\nAll in all, had lots of fun, and a great experience playing and not playing Schrodinger's Cat ;)","January 7","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

If you dont collect them, you have to redo the zones to get them without a hint of what zones have charms left or where they are. Its easier the second time because walls where you punched a hole keep the hole and you can use the quarks in other ways, but you have to complete the WHOLE zone again, including already beaten bosses.\n- boss fights. You have to make combos while running... with a time constrain... without save points.

The main problem, therefore, is not one of substance, but of style.\n\n"It's alright to be clever", reads one of the taglines that appear on information boards throughout the game. Yes, it's more than alright, IF you're not forcing it. Otherwise, your game becomes a vehicle for esoteric physics humor that runs roughshod over the gameplay. You can see the Team17 name and the Worms engine gleaming through, but the production values are not up to par; for example, some of the voice-acting (which is un-mutable) is full of distortion due to poor recording levels. I guess the math puns are just that integral to the experience.\n\nI know they were going for a mascot with "radical attitude" in the best 90s tradition, but this result is really .... bad.
