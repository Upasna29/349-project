"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/409100/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","The Purring Quest is a cat-themed platformer adventure game feature multiple cats, dogs, pigeons, moles and other animals.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You play as Kimchi the cat and you are trying to find your owner. On your majestic adventure, you also collect fish for endless hunger and help out other cats by finding their own items.\n\nPros:    The Story | On your journey, you will find several cats that require your help and all of them have something to say. Cat dialogues are mostly trying to be funny and are full of references. And these references are funny just enough times for me to say that they're mostly funny. Some of them are just tacky, though.\nThe Graphics | Everything is hand-drawn and I absolutely love it! The animations are smooth and I can't even imagine how much work was put into this. It's one of the best-looking games I've played in a while.\nMusical Background | The music is pretty good, in my opinion. It's not something you would listen on your everyday music player, but it's fitting the game well and it's quite charming. The sound effects aren't too bad as well.\nBonus Missions and Related Achievements | Apart from the main story line, you can also free cats from hidden cages and find a special item in every level. You also get properly rewarded with an achievement for each of those things.\nThe Gameplay | So, this game is a platformer and I have to say that it's a really fun one. It has some difficult skill-related sections, which you will have to repeat a few times in order to complete them. Across the levels, you will also find numerous (but not as you would want) checkpoints. Every level takes about 30-45 minutes to complete and there are five of them in total.\nPerformance | The gameplay is very smooth and there were no performance-related issues at all. Just as it should be.\nCons:    Lack of In-game Options | This is not a very big issue, but everything you want to set up regarding graphics, you have to set before launching the game itself. The Unity launcher is the only place you can modify settings.\nLives | So, when you're playing, you have seven lives. You lose a life when you fall from certain heights. Unrealistic. Also, when you lose a life by getting caught by a dog, you lose a life and respawn at the checkpoint. If you run out of lives, you respawn at the checkpoint as well. So, I don't know what is the point of lives in this game.\nStoring Chosen Settings | This is something that this game doesn't do. You have to choose your preferred language and jumping technique each time you open the game.\nOS Compatibility | There is no SteamOS and MacOS support, which is weird, because Unity has the ability to export games for all of those operating systems.\nGlitches | During the gameplay, I found out a few glitches that prevented me from reaching some fish. Also, the "Jumper" achievement seems to be broken.\nThe final verdict:Personally, I enjoyed the game a lot and it offers nice gameplay, despite having some problems. I found it really cute and charming, more than usual. This game should get you buys for about 3-5 hours, depending on your desire to hunt achievement or read all of the dialogues.\nSome of the profits are also donated to charity, so definitely get this game, if you see it for the right price.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Great.\nA percentage of the sales of this game goes to a cat foundation, so that alone is a good reason to contribute. But then it turns out that the game is good too!\n\nA variety of beautiful levels that go from a cemetery to a city or a skyscraper, that include 200 fishbones, a hidden cat and a hidden collectible, which lengthen the duration of the game. These all appear later on the main screen, looking nice. The dialogs are awesome, much more spiritual/philosophic than I expected. PURRFECT!\nThere are a lot of actions you can do: climb, scratch with your paw, do a regular or a high jump, hide behind some scenery... even lick your balls if you stay still for too long. Yep.\n\nThe physics are flawless and the difficulty is well balanced. Not too easy to breeze through it (there are only 5 levels after all), but not too hard to be frustrating).\nSometimes the controls for my official Xbox360 wired controller get unbinded for no reason when I close the game, and I need to configure them at the launcher again :(\nI also miss a gallery menu with more info about each cat (I forgot to remind that these cats are based on real ones)","November 12, 2015","true","7.5"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","54","77","10","0"

The Purring Quest has some things going for it but also has some issues that prevent it from being anything more than an average platformer.\n\nThe standout in the game is the presentation. The artwork and music in general are really well done. The story is not bad but I wish there was more to it. The game is filled with cat jokes and puns so if you are a big cat fan you should enjoy this aspect of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is solid overall and I had some fun with the game. Unfortunately the game doesn't really do anything unique with the platforming genre. Being a platformer featuring a cat as the protagonist I was hoping that the game was going to have some unique mechanics that I hadn't seen before.\n\nThe biggest problem that I had with The Purring Quest was the jumping controls. While they might get fixed with a later update, at this time they are imprecise. Regularly I would press the jump button and nothing happened or it took a lot longer to jump than it should have. This leads to some frustrating moments since I can probably attribute at least 95% of my deaths to the jumping controls.\n\nThe other problem with the game is the length. To finish the game to completion only took me two hours. The game is short since it only has five levels and outside of the troubles with the controls the game is not particularly difficult. I didn't collect all of the collectibles which would add some time to the game. I don't really see The Purring Quest as the type of game that I would replay though.\n\nAt $12 I would maybe recommend the game for people that are big cat people. If you don't love cats the game is just not worth $12. If you like platformers I would probably pick up the game when it is on sale though.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review	[www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","37","54","0","0"

The jumping is painful, and since this IS a platformer, that's pretty much all you do. The movement in this game is extremely slippery and the controls are just a mess, so it'll often take 10-15 tries just to do the simplest of jumps. Yeah, the cats are cute and I had high hopes that this would be a relaxing and enjoyable game, but unfortunately at this point it's just a chore to play, and I don't think there's enough enjoyable gameplay to justify buying it at full price.","November 15, 2015","false","2.2"," 94 of 156 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","94","156","9","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/409100/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","The Purring Quest is a cute platformer where you play as a cat. The game takes place on a twodimensional plane where you (the cat) has to jump, climb, claw weaker enemies, and avoid bigger enemies like dogs.\nAlong the way there are collectibles: each level has 200 rotten fish to find, one trapped cat, and one other item.\n\nThe strengths of the game are in how it feels like you really are playing a cat, with a world that looks to scale and plausible dangers. It is an 'epic quest' but on cat scale.\nThere is no voiced dialog, but at several times the story is told through textboxes. Which is a bit of a shame as the game intro is completely textless but succeeds perfectly in telling the game's story, and is excellently animated for this game style.\n\nGood points are how good the main character is controllable -- as long as you use a controller. The game offers two different jump styles: long jump and double-jump. You can switch as you start the game to a style that you like best.\nI also tried keyboard controls, but they don't feel as responsive as the  controller does.\nThe levels are all relatively easy to get through with a boss fight or other challenge at the end, but they're all very possible. The challenge comes from finding all hidden items.\nIn level three you get a hiding ability that made me laugh... Solid Cat.\n\nBad points are that the game occasionally likes to hide enemies behind foreground effects. This leads to a cheap death. You do get seven lives and even if you die seven times you can respawn at a checkpoint, but cheap deaths are never fun. You also have falling damage... for a cat. Thematically that just feels wrong.\n\nThe game starts in a pretty dark level at a graveyard which may be too scary for younger players - not that anything bad happens, but the mood can be scary. Afterwards everything is lighter and more fun so if playing with a young child consider starting them at level two.\n\nOverall fun game and definitely worth checking out if you like platformers.","April 3","true","9.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/409100/","manicado","Meownic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/","271 products in account","I would first like to thank Valhalla Cats for the copy of the game to go ahead with this review.\n\nIf you would want to skip the wall of text and see the video version, please do go ahead and watch that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnAIezSN_G8\n\nNeko version -\n\nNyan nyan, purr purr purr, hiss purr. <3 Valhalla Cats <3<3\n\nEnglish version -\n\nOpening this game I was quite excited as I'm a huge fan of kittens, cats and meo-re. If you want a preview without too much spoilers I have added my video above, as I'm not too great with words. Feel free to watch that instead for a better idea of the game.\n\nThe game begins with a very heart wrenching cutscene, upon this cutscene I paused to question "how long do cats actually live? Surely not this long?!" But anyway- Politics aside... upon finishing that cutscene you are then brought to the main menu where you get to choose from English or Spanish languages. On the main menu there were only three options 'New, Continue and Quit' which troubled me a little bit as I do love volume control. The reason I love volume control is because this game is very loud. Luckily upon starting a new game you can open the menu and get volume option sliders! Yipee!\n\nWhen you start the game you are presented with an overworld layout (like Mario) where you can choose levels. There are 5 levels ranging from villages to a cities. When you get into the game it has all the functions of a platformer - as you'd expect. There are several checkpoints in the levels which I feel are too spaced out because sometimes the game can be very cheap with killing you. You die from insta kills - such as falling down pits or being spiked to death or from being hit by rats and enemies which in turn takes away 1 cat head which you have 7. (You can see them to the top left in the screenshots.) In control of the cat, you have a normal jump, a normal attack, a high jump, hide button and a climb button. The reason you need to have a hide button is because of those pesky dogs which I found frustrating, If they touch you once you restart at the last checkpoint.\n\nIn the levels you have collectibles too - there are smelly fish bones (which are the most common scattered everywhere), hidden objects such as paintings which can be tough to find and the final collectibles are trapped cats in cages which you swipe to break them free. They then have a fascinating discussion and whenever I spoke to them I always imagined them to speak french back. (Don't ask why)\n\nMoving on, I don't blame how cats are after playing this game. It makes me realise that everything is out to get them! Dobermans, Chihuahuas, Pitfalls, Pugs, Electrical Cables, Frogs, falling plantpots, moles and the most frustrating of all Cacti. They caused me many deaths. (And I have only got to level 2). The reason I stopped there was because I'm pretty bad at platformers, the high jump mechanic feels a bit off (like I'm not sure if it's just me, but would love someone to clarify that) and those blasted Cacti!\n\nI had to stop there because my blood pressure would've gone through the roof otherwise. I would've really appreciated if they added difficulty options or life collectibles. Even more checkpoints would definitely suffice. Getting killed cheaply and then resetting quite far back was annoying. So please, if you are annoyed easily enter at your own risk.\n\nI recommend this to all cat lovers, cats, platformer appreciators and those down for a good challenge. I would however not recommend it to those who get agitated/annoyed easily because this game can easily set you off with its cheap tricks of killing you.\n\nIn the end, I feel it's farrrr from purrfect but if you do find enjoyment in the game it is a very pleasant experience indeed.\n\nThanks for reading and let me know if I can add more/or if you have questions feel free to post below :)\n","November 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","33","50","6","4"

The theme is cool, and from what I've heard thusfar of the soundtrack, it is rather nicely done. Some cool mechanics (like hiding) etc are nice.\n\nCons: Game might be a little simplistic for some, but then it is a 2D sidescroller.\n\nWhat needs fixed:\n\n1). XPadder for some weird reason does not like this game. This is the only program that can tell XPadder is running. I have never seen any program or game be able to tell the difference between keyboard input and XPadder. I bound the Q button and the spacebar (attack and jump respectively) to different buttons on my joypad using XPadder (because the game ONLY allows 360 controllers). When I pressed the button for jump I'd sometimes jump, but sometimes attack. This obviously wasn't going to work, so I was forced into using WASD controls instead. (Side-scrolling on a 360 analog stick is a huge "NOPE!"). Not sure what to suggest here, other than perhaps looking into enabling more controllers than just 360 controllers.\n\n2). The first stage's boss's hitbox is really wonky. In fact, the character's attack hitbox seems a bit off. The first boss is very erratic, it seems to be entirely random if you hit the boss, or the boss hits you, or you trade hits. Given that he takes more than 6 hits to kill and you can only take 6 hits yourself... yeah, good luck with that. I think the best thing to do here, is to give the player character a slightly bigger hitbox with his attack. Also, it'd be nice if we could attack in mid-air, the first boss seems a bit frustrating when you spend most of the fight waiting for him to attack you (and you'll probably just get hit in mid-swing anyways, no matter when you time it). Also for some weird reason, the boss's hitbox seems to be "off" too -- when he flies side-to-side, he was "hitting" me even though he wasn't actually touching me.\n\n3). Sound/Music FX sliders would have been nice in the first config dialogue popup before you actually get into the game. I have a strong pair of headphones, and most programs I need to turn the volume down considerably or I get my eardrums blown out. Being able to set volume levels before actually entering the game is a godsend, so it'd be really nice if you could include that.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","1"

Then they come back when they need food or curling around you. Well this time around, the cat wants to find his owner, and boy oh boy, now I know why cats have seven lives to spare - they really need them! Jump into the Purring quest and find out why?\n\nThe Purring Quest is a 2D platformer where you take control of Kimchi, a cat who is on a quest to find his owner. As you launch the game, you will see what’s about about to happen to Kimchi, and why it wants to find his owner. It is a rather emotional start to the game (without spoiling it). The quest itself has five beautiful levels and you will have to collect fishbones (200 per level), a hidden cat and a collectable. Scratching posts will be laid out at intervals within each level.  As you pass each of these posts, your progress is automatically saved. You will lose one of your seven lives if a dog catches you, especially the nasty chihuahua and/or the adorable doberman. Other animals, like the pigeon, are to be avoided, or you can hit them with your little paw to get rid of them, but make sure your timing is right, otherwise you will lose another life! You might be aware that cats will always land on their feet no matter what - but what happens if the length of the fall is very high? Well, you will lose another life. Pots will drop from windows and even pigeon droppings can be a challenge to get through! Kimchi will meet other cats (famous cats, I may add) during his journey, with whom he will have a little conversation, or even be offered something to help him on his quest.\n\nI really like the graphics and animations in this game; really well executed and the game runs smoothly. You can use either the gamepad or the keyboard for the controls but I personally prefer using the gamepad. Good, smooth soundtrack, too.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Good Story\n-	Good Soundtrack\n-	Fun and challenging at times\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No difficulty option\n\nI really enjoy The Purring Quest, a 2D platformer with a good story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/409100/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1063 products in account","Status: 100% completed\n\nIncredibly charming and cute game, but not without the flaws. It was quite disastrous at its launch and I couldn't even complete the first level because of the boss collider problem, controls and combat system back in a day. But developers fixed and added A LOT since then, making the game much better. I can't even imagine it being fun without such thing as Double Jump (added only in 1.4).\n\nPresentation\n\nVery nice and fluid animations, although not as advanced as they could be. I still find climbing animation to be awkward and it looks like a climbing man in a cat costume (at least to me).\nArtwork is good and sprites are very detailed. Many personal touches and details you might not notice on your first walkthrough. I'd only complain about the skyscrapers background on the last level, it was very low-resolution, blurry and it can be even distracting if the camera is zoomed in.\n\nGameplay / Technical Notes\n\nIt's a pretty basic platform game – jump, attack some enemies, avoid falling things, collect items for bonuses. You can also hide behind specific objects from enemies like dogs, but it's not really necessary and you can also just jump over them and run. Later in the game you get a hiding box (like in Metal Gear Solid), which allows you to hide anywhere, anytime you want.\nIt controls like...well, almost like in Lion King (1994). You need to get used to it.\nAs for the difficulty, the game was much more punishing than it is now, but the sudden difficulty spikes are still there. Practically all levels are basically a walk in the park (maybe except that mole boss fight), but just before the final level it gets much more challenging (with extremely frustrating piano mini-game and spotlight chase). Speaking of that mini-game, it appears out of blue in the end of 4th level and it may seriously hurt your experience or even put you off the game. It's very similar to Guitar Hero and it's pretty fast. It could work, but not in the way it was implemented and definitely not with the controller.\nIf you play the game with controller, you simply wouldn't be available to get past that mini-game at all. Imagine pressing buttons on Xbox360 / XBone controller pretty fast just seeing colours of controller buttons on screen, not even letters. Playing it with keyboard is definitely less frustrating, because you can put your fingers on it like on a piano, but it's frustrating nonetheless. In the end I managed to beat it (and even getting an achievement for doing only one mistake) by tricking my brain. It's hard to explain, but it was about dividing the screen into two areas inside mind and expecting hands to follow.\nAt least you can switch between controller and keyboard on the fly.\nAlso, if you play it on TV, be prepared that the dialogue font is quite small and overall the game was designed to be played in front of a monitor.\n\nAs for the options, there is a standard Unity launcher where you can change resolution and graphics quality. You can only change volume of sounds and music inside the game itself.\n\nMusic / Sound\n\nMusic is really great, relaxing and good to listen outside the game. Sounds are just as good and fitting, cat sounds specifically are very charming. I also like how the cat you play (Kimchi) makes “meow” sounds from time to time.\n\nStory\n\nStory is about cat returning a medallion to the man which looks after him (I won't say “owner”, uh-huh). The intro is sad and can be heartbreaking, but the “cutscenes” (both intro and ending) are made in form of a slideshow and don't feature any kind of animation. The pictures change very fast, it looks quite rough and can be distracting.\nOn your way through the game you will also meet characters based on real life cats (such as Nora and Oscar).\n\nHow long to beat\n\nThe game is short and can be completed in 1-2 hours (standard walkthrough) or 2.5-3 hours (completing / collecting everything). Which is great for me.\n\nMade by passionate cat lovers, it's a must-have game if you like cats. Despite the mentioned mini-game and the game itself still being rough around the edges.\n\nReview key provided by the developer\n\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","January 16","true","4.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Firstly, a percentage of the profits will go directly to animal welfare associations, so you are contributing to a good cause.\n\nYou'll play as Kimchi, one of the cutest cat you'll ever see, who is trying to find their owner. On your adventure, you will also help out other cats by finding their lost items and will be able to free four special needed cats who were trapped in cages by an evil cat.\n\nThe game mechanic will grant lots of fun and will be extremely "user friendly" in a way that even players who are usually real bad in platform games will be able to finish The Purring Quest without getting stressed. There're only five game maps, so you'll be able to finish in a couple hours.\n\nWell, truth to be told, if you are kinda bad in games like Guitar Hero like I'm, you might have some difficulties near the end of the game because of the Piano's Game in the end of the fouth level. Gladly I have some great real life friends and one of them helped me to get through that part before I decided to start a murderous rampage.\n\nThat being said, I had a great time playin' and I think you'll have as well, especially if you love cats and as you are reading this, I know you do.","April 20","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(I kinda feel bad about it given part goes to charity.)\n\nI've played a little over 30 mins so far and I really enjoy this game. The art is amazing, the music is nice and the game is relaxing (for a platformer.)\n\nNow, this is nowhere near the best platforming I've ever seen in a game but for some reason I just really "like" this game. I may like cats, sure, but playing this game just makes me feel good. Makes me happy... puts me in a better mood. However you'd like to say it. And honestly, that more than makes up for it not being the perfect platformer (and not perfect isn't bad, by any means.)\n\nI like the touching, "Up-like" intro (you'll know what I mean if you play the game) as well, and how it sets the story for the game. The other cats you meet and resue are a nice touch. And even though I generally hate random collecting in platformers, I'm actually enjoying trying to go for all the fishbones in each level.\n\nSo...\n\nDo you like cats?\nDo you like good art?\nDo you like good music?\nDo you like cute stories?\nDo you like decent platformers?\nDo you like supporting good causes?\n\nIf you answered "YES" to any of the above questions, you should be buying this game now.

The animation is top-notch, the cat movements are very realistic. The music is pleasant and relaxing, but I didn't really like the music level. I had to have my daughter complete it for me, I never have been good at music games. The controls can be a bit frustrating at times, but overall are pretty responsive. Each level there is a cat to find and set free and famous cats to have conversations with. There are enemies such as rats and birds that can be dispatched by your claws.  You can hide in a box from the dogs or jump over the chihuahuas and run. There are old ladies peeking out of windows that need to be swiftly dodged or crept past. The boss battles at the end of each level aren't too difficult once you know what to do. I have followed The Purring Quest since it was in Greenlight, upvoted it and was excited to see it finally released on Steam. It is a gem of a game, one of my favorite games released from Greenlight and I highly recommend it.","February 12","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It took me 2 hours, of casual play, to complete the game and all achievements. The last 30 minutes were probably spent on replays looking for a single fishbone I had missed. If you only play longer games, you can stop reading, as you'll be frustrated with the lack of content.\n\nThat said, the game is cute, and imaginative, putting you into the role as a cat, The game at it's core is a platformer, with a total of 5 levels. At the end of each level you get a "boss" fight, where the gameplay shifts drastically. It causes a little confusion while you figure out what you need to do, but the game is forgiving in that you get plenty of lives, and should you run out, you can choose to "continue" and you refill all your lives.\n\nI still don't have a good sense of the target audience. The puzzles themselves are single and straightforward, so a child could play confortably, but there are also time bassed sessions and quirky controls that are better suited to an adult.\n\nThe game offers keyboard or full controller support, but I found I had to keep switching back and forth. For general play, the controller was a lot easier, but when I reached a music "boss" fight, where you notes scroll from the top of the screen and you hit the appropriate button at the right time, I found the controller was almost impossible to manage due to the way the screen presents the info. Switching to keys, I aced the fight in my first try.\n\nI do recommend the game, and had a lot of fun playing it, but if you pick it up, just be aware that you'll get a max of two hours and find yourself wanting a little more.","May 21","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While trying to find him, you find along the way wise cats helpful to varying degrees, a number of caged cats and a conspiracy centered on catnip... Here the setting especially delights as it offers tantalizing clues (LEGALIZE CATNIP! TALK TO YOUR CAT ABOUT CATNIP BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES). I also particularly enjoyed the variety to the 'boss' fights; no two are the same, and they tie into abilities and themes of the current chapter.\n\nAnd if you simply love cats, you shouldn't even be reading this far, you should already own this game. ;)","February 28","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played this game with a keyboard and had little problems, the trick is to use the directional pad for movement and tab,q,space,z for actions.  Also i found it easier to use the double jump technique as it is easier to control the jums and more precise imo.\n\nBack to the game, although its not terribly long, for the price, its fine, plus i would love the dev to make a sequel and  this is a good way to support them in that endevor.  Its a very enjoyable game and i you like  cats then you would do yourself a great disservice if you do not play it.  Also it supports a cause and has some important messages scattered throughout the levels about treating cats in general.\n\nThe story is very simple and to the point and it is very touching.\n\nI will be replaying it to obtain the 100% achievment, its is def worth it.\n\nAs it is on sale right now, I would recommend you buy it, no question.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/409100/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","You know how some people say that cats just don't really care about humans- that the only reason they put up with us is because we scratch their fur, feed them whenever they ask, brush them and scoop the cat box? Well... this game kind of disproves all that, all the while offering some fairly decent platforming action. There's even a sweet little story to go along with it- and to top it off, the game is challenging, but not overly so. You won't throw your controller down in frustration, not even once. This time around, wash your fur and straighten out those whiskers, we're reviewing The Purring Quest.\n\nThis game has you taking on the role of Kimchi, a cat that is owned by an older gentleman. The opening montage to the game tells of a bittersweet story-a young man falls in love and marries his dearest, and then they adopt a cat- Kimchi. They live for many years in peace and happiness, until one day... the wife falls ill and passes away from some unexplained illness. This leaves Kimchi's owner in a state of shock, and he ends up just living with his cat for many more years- developing what appears to be some form of Alzheimer's as depicted by the pictures on the wall flickering and fading away. However, Kimchi is essential to reminding him of the current day- and all is seemingly good. Until... he takes Kimchi out to visit his wife's grave at the cemetary, and ties his leash up to a fence post to make sure he doesn't run off while he visits the grave. He spots a woman that looks amazingly like his departed wife did when she was young, and he ends up wandering off after her, dropping a picture necklace that might be the only thing that can jog his memory. Kimchi panics- his owner has just left him all alone in the graveyard, and to make matters worse, some crow just swooped on down and stole his owner's locket. Struggling out of the harness, Kimchi starts to make his way back to the city to locate his lost owner.\n\nThe game consists of five levels- the graveyard, the village, the gothic quarter, the city, and the skyscrapers. You'll need to complete each one in order to finish the game. There aren't any secret levels as far as I know, but what there are in each level are things to collect and famous cats to meet. There's no sign of Grumpy, but you'll end up meeting cats like Nora the piano cat, Oskar the blind cat, Nala, Cooper the photographer cat, and Henri "Le Chat Noir", the philosopher cat. Each of them is a bit of an internet celebrity in their own right- for example, Cooper's owners regularly attach a digital camera to his collar and let him wander off, letting the camera occasionally taking a picture from a cat's-eye view, and a collection of these ended up in a published book. Each of these famous cats helps to guide Kimchi on his way to finding his lost owner.\n\nEach level also contains things to find- two hundred stinky fish bones have been hidden through each level, along with a kidnapped, caged cat and a collectible that ties in with that level's famous cat- be it a piano score of Nora's music, a copy of Cooper's book, etc. These can be hunted down and found for achievements, just like the kidnapped cats can. The caged cats are kind of hard to find- but if you just keep looking around and listening for the meowing when you get close, you'll be on your way to finding them. Cat scratchers are also littered through each level- touch one of them to save your progress through the level and it'll serve as a continue point.\n\nHowever, well... not everything is catnip and boxes- Kimchi will have to deal with a selection of enemies through each level. Mice, birds, frogs, pits, spiked fences, sharp-thorned cacti and, of course... dogs. The dogs are the worst- while you are able to attack with a claw swipe while standing still, there's not much you can do against a dog except run away or try to hide. If one catches your scent, the only thing you can do is run away from it and hope it doesn't catch you. If one does, you'll end up losing a hit and be sent back to the last cat scratcher you touched. Kimchi can also lose a hit by falling too far- you'll crash to the ground and be sent back to the last scratcher you passed. Get hit seven times and that's all she meowed- but you have unlimited continues and you pick up at the last scratcher you activated, so death really isn't much of a penalty.\n\nYou get to chose between a few different options in the beginning- the game not only supports KBAM, but it also uses a controller no problem. You also get to choose jumping styles- either Kimchi can do a high jump or a double jump, whichever suits your playstyle better.\n\nI completed the game in about an hour, but I imagine that going to find everything (which I plan to do) will expand it to maybe three or four hours.\n\nI only have a handful of complaints about this game- the fish bones you need to collect are only really highlighted with a faint green aura- I'd really like it if they had a bit more color to them so they were easier to spot. Also, there's a rather jarring rhythm game section after the fourth level where you have to play a section from the game's theme song on a four-key keyboard. You get infinite tries to do it, but... the last thing I was expecting was to have to do something like this, and there's no warning or opportunity to practice.\n\nSteam wants ten funbucks for this- and I'd be happy to pay that for this. The graphics are solid, the gameplay is tight and well-made, and there really don't seem to be any major game-breaking bugs. Not to mention that a portion of the proceeds go to animal welfare organizations, so you're helping out animals in need and getting a decent game for playing or gift-a-pulting, which is all good and wonderful.\n\nTL;DR - Buy this game. The cats command it. 8/10.","April 2","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As another review said, playing this game is therapeutic (at least if you like cats and melancholy).\n\nThis grabbed me from the opening scene. It seems odd to have a full-out platformer and story based on being a cat. Yet there it is, and competently at that. A few things are contrived (it is a game after all) but it really felt like a cat's journey to find/help his owner, coming across the caged cats and celebrity cats really added a lot of flavor to the whole journey feel. A great story (I'd say with the same emotional impact as the entirety of How I Met Your Mother), told effectively in the short span of 2 minutes and with only a few animations. Proof that you don't need million dollar, epic sweeping cutscenes to deliver a powerful emotional punch. Unrelated thought, but the scenes in this were way better than in Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void, in my opinion. The 'secondary' storyline isn't really related to the main story, but it also helps add some subtle meaning to the journey.\n\nMusic/Graphics: Beautiful. Everything is hand drawn, with a lot of extra details in the foreground/background like trilobites, funny graffiti, even the fish bone collectibles have flies buzzing around them. The title screen music (main theme) instantly makes me melancholic, and the other music suits each level perfectly. Ranging from calm for the quiet forests/cities, to a sort of 'suppressed urgency' for the last. Would be a good idea to have a separate soundtrack if it's not already in the files.\n\nControls: The weakest part. Kimchi is responsive, but sometimes overly sensitive when jumping (seems to have an initial deadzone for moving left/right, then suddenly accelerates). Also, with default controls I couldn't do a high jump while running to the right, so I had to change the control settings (which weren't a great choice to begin with). Changing the controls isn't the easiest thing in the world, it seems like *every* single option for every peripheral type is thrown into one big list, and you need to find your particular peripheral, taking some guesses. Also, the 'tutorial' messages don't seem to update buttons to match your particular setup but I could be wrong.\n\nGameplay: I bought this game somewhat as a 'joke', but it's a surprisingly capable platformer. There isn't a huge variety in the platforming puzzles and a few sections can be frustrating (largely due to controls), but overall it's very satisfying, helped in part bythe desire to collect every item. Finding everything will make you work a little bit, but generally isn't difficult and won't make you spend 50 hours which fits the theme (as interpreted by me) of this game being more of an experience. Each level tends to have its own flavor as far as specific platform arrangements or moves. Also, the end sequence (or boss battle) for each level is a unique experience (first boss seems weakest designwise). The levels aren't too long, any longer and they'd be a drag in my opinion. The overall game length is quite short, but it still felt right to me.\n\nIt's clearly an indie game and there are a few rough edges, but this is a great complete package with everything tying in to each other making it greater than the sum of its parts. It's apparent that a lot of care and love went into this game, from the selection screen all the way to the credits. The premise seems a little bit silly at first, but a game hasn't struck me as much as this has in a while (enough to make me write my first game review).","December 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls feel sluggish and unreactive, the dreaded "skating on ice" syndrome at times. I have a cat and she can (figuratively) turn on a dime, so better agility or traction would've been appreciated for Kimchi.\n\nThe game allows you to pick between two control schemes - an original "high jump" scheme and recently added "double jump". "High jump" while more realistic is atrocious to play with, a really bad experience. Luckily "double jump" saves the day.\n\nThe game's saving grace is that it's about cats. Cats earn them thumbs up. The backgrounds are suprisingly atmospheric and the music is adequate. The celebrity cats that appear ingame are very cool, particularly Henri. There are only 5 levels and as such it can easily be completed in a single sitting, quite possibly with all achievements.","December 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls take practice, and I've certainly played more elaborate platform games than this, but few games exude such affection for their subject matter, and so effectively tug at the heartstrings of their target audience. The game itself is a pretty lightweight experience, over in a few hours. But the experience of having played it, the wonderful and moving music, and the beautiful artwork, are things that I'll carry with me for much longer. <3","December 5, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had to play some of the levels over several days as I got very frustrated trying to repeatedly make it through various parts of the game. Thankfully the checkpoints appear fairly often throughout the levels and lives are fairly disposable. Although some of the secrets are hidden out of the way a little bit, I did not find that I had trouble finding anything or felt stuck along the way. I ended up missing two fish on one of the levels by mistake however once I beat that level I easily went back through and found them.\n\nI also had issues getting the game to show the opening cinematic (I only got to watch it once) and the background on the title screen, level selection screen & the last section of lv 4. I am not sure if changing something would work but I was able to play the game without and had no problems in the levels themselves. Happily the game seemed to deside that the time I loaded it to beat the last part of the final level was a good time to show cinimatics so I actually got to watch the ending on the same run as I watched the beginning.\n\nI found the game rewarding overall and the cuteness, enjoyable music & fairly linear path seemed to make up for the frustrations with the controls & callenges in various stages of the levels so I would suggest this for anyone patient enough to work through the game.","March 31","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take this game for what it is and I'm certain anyone who likes felines or animals in general could find something of liking here.\n\nLet's just start off and say that it is a cute little game with what I'd consider a rather pleasant art style, in fact the small spurts of kitty jokes and "Aww that's cute" moments combined with how the game has been drawn up is what pretty much made the game for me personally. After playing through all the levels and finding all the collectibles I ended up falling short of just 3 hours so if you're looking for an extensive game this is certainly not for you, it's more like a quick fuzzy experience that will warm you up, probably a great game if you're feeling down and need to get your mind off things.\n\nGameplay wise it's alright and nothing over the top. Controlling your character doesn't have too much feel to it and I'd class it more more like a well made flash game on that aspect which can be taken as you wish. The platforming is not by any means challenging when it does come up, so it just strengthen the idea of the game being a relaxing experience with kitties rather than a challenging puzzle and platforming game. The game allows you to play both with a keyboard and an xbox controller so that's a plus! And the controls feel solid enough so any seasoned player should not have too many problems or frustration going through the story and enjoying the game as a whole.\n\nWhat I personally would've liked would be a longer game, where maybe the different areas of the game would have more than one level to give some more sense of travel since the game sure is, very short. Maybe some interesting cutscenes inbetween the levels instead of a "Straight into action from the menu" sort of take, since it feels like the game would benefit from this and give players something more to get invested in. The game also lacks much replayability once you've ran through it which is also a bummer. As far as the challenges and platforming goes I would've liked it getting even more tricky down the end of the game, but since there's not much room to expand a difficulty curve it makes enough sense that it was made the way it was.\n\nOver all I think despite the shorter play time and the price tag I found this a welcoming game and I enjoyed myself. Snatch this game up on a steam sale and there should not be any regrets, just don't come in with high expectations as this game was probably a feat by itself on limited resources.\n\nNice art style, cute humor and easy going game. It get's my thumbs up.","April 14","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love the graphical style and atmospheric music. Have only completed the Graveyard level so far, but it has been quite challenging. The game is a platformer at heart, so if you are used to platformers you will know the frustration you feel every time you misjudge a jump and the satisfaction when you finally get it right. The controls are ok, but if you are using the keyboard having to press "S" and then "Space" to high jump can be a bit fiddly at times. You will need patience to enjoy this game and if you don't enjoy platformers you migh want to stay away.\n\nBut as a cat platform game it is pretty good and I must say I am enjoying it so far. I like the main cat sprite and meeting the other cats is cool.

Didn't like the ending one bit, very lacking. Wouldn't say this is worth $10, as it is very short with only five levels.\n\nBut this is a cute game that supports multiple cat organizations, charities, etc. The fact that the cats in the game exist in real life is also really nice and charming.

As much as I would love you to tell that this game is great, I just simply can't. But let's start from the beginning. Purring Quest is a platformer with many design mistakes. The beginning of the game is really not that great. The first 3 levels are simply not designed for its actual gameplay. It feels like if you are putting Mario in a Sonic stage, for example Green Hill Zone. But not with Sonic's Physics. This fact makes the first 3 levels of the game just bad. If you are closing one eye, you might can say they are ok-ish. But that is everything you can say. On the other hand, the last 2 stages are good! They are challenging and most importantly built with the core gameplay in mind. But still 2 out of 5 good stages is still nothing you should be proud of. Next the graphics, they are ok. Nice hand drawn graphics which are nice to see. They look cute and that is what the game wanted to be. A cute platformer with a somewhat touching story. Thirdly, the game gives you the option to choose from 2 gameplay styles. "high jump" or "double jump". The problem here is that double jump is again not designed for the stages. You will often get stuck and not able to progress any further. That is terrible! And last, my biggest problem with this game is the actual content. You can easily beat this game in under 1hrs. 1hrs!!! for 10$. That is really really expensive for a game. I happened to have done a 100% run in this game. At the end I had a bit more than 2hrs on record. This probably has happened since I am playing platformers alot. But still, do you really wanna play 2hrs of gameplay for 10 bucks? At the end, I can only recommend to you this game if you are looking for a short and cute game with average gameplay at best. Or if you are looking for a way to support animal welfare associations though purchasing a game. Since the store page is telling you "A percentage of the profits will go directly to various animal welfare associations. So in addition to enjoying the game, you are contributing to a good cause." The problem here is, you don't actually know how much of your money goes into their hands. Maybe it is 1% or 99%. You are not actually told that.\n\nRating: 4/10","March 13","false","2.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","1"

Even the basic platforming is rather frustrating, and the boss battles (something I'm already biased against) are infuriating. This isn't a difficult-on-purpose kind of thing, like Super Meat Boy, it's a difficult-because-of-flawed-programming thing.\nWhile it's a different type of game, for cat fans I'd recommend Catlateral Damage instead. Its controls aren't perfect either, but they're better than this, *and* tight handling isn't as important for what it's doing.","April 16","false","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A fitting price for this game would be somewhere between $5-$8, but because it supports a good cause, it needs a few dollars margin.\n\nGameplay\nIt's a bit wonky. It's difficult to control the cat, the enemies are overpowered, there's two types of jumps and the higher jumps are a pain. Though, nothing that can't be fixed (-- Please fix it).\n\nAnimation\nBecause the animation was all hand-drawn, it has its own style and has probably been time-consuming to make, but the end result is stunning.\n\nStory\nIt starts off with a kick in the groin, you progress as the cat from there on. Although the first bit's confusing, it sets the average tone for the rest of the game. You also meet plenty of popular cats and the humor keeps you hooked.\n\nMisc\n-How much money goes to this good cause, per sale?

Valhalla Cats, the Spanish studio behind the game, proudly state on their website that each member of the team has at least one cat. However, the game’s tag-line “have you ever wanted to be a cat?” is not entirely apt. The Purring Quest is not a sim game, nor does it offer the multitude of interactions found in the PS2 adventure game Dog’s Life, with its similar tag line: “It’s great being a dog.” Rather, It’s a somewhat old-school platformer, with increasingly difficult stages ending in a boss fight or similar encounter.\n\nYou take control of Kimchi the cat, jumping on window ledges, climbing trees and chasing birds and mice, and each stage has a number of collectible items like fish bones (warning: don’t feed your cat fish bones). Kimchi has two kinds of jumps used to reach these precious fish bones and ultimately move on to the next level. A regular short jump and a high jump, done by holding a left shoulder button then X. This choice of button press seems unintuitive at first, but it soon becomes second nature.\n\nThe game’s enemies are the aforementioned mice and birds. Kimchi’s only attack is a single swipe of her claws, but that’s more than enough to send these foes bursting in to a puff of smoke…yeah, the enemies literally burst into smoke. This was confusing at first, but it may have something to do with the family friendly nature of the game. There are also dogs which must be avoided at all costs. Early in the game you get a cardboard box (perhaps a nod to Metal Gear Solid?) which can be used to hide from these dogs which are prowling the streets.\n\nThe boss fights have some interesting ideas built in to them; like knocking rocks on to moles heads as they pop in and out of the ground. In practice, the control scheme just isn’t quite as responsive or fluid as you would like it to be and it makes the fights quite frustrating as a result. In that fight, there are cactus plants between the moles, forcing you to jump around them. The jumping is just not accurate enough to be able to avoid these cacti completely. Then there’s the final encounter which is basically a race to escape the boss. The difficulty spike here is gargantuan; the jumps come thick and fast and must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Expect to retry the final boss many times.\n\nFull Review: http://gamesnosh.com/the-purring-quest-review/","November 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As a platformer though it is pretty mediocre.   Playing this with a keyboard is downright painful and the controls are not where they need to be for a game in 2015.  The jumping is very clunky and at certain points in the game it makes some segments much ahrder than they should be.\n\nAside from that, the game is pretty short.  There's a lot of collectable items, but no steam achievements so you feel like you are weasting your time searching these things out.   There's some overly annoying mechanics at certain parts in the game like the patrol dogs.   Aside from the painful controls, the game is easy in the sense that there is no cost to death or running out of lives.  If you die you go back to the last checkpoint in the stage, if you run out of lives it's the same thing, so why even bother with lives?\n\nThe game is only 5 stages, and for some baffling reason there is a rhythm game segment that you have to do which is really annoying in the middle of a platformer.  The only saving grace is the cat meow symphony in the credits, which is pretty damned good to be honest.\n\nWait for a sale if you want to pick this up.","November 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

I expected something comfy and relaxing but the terrible controls (both Xbox360 controller and keyboard) are slippery. The cat never jumps high enough or gets stuck on things or hits the border of objects and fall, specially with doble jump. High jump seems to be broken because it's only a regular jump. Half of the time going through levels is spent trying to jump into some platform that it's required to finish the level. If you ever had an illness in your hands or arms like me, avoid this game, my arms actually hurt a lot from playing this game.\n\nThere are better ways to donate your money to charity than purchasing this game, like giving it directly to the organizations, at least until they fix it.","April 10","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clamburglar/recommended/409100/","clamburglar","The Sauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clamburglar/","1326 products in account","At first The Purring Quest seems like it would be a game for children, but that idea is put to bed early on by the first cut scene and the difficult controls. Since nearly all the positive reviews mention control awkwardness, and some mention console controls being the solution, I went straight to console controls. That just raises another frustration: there's no controller layout diagram, or even a list of bindings. You receive control instructions the moment you first encounter the necessity to use a control, and it's for the keyboard control. You have to hunt around on the gamepad to figure out which button S and W are mapped to (they're the bumper keys, by the way). It's not the sort of intuitive thing that you'd automatically go to. To save you some frustration if you do decide to try this game, use the left bumper to jump higher, and that same key makes you hide (where available), but the right bumper makes you climb (when available), and unhides when hidden.\n\nBoss fights are all around terrible and just shoehorned in, because side scrollers need boss fights? There's no life meter, and really no indication that you've just entered into the boss fight that feels like it doesn't belong there to begin with. Health and lives are at times interchangable, with some things taking one health away and rebounding you back, and other things taking one health away and sending you back to your last checkpoint. Regardless, when you're out of health, you just continue back at the checkpoint with full health (so why not just give all health back any time you're sent back to the checkpoint?)\n\nThe artwork is fine, but it seems like level design is artwork-based instead of playability based. Terrain is spaced out for the artwork, not for playability. The Purring Quest feels very much like a clunky collaboration of a single first time game developer and a single first time game artist, with a very amateur feel to a well drawn game. There is no story to speak of here as any sort of saving grace.\n\nThere's nothing of value to be found in The Purring Quest, especially at a $12 price tag.","November 24, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

Other reviewers mentioned this issue, but it wasn't until I played the game myself that I understood how badly it affects the playing experience. It is way, way too sensitive! I couldn't even enjoy the ending of the game because I was too mad and frustrated and Not Feeling The Warm Fuzzies to appreciate the conclusion - in fact, I felt disgust that I persevered through the final level and all I got was, well, that.

I love the realism of the cat.\n\nThe controls are too frustrating, though. The biggest challenge in a game shouldn't be trying to get it to respond properly. I wasted too much time trying to get my cat to just jump correctly. I started just not bothering with some tasks and just trying to take the easiest route.\n\nBut then I got motion sick. Seriously. The jerkiness and something about the way the background moves (or doesn't move?) made me dizzy and want to throw up. It felt terrible. I had to sit and take deep breaths for a long time to recover and decided I couldn't play the game ever again.\n\nI hope the devs do some research into how people who are prone to motion sickness respond to the way characters move, how backgrounds move, and how the two move together. It was way off. I've never felt so physically ill after playing a game as I did with this one. So sad.

I played with the double jump setting with mouse and keyboard and had a heck of a time with 80% of my jumps. Occasionally you'll run into dogs that will bark if they catch you, sending you back to your last check point. Combine that with the frustrating platforming and you're looking at a lot of repitition and tediom. Also repeating so many things kind of makes the soundtrack lose its luster; there's just not enough variety imo.\n\nAlso the first boss battle was very easy and felt very tedious as well. attack the boss, casually walk around its next attack, attack again.

The Purring Quest has taught me otherwise. The Indie Platformer based around internet felines only had maybe one or two moggies that I recognised!\n\nThe stories introduction places you in the role of a cat chasing after its owner. From here you platform your way through five different levels to reach him and return his locket. Along the way you meet some famous cats who. I'd say they encourage you along but they really don't do anything other than recite a few lines which presumably are based on what they're famous for.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the aesthetic, it's almost cutsey and reminded me almost instantly of 102 Dalmatians on the Gameboy Colour which is a game that I played a lot as a child. Everything is hand drawn and has a consistent theme to it. The animations are also fantastic, especially the one you do to hide behind things, but they often transition awkwardly ruining the flow of them.\n\nThe platforming itself is difficult thanks to some pretty nasty controls, you lose any momentum immediately and the jumping feels too heavy especially when you use the high jump. Some levels, the final one most obviously, also have a few issues where it can be difficult to tell the background from platforms. The levels themselves however aren't very hard to get through and the majority of the games difficulty comes from collecting all the items around the level. With 200 'fish bones' throughout the level and a couple of other things hidden out of the way there's maybe 3 or 4 hours of content in all.\n\nEach level also ends with a different style of 'boss' from a combat based enemy to a difficult Assassins Creed like climb. The last two of these, a guitar heroes type piano playing section and a speed run platforming section, were enormous difficulty spikes compared to the rest of the game and would likely cause many people to give up on it.\n\nIn all the Purring Quest ends up being an unfortunately median platformer in an oversaturated marketplace. It's core theme isn't strong enough to pull it through the occasionally dodgy platforming and the general difficulty of the game will leave a lot to be desired. Still; there's far worse out there and every purchase will send some of the profits through to animal charities so you  might want to give it a look.\n","December 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

It has issues such as the keyboard controls being awkwardly placed and completely unresponsive at times, so it is recommended to use a controller if you have one. The graphics are well done and the animations are fluid enough. The soundtrack is put together nicely and fits in with every location. The difficulty stays a constant middle ground throughout and it never felt like things got unfair. I enjoyed the game from beginning to end but I do have two major problems with it. First is that the game is way too short, it will take about two hours to complete. Second problem is the cost, it stands at base price of $11.99. To justify the price, some of the profits made from the game will go directly to various animal welfares.\n\nThe Purring Quest is fun game while it lasts and the fact that buying the game supports animals in need, makes it incredibly heartfelt.

Hehe...\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI received this game as a gift, and while it is cute and it has a good story....it is BUGGY AF.\n\nI have a pretty advanced gaming system over here with fantastic internet, and the intro skips and stutters and lags. In fact, I was so put off by the intro lag (while it is a beautiful story) I didn't even attempt the game until I had exhausted all possible options on my end. Nope. It's the game, not my computer.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself was not as atrocious, jumping is exceptionally difficult. The game does not always respond to the gamer's controls, making death inevitable, especially considering this is a platformer. To make matters worse, there is a speed run type deal on one of the levels and it is absolutely greivous and borderline impossible. If you're going to make a super meat boy level, at least hire competent game devs to make the controls responsive.\n\nAlso....has bird poop ever killed anyone? I mean, it's gross but I'm thinking no.\n5/10 (Good music and good story, not so great gameplay.)\n\nFix this lag/control response time, Valhalla! I will update my review if I see an updated version.","November 17, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

One of your masters, the woman, passes away suddenly, and you are left with the man. The problem is that the man has fallen into deep depression, and starts to forget about all the good times with the woman. This is where you really come in, you see you have the ability to help him retain the memories that he is losing, but there's a problem. He sees someone, while visit the grave, that looks like his lost love and disappears leaving you alone in the graveyard.\n\nIn The Purring Quest, you will now find yourself playing the role of the cat, you will have to navigate through stage after stage, dodging dogs, birds, flower pots, water, and more. You will be tasked with collecting fish skeletons along the way. You will also meet up with at least one cat per level that will help try to guide you back to your human. There's also a cat that is trapped in each level that if you set them free you get bonus points.\n\nGraphically this is a side scrolling game, that looks good, there are a couple of levels in which the background and the foreground get kind of confusing, and it is only when you try to make a jump to a ledge, that isn't really on the same plane as you are that you learn what is available and not to maneuver on.\n\nI would have liked to have seen the different cats that you interact with be voiced, I would have really enjoyed that aspect of the game, and I think that it would have definitely allowed the gamer to be pulled further into the game.\n\nUp to this point in the review, I've basically had a good things to say about the game, but now comes the time where I've got to talk about the flaws, and there are some pretty glaring ones that need to be talked about.\n\nLet's talk first about the tutorial, I do like the fact that there is a tutorial piece to the first level that basically pops up the keys you'll need to use to perform actions in the game, the only problem is that this game allows for gamepad input, and the tutorial does not switch over, so trying to figure out how to jump high, attack, climb, hide behind an object, and other such actions is a trial and error activity, which is never a good thing.\n\nThere are no options in the game, outside of first choosing the overall language. I would have loved to be able to control the volume in the game, and it might have alleviated the controls issue if there was an option to select keyboard or gamepad.\n\nSpeaking of controls, they just don't feel right, there have been too many times in game where after playing the game over and over again, I'm still having issues remembering what to hit to perform some actions. There's also the fact that there are some precision movement pieces that will have you slamming your head on your desk because of the collision or the slightly too high perch you just can't reach.\n\nLet's talk about bosses, there's a boss at the end of each stage, and I've learned that each fight has been different, which is fine except that these don't feel crisp. I know this is a spoiler, but I'm going to help you out, the frist boss is a crow, you can ONLY hit the crow when its not moving in the middle of the screen, if its moving you're going to take damage.\n\nSpeaking of damage, you start off the game with 7 lives, or times you can get hit. Does it not bother anyone else that this number is not 9? I mean Cats equal 9 Lives, when the hell have they ever been 7 lives? I know that's nitpicky, but it bothers the crap out of me.\n\nIn the end this is a cute game, it definitely has its moments. If you are looking for a stealth game starring cats, you are going to need to at least take a peek at this game. For me, however, there was just enough flaws in the game that I just could never truly enjoy myself, and so I've got to give this game a 5.2 out of 10.","December 22, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you do I'm sure you will like Purring Quest. The game is a nice side scrolling adventure where you control Kimchi the cat. The story is touching, the music is really well made (mostly piano recorded and very pleasing to the ears) and the gameplay is cool. The devs patched Purring Quest two times since I got my copy to make the controls better for everyone. They seem to really care about this game and about cats in general considering part of the money you give for the game is donated to cats with special needs.","December 9, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are cartoon-y, but both background and animated felines alike are done very well. The cats are adorable! The shining light of the game is the introduction of several famous "cats" - the dialogue is befitting of their "humanistic" personalities and written well.\n\nWhile the animation is smooth, the platformer mechanics are simple, but clumsy. You have the opportunity to have two jump styles, which I thought interesting. The game is not long at all, so the clunky mechanics did not detract from how I enjoyed the game. You'll find yourself having missed a platform (or dying) for really no reason at all - but all levels have multiple save points. . . so like I said, game is short enough and the difficulty easy enough to let it slide.\n\nI'd really like to see more from this developer - so if you enjoy "cat pop culture" and want an easy, funny, and short platformer - give it a try!","May 25","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
