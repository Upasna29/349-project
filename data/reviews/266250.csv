Graphics and effects are bright and crisp. Price is suspiciously low (but there are no upgrades or more ships). Soundtrack is decent and narrator creates a nice futuristic atmosphere.\nOne of the things that I liked was ability to combine your guns with shield. There are two type of shots and each makes much more damage combined with an active shield.\nAnyway, there are more than a few problems. Biggest one is very bad level design, there player are often swarmed with large groups of enemies, with mostly a random chance to survive. In addition, there are only 5 levels in an entire game! Devs probably wanted to stretch the length a bit, by making some levels way too long. Believe me, its simply too hard to avoid those pesky ships for 10 minutes and then die near the end of level to restart again… Well, the game does not end with this short campaign. There are survival mode, more difficulties… But it doesn’t matter because all feels unbalanced and repetitive.\n\nProcyon is an innovative shoot'em up, but not really a fun one and way too short to leave a solid impression.\n\n5.5/10","January 11","false","4.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

For veteran Shoot 'Em Up players out there you might find Procyon less challenging than some of the brutal contenders currently on the market, but that's not to say that it is not an enjoyable experience.\n\nGraphically, it looks sharp with high def effects & backdrops (no 8-bit look here) with sound effects & soundtrack holding strong too. Comes together very well. Controls are intuitive, allowing you to switch between your standard wide bullets to your concentrated beam weapon in an instant. The weapon & shield system implementation was one of the strong points for me. The weapons are linked into your shields and when combined offers a power-up damage to clear your path ahead. Beam weapon also arcs & bends which is a nice effect and allows you to still move around somewhat without loosing out on damaging your target.\n\nFor those that don't skip through the mini-story cutscenes there is also some humour to be had (worth watching through at least once).\n\nOn the negative side, I did find the boss fights a bit average; not bad but not really exciting either. Also an online co-op mode would have been awesome so I could play with friends around the world. With the duality in the weapons I could see online co-op being a lot of fun! Also, as I said earlier the game is very short. The 5 levels took me about 30 mins to complete first time through (and that was watching the cut-scenes!). Thankfully there is replayablity with higher difficulty levels in Attrition (5 lives + 1 per level completed) & Survival (1 life only!) to conquer.\n\nFor the price, overall quality & fun factor of this little title, this still gets a 'Thumbs Up' from me.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","March 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The amazing orchestral soundtrack uses one characteristic and short motive in all stages.\n\nEven the hilarious background story is thought provoking and really well written: " We are humans, we're REMARKABLY GOOD at fighting and we fought back / Unfortunately, we're humans. We are REMARKABLY BAD at ressource management!"\n\nThis game for this ridiculous low price deserves your attention. It's deeply accessible, features easy / hard modes and therefore it will please casual players and even veterans.\n\nI can't praise enough the hard work of Josh Jersild, the developer of this little gem.\nThis guy did all the programming, the hilarious voiceovers, the great score and the modeling / texturing ON HIS OWN in his spare time but this game that easily stands out from the rest doesn't feel like homebrew.\n\nJust check the other reviews on the store page!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/266250/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Procyon is a very good indie 'shmup that fans of the genre should enjoy.\n\nAs a fan of these type of games, I judge them on 3 main factors. First is it's "uniqueness". One of my favorite shmups/bullet-hell games of all time is Ikaruga b/c of how it took a classic game formula and twisted it and made it something new to play.  This is probably one of Procyon's biggest drawbacks. There is not much to seperate it from other side-scrolling games of its ilk. This is not to say it's a bad game, on the contrary. It just doesn't do anything differently. The second factor is control. Games like these require tight and precise controls especially when the going gets hairy. Procyon has controlling down pat. I was able to jump right in and was able to pilot my ship and not once have I been disappointed by the controls. Thirdly, is fun-factor. Procyon is a fun game and has the right level of arcade challenge to keep me wanting to retry immediately when I fail. A good way to describe this game is a "meat and potatoes" shoot-em-up. I would have liked to seen more variety in weapons, but Im also not incredibly far into the game so that may change.\n\nThis game is definitely one that can be defined as "indie" in respect to looks alone. The design is very simple with ships not having a whole lot of pizazz or graphical oomph. I don't play these games to be wowed by graphics, so this is a minimal knock for me, but others that judge games purely on looks will probably not find much about Procyon. Lighting is well done and when there are a lot of enemies on screen with different colored beams going off its definitely eye candy. I also liked some of the stage backgrounds i.e. Empire City. Nothing extraordinary, but eye catching and adds to the level. Enemy design is mostly simple, and there's a particular enemy that looked to me like a Playstation controller. Whether this was intentional or not, I don't know, but its something that caught my eye.\n\nA very strong aspect of the game is the soundtrack.  I find soundtracks in games like these to be more important than in other genres and Procyon's music to be excellent. A AAA developer would be happy to have this quality of a soundtrack in its game. The fact that it's in a shoot-em-up makes me very happy and will keep me playing.\n\nSteamworks integration is very much appreciated. With card drops and achievements, this will add to the game's replayability. I love the fact it tracks high scores as well, as I consider this to be a staple of this genre.\n\nAll-in-all I recommend Procyon most especially to 'shmup fans. It's a classic side scroller and does pack a challenge as you go further on into the game. The music is awesome and adds to the gameplay experience.  I also think that it's $3.99 price point is pretty much right for a game like this.","July 27, 2014","true","1.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I played the game for quite a while, but today I saw that it has just come out on Steam, so I bought it instantly. Procyon is a very nicely polished game, with pretty visuals and some really nice gameplay, especially on higher difficulty levels. The story is also quite entertaining, as you will figure out just after watching the first scene. In Procyon there is a wide variety of different enemies, all with their very own way of attacking you, aswell as a boss at the end of every level. Of course the boss is also different depending on the level, so gameplay is not repetitive and the pretty nice soundtrack adds a good layer of extra polishment to the game. I do definitely recommend it, at least to everybody who either likes this genre, or to people who just really enjoy funny cutscenes. :)","February 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

It is up to you, a brave human with balls of steel to save it from annihilation by piloting the Procyon, a completely untested ship that can blow up if it gets hit by "anything harder than a punch". Navigate through the 5 levels trying to repel the alien fleet and destroy their point of origin. Your weapons are an array of bullets, a beam that can somewhat bend to target a single enemy and a shield that temporarily also strengthens your weapons, which is a somewhat interesting mechanic. Note that you can alternate between landscape and portait view depending on what appeals more to you. Overall it is a pleasant game for some casual retro fun, in my opinion.\n\n+ Old school arcade action\n+ Over the top voice acting, which is pretty amusing\n+ Writing is funny at times\n+ Difficulty scales well\n+ 4 modes to choose from (arcade/survival/attrition/practice)\n\n- Ship movement can be a bit sluggish\n- No ship upgrades or powerups\n- Short (only 5 levels), counts for length on replayability in other modes/difficulties\n\nWarning: If you play with a mouse and keyboard, lenghty sessions can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radicalcj/recommended/266250/","radicalcj","Radical CJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radicalcj/","10 products in account","(STRONGLY RECOMMEND)\n\nFor me, the “side-scrolling spaceship shooter” is a game genre that invokes an ambiguous response.\n\nIn one hand it offers addictive simplicity and nostalgia. In the other an absolute lack of narrative and gameplay conventions so well entrenched that it is almost impossible to distinguish any two examples of the genre from one another… also often little room for developing a strategy beyond mashing the attack button.\n\nWhile obviously “retro” in many respects, Procyon is not a slavish tribute to early scrolling shooter games. Rather, the conventions have been bent for the players benefit.\n\nThe various modes and three tier difficulty setting allows the player as much, or as little, challenge as they desire. A ‘Practice Mode’, for example, allows a level to be played with unlimited lives, although this does not unlock the next level.\n\nThe graphics are also nice and 3D looking rather than “ironically” pixelated.\n\nLots of explosions and a large variety of alien spacecraft, all with different flight patterns and attacks.\n\nThe controls are simple and intuitive and the spaceship is highly mobile allowing you to dodge enemy attacks and move quickly around all over the screen. The weapon/shielding compromise system also gives you something to think about as expending your energy on supercharging your weapons leaves you unable to deflect attacks. Different enemies are also more or less vulnerable to the players two (or three if you count the lightening) weapons, so button mashing is not rewarded, “use ya noggin”.\n\nWhat I particularly enjoyed were the cut scenes establishing a satire narrative between the levels.\n\nIt’s a short game (5 levels only), but it’s highly replay-able and considering that it only costs $3.00 or something its very good value for money.\n","March 5, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but the game does have a great artstyle going for it.\n\nOn top of the game's fantastic artwork, there's great music and sound effects. The gameplay doesn't deviate at all from its genre, so it's rather easy to pick up. I found the gameplay moderately difficult, although this is coming from someone who is inexperienced in the genre to begin with. The controls are smooth and I had a blast flying through the game's levels, even if my fun was usually put to an end at the hands of some massive boss (which are rather difficult to defeat).\n\nMy only issue with Procyon is its lack of online multiplayer. It has local multiplayer, but no online? What is this, 2005? Other than that, Procyon is a solid shoot 'em up game. Nothing too special, but it does a good enough job to earn a recommendation from me.","March 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The lack of power-ups, tiny amount of levels, little variation in enemies, absolutely boring boss battles and at time unfair placement of trash enemies did indeed get on my nerves after a while.\n\nThe music doesn't really suit the game either, but that may just be my own personal opinion.\n\nNote that I don't actually give this game a bad score. It is not a bad game, just a mediocre game. But I feel that the "very positive" score that the game now gets on Steam is not waranted; at least I hope that my vote will balance the final score somewhat.","March 12","false","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First off it works perfectly on my stereoscopic 3D rig using Tridef Ignition, second it's got a really clever sense of humor and mostly the gameplay is exciting, by parts riveting, and provides a very high level of challenge while not discouraging the player from trying again.\n\nThe visuals are incredibly appealing, especially in stereo 3D; stereo will normally help player's situational awareness and despite the "2D-ness" of this title, the 3D brings the exact same quality - the separation between foreground and background helps keep you aware of all objects on the gameplay's plane/layer. It makes it look even purdier, too! :-)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWDFLzADAeQ\n* Warning: Steam though it would be a good idea to break all stereoscopic videos. Head to YT to watch it, make sure you are using Flash, not HTML5.","March 5, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

There is not much story, but the game has a good sense of humor. It is interesting how using your shield uses up your special weapons.....that way you have to balance being offensive vs defensive. I thought that mechanic was new and different for this genre. Few problems. Shields should be able to stop kamikaze ships just like bullets. Also, the special beam was basially useless, it barely did more than regular beam, which seemed to do as much as the energy bullets. If I'm zapping my shields and using the single target weapon, it should be much more noticeable and worth using, misstep there. Another problem was level design. The game is short, only 5 levels. The levels are very long, which you think would be a good thing, but it actually hinders the game. It should be more levels, that take less time. But the way they structure it, you only get a few lives per level, can't gain more, and if you die you have to restart the 5 min level all over again, which is annoying and repetitive. The other problem is by making them so long you are trying to force grinding the same level, because you are asking me to make no mistakes for so long. That is why the levels are usually short. And it isn't like they change the levels up over the 5 min, you keep fighting the same guys, they just keep throwing them at you again and again and again, and then a boss with a ton of health. So if you die you have to do it all again. So less focus on making me redo the levels, just because you only have like 25 minutes of actual gameplay. Would be fun to try co-op too. 6.5/10.","June 3, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
