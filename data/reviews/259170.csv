In an attempt to modernize the series and move it more into the realms of action adventure rather than outright survival horror, Alone in the Dark only ends up partially suceeding. It's an incredibly ambitious game that would probably most likely have succeeded in sitting next to Resident Evil 4 if it were not hampered by some severe technical limitations. These limitations provide a high bar for entry and I am afraid most gamers will probably give up on the game due to these shortcomings. Alone in the Dark feels like a game that was rushed out the gate to meet its retail deadline.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=333800549\nThe control scheme and inventory, is to put it bluntly, clunky! It does take some getting used to and for a game that often throws you into the thick of the action the control scheme just can't keep up as it ends up slowing you down dramatically during intense sections where you need to be quick and nimble and on on your feet. This results in a lot of cheap deaths that can get incredibly frustrating. The driving mechanics are also badly implemented (you will be doing a lot of driving around Central Park completing tasks and killing enemies to advance) with the cars you drive responding in strange ways to the obstacles they encounter. In some instances you will crash headlong into a tree and the car will barely even register the damage where as on other occasions you will simply mount a curb and all the doors will go flying of your vehicle. There also appears to be no weight whatsoever behind the vehicles you drive which makes them feel like a paper plane as they glide across the screen.\n\nWhile I did not encounter any severe game crashing bugs, getting the Microsoft 360 controller to register with the game was a very complicated affair that a simple tutorial would have benefited explaining how one goes about setting it up. Often when booting into the game, Alone in the Dark will loose all sound completely and will require the gamer to alt-tab out the game in order to get the sound back. There were also a few instances where the game did not save my progression only for me to re-enter the game world and have to complete a particularly grueling section all over again (which did not leave me very amused). The dynamic lighting effects in the game can also often go dramatically wrong and render the sequence with an effect that I am sure the developers of the game did not intend.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332158025\nAlone in the Dark features many excellent set pieces that are adrenalin fueled and a total blast to play and I often found my heart skipping a few beats during these sections. They are intense and well designed and show the greatness that Alone in the Dark was aiming to achieve. Placing you in the shoes of paranormal investigator Edward Carnaby - your task is to do battle with the demonic forces that have been unleashed in New York by a madman hellbent on harnessing its powers. During your adventures you will meet up with characters that will aid you in your adventures. Thankfully you don't have to end up babysitting them like you had to do in Resident Evil 4 as adding any escort-styled mission into this messy but entertaining mix would most certainly have backfired.\n\nAlone in the Dark also features some novel game-play ideas, the most famous beings its fire tech (fire is an important feature in the game world when it comes to vanquishing your foes or even helping you solve certain puzzles). Even for a game that is over 6 years old the fire technology on display here is fantastic and how it reacts to the world is quite jaw-dropping. You will also pick up a host of items along the way (although you are severely limited by what you can carry) that can be combined to help thin the hoard of demonic forces that pursue you at every single turn. These items can then be used against your enemies in creative ways. At the heart of it you will still be shooting your way through Central Park with your trusty revolver but ordinary bullets are not going to help you out much here at all and this is where the combining of articles really comes into play.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=336804066\nAt the end of the day I really enjoyed Alone in the Dark. While it may not be the classic game the creators where originally going for its still a heart-thumping ride to experience and if you can forgive the game many of its shortfalls you should be in for one hell of a ride.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 4, 2014","true","25.7"," 129 of 157 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","129","157","3","19"

Like reading the reviews wasn't bad enough...\n\nI don't get what's everyone on about... It may not the best game out there, but it’s still so damn brilliant!!!! I’m a big survival horror fan, I’ve played a lot of games and Alone In The Dark deserves to be applauded for its innovation. I’ve played it when it was released in 2008 and it was the first of its genre and I've been gaming since I could walk. This franchise started the survival horror genre. This is most probably the most underrated title in the history of video games. Because even though it has flaws like the broken mechanics,  tiring controls and camera, and most probably Atari not testing it. There are also crashes when you try to edit  the display settings, their fault aswell . But those who are able to deal with these flaws, that aren't easy to ignore, may end up living a very very rewarding action adventure.\n\nAlone in the dark is a survival atmospheric horror game built in episodes. Each episode begins with a video summary of the previous episode, and ends with an epic scene to rattle our nerves.\nYou are an amnesiac Edward Carnby who is a paranormal detective who disappeared back in 1938, awakening from an exorcism in 2008. After over hearing a bizarre conversation between men in robes,  you start to wander a collapsing building for a way out. You will witness several people being killed and possessed by demonic forces. You will meet a woman and an old man who has all the answers. But there isn’t time. Because Lucifer is trying to bring the end of the world using a stone that’s been held by Edward for decades, that contained his soul after he’s been cast out of heaven. And you must stop him before it’s too late. So you start your adventure in a beautiful, picture perfect New York city. Driving to out run a raging apocalyptic earthquake with giant fissures wiping out the entire city, trying to make it to central park. And that’s where you begin to unravel so many mysteries and experience even more epicness! Brilliant events and a gripping story that keeps building up to a whole new level every time as you progress and keeps you wanting even more. With an ending that leaves you with questions more than answers.\n\nThe graphics are great, the atmosphere, the lighting, the ambiance, gameplay, the characters and dialogues… All are featured wonderfully. The story is well scripted and provides many intense dramatic moments with beautifully composed soundtracks. Gives you a great feeling of novelty, as you try to heal your wounds, like literally look down to heal a bloody gapping wound through your jeans or jacket. The game also allows you to use your jacket as an inventory which I found pretty cool, like to fit in as many objects as the pockets and belts allow you. As well as combining them and creating fire weapons, explosives and light sources. Also how objects can interact with the environment. Like grabbing a chair or a wood plank and place it near other objects, then set the plank on fire. You will see the fire eating the plank slowly, turning it to ashes and moving to the other objects. Quite cool.\n\nAlone In The Dark has many flaws that can kill the thrill sometimes. But it won’t kill the thrill of the story and puzzles. If you’re into survival horror and atmospheric games, then you should definitely give it a try. It might be too primitive for 2008 standars, but it’s still quite enjoyable.","June 21, 2014","true","59.1"," 78 of 100 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","78","100","0","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissera/recommended/259170/","Kissera","Vivian James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissera/","423 products in account","Just a warning to users: I tried to run the game, and Securom gave me an error that it couldn't activate -- looking into it, the error was because I monitor the cpu usage of my PC using a process explorer.  Looking into the matter, Securom states blatantly that they don't like that process explorer software can monitor what Securom does, and therefore, they will never allow Securom applications to run while a process explorer is open; not only is that shady, but it's downright crap.  So buyer beware, this product still has Securom and still requires Stardock activation.  And yes, this is the old rootkit securom that will actually close your process explorer software after it's been installed and activated.\n\nThat having been said, Alone in the Dark itself is a bit of a mess of a game.  The controls are pretty bad, this is in part due to their choosing to make arm controls based on the right-hand joystick on a 360 gamepad (it's even worse on PC if you don't have a gamepad).  The graphics are good, really good (especially considering this game came out in 2008).  The gameplay can be questionable at times, and some mechanics are used for the first 5 minutes after they're introduced, and then never again.  An example of this is the blinking mechanic, it's used to clear your vision when you start out the game, but after this point you won't be using it again.\n\nThe physics puzzles often involve moving Edward's arms to manipulate certain objects in certain directions, and while this was a good idea in theory, it should have had a toggle button for this type of manipulation, as it translates poorly to combat.  Edward will often ♥♥♥♥ the object back as if to swing it, only to slowly lower it because of how clunky the controls to this particular function work.\n\nThe game assumes you've played previous games and gives no introduction to Edward or Theophile, only mentioning events from previous games in passing, as well doing nothing to inform us what happened in the months and hours leading up to the game.  The game starts off in the middle of the story, and you as the player are given little exposition until nearing the end of the game on what is actually going on.\n\nThe good portions of the game are non-gameplay portions, and involve the inventory, as the player selects items and combines them in Edward's coat, such as combining a glowstick with a piece of tape to make a sticky glowstick that you can throw onto walls and ceilings to help illuminate the area.  Likewise one can combine gasoline and handgun ammo to make incendiary ammunition (which is needed to kill demon enemies).\n\nThe game uses a location-based damage system similar to Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth (although that game did it better), and the player applies bandages and healing spray to repair these wounds.  The problem is that wounds often require multiple items per wound, and you don't get anywhere near enough of these, and if you suffer a bleeding wound you'll be forced to use up the majority of your healing items to repair it.\n\nThere was a lot of things about Alone in the Dark that were good ideas, but with bad implementation, and unfortunately Eden Games and Hydravision Entertainment got liquidated before they could release the patch that was supposed to make the 360 and PC versions play like the updated Alone in the Dark: Inferno for PS3.  The game itself can be enjoyable, but it's hard to make a recommendation to buy any game that requires a person to install and activate a rootkit to play.  So this combined with all the negatives (of which there are plenty) is why I do not recommend this to people; instead try and get your hands on the PS3 version.","July 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 75 of 99 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","75","99","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/259170/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","Alone in the Dark is a 2008 action survival-horror game, and fifth game in the Alone in the Dark series. It is also one of the most profound and fascinating examples I have ever played of something akin to a glorious train-wreck.\n\nThere's a story here, I'm sure of it. There are definitely cutscenes with unforgettable hammy acting and dialogue, with such excellent writing and voicing execution like "I don't have your stone, and ♥♥♥♥ you anyway," or, "I'm the ♥♥♥♥-ING UNIVERSE!!" However, I couldn't rightfully tell you it without looking up a synopsis. I guess New York is in trouble, so there's that.\n\nAlone in the Dark is daring, different, and truly there is no other game quite like it. In this game, you'll find yourself doing everything from racing a car through Central Park as giant bats tear your car apart as you drive it, only to form themselves into a literal giant bat tornado.You will learn the importance of tape with a surprisingly complex crafting system that existed long before Minecraft. You'll drive a forklift through a cave and pick up rocks and bridges. You'll literally be ♥♥♥♥ out by a giant worm.\n\nIf anything, I can say it was ahead of its time. For a 2008 game, it tried things that would later on become parts of much more successful and bigger games, and gaming elements that have become popularized. Climbing segments with things crumbling apart ala' Uncharted before Uncharted. The after-mentioned crafting item system the game features. First-person 'experience' walking simulator sections. This game was ahead of the curveball on what would be hip several years from the time it released.\n\nIt just pulled off most of them pretty poorly.\n\nHonestly, the task of things you'll be doing before this game is up is ridiculous. The developers clearly had huge ambitions, but didn't have the time or budget to polish off its ideas. So what you have is a game that controls a bit weirdly, suffers from some hilarious glitches, and somehow tries to wrap up every ridiculous thing that happens into some sort of logical story. Sometimes the game wants to be an atmospheric horror game, other times it wants to be an action game, others a surrealistic platformer, or why not take a moment to take part in a firefighter simulator?\n\nThe game even went ahead of itself and made it into an episodic gameplay experience. Split into episodes, the game will literally let you play almost any episode or part of an episode from the very beginning of the game. At any time you are free to skip ahead (or go backwards) in the games storyline... With one exception. You have to complete all the episodes (and partake in one quest involving burning roots in an open-world hub world of Central Park) to play the last episode. I can only think the reason they did this is because they realized a few parts of their game were needlessly difficult, usually because of controls.\n\nThis game also has a Soundtrack that it honestly does not deserve, but adds so much to the experience. You'll be listening to over-the-top child orchestras and epic tunes as you drive in a collapsing New York in a taxi that controls like butter. And most of the soundtrack keeps this epic, mysterious tone full of orchestra songs and some just excellent pieces of music that make it feel like the game is telling some deep epic, when most of the time you'll probably have no idea what's going on. The music just adds to the glorious train wreck that this game is.\n\nIf you're like me, you'll be playing this and telling yourself that this is a terrible game, and just exclaim out at some new element that baffles on why they decided to go with THIS direction on something, but all the same you'll find yourself both curious, and even excited on what may be around the next bend.\n\nThe game isn't all bad, it has interesting ideas, sections, and I would even say the game has some good fun to be had, but it is plagued with problems, and just goes so hilariously and over the top off the rails its almost awe-inspiring. Its problems are somewhat front-loaded, so if you can bear through some sort of dull beginning sections, the game has several loaded guns of things to experience ahead for you, and if you can get past the beginning, you are almost certain to enjoy the crazy ride this game provides.\n\nIf someone ever asked me to point them in the direction of the purest B-horror game ever, I would point them to this game. It is the hammiest, corniest, most over-the-top horror game I've ever played. It is ridiculous from start to finish, and it is for this reason I'd recommend this.\n\nKnow though the PC version suffers from some problems, mainly some people have trouble running it. Solutions to get around, but still. And the 'best version' of the game is actually on PS3, as it contains an additional chapter and fixes several problems and inputted some better controls.\n\nStill, if you want a B-Horror game, look no further than Alone in the Dark.","July 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","57","72","0","0"

At its core, its still a survival horror game. The controls are awkward and maybe too overly detailed. The camera is a struggle with your player consuming a third of the screen and you need to switch between over the shoulder third and first person views to get things done. Its cumbersome and awkward, but for any ill will toward the controls the game certainly makes up for it with its production.\n\nEvil tremors that tear through buildings and city streets are turning people evil. Similar to zombies, but they have a lot of self preservation and they can talk too. You play as a Robert, something a former evil inhabited and you meet allies along the way. You'll be rescuing several short term and long term characters so the game never truly feels alone. Sure you do all the work, but they're with you most of the way. You're never in the dark for too long either.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting mechanics in the game that feel alien in a way. The first of which is a blink your eyes mechanic that is only in first person. Go figure. You blink to reduce the blurriness and by the first ten or so minutes you'll see fine until a blood spitter covers your eyes. Then just blink it away!\n\nFire will spread from object to object and you need to catch chairs, lamp shades and bats on fire to use as weapons against the evils. So stiffly hold the weapon in a fire and hope it catches. You can only carry a weapon in third person, so the character will obscure the weapon being held out. So hope that it catches fire. Then you need to hold an analog stick or something else if you're using keyboard controls to charge your attack. Hold it back, then flick the other way to swing. Other games have done this better and its slow enough where the enemies can run away when they see your flaming board of justice. Fire is the only thing that can kill inhabited humans and kill them instantly. With a chair lit up you can use it to sometimes illuminate an area. Other times the game decides that you failed so it raises the lights on the entire area.\n\nYou can use a fire extinguisher to slowly put out fire in first person or switch to third person, hold the stick back and bash down a door. If you're unable to bash a door down, then you can shoot through the lock. Again, interesting and detailed mechanics yet slow, cumbersome, awkward and deliberate. It turns a typical adventure game into something with a slower pace.\n\nThe game has a grand scope. You'll go from humble beginnings of bashing down doors and tackling issues to get from point A to B. You've got a gun, healing spray, a lighter, duct tape and you can pick up melee weapons. Then get to hang off the side of building by wires and hand holds. Its the adventure syndrome of modern games. Truth be told, I'd rather go on an adventure in the guise of survival horror that I would a straight up survival horror game.\n\nThere are puzzles such as three bloody finger prints on a keypad. Loading a fire extinguisher onto a lift, jumping and pulling a rope to launch the extinguisher to the floor it needs to be. Getting two wires close, but far enough apart to hot wire a car or a power generator.\n\nThe inventory has a unique thing going for it, because you open your coat to reveal all sorts of compartments that has you carrying ten pounds of gear. Just think what could be accomplished if he uses his pockets too! Selecting from the array of duct tape, ammo, and flashlight batteries becomes a chore trying to accurately select something with the analog stick then push a button. When you dig through your inventory, the game is still playing.1\n\nAlone in the Dark plays out in chapters like television episodes that have credits at the end and a "previously on" reel to start each chapter. This can be good and bad. The credits signify that its time to shut off to the game and come back to it later. The reel is a good way of recapping everything if you come back to the game years later. If you chose to keep going, then you just have another cut scene to sit through that you probably remember. Speaking of cut scenes, you're stuck watching them with no way to skip them and that alone becomes my driving force to push through the game rather than take a brake.\n\nDriving plays out like a lot of other games with forward and reverse, but once you get up to top speed its easy to fishtail at a ninety degree turn. So you learn to slow down, but if you slow down too much the ground will crack and swallow you whole. The first driving sequence is crazy in a good way once you break out of a garage. Buildings are falling, roads open up to create jumps. Other vehicles on the road become hazards. There are plenty of visual cues like a taxi driving through a glass storefront to indicate that you should do the same.\n\nIts amazing to look at and see, but without checkpoints a fun thrilling ride turns into a frustrating challenge. It only reaches a frustration when the game glitches and locks you in the ground. In normal circumstances this is remedied by waiting for the ground to collapse and suck you in. Other times the ground never collapses and you're forced to restart the chapter rather than the last checkpoint. The odd thing is while it looks as if you can rewind to the last checkpoint, I was never able to. Instead I had to quit back to the main menu and then select the chapter and checkpoint.\n\nI encountered a few glitches such as the game crashing when I went to the display settings. I was supposed to run down possessed people in a car, but I failed to do so in time, so I fought them on foot which triggered a lot of things that were supposed to happen in the car. Other times voice overs would play after they should have like explanations. Speaking of explanations there are a lot of tutorial prompts. If you take too long, they forcefully take over the screen and you need to push a button to send them away. Some of these prompts have images of the controller, which is great, it shows you what you have to do, but other times there's no image and no text indicating what you push.\n\nThe glitches are forgivable for the most part, other than the few that crashed or prevented me from advancing. Even a few times is still too many. Despite the flaws, glitches and cumbersome controls the game has great visuals and that makes all the difference. Some of the textures look super high quality on the default settings, while others look low quality such as the protagonists leather jacket is torn and rather than having tears in it, the skin textures on the jacket itself. Everything looks crisp and clean even among fires, destruction and chaos. There needs to be some atmosphere in the world rather than just the sky boxes.\n\nThe character models and hair are good just as the voice acting, but the problem is that its tough to care about the characters. I'm into the story yes. Evil taking over New York City, sure give me that, but I know nothing about them other than their look. A haggard drifter with no memory, a woman who is the normal commoner and a priest who knows more. There's no reason to like or care for any of them.\n\nAlone in the Dark is still an interesting game despite the controls and the fact its more adventure than typical survival horror.","October 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","35","47","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psykhophear/recommended/259170/","psykhophear","Psykhophear™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psykhophear/","334 products in account","Alone In The Dark was a promising game when it first came out in 2008; it had a great storyline and some cool game mechanics that involved playing with fire (which is awesome) but the main problem it had back then that still holds true now, unfortunately, is the control itself. The game uses fixed camera angles where the player controls Edward Carnby like a tank and the game mechanics as a whole feels stiff and outdated. It's as if the developer tries to emulate the controls from the original Alone In The Dark and bring it to the next-gen and although it sounds like a cool idea on paper but in reality - it's not.\n\nThe supporting characters are mediocre as well with an annoying female partner named Sarah and an uninspiring antagonist named Crowley. Everything about them is boring and they just don't provide any sense of motivation into the story. It reminds you of that abysmal movie adaptation by Uwe Boll, which was originally supposed to coincide with the game but thankfully, it didn't happen.\n\nDespite its flaws, Alone In The Dark is still fun to play. If you get pass the fact of its stiff controls and awful driving sequence (good luck trying to finish the earthquake scene on your first playthrough), you'll learn that the soundtrack is outstanding and the weapon manipulation is really intuitive. It's incredibly satisfying to blow up stuff with a fire-induced gun and home-made explosives. It's just too bad the publisher has not released any patches to fix these problems until now. But then again, it's Atari; what do you expect?\n\nFor me, I appreciate Alone In The Dark for what it is so I give it a thumbs up for an ambitious attempt. If you really want to experience the game in its entirety, I suggest getting the PlayStation 3 version that addresses all the gameplay issues found in the PC and Xbox 360. If you don't have any consoles at all, then you're stuck with the PC version. Either get it when it's on sale or don't get it at all.

It shows what an uninspired port can do to what might have been a decent game. Slowly I begin to understand why Infogrames/Atari went downhill so fast.\n\nI've been playing AitD back then in 1993 and loved the atmosphere, the puzzles and how the story did unfold. But this sequel discouraged me to play even before it started. Technical issues (resolution has to be set manually in a config file) gave me a bad feeling right from the start. But it got worse when I realized that the effort put into porting it from console to PC was minimal at best.\n\nThe greatest flaw is the hoplessly overcomplicated and unintuitive UI and control system. You are confronted with a myriad of keys needed to do things which you'll quickly forget afterwards, just to wonder what might have been "blinking" (no kidding) once your eysight is blurring again.\n\nBut even worse is the way you have to move around. Pressing W to move forward while needing A and D to steer left and right might have been a decent input system for 1993. But it isn't really working for a game which forces you to walk on thin ledges while all kinds of debris is raining down on you. To make it even worse, the 3rd person cameras are so bad, that you feel like a drunkard stumlbing disorientedly around when you try to navigate even a small room.\n\nThe puzzles are illogic. In one situation you need to lift a fire extinguisher to a collapsed floor above you. Now every sane person with two working arms would simply lift the extinguisher to platform one, climb up and repeat it.\n\nOh no! The developers of this game thought it natural to put the extinguisher on a platform, which is connected to a rope, which in turn is dangling down from the ceiling... so all you need to do further is to climb up the collapsed floor to leap 2 meters above the ground to the dangling rope to grab it somehow in midair, just to pull the platform (remember, the one we put the extinguisher on?) up so the extinguisher is airbone to land on the second floor.\n\nPhew.\n\nOkay... seriously?\n\nAnnoyed as I am I don't even wish to mention the mediocre voice acting or the clicheéd horror snippets happening to anonymous people all around you. It's really not worth the effort, you know them all. Or the music which tries to create suspense, but is quickly starting to annoy you, because it's nowhere close to be dynamically linked to the action on the screen.\n\nAnyways... don't buy it, unless you are a die hard AitD fan who just needs to know what happened to the series by first-hand-experience. Hope you got a gamepad then.","November 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","0"

You'll probably get as far as the Options screen, but if you click on Display the whole thing will crash to desktop. Given that Atari as a company has dissolved and its assets stricken to the four winds, the only solutions available on hand are:\n\n1) Play this game on a PC with more modest videocard specs\n2) Download someone else's "res.aitd" resolution config file (or make one of your own), copy-paste it into the appropriate user AppData folder location and hope you won't get stuck on a looping intro screen animation with no menu items\n3) Purchase Alone in the Dark: Inferno on PS3 instead\n4) Grit your teeth and accept that some things in life are just not meant to be\n\nFurther details:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/259170/discussions/0/611701999519746944/\n\nAdditionally, while the game does support Xbox360 controllers, it will NOT automatically detect it at game start up. Instead, you need to go into the Options -> Configuration screen, click on one of the default keyboard control keys as if to rebind it, and then hit any of the buttons on the controller: whereupon the game asks if you want to rebind the controls to the controller and will do all of it automatically if you click on "yes". And you will still need to use the mouse to exit the Configuration screen because the controls won't take effect until you leave that particular menu item. Fiddly, but easily solvable.\n\nNow as for starting an actual new game itself, I have two words: good luck. You might be fortunate enough that the game will start if you change your speaker settings from 5.1 (or what other setup you may have) to Stereo. Which is a silly thing but it's worked for some people. I am not one of those some people. I am one of the 4) people whose moderately beefy machine specs have rendered an 8+ year old game unplayable. Apparently upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 might help but that requires upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.\n\nWell, this is a good a time as any to build an archive machine for playing older Windows games, I guess...","February 7","false","0.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

Alone in the dark was a classic survivl horror and was the basis of what would become the popular Resident Evil franchise, however, newer games with new ideas started coming out and Alone in the Dark was left out in the dust. Atari quickly put their minds to work and decided to resurrect this forgotten franchise but make it fit in with the new demographic of gamers by taking out everything that made Alone in the Dark great and adding in every sort of cliche in horror game history.\n\nGameplay is the biggest thing that's been butchered in Alone in the Dark as it literraly doesn't live up to it's name. You're not alone because there are tons of people that will follow you around at some point and you're rarely in the dark. You can play the game from a first or third person perspective but the controls for both of these perspectives are terrible. When in first person, your sight is limited to what you can see an you'll most likely get stuck on something and half the time, you won't even know what you're stuck on. In third person, the controls feel restricted and you'll struggle to pull of basic actions in the game. The camera is awful in the third person view because your mouse is terrible for controlling the camera and it constantly fights with you. I failed doing a certain jump near the beginning of the game and it took me 6 attempts to get right because the camera switched perspectives when I went to jump. There are a few gameplay elements which seemed like good ideas but weren't used up to their full potential. The inventory management is one of them. In game, when you want to look through your inventory, the game doesn't pause and you need to look down at yourshirt and actually select the items you want to use which is a great idea but, you might be shocked to hear this, the controls suck in the inventory screen. You will constantly try and navigate over to a certain item that you want, only for the game to take you to an item that you've never needed before. The game is also buggy as hell and some bugs will prevent you from proceeding with the game.\n\nThe story is that Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character wakes up shortly before he is meant to be killed by some men for whatever reason and the thing is Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character can't remember anything about himself. However some weird creatures stop him from being killed and he escapes the building with a little bit of information about his task and he also escapes with Ms. Obvious girlfriend for unlikeable and forgettable main character. So the 2 go out and try and complete the task he's been given and also figure out who he is. By a horror stand point, this plot has been done to death but most horror games add a unique thing to it to make their specific telling of this plot memorble. Alone in the Dark doesn't. It literraaly takes the bear bones of a plot structure and uses it as it's final product.\n\nGraphics are a mixed bag and the graphics is probably the best thing this game has going for it. Certain things in Alone in the Dark look amazing. The fire looks brilliant and it's great just to watch the fire spread across more of a surface. The game overall looks OK but there are quite a few badly textured things you will come across throughout playing Alone in the Dark. Sound is relatively bad aswell, mainly because some sounds are actually missing from th game, mainly in the SFX. Some sounds cut out randomly and for no reason at all aswell.\n\nThe game is quite short for a horror game and you can complete it within about 12 hours (my timer counter is broken for this, probably because my steam account had mercy on me and it didn't want anyone else to know that I had played this game for 12 hours.) There is no reason to replay Alone in the Dark either because there are so many bad things that are included in this that youwill not want to put yourself through this torture anymore.\n\nThis was meant to have been the great return of a classic survival horror video game series but instead we were left with a buggy, ugly and unfinished mess\n\nFinal verdict\n\nPros\n+ Some great ideas\n+ Decent graphics\n\nCons\n- Awful controls\n- Buggy as hell\n- Forgettable story\n- Unlikeable characters\n- Missing sounds\n- Some ugly textures\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 6","false","1.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

I am not a 3rd person view kind of guy, unfortunately, the game is practically FORCING me to use 3rd person. Not really a point to keep putting it back into 1st person every time. Plus, the X axis mouse sensitivity is WAY too high, and the Y axis mouse sensitivity is WAY too low. I tried changing these options in the settings, but they did not do anything. Another thing is that the resolution is screwed up. If you change the resolution any higher than the default, the game crashes. On top of all this, the saving system is messed up. Bad. I got pretty far into Chapter 2, but when I saved, got on it the next day, it reverted back to the very beginning of chapter 2.\nI'm just gonna enjoy a let's player play this (hopefully without a microphone).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/259170/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","Ohh my this game!\n\nBefore I start my review I would like to say I palyed this game on my pc without a controler. The PC port of this game is downright terrible in terms of controles. Maybe you sould get youself a controller before playing this.\n\nPresentation:\nSo the game begins with awfull musics and starts with an amnesia plot, so original! Afterwards you are running aound, trying to find out how anything works in the game. All the butttons are displayed with the X Box controler icons so you have no idea how the controles works on a PC. After running around some time, and thinking the controles are bad, I incounter and enemy. The enemy is easely beaten, buy dosen`t die! I figure out you have to burn the corpses in order to really kill anything in this game, and trust me they paly on this fire thinf alot in this game. From the begining I was afraid I was not gonna like this game, and I was right after all.\n\nGameplay/Controles:\nTo be honest there is a great aspect I like about this game, the crafting. You can find items all over the game, then open your inventory to combine items in order to make a bomb, or molotoves etc. This acpect was great but here comes the bad aspcets.\n\nThe camera can be witched from 3. to 1. person and the other way araound. Sometimes I really think to myself, tht the developers really did not know, if they wanted to make a 3. or 1. person game. The also switctes between these to modes some time, so I really wished they had just keept the one or the other. The 3. person camera is either locked in a cinematic wiev, or right behind you and flies around if you get close to a wall. This togehther with clonky movement, makes the game So anoying to navigate.\n\nThe combat is really stiff. Eventhough you can move the weapons you have in hand around, they still seem to do one of two attack animations. The pistol is so underrealming, simply becouse you need fire to kill anything. And the bad combats goes on, and is the main part of the game. When a charecter is noked down, you either need to have some fire, or find a nerby firesource, if you have none, you are going to fight the same enemy over and over forever.\n\nThere are driving in this game, but it is beyond bad. Eveything is so stiff, and you fell like you have no real contole over the car. There are even some driving porstions of the game, that took me SO long to complete becouse of the bad contoles.\n\nThere are also puzzle accpetcs to the game, but only one stands out, and that was the ghost puzzle where you have to find objects to spell ot a sentecne for you, the rest is really generick but it all have a problem.\nThe game is really not giving you any information how to do any of the puzzels in the game. Even when the anwser is not at all ofious. There is some dark floor you have to light up in order to walk past it, but the game dose not tell you how you can deal with it in other ways that are way smarter and easier. There even is a part where you have to make a really complicated bomb, in order to open a door by sticking it to a minion.\n\nThe gameplay is really focus around fire, so everything get`s boring fast, becouse you only have to think of one way to win. There are many options to make weapons, but you simply choose the simples one, becouse any other way is either too complicated or too wierd.\n\nYou can also rewind time in the menu. It`s a really pointless feture. Just wanted to mention it.\n\nCharecters:\nI could start by saying, "what charecters?" All the charecters are so badly wrinten and the only way to get anything from them, is by reading SMS`s you get on yourt phone. Even this informatiuon is not interesting. So here are the charecters steriotypicall: main good guy with an atitude and amnesia, worthless girl charecter thea works as loveinterest, old guy that knows whats going on and helps amnesia charecter, evil guy and evil force.\nThe dialog for all of them is so badly written and you care about no one in the story. Overall the charecters are so bad the game really makes you ask youself "why am I playing this?" "what do I get out of helping charecters I hate?"\n\nVisuels:\nThis game is very ogly. The graphics really look to pixeld eventhough it`s a never game. Eventhough it tries to have a seriuos look sometimes, the graphics really kills it. Only a few moments and a boss looks ok, but why could they not make the whole game look like that?\n\nThe game takes place in Central Park, and therfore everything looks the same. Eventhough you laster in the game can explore, you find out how doll and gray everything looks. The coloursceam is a big minus here.\n\nThe animation for the game is also very wonki and glitchy. Sometimes the enemies can jump in the air and fly after your car eventhough you have driven far away. All in all the game look bad\n\nSound/Music:\nThe main theme of the game I think is bad, but you can of couse like it if you will. The rest of the sound is nothing to write home about.\n\nStory/bosses\nThere will be no spoilers here, but I will comment on the ending.\nSo this is an amnesia storry. Your charecter has no idea who he is, and has to find out. He finds an old guy and a girl and starts to figure stuff out. Then an evil guy shows up and want to kill the manin charecter.\nThe goal of the main charecter and the evil guy is to either stop or let out the devil. And by the way the devil destoryes a hugepart of New York, but is aperentlly hitten under Central Park.\n\nThe story is really boring, and all of the charecters fells like they are totally ok with everythign that happens around them. You are just running around from one location to antoher while the girl is trying to find anything out about you. Thi leads to  lot of traveling and a lot of bad combat in order to find the portal to the devil.\nEventhough the concept sounds cool it is executed in such a bad way, that you really losse interest of the story early on.\n\nI have to mention there are boss fights but only one good. The rest is just plain bad and they are really few too.\n\nAbout the ending. You have to make a choice, but trust me NONE of the choices makes for a good or even decent ending to this game.\n\nConclution:\nSo you kinda know now what I think about this game now. I see it as a bad port from the X Box and a bad game in general. As a person that loves good carecters and story this game tries way too hard to have a good story and it just makes all the flwas shine even more.\nCombine this with bad graphics, bad combat, anoyng puzzels and overall bad everything and you got youself a bad game in my opinion.","April 22","false","14.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It did have some really good concepts, but overall it feels as if the climax was underwhelming compared to the intriguing build up.\n\nEither way, a 6/10.\n\nNot too good a game - but not bad either if you have about 10 hours to spend for a mediocre horror game.","November 21, 2014","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fairly linear and whatever puzzles there are are uninteresting. Initially this was planned to be the first in a set of episodes, but it looks like all further episodes were canceled. What we end up with is an unfinished story that leaves plenty of things out in the open.\n\nThe best of the game is probably its atmosphere: it really does its best to convey the "haunted house" setting to the player, but unfortunately is only partly successful in this due to the graphics not being up to par and some badly chosen mechanics ("press x to blink"). Also, but this is fairly subjective, I find the "horror" element to be too much in your face - for this type of survival horror I prefer a more subtle approach that intensifies as the ending nears.\n\nThe worst of the game are its technical issues. It is an Atari game for the PC, so you know what that means ... Everything about this game betrays its console origin.\n\nThe graphics are only meh, not bad bud also not great. Large polygons, repeating textures, sudden transitions in animations, ... Despite its average looks, it uses a lot of resources on your machine so people who meet the minimum requirements may suffer.\n\nThe controls are clunky and very console-ish, giving you far more buttons to press than actually necessary while also combining several functions under one key - something that is not needed on a PC! Cutscenes are unskippable.\n\nThen there are the crashes. I was lucky and able to get the game working quickly (a lot of peeps on Steam can't even get that far). But, yes, trying to change the display options crashes the game very time. A gamepad works unreliably as well with this.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game comes with additional DRM: the much hated SecuRom protection.\n\nAnd it would not be Alone In The Dark game if the camera hinders the players whenever it can.\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you really want to play this game, get it on your favorite console but avoid the PC version at every cost. This game on PC is the definition of a horrible port.","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donequis/recommended/259170/","donequis","donequis 🎮","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donequis/","403 products in account","Oh well. After so much rumor about the game back then, I just had to buy it when it was finally on sale for 2 bucks. And what a mistake it was.\n\nThis game seemed to be so promising on Xbox 360/PS3 back then, but the PC port is just horribly bad.\nThe graphics are just meh, with crappy animations and low res textures (even if you crank the settings up to max, in first person it just stays ugly). But since this game is over 7 year old, this may be forgiven. What I can and will not forgive though, is the fact that it's FOV-locked and has no support for any other aspect ratios than 16:9. There's not even a hacky fix to be found around the internets, so you're out of luck if you don't have a 16:9 display.\n\nThe gameplay has some interesting bits to it, but generally it smells due to a ridicoulus keymapping (it basically requires you 3 hands to play), really bad movement in third-person, and a wonky fighting system. But not only that, at every point where they try to scare you, there's usually a build up over 20 seconds, in which you will nearly fall asleep murmuring "oh, the horror", until the actual scary event happens. So, horror game? Maybe, but not in the sense of a spooky setting.\nThe game might be a tad better when played with a 360 controller, but I have yet to confirm that.\n\nSound wise - well, there isn't much  to be heard. Effects are ok, the few lines of synchronization are not too bad, and the soundtrack tries to keep you excited, but ultimately doesn't do much for the game (mostly because it only sets in with scripted events).\n\nI was really hoping that this game could somewhat live up to it's hype back then, but it completly failed - and although it might sound harsh, it's understandable to blame this game for Atari's insolvency. It was just such a huge mistake to give this project to a studio, which only had developed racing games (which were actually decent, see Test Drive Unlimited) previously.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? No, if you're interested in good graphics, good gameplay or a good setting. No, if you were hoping for a good horror game. But yes, if you're a die-hard-fan of the old AitD games and really got a thick skin to bear it's flaws.","July 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Alternating between stupid and staggeringly ambitious, AitD remains possibly the most singular survival horror game "genre piece" made to date. Systems upon fiddly systems of needless simulation that nonetheless serve to give the player a wonderful sense of agency in the world. My recommendation however; *use* the ability to fast forward. There are sections of the game that are almost unplayable, such as the early car escape. Skip it! The game lets you! To get to the "actual game", fast forward to the chapter immediately following the car escape. AitD is by far at its best when it's a free-form open world roaming "sim", so play it that way. Experiment, poke at it, laugh at it. It's a rube goldberg device masquerading as a horror game.

Graphics are slightly improved over the console version, but that’s about it.\n\nYou might notice my playtime, less than half an hour. Don't let that dissuade you from an incomplete playthrough. This is identical to the console version, and not worth the second play through.\n\nTL:DRDon’t buy it. Even if on sale. If it comes in a bundle you purchase elsewhere, that’s fine; just don’t install it. Avoid it, as it does the Alone in the Dark name a grave injustice.\n\nThe Good+ Environment. It has a few jump scare moments that are unexpected.\n\nThe Bad- Graphics. They’re horrible, even at max settings. The PlayStation 3 version looks identical, like Atari did absolutely nothing when porting it to PC.\n\n- Controls. They’re also horrible. Carnby controls like a tank, but not in a good way (like the original Resident Evil games). Whether you’re in first-person or third-person, they’re horrible.\n\n- Sound. The sound effects are boring. The acting is bad. The music has a few good moments but is very generic. Speaking of generic…\n\n- The story. It’s been done a billion times before. The original Alone in the Dark had a fairly interesting story. Atari did not try, at all, when it came up with the story for this game. It’s like they used one of those online generators to plug in a bunch of info and had it spit something out.\n\n- Replayability. None. Not like you’d want to play it through once, much less multiple times.\n\nThe Rest+/- Technical issues. There are a lot of issues. Disclaimer: Despite having the game in my library for a few years, I’m going through my backlog as of early 2015, so playing a 2008 game on a Windows 8.1 system may cause issues. With that said, I can’t necessarily hold technical issues against the game, as they may not have existed when the game was new.","February 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Players control Edward Carnby, the main character from the original Alone in the Dark, on a thrilling journey through a dark and terrifying re-creation of New York's Central Park where Carnby must discover the truth behind a dark conspiracy.\n\nWith inspiration from the presentation style of popular action TV dramas, Alone in the Dark will be split into a number of distinct episodes. With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each episode, the structure of Alone in the Dark pulls you into world that delivers a fiercely gripping and terrifying experience. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.\n\nAlone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction. The game will mark a new beginning for the Alone in the Dark series.","November 12, 2013","true","169.7"," 9 of 51 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","9","51","0","0"

Yes, by all means\nIts so advanced for 2008 game, even today, almost 7 years later. It puts big focus on physics and creativity to survive. It lets you explore freely most of the time so you can look for supplies(even tho they are mostly easy to come by "along the way"). It has very interesting enemies and melee combat system, amongst other interesting and unique features, like closing your eyes to see some things better(yup, its a thing, you will also have to blink manually at times) and combining everything with everything to get a tool best suited for you current situation.\nGames story is really good and even tho some people will say its "just another post-apocalyptic zombie game", this is not the case, first of, its not post-apocalyptic, its apocalyse preventing one and there are absolutely no zombies here(although some enemies do look like them :P).\nAlso what i would like to point out is that this game is made in a way to resemble a tv show. What i mean by this is that every time you resume your previous session, a "previously on alone in the dark..." will play and highlight key moments that happened to that point , also, every time you complete main objective for that chapter, end credits will roll, but, in adition to this, game is playable in 1st as well as in 3rd person, and 3rd person is very cinematic, with great movie like camera angles while 1st is very immersive so, pick your favourite.\n\nDo i recommend the PC version? Absolutely not!\nIf you have XBox360 or PS2/3, play it on one of those instead, because, PC version is just bad, mouse and keyboard controlls are not that good, new PC's and systems cant run and/or configure it properly, visuals are glitchy at places and the game was never and never will be patched because the complany went bankrupt from what i heard.\n\nAll in all, amazing game, bad port, but since im reviewing a game here, imma hit "Yes" for recommended, an as for the port itself, you have been warned","December 21, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The PC version is a complete disaster regarding hardware compatibility.\n\nOnly get this game if you have a PC with Windows XP or Vista and a GPU with 1GB of VRAM or less.","March 15","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
