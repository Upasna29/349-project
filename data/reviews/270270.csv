The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm in The Thing (1982), which is one of my favorite horror movie. At first it was quite challenging to survive in the cold, harsh winter of Siberia. From hunger to thirst, I was searching for better weapons, armor, and loot while avoid/sneaking by mutants(can get pretty tense). Weapon ammo is scarce in the beginning so avoiding enemies is probably best. Had to move out of my safe house so I can travel farther into the randomly-generated, open-world map without wasting any more resources. From there, it wasn't as hard as before but still alot to do and explore. Crafting is very useful too. I can build my own wooden cabin with torches all around and a workbench to craft even more stuff. Now including Permadeath, animals are introduced to hunt, so I'm definitely keeping an eye out for more updates.","December 7, 2015","true","28.8"," 57 of 58 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","57","58","3","1"

My first playthrough I survived roughly 70 minutes. A brief tutorial gets you going with the basics and throughout my playthrough I found myself bringing up the Manual to check things such as crafting and whatnot. GAMEPLAY: In Frozen State's current 'state' do NOT expect a run and gun zombie killing game. I found it to be much more of a survival of the elements and finding safe places to sleep, cook food and stay warm. Most of my time was spent going from house to house looking through cupboards and bedrooms for useful items to either drink, eat or cook with. Building fires is absolutely necessary to stay alive along with finding safe places to sleep. As if surviving the subarctic tempurature isn't difficult enough, there are zombie-like creatures scattered thoughout the game. You start with a Nagant 7.62R pistol and an axe, the enemies (two varients that I have found so far) are not the most difficult to kill but I found myself avoiding them like the plague just because I was dying a slow death trying to stay alive without dealing with them. AUDIO/VIDEO: Both could use a little bit of work. I don't need my games, personally, to be the shiniest thing int he world but the visuals could maybe use some work. Noticed some animations were missing and some, like the flashlight I found, were really impressive adding to the overall atmosphere. Audio was OK, nothing to write home about at this point.\n\nIn the end, I was freezing to death, getting hungry and becoming dehydrated. I was out at night during a snowstorm searching for safe shelter where I could build a fire and sleep. I stumbled across a huge building, I think it was a school, went it and went upstairs looking for either a bed or bathtub. I could hear creatures walking around and it was almost pitch black in the building so I had to move by flashlight and focus in on sounds. (You can hold "C" to focus on noises, I thought this was a really cool feature adding to the survival-horror feel) Was killed by a creature that walked on four legs, reminded me of the 'Licker' from a Resident Evil game.\n\nAll in all, I really think this is what survival horror is about. Excellent dark, gritty and isolated-survival aspects. Needs a lot of work but so far so good. They have a lot of content planned and I can only see good things for Frozen State. Worth the $10? Yeah, help the dev team out with your feedback and I believe we will all be well rewarded in the end. Enjoy!\n\n*Edit: " I stumbled across a huge building, I think it was a school..." Literally. I found a few bottles of Port Wine and was #$%*ing wasted.","July 1, 2014","true","1.3"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","56","60","0","1"

A lot.\nIt's a great game in that it's genuinely tense. The stakes are high and you can't just reset the gambles you make. I have been playing it since, I think about the first month it came to Steam, and it has changed dramatically.\nWhen I first bought it, I was afraid at first, it would be the same generic kind of survival game that has been washing up on the shores of Steam like rotten flotsam. Frozen State is like a big, ice coated barge crashing into the shore and unleashing a horde of the undead onto your normal beach going day.\nI have some key things to say about it. The first is that I survived 20 days. That is my current maximum. I found the Mansion, and it was there I died.\nWord of warning? Humans Aren't your friend. But I did find a car, and by god, that was the most satisfying feeling on the planet to be able to avoide the Piercers, Jackals, Widows and other horrible monsters occupying the wastelands. I could explore so much easier and take a nice deep breath knowing I had a moment of peace.\nI expect the developers will eventually take the feature of beaing safe in a car, away, but if I could ask them not to, it would make playing the game in the future so much easier.\n\nThe game is like the era of Playstation 2 horror titles like the Silent Hill series, it's filled with suspense. Every action you do could give you away or get you killed if you aren't careful. I would even say this is a tougher game than Don't starve and I Love how ruthless that game is.\n\nI hope for so much of this game, and that's why I delayed my initial review but as it stands, this game is WORTH your 10 dollars. It is Worth your time. The game is hard, which it should be. It's survival horror and it places a hard pitch on the actual survival aspect. If I hadn't been stupid? I could have gone on for probably close to another 30 days with the supplies I found, but one wrong decision, one wrong choice and you're done. Example? I had gotten to the point to use a series of molotovs and had 6 fistfuls of fire to chuck at Reapers in one of the houses and I was an idiot and caught myself on fire. The heat, the sound, it drew the Jackals and I booked it like a mad man back to my car just to slather Stas in Burn Ointment to compensate for my own recklessness. I barely escaped, but I did by the skin of my teeth.\nOn a technical level I will give a moderate review as follows:\n\nGraphics: Appropriate - It could be better, but I understand the level and it's satisfactory. I can see things, I know what stuff is. I can make out details and it does the job more than enough.\n\nDifficulty: Hard - This isn't Minecraft. This isn't Don't Starve. This is a hard game with definite rules and hard physics in play. Sure you can carry 13 logs in your inventory, but the point is that you need to be careful and cutthroat with what you have and what you take. You can't just plop down some bricks or garbage and block your enemy and you are lucky if outrun your enemies. Don't expect an easy start.\n\nGameplay: Stern but fair - This sounds like a difficulty but as mentioned in the previous sections of this review, this game is about what you are willing to do and how careful you are to prepare for the Icepocalypse surrounding you. It is fun, sneaking past your enemies, hoping to god their cone doesn't spot you so you can get home, getting your base built, HAVING A GUN (with limited bullets) SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO MELEE ENGAGE; all these aspects are some of the rewarding elements to it. Being lucky and being careful are the greatest measure a player can have aside from their own preparedness.\n\nCurrent Cons and suggestions:\n\nCharacter progression is hard. I wish the developers would consider giving you some of the Level-Up Pills every 5, to 10, to 15 days. I have had such a hard run of the game because I couldn't become tougher in-game, only smarter in how I play.\nI wish you could make matches out of gunpowder or maybe use infected meat to make like tallow or some kind of grease to make some kind of natural igniter.\nMaybe a lantern not like the flashlight you can build out of scrap metal that you can place would be nice.\nIf there were anything else, right now that I could ask for? Maybe either the ability to armor plate your car with scrap metal or maybe a scrap metal sword or knife so you can make a spear or have something other than the nailed club or axes to kill stuff with.\n\n\nOverall opinion: The game is hard, it's like squeezing water from rocks, but when you get it together it can be so much fun. And while I appreciate the game being hard, as it should be, I wish that the guy I killed at the Manor had dropped at least his axe. All he dropped was bedsheets. To bandage my ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ up.\n\nBeginners tips?\nStones can be thrown as distraction items to lure enemies away.\nBehind your house is an underground silo thing that you can access in the back-left corner, usually in there are the thermometer and watch. Sometimes a bed and a workbench. It usually has a plethora of goodies in it.\nCrafting will be your biggest ally as some of the weapons you make are invaluable, and you need to upgrade it to make your armor and weapons better.\nALWAYS CARRY SPARE FIRES AND MATCHES and when you find an extra sleeping bag? That also.\nTrying to upgrade your weapons can cause them to break. I lost my starting axe and a double barreled shotgun this way. Upgrades are always a gamble.\n\nBuy it out of 10.","July 16, 2015","true","58.4"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","55","60","4","0"

Before I got through the door I saw the horrific monster walking towards me, I fired a few bullets but I have had little experience shooting a gun so I missed 2/3 shots. I put it away and raised my axe and lunged at it taking a few good swipes at it knocking it down killing it. Once I had caught my breath I slowly walked into the same building when something more horrifc crawled across the ground at furious speed. I ran back terrified taking more shots but missing, I did as before and raised my axe slashing at it killing it. I'm not sure what it is but I really didn't want to know. I pressed on still looking for the paper I needed...\n\nI found a supermarket but inside I found no paper although on my way out around the back something huge chased me, i'm not sure what it was but I ran and managed to escape.\n\nThankfully I was struck with the best of luck, a building full of apartments. I ran inside checking every drawer and cupboard but nothing until I checked an oven...And there it was, the one thing I had spent my journey looking for...Paper...I swiftly crafted myself a fire and crouched next to it, feeling the warmth as it brushed my skin...I am now in that appartment hoping that by morning I will still be alive...\n\nI have decided to leave the room I was in, in search of more supplies. After a few minutes of searching I hear a loud crash as a wooden door breaks down, I stop dead in my tracks swiftly checking my surroundings...Suddenly a monster crawls along the ground towards me, I raise my axe once again and give it a few slashes but it keeps coming I try to give it another but a Gaunt begins his approach so I back into a small bathroom and whip out my pistol and fire an entire magazine at them...They are dead...I am now cold and dying...I rush around looking for the fire I left on so I could know where I was. I enter a room and see the thing I saw at the supermarket, it turns and begins its chase. I turn and run now looking for the exit. I run into a room hoping to find stairs but all I find is another exact same monster. I turn and run but he is right behind me. I manage to duke him out and continue my escape. Quickly I close a door to block them and run into another room...Empty...I turn back and see them already coming towards me, I try to doge him but to no avail, with one foul swoop he slices my neck cutting it open and I drop dead...\n\n\nThis was all in one small hour session and was a great thrillride, there was alot more I could have explored and seen but that would take far too long and be far to dangerous as I'm sure there are alot more terrifying creatures out there.\n\nThings to improve/add:\n\nMultiple saves - You can already do this by just copying the data folder and then deleting its contents except settings but it would make it alot easier than having to do that.\n\nGetting around objects - I have seen various objects and such placed infront of doors and such and with no way to get around it, I think being able to climb over it or push things out of the way would be cool.\n\nMore crafting??? - I'm sure it will improve and add more but there isn't much atm anyway unless I just haven't found the right things although some things are there that I don't have but Idk.\n\nMore open worldy - Although the zone traveling does help FPS ALOT you can easily escape enemies by using zones when being chased which is a bit silly. Unless you can combat that with a sort of 'enemy nearby' system.\n\nMods - Of course mods 'cause why not?\n\nMultiplayer - Although it's a big leap I think this game would be extremely good for MP as the core gameplay elements that are in the game such as lockpicking would make for some fun gameplay.\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now but my rating for this game as it is, is an 9/10.\nThe games concept is very unique and fun and even now I can see myself spending SO many hours in this game. Definately recommend this game!\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PWI_xqPUOI","July 5, 2014","true","2.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","3"

Very hard core survivalist, very fun very unique.\n\nProblems/ bugs I have encountered.\nFor a game still in Alpha I have only found one problem with this game.

Don't know why it doesn't work, food, water and clothing all work fine.\n\nFirst off this game is very easy to get into, its a single player game not co op or multiplayer.\nYour enemy? The weather, starvation, dehydration, keeping warm and... people infected with a violent space parasite.\nParasites (they look human but usually have extra probiscus mouth sticking out of where their mouth is.

While the survival genre isn't exactly new (and let's face it, survival as a genre is very over-saturated these days) this game brings a rather unique twist with it being based very cold temperatures that make exploration need very careful planning, as one wrong decision can cost you dearly, either from freezing to death or the alien hybrids that have nothing better to do than to make your life a misery.\n\nInteriors of buildings are randomly generated which in turn mean that items are also randomly generated. Your starting gear is also randomly generated to an extent too, which is rather nice as it brings a fair bit of variety. A decent example is that the first time I played I got a nice revolver with plenty of ammo. The second time round I didn't get a revolver and the third time I got a revolver but had the wrong ammo type.\n\nThe hybrids hurt, It is advised to try and avoid combat if possible (however you could go in guns/axes ablazing, just don't expect to be in one piece after though :p). You can sneak by crouching or walking to reduce noise you make, as far as I can tell it seems to work well enough.\n\nWhile the controls can get a bit of getting used to, they work fairly well. Line of Sight is implemented very well in this game where you have a cone of sight that is movable with the mouse.\n\nReally enjoying it so far, although I haven't put in as much time as I would like. Would love to see more crafting options, randomly generated maps (as well as interiors) and more functionality. I will be following the game to see how the devs expand the game.","July 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

The game takes place in Siberia, so obviously its gonna be snowing and cold, but that means that you cannot stay outside for long, or you will suffer from hypothermia. This game is very clever, you cant just stay inside one house the entire time, you will eventually have to go out and get supplies, so each time you go looting, it may be your last day. Another cool and uncommon feature is the sleeping mechanics, you can find beds, bathtubs, or sleeping bags to go to sleep, though you will have to put a campfire next to you, or you will freeze to death, also you can be killed in your sleep, by zombies. Overall, for an Early Access game, i will give it 9.5/10 i really like survival games, especially ones with zombies, and this game is really good. I totally recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice survival game, and i hope the Developers continue with the great updates. :D","October 4, 2014","true","3.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

With Frozen State, produced by Snow Arc Studio, normally known for Mobile Apps, we see a clear return to the genre's roots.\n\nTaking control of one of 3 characters, (only 1 available as of now), the player is thrust into an icy, post-apocalyptic world with meager supplies, and no bearing on their goal or object. Using a classic top-down view, the player must venture through the cold, and traverse numerous randomly placed 'Zones', complete with decrepit buildings, and the crumbling tenents of of former society. The wind and snow constantly blow, quickly chilling you to the bone, giving you the choice to to run for cover, or start a campfire to preserve your body temperature.\n\nSupplies, food,  water, and sleep are constantly an issue, forcing you to scavenge every cabinet, fridge, chest, and pantry in order to survive your body's constant needs. Mutants also roam the wasteland, presenting another threat to survive, making you use found weapons to fight back against their presence.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic survival game that looks very promising.","July 9, 2014","true","8.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I played on an Early 2009 Mac Pro, 16 GB RAM, Radeon 5870.\n\nNo bugs / glitches during play. I really liked the audio in the background, it provided a lot of atmosphere. Enemies were tough if you don't have good weapons. On my first play through I died fighting a monster with my fists. On the second playthrough I was able to find a lot of supplies raiding a 3 story apartment building (with a yeti monster inside). I was able to take out several enemies with either an ax or a firearm at range. The only thing I had to worry about was finding a place to sleep. I am glad you are including a sleeping bag because that was going to be one of my first suggestions.\n\nThe movement was different from what I expected (I thought you would use the mouse to change direction), but I found it actually provided some advantages such as running backwards and firing at enemies. The crafting is easy to use and intuitive (combining elements to make a meal, then putting them on a fire to cook them and make them edible). I like the different outfits (coats and hats) providing different defensive and temperature protection.\n\nOne big request is to get the map working. Moving through the different maps worked well, but it was hard sometimes to remember where the nearest bed is. One issue I noticed was going to one area then going back to a previous area, but your perspective was rotated 90 degrees. The camera could be rotated back, but since you don't currently have a map it was occasionally difficult to find my bearings. Also, if you could add notes to the map that would help.\n\nSometimes I would find a building / house with something blocking one of the doors outside (like furniture) and you are unable to cut through it. The only thing you seemed to be able to destroy were locked doors.\n\nSome feature requests: key remapping - everyone has their favorite keys to perform actions. A save game feature - I had to finally kill myself in one game because I was bored and could not save it. Since you start out in the same house every time, how about adding a home base to store items and protect yourself?\n\nI have been following this game since its Kickstarter campaign and I am very impressed with the progress the team has made. You have laid a solid basis for a great game.","July 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You're just setting up a failing pest control bussiness."\n\nIf you're a fan of survival horror this is something you're gonna wanna grab.\n\nThe monster population is actually surprisingly but pleasingly small - it means its still an event as well as surprisingly and worrying when you actually run into one or two of em - instead of mowing them down by the dozen with a sword or machinegun.\nEvery enemy type (but some more than others) can cause a serious amount of damage and even poison or make you bleed. Going into sneak mode and trying to get by unoticed is possible but if you get caught, panic and open fire any nearby enemies are gonna start smashing down doors and running about looking to finish your weakened ♥♥♥ off.\nOn top of this the cold is quite a serious problem - lose track of time while out scavenging for food or meds and you can find yourself after hours, in the dark, in minus twenty degrees celsius snowstorms with about five feet of visibility. You see a crumbling structure up ahead and head inside hoping to find some shelter and maybe somewhere to set up a fire and sleeping bag - only to hear the growls and footsteps of the current ocupants. Which would you prefer: sitting there next to the fire all night staring at the doorway and hoping they don't find you, or go off and try and clear the building out in both the cold and dark?\n\nIncluded in the game are skills which can be upgraded with points found while generally looting or sometimes on the corpses of slain monsters. Skills include resistance (cold, posion) crafting (more items to make) strength (bare fist damage, carry weight) and more.\nAlso, bases. Technically a player can make any building they found and clear out their home sweet home but they also have the option of crafting four different buildings (ascending in size) almost anywhere they want. In the same "buildings" tab "homely" craftable items are avilable such as crafting tables, storage boxes and torches to spruce up your new home or refurbish your current one, and fotifications such as wooden walls and spike barricades.\nOh and did I mention that like in project zomboid and one or two other games that enemies don't appear on your screen unless you are facing them? That means to make sure a building is completly secure, every cuboard, toilet, nook and cranny much be searched. This also means that you may not notice an enemy was hiding around the corner until its picking its teeth with your bones, or that the enemies chasing you were a lot closer than you thought but didn't know until you stopped running and turned around to check.\n\nCons: (In order of nit-picky-ness)\nPlayer controls, movement and combat, are pretty clunky - its next to impossible to defeat an enemy using melee without taking a few hits.\nMore craftable items needed - walking around with a cart full of transistors, insulation, paperclips, light bulbs etc. that sound like they may be useful in some contraption but at the moment seem to have no purpose in crafting.\nPlayer appearence doesn't change - may seem mild but I dislike when your character doesn't change when equipping new armour/clothes. It shows clear progression and looks silly in this game when in reality you are wearing several polar bears to brave the winter colds but your character appears to be knocking about wearing jeans and a t-shirt.\n\nI could continue nitpicking but many of these will likely be fixed after a few months or when out of early access and if, like me, you're a fan of survival horror this is a game you are gonna want to keep your eye on.","March 14, 2015","true","30.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This is an Alpha game that has tremendous content very early on.\n\nIt is a survival game but very few games make winter an enemy. Cold weather can kill you if your not paying attention to your temperture and if you decide to take on a hybrid, (the current enemy in the game) you have to be fast because some will kill you without thinking about it. This game is not a complete rougelike but if you die, you restart, and about ninety percent of the items and objects are procedural generated. Plus (as I said above) the enemies are as deadly as the weather itself.\n\nNow the game is early so it has it's fair share of bugs, but from my experience I didn't come across any game breaking bugs and I play this game on a laptop with an Intel hd graphics 4000 (I did have to reduce some graphic settings). There's not much that I dislike about this game, the enemies are done right so far, keeping track of your characters health (food, water, etc..) isn't too bad, and having the random generation changes things up a bit.\n\nThe issues that I do have, is that there is no sprint button. So it takes a while to do certain things such as gathering wood to build your cabin. There's no map, so it's very easy to get lost if you don't keep track of what your doing. Also there's only three enemy types and there's only one that I try to avoid (fortunately more are going to be added soon).

There's very little sound, very random gameplay, very few goals, and little to do once you've loaded up on fire, water, food, and have a good bed. My second game saw me sitting pretty with a bed, enough for 20+ campfires (each one lasts 6 hours), warm clothing, a week's worth of food ready to be cooked (lots of buckwheat and rice), and enough lemonade, tea, and tomato juice to match the food. I'd basically beaten the game.\n\nBut other than the jarring realization that you don't need to play anymore, it's got the makings of a good game. Doors that latch/unlatch, campfire cooking with crafted foods, good balance to monsters, and doesn't look half bad (though the protoganist could go for a revamp, and i was disappointed to note that equipment changes weren't reflected on him). Someone noted that they didn't like the movement, but i don't see anything weird with it. Pretty standard look-with-mouse and move-with-wasd controls, and the character doesn't slide around.\n\nI don't know if i'd say it's more than a $5 game right now, but it's got promise.

The game has randomized loot, crafting and survival elements, as well as monsters that remind me very much of the creatures from 'The Thing'. While the game is still in alpha and early release, I believe it is fully worth the pittance you pay for what could be hours of fun. As a plus, the developers seem to really listen to the comments people make, and take a keen interest in player suggestions to further develope and refine the gameplay. If you are like me, you'll love helping give the developers more ideas and create the game to be what you want it to be, unlocking the potential of community development.\n\nIf you enjoy "breaking & entering / Treasure hunting" games based around survival of the elements and unknown enemies, as well as unforgiving consequences to every action and 'Permadeath' roguelikes, this is the game for you. If you prefer a more casual gaming experience, this may not be your cup of tea.\n\nIn closing, I highly recommend this game to the more 'hardcore' crowd- Players which enjoy games like Project Zomboid, State of Decay, and DayZ.","July 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You get to build anywhere you want that is outdoors, which is awesome.\n\nI wish there where more written notes and diaries that actually tell you something. I've done 4 play throughs and searched everywhere and everything and have only found 1 note that tells you the codes to all the vending machines. That's it. :(\n\nOverall thoughts on the game as it's still in Alpha. 7/10.\n\n(Combat) 5/10, it's pretty fun, but will get boring after a while. It's still a challenge though at the start.\n\n(Crafting) 7/10 It basic, It's easy. You can craft on the spot without needing a workbench, and even build large structures.\n\n(Building) 8/10 It's easy and fun. You can freely build anywhere you want, except indoors if it's a wall or barricade. The rotating is slow and you can only rotate one way. So if you mess up your angle, you'll need to restart.\n\nYou get resources back after taking something down you've built, which is good.\n\n(Cooking) 5/10 You get quite a few different cooking options for the food you've gathered. Some foods need to be prepared by crafting them with some water so it can be cooked in a fire or stove. You cannot plant and farm anything in the game, so most of the food you will find are packets of oatmeal, rice, tea, instant coffee, etc.\n\nInstant coffee is one of the best things you can find. It will recover your Body temp, fatigue, and thirst all in one when crafted and boiled into a Hot cup of coffee.\n\n(Monsters) 4/10 Even though they are hard to kill when outnumbered, there are only 3 types. 1 fast, 1 normal, 1 slow.\n\nJackjumpers = Fast/Normal strength\n\nGhouls = Normal/ Normal strength\n\nPeircers = Slow/Very Strong, Critical hits.\n\nThe most monsters I've seen in one place was 2 piercers, 4 jackjumpers, and 3 ghoul things. You don't see many of them though, and only a few. :P\n\nAfter you are equipped with a decent weapon, some armor, and good defense and fighting skills, it's easy and sometimes so boring you just end up throwing grenades around for fun because you've already blasted all the other monsters.\nBut don't get me wrong, at the start of the game they are very difficult to fight.\n\n\n","November 1, 2014","true","14.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Crafting, basic needs in game such as hunger, thirst, rest, and keeping warm. But a lot of that you don't learn to do in the start. The tutorial, if you can call it that, is very breif, and traveling is very confusing. Overall gameplay wise I would give it a 3/5 for now, but it is early acess and will be improving. I play Arma 3, on all low, in a 1024x768 resolution with overall distance at 10000 ( i like jets) and objects at 2000 and shadows 100. I can get around 30fps. Not very good, but playable. In this game, im not quite sure why, but with it all on low and same resolution it feels like im getting frame rates in the teens. Now I will admit, my system is pretty low end, but I play games much more intensive at better performance.  So right now I would say this game needs optimized in every way shape and form. And the map sized per location, isn't terribly large either, so a high framerate would be expected. Would I recommend this? Eh? Maybe in the future if the game improves I would right now, maybe, depends on the friend.\n","April 13, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

There are no NPCs or quests to give the game a point, so at the moment it is just a case of playing to survive. If you enjoyed This War of Mine, for example, then you'll be familiar with that concept and should find this enjoyable too. Quests are planned for later versions of the game, so if you like to watch projects as they develop, get in now.\n\nIt is extremely challenging; you will die. A lot. Even without quests, there is plenty to do just with keeping your stats (hunger, thirst, fatigue, etc.) maintained and finding the necessary materials to do so.\n\nThere is an intuitive and slick crafting and building system in place. This is one area I would really like to see developed even further, though—more items to craft and build, please!\n\nThe only thing that I dislike about the games design really is the save mechanism. I'm sure many people will disagree with me here as they like the challenge, and it is somewhat remeniscent of the 'ironman' mode in other games, but I think there should at least be an additional save point on sleeping, perhaps.\n\nAs it is, the game only saves when you move between locations, but there are times when I will spend several nights in the same location and be doing rather well emptying the buildings and defending myself, only to die on maybe the third day there, and have to respawn, losing all of my hard work AND randomising the area. This seems perhaps a little too punishing, even for the hardboiled gamer.\n\nJust my two-penneth. All in all, though, a fantastic foundation for a thoroughly intense and enjoyable game. I truly cannot wait to see how NPCs and quests will bring the whole thing to another level.\n\nOh, also, in case the developers respond to these comments, a question: I read some time ago on the old kickstarter page that tactical (I assume this means turn-based?) combat would be introduced. Is this still part of the plan? Just intrigued..","August 26, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Combat is a difficult as there is no way to block enemy attacks, although that might be the point as this game seems to advocate hiding and running from the monsters as opposed to actively combating them.\n\nI am really interested in the ability to build complete structures such as cabins and the like. Although a cheaper version of a campfire would be nice, perhaps like how Don’t Starve has the normal campfires that burn out and a fire pit that you can restart if it dies without having to make another.\n\nAll in all I think this game has promise and I get a lot of playtime out of it.","November 10, 2014","true","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Lots of area to explore very  easy to get lost, I recommend graph paper like old school mapping from AD&D days , glad I am a expert there LOL!\nThe game is very fun even though it is still missing the majority of the content and stuff, no skills, map, journal, and most of the crafting not in yet, No quests, missions, objective other then staying alive and not freezing in the cold weather , SO EASY TO DO! Awesome for an alpha early access, I dont do early accesses anymore since 99% of these are TRASH now with the major influx of survival wana be games thrown together put in early access and forgotten about and they run off with your money.\n\nI am hoping this wont be the case here with these devs , the game is so good already, when its released the 20 bucks if they complete what they are boasting which should not be hard code, just lengthy, then this will be worth 20 easy, and ill be glad I paid 9, which I am already its quit fun even in this early stage!  8 out of 10 stars for my rating for an alpha!!\n\nI have seen some people say they had performance issues, I can tell you as a computer expert and someone who keeps my computer free of troublesome malware and such, but also using an almost 4 year old video card Radeon HD 5750 1 gig I HAD NO perfomrance or framerate issues, I had no crashes, and my first sesson was 7 hours long.

Yes, I know that it's still in Alpha stage but It's already extremely fun. If you're suggesting of getting this game, get it. This game is worth the money right down to the half penny.\n=========================================================================\nI also have some thing that I believe to be bugs that can be fixable:\n\nPROBABLE BUGS:\nThe light from the flashlight is always on, even though I don't have it equipped.\n\nThe light is also not coming from the character and sometimes it splits into two light beams when there isn't anything their.\n\nAnother thing is the lag, you need to fix this or less people will buy the game. just try to get the game to play as smooth as possible and more people could buy the game.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUGGESTIONS:\nYour character wearing clothing is visible in the game instead of only seeing it on the LUCA-12 when equipped to have them look different so the player doesn't have to look at the character wearing the same clothes even when you have something else equipped.\n\nmore types of Hybrids instead of just the Piercer, the Jackal Jumper, and the Gaunt.\n\nYou could also make wall break from explosives and from a large enough amount of damage from Hybrids.\n==========================================================================\nHere are some suggestions for new kinds of Hybrids:\n\nThe Climber:\nThe Climber can climb buildings and go through open passages like open doors, windows, and holes in walls.\n\nThe Chunker:\nThe Chunker can pick up rocks, debris, or even the player. It can also charge at you in a straight line\n\nThe Possesor:\nThe Possesor can control abandoned cars and can make them drive at you, and can catch your bullets and throw them back at you. The Possesor can also (if you take my third suggestion into account) throw cars through walls to get to you. You would probably think that something this tough would make the game impossible to survive but the Possesor's weakness will be a very low health that you can kill it in about five hits with a large kitchen knife.\n\nI hope you take these into consideration.\nThank You, Cerxion","August 29, 2014","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","14"

Feels like the same game concept of Dungeon Seige, a great franchise.\n\nIn the beginning I struggled to stay alive, usually dying because i had no water or matches to light a fire.  I also died a couple of times fighting the muties until I learned how to defeat them.  There are plenty of items to collect out there.  I stayed alive for days.  I found some back packs and could carry 250 of gear.  And I was.  I had to start dumping stuff.  Got caught in a small room by two muties.  Death comes in numbers.  When you die you start over.  Will this change?  Will you be able to save?  Maybe when all your bars are 100% a save feature comes up??\n\nThe C key for listening doesn't seem to work?  I had muties close and when I held down C I still could not hear them any clearer.\n\nEven in Alpha this is a good game.  Looking forward to the other aspects of the game getting fleshed out.  A big one being the skills pane.  As you progress you should get better at surviving.  There are very few guns and ammo.  Don't change that.  They are hard to use at range anyways.  Hence skill progression.\n\nA map would be great.  When i walk through the tansition zones I find myself getting turned around and going back to where I had already been.  Maybe thats on purpose?  It is dark and blowing snow at times, easy to get lost.  On the blowing snow topic.  I would say I played for about 10 to 15 game days and it was always the same weather.  Change it up.  It has to stop snowing sometime.\n\nOne annoying thing.  You can crouch, which works for evading enemies.  But you can't jump?  This would be good for hopping over some of the small obstacles when running from enemies.  Instead of getting trapped and dying.  Again maybe this is on purpose?  Try to blend a little realism in the game.  I should be able to jump over small fences and debris if I'm fed, watered, warm and not injured.  Right??

By no means a "bad" game but by no means a finished product. Giving the game the benefit of the doubt it is in Early access and certainly has a lot of standards to live up to and achieve. Sadly that being said this game updates on a basis which is next to never leaving this game to be one of the many that seem to have been left to rot by the developer atleast in my opinion. And really at the 10 dollar pricetag it's one you should leave on the shelf as well. With the combat being one of the major points of this game it falls completely flat as a mere joke of what it should and could be. You are simply left to click until the thing dies or you die. The plot development is completely no existent I really have no clue what you're supposed to do other than survive. And even that's hard with not dying to the cold being next to impossible if you don't know exactly what you are doing. That aside the game has a half decent crafting system which revolves around all of the meaningless items you find lying around in drawers, cupboards, and fridges which is honestly quite odd. I could've said something along the lines of found a couple of tripmines in a fridge 10/10 best game and left it at that. But who the hell would take that seriously even though it's something that actually happened. Poor mechanics and a lackluster system of doing things leave the game with alot to be desired but as far as procedurally generated horror games go it's not at the bottom of the list. 6/10 Could be better...

While I am no big fan of top down games in the first place this one offers a very interesting feel and has much potential, but, the WASD-E interact setup is lost on top down and only served to make the controls unbearably inefficient, the game would benefit from the option to change controls from their original setting to a user preferred setting. (allow me to set key bindings)\n\nAnother issue I found currently is that the max range of interaction is too low, if I light a campfire I end up being burned because I have to practically stand inside the fire to interact with it. Your characters movements are rough and choppy and hiding, while a neat game mechanic, is not implemented well at this point since the interactions are still in poor repair...trying to hide in a wardrobe when a gross mutated monster is chasing you takes a while since you have to find that interaction sweet spot just to get into the wardrobe.\n\nSo, cons - Clunky, offputting controls. Poor interaction mechanics. Great music, poor atmospheric sounds. Top-down ruins the atmosphere, Choppy movements...and let me add, poorly constructed "inventory" screen...listing items? drag and drop? I feel as though I stepped back into 1999.\n\nPros - Survival game, if you like survival games then keep your eyes on this one. Wonderful list of lootables and craftables. Can run on low-end machines since it is graphically simplistic.\n\nUltimately I cannot recommend this to hardcore survival gaming fans as it does not really deliver satisfying game play and the survival mechanics are rough at best, starving and needing to eat in just 6 hours? Dying of thirst after half a day?  I am constantly having to drink and eat and burn myself on a campfire to stay warm.\n\nSo, kids...don't waste your money yet unless you have $10 you don't mind spending...it isn't terrible but it certainly isn't what the other comments make it out to be.","November 16, 2014","false","1.4"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","22","47","0","0"

They brought Dead Frontier to Steam." And unfortunately, with that impression, my entire expectation of the game was that... I was never really fond of games such as Divine Divinity or Neverwinter (the RPG, not the MMO. There's a humongous difference) so while this is more like the original Neverwinter, it isn't exactly what I was expecting, and at the moment I'm not completely certain why I don't like it - I loved Neverwinter, and I love Dead Frontier, but something in this game is very off-putting to me. Maybe it's the seemingly complete silence, or the lack of much of a tutorial short of the game telling you how to unlock your house. I had no idea where I was going, either, and while some games, that's appealing... it wasn't in this one.

The price is fairly low wich is alright and I bought it because it seems it could be a great game. Right now?\nRidiculously low frame rate, only one character playable, broken aiming mechanics due to the low frame rate, no introduction, no history no npc... Do I need to keep going?\nJust most of the game features are not there.\nStill great ideas, great promises and a really low price.","July 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 9 of 49 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","9","49","0","9"

It does not hold your hand and is a survival horror as it should be.\nThe speed at which you walk/run may be a little frustrating but it's not a fast paced game...running can get you killed.\n\nYou have to explore a lot, you will be a weakling for a bit, you do get more badass.\nCheck every nook and cranny...trust me there are some very cool suprises out there.\n","October 29, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hmm ok i love Zombie games but some just dont fill the gap that i expect in these games, and to be totally honest this game doesnt either BUT that being said this is a really Good game for a Early Access.\n\nYou play as a single Survivor in a Frozen world and u go into areas using access points to access the big map, then you move across the map and find locations to visit or u can just check out whats happening in the wilderness (lots of trees to cut down). At first i was like trying to get use to it but after a time i began to Realise u don't want to always take on Zombies face to face, thats why u can Sneak about and lvl ur guys skills using a element u find during the game in houses (check everything)\n\ni Recommend this game because i feel (and Hope) it is going to get better. i was thinking that the Zombies where a bit copied EG they all look the same 4 models , but in the last 20 min of playing this i found a BIG FAT Zombie which i ran away from.\n\nThe Crafting in the game is simple  but finding the elements u need is the challenge.\n\nThis game totally worth it AND for £4.89 it is well worth the Punt. It's not worth full price Right now BUT if it keeps going this way it will be.","December 29, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
