I was just waiting for it to emerge from Early Access to pick it up. Well today is that day and I have to say - it still feels like an Early Access game. I read a number of the other reviews and they just don't feel genuine to me, based on my experience in the game.\n\nThe user interface is clunky at best. For instance, they have a text based Tutorial in game that you can call up at any time, as well as some hints when playing. The hints say use the 'Action Button' to perform an action. Fair enough - but what's the Action Button mapped to? Ok, pull up the Options menu and look for keybindings...nope! You have to save your game and back out to the main menu just to look at the keybindings. Not a deal breaker but pretty annoying when you are first learning the game.\n\nNext up - they have mini-quests you can complete (like sell 5 health potions) for experience. Great! I chose an easy quest and was on my way. But there are other quests you can choose too. So I pick a second one to optimize my time. Except when you select it you replace the original, without any prompt warning you that you lose all progress on the existing quest. Ugh.\n\nSome pretty clear bugs in the UI, like looking at the skills. A hint says to select a skill to see its description and cost. Except it doesn't work. You click on the icon and it just asks you if you want to buy the skill without telling you the cost or the description.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. Let's be fair I only played an hour so I didn't see very much. But that first hour was dreadfully boring. Purchase a display, purchase an item to put on the display, open the shop and literally watch the shop to see if any customers (or thieves) come in to do business. For 15 minutes you just stand there waiting to see if any customers come in. I'm sure there's much more to the game after this, but after an hour of just staring at the screen waiting for customers to buy I couldn't take it. This is only a $10 game, but it just isn't fun in the current state.","May 20","false","1.2"," 188 of 225 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","188","225","6","11"

At the moment you cannot close your shop so that you may change some things around, instead you have to save your game then reopen it. This is the only major complaint; a smaller one would be that there are things that indicate features that just haven’t been added yet (for example a quest board with nothing on it).\n\nNow for the, as I mentioned earlier, potential. Some features that I feel would make the game much more interesting include:\n-	Employees (people to sweep the floors or security).\n-	Hero’s that enter your store and make custom requests for a quest they might have taken on.\n-	Some more random events ( e.g. people vandalizing your store)\n-	A store quality rating\n-	Decorations for your store (paintings, vases or chandeliers)\n-	Some more creative shop expansions (a second floor or balconies)\nApart from all this I really can’t wait to see the future of this game and all it has to offer.\n","October 3, 2015","true","7.1"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","94","99","4","3"

You have complete freedom over what you will have in stock, where you will put them, and so on. You are the only employee, so you'll need to do everything from furniture placement, ordering products, restocking, cleaning and maintenance, and even guarding your shop from raiders and thieves!\n\nThe Pros:Sandbox - While there are some quests to guide you, but you are free to do what you wish. You are in charge of all the aspects of your shop.\n\nPlay Style - You play from day to day (no weekends :D) and each day is divided into different stages, namely two five minute intervals, in which you will have to pay taxes. Visitors are realistically peaking during the middle of the day and low at the start and end of the day. Between any two days, you have an unlimited amount of time to clean and restock your shop!\n\nFun! - Even though the game play is repetitive from day to day, the profits that you make allow you to expand, and afford to import better loot. You will find yourself enjoying the seemingly monotonous activities because you will expand your shop, have more expensive items in stock, attract more clients, make more profits in a perpetual way.\n\nHumorous - The voice acting for the villagers is quite cute. Especially when they scream What the F#&@ when they stumble upon a high price or the joy they experience after making a purchase. Shopping, shopping, shoppng, YAY!"\nThe Cons:Performance Hit at later stages - When your shop will become bigger, if you choose to stock it with many small items (such as a dozen bookshelves with potions, like I did) you will see the that the game doesn't like this and drops frames very frequently, making camera movement a jaggy experience. Hopefully this is just an Early Access Problem. To work around it, focus your shop on expensive items scattered around with generous room between furniture.\n\nEarly Access - There are a few annoyances such as the mindless customers, eventual glitches (but very rare!), engine limitations, few item options, but really these are all related to the fact that the game is still in early access. The game as it is gets updates regularly, so I cannot comment as to what is bad, for it can get out of date really quick. What I can say however is that the negative ones aren't that bad.\nConclusionThis is a really nice game. If you like the idea, consider giving it a buy, but also consider waiting for the full release. The proof of concept is great, and I am pretty confident it will make a nice game once it is finished, but as with all Early Access titles, I tell people to only buy it if they really like what they see as of right now, and wish to support further development of the game. There is no guarantee the end product will be on your taste. That being said, I still consider it to be a nice game and am very interested to seeing where it will go!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 14, 2015","true","8.8"," 89 of 96 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","89","96","7","1"

Some of this review may be outdated! :D This is a good thing.\n\nI loved Recettear, so when Shoppe Keep got on my radar I was really excited.  It's in Alpha still and is fully playable.  This game does as much right as it does wrong.  Is it fun? Yes it is, once you climb over a huge hump to get to a productive endless mode.\n\nThe good:\n-Running a shop in first person is great, it really feels like you are juggling all the workings of a busy store by yourself\n-Lots of useful skill upgrades that are earned by turning over product and earning XP\n-Shoplifters are a big problem and you can whip out both sword and spell to make them regret stealing (...with this arsenal why are you running a shop, again? O_o)\n-Place shelves and tables as you like (if you can afford them) to make a shop that is all your own\n-Mark up and mark down product on the fly (Honestly I stayed at 150% the entire time with no problems)\n-Rapid fire placing products out is satisfying\n-Tons of Scenarios to play through where you have to meet objectives and earn rewards\n-The peasants have a cool style to them and I love the skeletons when you zap a shoplifter\n-The blocky potions are awesome looking!\n\nThe Bad:\n-Sweeping. Unless you are the worlds biggest Viscera Cleanup fan this mechanic may drive you nuts as you have to clean up after all these filthy peasants tracking mud all over\n-Scenarios are mandatory if you want to have a wide variety of items to sell in endless mode\n-The gameplay drags on forever sometimes.  Each game day is 20 minutes long in endless mode\n-The hitbox when fighting is a joke, I rarely can kill JUST the shoplifter without ending 1-3 other innocents and taking a big gold penalty for my troubles (this is factoring in the skill that is supposed to help and the security grid!)\n-When a shoplifter is killed by the door and that 350 gold armor falls outside your reach T_T\n-Needs more stuff to sell!\n-Various graphic glitches (floaty out of sync arms/legs, stretchy corpse meshes)\n-Needs a more streamlined tutorial built into the first couple scenarios rather than having you read the help window\n\nFinal Verdict: Shoppe Keep is fun when you get past some pretty big obstacles.  But it always felt like a game with a lot of promise but just wasn't there yet.  Still, you could do a lot worse and under the assumption this game will still be updated and developed you may want to give it a spin.","August 22, 2015","true","6.1"," 77 of 85 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","77","85","13","2"

You'll be in charge of building your shop from the ground up, managing inventory, sending your champion on quests to get rare materals, and defending against barbarians.\n\nPros    Developer is very active and listens to the community. Check out gameplay from a year ago to see just how far the game has come in a short time.\nVery free form in how you manage your store. There's no 'right' or 'wrong' way to play.\nTons of items to stock, with more being added with each update.\nSkill point system with lots of things to unlock.\nAfter the first hour gameplay gets very hectic.\nA few different mechanics for acquiring items to keep things interesting.\nThe graphics, while simple, are charming and the game has a good sense of humor.\nCons    The UI and some of the mechanics are still a bit rough.

Runs well enough on my GTX 760, but not as fast as you would think for a game that looks how it does.\nJust to briefly comment on some of the negative reviews I've been seeing. If they have less than an hour of playtime, I would take them with a grain of salt. The first hour of game play is not at all representive of the game over all. Also, people seem very hung up on the "Early Access" label being removed. The thing is, the developer isn't saying that the game is 100% done, just that there's enough of a core game here to justify an actual release. Given that there's been 2 post launch updates in less then 24 hours there's no indication that they are planning on abandoning the game anytime soon.\n\nIn conclusion, if you can overlook some of the rough edges there's a ton of fun to be had!","May 22","true","68.6"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","54","58","0","1"

So for now I cannot recommend it. If the features I list below are implemented in a way, I would gladly recommend this game. ADDITION (3/19/2016): even after the updates the game still feels very much the same as it did months ago on release, the devs has added some interesting and cool “fluff” along with nice real additions, but a lot of core issues remain that fail to make the game interesting, emphasizing point 2.\n\nI know this is a very early access game  (its reported as late beta? I hope not)  but here’s what I see needs to be implemented, because in my opinion in its current state this game is a thumbs down. I really love the idea and art style of the game and I hope a dev sees this and will actively add features to the game.\n\nMy list of fundamental things that need changing or implementation:\n1. People shouldn’t constantly drop dirt. It’s annoying and makes no sense. Dirt should accumulate over a longer time so the player can clean it up during down times.  This has been fixed its far less tedious\n\n2. A way the player can be a cashier: npcs shouldn’t just magically pay when they pick up an item. They should browse and find something they like. A way for the player to que up and collect gold from npcs is needed. This will remove the massive headache of thieves looking like normal customers and can allow for more sneaky thieves you have to watch out for.  In its current state if any items are anywhere near the door it’s really terrible.\n\n3. Slow down the pace a little. Too many thieves and constantly having to sweep dirt makes the game a pain to play.  game is slower now, maybe a bit too slow, needs tweaking.\n\n4. A price tag to change prices faster, or a price sheet in the back with all items and an easy way to change prices, along with dynamic prices due to a simulated out ide world.  ADDITION: the prices carry over now, but the percent based system is tedious and unintuitive, and really using the plus and minus keys? Also customers get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a 5 gold profit? Most stores sell for 200% or more profit, pricing can use some tweaks.\n\n5. Please focus on the free mode, the scenarios should be short tutorials, nothing more.\nThe games seems to be moving in this direction.\n\n\nHere’s my list of suggestions:\n1. More hirable npcs. Cashiers and security guards would be very useful to hire and add to daily costs while improving efficiency.\n\n2. Specific offers made to order that you can fulfill, for say a party of adventurers that need gear to fight a dragon, you can be commissioned a pack of special gear to fight said dragon. ADDITON (3/19/2016): quests fulfil this somewhat, just add some story.\n\n3. A simulated outside world with daily or weekly news, things like supply and demand, multiple producers with varying quality maybe with daily shipments, not instant.\n\n4. An RPG style upgrade system, with things like STR, INT etc. rather then just a linear skill tree. also skills that affect the store directly, (like traps) should be purchasable as they are tangable things not "skills". This game is obviously inspired by the shop keeper trope found in RPG games.\n\nHere are bugs id like to report:\n1. fix the ragdolls, you probably know about this one, they clip into the roof.\n\n2. scrolling on the main menu is broken.\n\n3. npcs take forever to realize something is free, either make them act naturally or make it so you cant sell things for free.\n\nIn conclusion, in its current state it’s a thumbs down. I’m not going to refund the game because I have hope in the dev and hope they will really listen to the community.\n\nEDIT (8/24/2015): added formatting and removed a bug that was fixed in a recent patch, added some new suggestions. added tl;dr\n\nEDIT (8/25/2015) fixed some spelling.\n\nEDIT(3/19/2016) After playing the game after the recent updates I can say it’s slowly improving but the game still lacks a lot of basic things, I still hate the way customers just magically pick up and pay for items in an instant, they don’t browse or stick around in any way. I’d also like the say that the updates feel like they are adding a lot of fluff to the game, don’t get me wrong I do like some of the stuff they’re doing, the game just feels very weak aesthetically and mechanically,  and it very much still feels like the mediocre release I played months ago. And the memes are kinda cringe just my opinion. Glad you no longer claim it’s a late beta though.","August 23, 2015","false","2.4"," 203 of 299 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","203","299","0","12"

You buy stock for items, choose the price  and profit you will be making from the item, build your shop, sell to customers. Sounds simple enough, but there are a lot of aspects that make the game very interesting.\n\nYou can actually set your prices too high, that way customers won't purchase your items, and sometimes even slap them off their spot. Why? Because they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nOccasionally you'll get a sneaky bugger that thinks they're smart, and they'll try to steal one of your items. If you act quick enough, you can slash at them with your sword, or zap them with magic. All the customers in your shop will run away at this point, but atleast you got your item back.\n\nKeeping your shop clean is also something you need to keep an eye on. All these filthy NPCs don't wipe their boots at the door, so everywhere they walk, they leave filth. You will be inspected every now and again, so it's best you sweep all the dirt, and corpses off of the floor.\n\nThere are a lot of items to buy, each are sought out by differnt types of customers. Commoners, adventurers, mages, etc.\n\nYou can also upgrade your character permanently across all levels with points. You earn these points by leveling up, which is basically by doing everything. You can grab upgrades like "Gain 10% more money from purchases", "Faster delivery of items" or "Anti-thief barrier".\n\nThere are 2 modes to choose from as it is. You can choose "Scenarios" which is almost a story mode. You play one mission, and try to complete the goal set out. For example "Sell 5 leather gloves, 3 studded gloves and 2 mana potions". Each mission has something to keep the game a bit fresh. Everytime you complete a scenario mission, you unlock new items you can buy in the "My Shoppe" mode. This mode allows you to freely build up your shop from the ground up. No scenarios set for you, just you close in the evening, build furniture to showcase your items, and then open up your shop.\n\n\nOverall, the game is really satisfying when you start selling loads of items, or catch dirty thieves.\n\nRecommended!","August 20, 2015","true","8.4"," 56 of 68 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","56","68","9","12"

I love management games in general but so far this one is very slow-moving and unclear.\n\n\nEdited to include more details as requested:\n\nI do applaud the devs for their work and their responses to the issue. I am sure a lot of work has gone into this, but it's not ready to leave early access. To answer the dev's question:\n\nThe tutorials should be built into the actual gameplay. For example, you do have a message flashing over the door of the shop to put down some displays and items before opening the shop, which was good. So I tried to figure out how to do that - I pulled up tutorials, read a little, and it kept repeating things like "use [action] button" or "use [imprint] button", but wouldn't tell you the actual keys to use. I then tried to look in options to find the keys, but they weren't listed - I had to save my game, close it, quit the game, and then from the settings menu look at what key the action key was. I shouldn't have to quit the game to figure out I need to use the "f" key.\n\nThen I purchased some health potions to put on the displays, but I couldn't figure out how to change the price so I could actually sell for more than I had paid. I tried quitting the game again and pulling up key bindings, but it wasn't listed there either. I finally searched and found the same question on the forums - but the answer told me I needed to use numpad + or -. I'm playing on a laptop. I don't have a numpad, and regular + and - didn't change the item price. I tried pressing almost every button on my keyboard but saw no change in item price.\n\nAt that point I quit the game and asked for a refund. There may eventually be a great game there but I don't feel like fighting the UI to try and find it. I will likely look this game up again in a few months and see how it's doing. I wish the developers all the best.","May 20","false","1.2"," 76 of 100 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","76","100","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reggaenomics/recommended/381120/","Reggaenomics","Petro Poroshenko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reggaenomics/","323 products in account","In depth.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is how horrendously poorly it starts off and presents itself. In that first hour of play, I was VERY tempted to claim a refund. I didn't feel any satisfaction in being a shop keeper, I had no idea what I was doing, there was very little in terms of tutorial (a note, text on pages will never be a good tutorial - give me prompts when starting out and you'll convey how to play the game more quickly and easily to the user), and I only had 3-4 customers coming by to buy health potions in the first few days.\n\nThen the second hour hit. Then the window of a refund closed, and funnily enough, so did my desire to claim one. Then the third hour hit. Apparently the fourth has also hit but I have no awareness of that, I was too busy sweeping and restocking. Now it's far too late and I want to sleep, but not before praising the game.\n\nIf you ever wanted to be a retail worker who can brandish a sword and slaughter a thief or even just a rude customer, this is for you. The game is exceptionally good at simulating the busy shop nature. I have to stock so many of these items, but suddenly someone is stealing something, then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ customer throws a shield, dirt is accumulating, my chest pieces are now out, my delivery of swords is in but all of a sudden no one wants swords they want armor, oh someone else is stealing, oh I thought someone was stealing but they were just running after I murdered the first thief now I'm an actual murderer, oh but the gloves are out as well...\n\nThings get hectic. And it's pretty fun gameplay.\n\nAs I implied above, the biggest things to improve are:\n\n• Tutorials that aren't trash. It's so commonplace to put a tutorial at the beginning that having a separate section handle it seems alien. Also a dozen pages of texts does not make a great tutorial. It was enough to get my feet wet but I'd much prefer button prompts in the first day. "Push 1, now left click on the table to place your health potions" etc. It might not feel important, but with the 2 hour window for refunds, you should strive to set a better first impression. Throwing the user into the fray is a game mechanic for some games, but this isn't Dark Souls: Shop edition.\n\n• Better UI. It's a bit of a mess when looking at all the skill pages. Part of the reason starting off needs a better tutorial is the skill pages overwhelms a new player a bit. There's a ton of crap all over the place. It should just be one page.\n\n• Better overall interface. The game feels pretty amateurish. If you've played Town of Salem or some other browser game now on steam, that's the vibe I get. I don't expect triple A menus, design, etc. In fact, I don't expect the devs of this to do anything about it in this game. But it's something for the next game. And I can already tell they have talent mixed with creativity, so this is just a place to improve on.\n\nAs I keep playing, my list of cons grows shorter. But these three are pretty constant for me thus far.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game for a great price. $10 is ideal, but I could see $15-20 for this, granted at that much I'd likely shy away from the game just at a glance. Having played it now and knowing what I'm getting into, I can see a higher price point.\n\nGive this game a try, you'll be glad you did. Really unique idea that's really well executed.","May 23","true","4.7"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","45","51","6","0"

It caught my eye about a month after being Greenlit and have continued to play it since. The developers are consistently updating with bug fixes and quality content. If you were looking for a good example of how to do a Greenlight on Steam right, look no further. The premise is a simulation/management of a adventuring equipment shop which you have started after "taking an arrow to the knee".\n\nPros/Things that I enjoyed:\n\n1. Despite that pesky arrow to the knee, you manage the shop pretty well on your own, theives and all.\n2. Leveling system with perks for becoming the best provider of goods the town has ever seen. And "selling quests", because selling 80 mana potions is no joke and deserves a little xp reward.\n3. Unlockable crafting recipes, items for sale, garden for growing seeds into plants, adjustable profit margins, and an adventurer to adventure for you (give him some proper knee protection, why dontcha).\n4, Shoplifters to help keep your righteous smiting powers sharp.\n5. Assorted shelves and benches for displaying your goods.\n6. Helper bots to help you with certain tasks (though at this point I find them a little more buggy than effective but I am hopeful that this will change as development continues).\n\nCons/Things I don't like so much:\n\n1. Customers becoming irrate and knocking over goods. Firstly because it's downright rude and secondly because retrieving the items from the floor/etc can be a little buggy/glitchy.\n2. Customers tracking so much dirt into the store. Not a big deal but would be nice to have an option to buy a floor mat or have help to clean.  I also think that while it is a nice mechanic to have to repair the displays, they degrade sooo fast :/\n3. Still has the occasional (often funny or just buggy) glitch, but still not final release so there is that. I almost did not mention this because the devs are so good and consistent with patching these things in a timely fashion and do actually listen to the community. But it is here because you should expect to see some bugs/glitches.\n\nHonestly I can say this is one of the many Early Access games I have decided to take the plunge with and not once have I regretted it. In my option this game is worth every cent and I cannot wait to see the full release! I've spent a bit of time on the game, and cannot believe how easy it is to I am very pleased with the direction the devs have taken this and look forward to each new update!","January 24","true","49.7"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","38","40","5","1"

After setting up shoppe in a little quaint town, you soon find out that everyone is Pigpen from Peanuts. As you follow around every customer walking into your store, you try to sweep away all the grime left behind because it ruins the appeal of your shoppe. To no avail, the dirt never stops and neither does the sweeping you will have to do.... (Thanks to the devs for reducing the dirt intake of customers, so the tale above is just a horrible memory.)\n:POSITIVE ASPECTS:\n-Animation that isn't too complex, but complements the style of the game.\n-3 skill trees to level up your shoppe, deliver time, and prices.\n-Customers stealing and barbarians attacking keeps you on your toes.\n-Can strike down all who oppose you or look at you wrong!\n-Customers actually pick up or wear the items they buy.\n-More variation than most game's npcs (add hooded rogue like characters maybe?).\n-Multiple types of swords, spells, brooms, and hammers to buy as you progress.\n-Mideveal/Fantasy style of the game is wonderful.\n-2 game modes. Scenarios (Story line) and My shoppe (manage your own shoppe with no rules!).\n-Building and customizing your shoppe is very flexible in terms of how you can place shelves, tables, counters, etc.\n-You can see your character's legs when you look down and realize why you became a shoppe keeper.\n-Mice appear when your shoppe is really dirty (not very positive, but a cool feature).\n-You can finally walk around outside your shoppe and pursue thieves.\n-Day and night cycles.\n-Sombreros\n-ONLY 7 DOLLARS!!!\n:NEGATIVE ASPECTS:\n-Sword combat is a little clunky. May hit/kill an innocent or damage/destroy a table next to you while stabbing a barbarian infront of you.\n-Npcs are a little stupid and get caught on things like shelving units, tables, each other, and decide to do a moonwalk at times. (Please make Billie Jean play when NPCs moonwalk. Jk.)\n-No Steam trading cards\n-No Steam Workshop (Srsly guys, would be the bomb.)\n:COMMENTS:\nCharming game with so much potential. Can't wait to see how this game progresses over time.

It's good, simple fun. Lots of issues, some can be forgiven, others not so.\n\n6.5/10 - if it's under $10? It's worth it.\n\n** THE BONES OF IT **\n\nOnce you get over the initial (and I have to be honest) clumsy UI this game becomes good fun. Once you tweak the graphics, read the tutorials and adjust the UI slider so you can read anything, this game becomes fun. Once you get past the fact that despite having opened a shop you have to walk the streets to sell your Health Potions to get started, this game becomes fun....\n\nDefine FunAnyone who has ever owned a business or even made sales via eBay knows the thrill of getting your first, then second then third customer. and this game does that nicely.\n\nThere are a lot of upgrades (poorly presented mind) and tiered products that open up your offerings. From leather to plate to wood to Stealth to Wizard.... There is a reasonable number of shelving and display options, also requiring unlocking.\n\nProgression is nicely balanced. Your items become unlocked as your furniture becomes unlocked, and your automated bot systems become unlocked and your earnings allow you to open the shop up... See where I'm going... It's a nice smooth path.\n\nHire a "Champion" and it can be made to do missions to bring back items, some rare. You can grind up unwanted items, loot, even thieves and Barbarians and turn them into higher level, unbuyable items via the cauldron and associated grinder.\n\nYou can plant beets, shrooms and weed and sell them for good coin. You need to repair your furniture, sweep your floors, put in dividers, plants, floormats etc. Upgrade your sword, your hammer and your broom. There are Quests, essentially linked to what you're selling and these unlock "K" points - the currency to gain the unlocks.\n\nThere's a lot to do and you'll be busy...\n\nBUT.....\n\nDefine NOT FunA relentless thief mechanic. You spend a large part of your time chasing thieves, killing innocents and generally upgrading to make your store thief proof - but still they come. Even with all kinds of enhancements and weaponary and markups at 135% you'll be spending 10 minutes of everyday chasing after, killing, picking up and cleaning up thieves. Yep, first few are funny, after that a tedious, mindless chore.\n\nBarbarians. Why? In 56 hours not a single loot drop and not a single reason for them even being in the game. They scare off all your customers, your automated weaponary doesn't kill them (but a thief with a $12 potion is insta-popped) and you can't leave your store running without being there in case they turn up. We can feed them meat to stop them, sure. IF you have a Champion or go trashdiving to find some.\n\nK Points are associated with the game, not the store, so every upgrade you earn in Shop 1 also applies in Shop 2 if you start a second shop. If you reset, both stores lose the points.  If you want multiple players with seperate saves (like my 3 kids) then each have to share the K points earned. This is a damn silly thing and clearly multi-store save was added as an afterthought and the problem wasn't even considered.\n\nOnce you reach the point where your Champion is bringing back the rare items to craft the fancy armor/weapons, the number of missions and effort required to make those items makes the point of doing it meaningless. eg: To get a Dragonbone Armor Set made requires a lot of work and good luck and once you do, the value of the sale is about 1/10th the effort. Yep, bump up the price you say? Then the thieves become worse and customers whine and... and... I couldn't be bothered after the first set. Poorly tacked on "feature" hardly worth your time once curiousity is sated.\n\nThe game drops off. No... It totally and utterly flatlines. Once you've opened all rooms, set up all your displays and got the bots to restock (too damn tedious doing it manually - trust me) the entire day is\n\n- Open doors. Stand there watching customers who talk but you can't hear.\n- Fight off Barbarians once a day. Why, why, why? Make it worthwhile dammit!!\n- Continuously clean up the dead thieves your bots kill (forever and a damned day!)\n- Once door closes, let bots restock, then restock bots, manually repair all furniture and...\n- Rinse and Repeat.\n\nBut hey, if you're feeling adventurous, find and empty trash cans and you may get some classy loot.\n\n(NOTE: Title is by a single coding dev, 18 months of work. I wish him well and hopefully his next title will be designed with the END product in mind. Allowing customer generated feature creep and starting with a loose design principle from the getgo is bad mmmmkay?)\n\nEdits: Typos and phrasing.","May 25","true","56.7"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","37","41","6","0"

Now penniless, I sit back in the early morning and wait to see how my luck pans out. No one comes early morning..."It's ok." I lied to myself, "The shops still new, people will surely come, I know I hate mornings too."\n\nAfternoon rolls around, and the streets are now a buzz with villagers going about their business. I then spot a potential customer, he's coming from across the street and he's headed right towards my door. I spring out of my seat ready to greet the gentleman as he walks in. He is walking over to the tables, the tension is palpable...Any moment now I'll make my first sale and have taken the first step to riches.\n\nHe swipes the health potion and runs out the door. My father raise me an honest man, and I hate thieves. I give chase, my sword and lightning spell at the ready. Chasing the thief down the block, dodging innocent bystanders, I see an opening...I raise my hand and an arc of lightning fires from my palm, vaporizing the thief, leaving a pile of scorched bones and the health potion...\n\nI pick up the health potion and glance around, no one seems shocked I just killed this man over 13 gold, I'm sure they feel the same way. You can't let people take advantage of you, I'm just a newbie shop keeper and I have to protect myself and my livelyhood. I'm sure they all understand. I return to my lowly shop, placing the health potion I just retrieved from the charred corpse back upon the table it had been sitting. With a heavy heart, I take out my broom and begin sweeping the floor. Unbeknownst to me another customer had walked in while my back was turned. I hear a 'ching ching' sound, and my available gold just increased. I quickly turn, trying to see the face of the man who was just my first sale, but I'm too late to thank him. As he leaves I hear him say "Thanks so much!" I glance over at the tables, the health potion I had retrieved from the thief was now gone.\n\nI smile, and say to myself "You know...I think everything is gonna be just fine."\n\n\n10/10 Would Force Lightning thieves again.","May 27","true","11.8"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","94","32","34","23","2"

More or less of course. This game has the elements of running a business. You don't necessarily have to sell armor and weapons. You can be versatile in your store such as, health/mana potions, arrows, different types of seeds to grow, and the helper bot. There is currently one game mode you can play with and that's called "My Shoppe". Here you basically set up your shop the way you see fit and earn money. Starting the game off is a little slow though as you only have little income and can order potions to start. You can buy some pedestals and sell your potions that way. Eventually you'll earn enough money to buy and sell things at a higher price.  Selling items are easy. Keeping track of what's missing, and when to order them is another thing. Currently in the game you can talk to the customer and see what they are interested in buying so if you have it stock put it out for sale!  Also having to keep track of what items are priced at a level a customer will want to purchase it at is a challenge in itself.  What keeps you on your toes is having thieves who decide, "This is way too expensive for my taste," and then end up stealing your items. Sometimes they get away. If you're quick enough you can ZAP! them with your magic or slay them with your trusty short sword. (ZAP! is my personal favorite). Don't forget about the Barbarians either! As your shop does well you will experiance random waves of Barbarians. Sometimes you get only one. Sometimes you get six. It's up to you to defend your shop. If you're interested in giving yourself a challenge or a "quest" then you can do so! Quests such as "Sell X amount of these certain shields" and earn yourself 1,000 Gold. Let's not forget the Skyrim references in this game!\n\nPros:\n-First Person\n-Clean Player Movements\n-FPS is Stable\n-I have 7.7 hours on it and it hasn't crashed once\n-The UI is easy to read\n-Game handles well to various types of resolutions to fit your monitors needs\n-Various choices of "furniture" for your store (Weapon/armor rack, hat rack)\n\nCons:\n-Save game bug (The worst con of them all)\n*AI pathing is sketchy (Which you can now "reset" their paths by pressing "J") *\n-Sometimes the combat is meh (meaning you look to slay a thief and kill him and an innocent)\n-There's no real tutorial (It's just a menu explaining things)\n\nSo in all these pros weigh out the cons. I believe this game to be fun at it's state and obviously it being an early access game there is much to be added and fixed! They even have a roadmap set up to see what features will come when. Having that save game bug is a downer though. Especially if you binge play one day, and it reverts all your money and most of your object placement progress, but it's alpha and it's a good way to learn the ropes. I reccomend this game in it's current state, and the greatest thing is it's only $4.99! There are plenty of games out there that charge $20 and have an hour of game elements.","September 8, 2015","true","28.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","28","31","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dekk/recommended/381120/","dekk","Bashie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dekk/","399 products in account","This game released only recently so there may be improvements between the time I'm writing this and the time you're reading it. Written shortly after release out of Early Access. I had previously had long paragraphs explaining what's going on with each feature, but I will try to condense this as much as possible. I will write a second, optional part of the review you can read for more detail.\n\nThis is a game I legitimately enjoy, but has too many lingering issues for me to recommend it in its current state. Here are some positives (+) and negatives (-).\n\n(+) Customers: You can have over 1000 unique customers and so far the number keeps increasing, each saves what they are wearing and holding as they buy items. Very cool!\n\n(+) Customization: Shop is very customizable and modular, change shopkeeper look and gender on main screen.\n\n(+) Automation via Robots: These are a godsend as the size of your shop increases, marking each individual spot for restock is a pain but once it's working it makes your job way easier and watching them at work is fun! TIP: Adjust stock bot price in lower right of bot menu, make sure star is highlighted so it restocks marked shelves properly.\n\n(-) Crafting, Grinder and Champion: Use the champion and grinder to get items and crafting rescources. However, it's ultimately not worth the time and money and feels like an incomplete feature.\n\n(-) Gardening: You can unlock a garden in the back of your shop, but it has no real depth or end-game use. There are only three seeds to buy and plant and can't be grinded into anything useful.\n\n(-) Performance: Huge memory hog despite seemingly rudamentary graphics, occaisional fps hiccups. Even on low and with a monster PC. (EDIT: New performance slider added, effectiveness untested since writing.)\n\n(-) UI: Inventory is shown as a 1 block wide vertical bar, you have to scroll a lot and you can even scroll above the 1st item of your inventory. (EDIT: Scroll issue has been fixed.) Some parts of UI are on a wall in the shop or only accessable from the main menu.\n\n-The Fun-: It's what's kept me playing the game despite all these issues. Huge timesink game, sandbox-y with no plot. It's fun watching a huge amount of customers going in and out to upgrade their gear, watching your automated bots take care of most of the work, and customizing your shop.\n\n-The Bad-: Lots of seemingly unfinished features and lack of polish, tons of technical issues, inefficient use of computer rescources.\n\n-The Verdict-: Regardless of all the bumpiness, I've still enjoyed this game. It's just important that you understand what you're getting into and what to expect. As of the time this review was published, I would advise looking into other shop sim games.\n\n----You can stop reading here, but I have more details below.----\n\nCustomization PT.2: Customizing your shop is fun, but it can also be a headache. Even with a fully expanded shop, you will have to manage your space very carefully if you want to fit everything in at end-game. Objects placed on racks and tables have their own individual collision, meaning that a space you could previously pass through is now blocked by an item itself, requiring you to re-adjust your setup. You can shift-click in order to snap tables to a grid, but if you want to keep everything compressed, you'll need to carefully adjust everything pixel by pixel.\n\nCrafting, Grinder and Champion PT.2: The issues holding back the crafting system are multitude. Recipes are very few and very specific. Not only do you need to correctly combine four ingredients, but you have to in a specific order or items are lost. This means there is basically no way you are going to discover a recipe on your own through experimentation, and will have to look at a wiki. There is even an item called a torn recipe page, this has no in-game function (and as far as I can tell does not even have a real recipe on it).\n\nThe second set of issues are difficulty and cost in aquiring these materials, many recepies require huge amounts of a single grinded element, or a rare item that you only have a small chance of aquiring from a champion quest, and then only one at a time. Do champion levels increase number of items gained and chance? I couldn't tell you any difference with a level 20 champ. The items gained from a quest do not come close to covering the costs on sending them out on the quest in the first place.\n\nAll these elements combined with a low price increase for crafted items, they could only be profitable when mass produced, which in most cases just isn't possible. There may be some setups that allow you to grind up ordered items into the ingredients needed, but to know whether or not it's worth it would require a lot of math or looking at a guide for someone who's already done it.\n\nSave Files: Game saves are actually seperated into two different files in two different places. At first glance, everything is saved in the .sk file in your game directory, but that actually only covers the shop itself and customers. Seperately saved is your character profile, which keeps track of data for achievements, bought upgrades like hammers and ALL of your skill points and skills. This second part is kept -in the registry-. So if you wanted to back-up all of your save, you would also have to create a windows registry back up. There is no cloud saving for this title.","May 30","false","58.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

Glad to see I wasn't disappointed. Aggravating customers that like to dirty my shop and throw my wares around aside, its a very addicting little game where the only thing you have to do is run a shop. Simple, right? At first, certainly. But then you get more and more customers in different classes that all need different things. But you only have so much room in your shop right now, because you haven't quite reached that amount of coin where you're able to break down another wall. Obviously, you've got to stock a little of everything.\n\nKeep an eye on your wares, kill any thieves that try to sneak off with your stock, and be ready to deal with aggravating customers that will regularly call you peasant, curse the prices you've set, and fling your items into the air with great abandon. They do it twice if you unlock the right skill!\n\nI'm not sure what the rest of the game will hold, but I'm looking forward to it.","December 28, 2015","true","37.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

"accidently" killed everyone else but not to worry after sweeping up all the bodies and skeletons yes i said sweep, The shoppe was up and running again.\n\nso i finally made some money i was over joyed and pleased with my achievement thinking about what to buy next for the shoppe untill i realised i havent been paying the taxes so BYE BYE money, on the bright side at least i now have an understanding on how the game works i still havent figured out how to jump yet whenever i press space i get a witty comment back "NO!" "You dont know how to jump!" and so on resulting with me spamming the space bar for a good 10 minutes.\n\nnow after all that i did actually play the game and got really into it yes it is early access so there would be a few bugs here and there *cough* getting locked out the shoppe *cough* just dont stand near the shoppe entrance when its closing and i had a random bug when there was customers still in the shoppe after the doors closed which was good for me because it was like a lock in and they all bought something as soon as the doors opened and of course the old corpse going crazy every now and then which is hilarious,\n\nnow a game for £4.99 i really highly reccomend this game its great for all ages and im looking forward to whats to come in the future, there still needs to be a lot of work done to this game and so much more can be added to it.\n\nThank you for reading this far,\n//TehFuzzySheep","September 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 44 of 66 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","44","66","28","3"

If you're into incremental and micro-management type games, I'd recommend it to you. It can be boring after a while if you're not into the genre, but if you are, it's defiently worth the $7.\n\nPros:\n-Variety of items you can sell that different people will buy\n-Popularity of different items fluctuates over time\n-Customers each have a different interest and return to your shop\n-Shop is expandable\n-Lots of furniture and customizability with placement\n-You choose which items to import and resell at what price\n-Somewhat of a skill tree with different perks that you unlock\n-Neat alchemy system by grinding up items you buy into their components and then re-crafting them into something else\n-UI is simple and easy to use\n-Thieves also steal from your shop at some times, you can hunt them down\n-Taxes based on how much you own\n-You can equip your own adventurer with items and send him on journeys to find special items\n\nCons:\n-Graphics aren't bad, but they're not stunning too\n-Map outside your shop is a little limited, customers appear and disappear when reaching map borders\n-Some things are a little confusing, i.e., helperbot\n-Alchemy system gives nearly no hints, although this is fine for some people, you're left basically guessing what the ingredients are as you don't even know what kind of products you can make\n-No buying raw materials for alchemy, you have to buy finished products and then grind them down\n-A glitch and a bug once every now and then, but nothing game breaking\n\nOverall, a fun game if you're into the playstyle and definetly worth the $7 if you are.

(excluding the 3 hours of ingame time of pure sweeping) I am going to present a list of my personal Pros/Cons of this very new game.\nPROS__________\n\n1. Presents a whole new and interesting perspective of gaming\n2. Has manageable scenarios/tutorials that provide challenges\n3. Has a Personal shoppe mode allowing you to create your own store\n4. Takes cognitive work and planning to succeed\n5. Decent graphics/animations on the NPCs\n6. Good graphics for the items and the shoppe itself\n7. Levelling system for your character,\nbased off of how much you sell\n8. The Music would go in my top 5 List of video game music\n\nCONS__________\n\n1. AI is clunky and has trouble with maneuvering,\nwhich can get you stuck with no way out\n2. AI can refuse to accept that some items are free,\nand sometimes treat them asthough they are extremely expensive\nby trashing the items or ignoring them\n3. A little too much dirt left behind by walking NPCs,\nnot too big of a problem, but a nuissance\n4. Barbarians are able to attack through the walls,\nmeaning that some furniture can be destroyed,\nif placed close enough to the wall\n5. A little too easy to level up and needs more skills to invest in\n6. Has a small amount of bugs scattered around\n\nSUGGESTIONS__________\n\n1. Needs more items and more variety (already has a decent amount,\nBut once you're rich it gets lame)\n2. More skills to invest in and maybe special abilities\n3. More of that Sweet Sweet Music\n4. Able to Support the Steam workshop\n5. Able to customize the size and actual shoppe itself,\nE.G the wall colour and shape of the store\n\nAll in all this game is very fun and entertaining for me and it manages to do so in a very early state.\nI am not a picky guy at all really but I have seen people slander the game with less than 1 hour played\nand I just wanted to share my opinion which isnt as harsh as it could be. But do not doubt this game at\nall, its got big things and if this game ever goes on sale make sure to pick it up, because its goin' places.","August 30, 2015","true","19.9"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"

Its great already but for going on playing, there is not enough content for me.\nPlease hurry, bringing more updates :P Co-op would be cool, such as animal breed or monster breed. Shop Assistants, more options for bots, more variety of items, better fighting, competitors, not only quests for selling but for going on an adventure by yourself instead of sending the champion, costumization of your own house, maybe some more depth in defending like monsters and more barbarians and maybe towers you can place outside to defend your shop. Colouring the furniture and walls. Mod-Support would be very important. It makes the game even better and then people are starting to talk about this game. The possibilities are endless with mods and i would be so happy to see some of these features in the future. PLEASE implement them! I would pay for more features because it is one of my favourite games. I want this game and developers to have a great future.\n\nEDIT:\n\nToday was the final Release of the game. The update itself brought just a few MINOR changes, no new content. Out of Early Access?! The game is not finished. Still the same bugs. Even what they promised in their forums like breeding is still missing. There also is still this "contruction site" ingame. It was one the of best Early Access games i've ever seen but now its also one of the worst releases. There is a good negative review, last edited in august 15 i think, which complains about lack of content and the "not finished feeling". This game has no depth in this state. This is still what i think after full release of the game. I am disappointed...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgeezy911/recommended/381120/","rgeezy911","RGeezy911","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgeezy911/","177 products in account","SummaryShoppe Keep is a simulation management game. It puts the player in possession of a shoppe, and gives the player the ability to furnish their shoppe with displays / a small selection of decor, and the ability to sell what they want from a huge collection of items.\n\nAt this stage, the game is not polished but looks good regardless :: For an indie, built by a three person team, it was very well made and can only continue to get better as updates arrive.\n\nProsThe game can be addictive as you play due to the upgrade / skill system. As the player unlocks different displays to use, they can continue to organize and setup their shoppe any way they want. The player can sell whatever they want be it weapons, armors, hats / helmets, potions, or a combination of any.\nPlayers will be put against different factors while running their shoppe. These include deteriorating durability on displays which would require repair, dirt accumulation on the shoppe floor, thieves stealing items, barbarian attacks, and more. These are the things that keeps the player focused and actively managing the shoppe, instead of just standing around and waiting for the day to end.\nThe player is able to customize the way they look and the tools they use while managing the shoppe. Not an important part of the game, but it does add some humor.\nVariety to the looks and clothing of customers for added humor.\nSeasonal changes for some additional variety to the outside town.\nGreat musical score that brings life to the game.\nNeutralsThe ability to craft new items using recipes is always fun to explore for new players. However, trying to guess at the new recipes can be frustrating, as each incorrect guess will consume all items used. If this feature were to be adjusted to be similar to Minecraft's crafting system (where incorrect guesses will not be consumed) it would work out much better. The saving grace is the recipe book. When a new recipe is found by the player, it is saved in the cauldron's recipe book for quick crafting and is extremely useful.\nThe visual quality of the game is pretty good considering a three person team. A lot can still be improved upon and it's not the best that it can be, but it's far from the worst I've seen.\nThe game still has it's selection of bugs, some silly in nature and others possibly game-breaking. Many bugs have yet to be discovered / documented properly. However, with time these bugs can be cleared.\nConsLimited to no ability to mod the game. Many games these days allow for direct community involvement through modding, and some of those games - which are no longer being developed - are only survived by their modding communities. I feel Shoppe Keep would benefit greatly with the ability to be modded easily. It's a big undertaking for a developer to accommodate, but I think it would pay off.\nInconsistent UI. The interface is not well polished, and in need of focused attention. This includes the main menu, in-game menus, the order scroll, champion screen, etc. The main problems are:\n\nTheme - The main menu uses text as buttons and the menus use a transparent background. However, in-game the menu uses text on gradient backgrounds and the menus have a neatly textured background. It's inconsistent.\nOrdering / Structure - Commonly, the "new game" or "resume game" button should be the very first button on the main menu, but in Shoppe Keep it is not. The in-game menu could also use organizing.\nTutorial Tool-tips were rushed. The tutorial tool-tips were a quick way to guide new players into the game, but were not the best course of action, in my opinion. The best solution to this would be to create an entirely new map / world, and force new players to play that map. It would act as a tutorial map that forces the player to do things in order to learn how to play. Once the player is finished, they can start a new game in the "freemode" map, and do whatever they want like normal.\nConclusionI have been with Shoppe Keep for awhile, played many hours of it, and dedicated even more hours into creating a Wikia for it. I enjoy this game a lot, and it's developer really cares about improving the game. In particular, this developer is very active in the Steam Discussions for his game, which is something I appreciate in any developer.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the $10.","May 21","true","127.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

I don't have much to say about the gameplay itself. It started off super boring, I'm sure it gets better over time. The issue I had is that the tutorial is impossibly bad. This game was stone unplayable without a list of controls on the second monitor.\n\nWhile playing in 1080p the tutorial messages were so small on my screen that I didn't even notice them at first. Once I did notice them, I was incredibly disappointed by them. They did not tell you what buttons did what. The first prompt was "Press the action button to travel between your personal house and the back of your shop." What it didn't tell me is what the keybind for the action button WAS, or that I had to press that button while selecting a trapdoor on the ground.\n\nAfter I figured that one out I walked into my shop and it said "Place a display in build mode before you open your shop." I promptly had to google how to enter build mode. The next prompt it gave me was to open my shop. I understood this one, but immediately went "Waaaait, don't I need to put ITEMS on these displays first?" Fortunately, my earlier random key smashing had brought up an order form, and I recalled that the keybind for that was Q. I ordered some health potions and placed them on my tables! Hooray! Success!\n\n"Time to open my shop!" I said. Then I hovered over the potions to realize with horror that I was selling them at cost! My extensive time in terrible retail jobs told me that was a bad idea. I promptly returned to my second-screen wiki control page and found the controls for increasing and decreasing the prices. When I pushed the button to increase the price, nothing seemed to happen. I was confused. But wait! Something is happening! It's increasing the price of my health potion. . 1% at a time.\n\nNow, you might be thinking that there's nothing wrong with that. . But when your health potion costs 10 gold, having to press the button to increase its price 10 times in order to raise the price by 1 gold is pretty damn annoying. It was a death by 1000 cuts. Those 11 minutes did it for me. I'm out. I wanted to like this game.

There's a slight fps drop during the busiest parts of the day, when a lot of customers are walking around, but it's small enough that I usually don't notice or feel the need to lower my settings.\n\nThe UI can be a little clunky and could use more polish, but you get used to it. There is a learning curve at the beginning that can be frustrating (mostly involving the controls). The game would benefit from an interactive tutorial level to ease players into things, in addition to the already present text-based tutorial. I used the wiki a lot during the first few hours of gameplay, which took away some of my early enjoyment.\n\nHowever, once you figure out the controls and know how to switch between game states this is fun to play. There is plenty to do and future updates will hopefully bring even more content and polish to the game. The devs maintain good communication with the playerbase and appear to be open to suggestions for future updates.\n\nIt seems (at a glance) that a lot of the negative reviews only have a couple hours of play time. If I had written my review during the first few hours, it would have been negative too. But again, once you get past the learning curve the game is much more entertaining. I'd recommend new players watch videos of others playing or glance over the wiki before jumping into the game to avoid feeling completely lost.\n\nI did not play this game during early access, so I don't know what the differences are and how the game improved since then, but I do think this is worth the price and don't regret purchasing.

With normal shop games you're left sitting there behind a till buying and selling the dearest items you have and thats the game pretty much done. With this game you have the SPACE and the need to supply all items to the customers, if you don't have it on the shelves you're missing out on big money. Plus the game has a morning - day and evening cycle, once you start growing you will learn to prepare for the onslaught of customers and thiefs trying to clear the dirt and bodies while also keeping the shelves stocked and repaired at all times during the day.  The items you sell most one day is almost never the same for the next so you must always keep on track with what the customers want and prepare a stock so the shelves are never empty. The bigger you get the HARDER it gets to keep everything on track and there is alot to work for and hopefully more soon.\n\nbad things about this game is the tutorial is written and some things aren't that obvious. Go to options and increase the size of the hub so you can actually read the texts that helps alot. Then sit through the tedious task of learning through seeing not doing and that alone can be hard for some. I would suggest a help box that appears to explain things while people play so they can play and learn at the same time, its a game not a lesson. And in a perfect world the graphics could be alot better but realistically its not an issue, also if you swing your weapon dont expect to not hit the guy 4 feet away behind the person you are actually aiming for you most likely will, I advise sticking to zaping them. Also getting a new quest will overwrite the one you are on already you can only get a new one if you complete or give up on the old quest.\n\nAll in all great concept I hope they touch up on a few things and expand the late game alot more and add alot more difficulty to the game. Other than that the game is well worth the money spent on it and I hope the creators keep expanding on this great idea. Although they have many bugs to work on the difference between this and other indie games is these WILL get fixed, noone will give up on a great idea like this not everyone is that lazy.\n\nThings that I would like to see added over time O:\n\n1. Add citizens to the town and events so you feel like a member of a town\n2. House upgrades and furniture so you can customise where you live instead of having it some house you sleep in but don't really\n3. Fishing - every game needs fishing especially one where you can sell the fish its a good feeling catching and selling them prize fish and decorating your shop with them\n4. Marriage O: it's got to be done also allowing this to upgrade certain things for the house and shop\n5. Advertisement - It would be nice to feel the grind of letting the world know your shop exists while you try to control what little money you have also sending adventurers to kill dragons with shop items to make people want that gear\n6. Have a shop reviewer come around and rate your shop 1 start to 10 this depends on how clean the shop is, how decorated it is, the use of high tech equipment and other things etc\n7. Rats were a problem in history why not make them a real problem here add them to the shops at the start and you have to fight to remove them constantly cleaning and eventually being able to buy rat killers and traps to help control it\n8. Add a cost of living to reduce the profit, based on the larger your house is andon who lives there with you meaning you have a goal to increase your profit daily rather than just making more money to buy the dearer things also making the game harder while you try to balance income and expenses which can all go to pot with 1 bad report from an inspector that walks in at the wrong time\n\nThat's all for now QQ","May 21","true","15.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

It will chug once you get a larger store if you have a crappy laptop with integrated graphics, but it will run fine if you have a regular gaming machine.\n\nThe game also isn't balanced yet -- you can get tons of gold without much effort, thought, or risk, although I did have a store wiped out by barbarians once because I wasn't paying attention.\n\nWhat is good about this game is that there's a solid core to it. What made it click for me was designing a store around the different character classes. You can organize it so that one section you have armor and weapons fo rogues, another for wizards, another for warriors, and so on. That makes it easier to figure out what you need to restock while also making it look more interesting. That aspect is solid right now and will hopefully be built upon. More cosmetics and more gameplay impacts from layout and item sorting would make it more interesting to play.\n\nThe other neat thing is that you actually get to see your customers getting equipped as you improve your store stock. They start out looking generic, but they eventually grab whatever the best armor and weapons are for their class. The game does track their names and inventories, but it's kind of finicky to get the interface to show up.\n\nSome caveats are that the game really needs more pressure on the player. Something like a debt mechanic, timed scenarios, more brutal invasions / calamities, more effects of having well-equipped customers, inventory decay, inventory weight, maintenance costs to repair objects, custom difficulty levels, or price fluctuations could improve this a lot. The UI also needs to be improved a lot -- particularly when you're carrying a lot of inventory and crafting something.\n\nI'd recommend this if you're interested in testing it out and the concept sounds fun to you. It's a good simple game to play while listening to podcasts or lectures as it is right now.","October 29, 2015","true","10.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's a mix of tycoon and simulator, and a well done one at that. It's got a warm, friendly 3d environment with lots of space and an open building mechanic. There are some things in the building hinting to future updates, and there is a slight lack of content, but I'm willing to look past it as it's in early access. You buy and place down obects to put your products on, and people come in and buy them. You set the prices and they buy based on them, so if you are trying to sell health potions for 90 gold each, you won't get any sales at all, but if you sell them at 1 or 0, your store will be flooded with people but you will loose money. You also get taxed based on how much you sell, and the more you sell the more specail points you get for upgrades. When people walk in, they leave a dirty trail to wherever they go, which is unappealing to customers. There are lots of little mechanics like that and it makes this game just a little gem. As of now it doesn't have TOO much content but it does have enough for maybe 30 or so hours of entertainment. From the theiving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that you have to kill, to the arrow in your knee when you look down, I rate this game an 8/10.

I really hope to see more and more features added, because this could be one of the better games I've played in awhile. Definitely worth the asking price for an "Early Access Game."\n\n[10 Hours Played Edit]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame is smooth for the most part there are a few times when you get a small amount of lag, but for the most part it's lag-free. The graphics aren't amazing, but they're definitely good enough. The mechanics in the game are sound and for the most part I have no Issues with them. I would like a better looking interface in the future, but that's a pretty small con at this point. The only thing that I really want to see improvement on is the town itself.

And, while the game could have used a bit more polishing before release, it has alot of content (especially for a 10 dollar game). It starts out very slow, however if you wait out the first few days by selling to people on the streets, you'll have a bustling buisness in no time! The game has its flaws, as mentioned in other reviews, however if you enjoy a casual and relaxed game, you will adore this.\n\nInteresting facts and Tips:\n1) The fire, ice and growth potions are seasonal, so in the first ten days, you wont be able to sell ice or growth potions.\n2) Scrolling the mouse wheel shows alot of different furniture types (i spent alot of time wondering why i could only use stools)\n3) The skills page has multiple tabs (This is how you can increase the items you are able to buy)\n4) You can kill good customers so dont shoot a thief with others in the way.\n5) You can customize your main charachter in the main menu.\n6) The game saves after each day when the doors close (Hitting "save shop" will not fully save the game!).\n\nOverall the game is great, it is fun, relaxing, and quite addictive. You just have to get past the first few days to have fun! Its totally worth the price considering what most games cost nowadays, and the devs are still activly working on it, so its not done yet. The devs are also very responsive to the community and fix bugs often.\n8.5/10\n\n*Note there is an occasional glitch when reloading a saved game where you lose everything in your hand, and some of your money.

Everything is great so far for an Early Access, not enough content for a full release to keep the player occupied. I still bought it and do not regret it. It's enjoyable.\n\nThings I would suggest:\n- Keep the game playing while alt+tabbed. I wanted to browse the web on my second monitor while my shop was gathering customers (upgraded security deals with most of the potential thieves), but apparently when you alt+tab the game pauses. It should be optional whether you want the game paused when unfocused or not.\n\n- Scenarios take ages. I just want to hop in and start a shop through "My Shoppe" (free mode) with everything unlocked. I don't want to labor through hours of Scenario mode (similar to campaign mode in other games) just to unlock items for "My Shoppe." My Shoppe should have everything already unlocked.\n\n- A counter where the player can be a cashier rather than running around and having the NPCs automatically pay for items would be great.\n\n- Longer delay for the pop-up messages (top right).\n\n- Game *could* (more of a personal issue rather than a suggestion) use more action by the player. Gather your own wood to sell in the back? Have an actual backyard to plant stuff? Raise cattle by feeding them grain (which you buy) and then slaughtering them in order to sell meat and hide? Things to do while you're waiting for customers to buy stuff or during closing time.\n\n- Closing time would be a great thing to include along with rush hours and everything instead of a forever daylight.\n\n- Signs, advertisement, etc.\n\nJust basically look at other shop management games and modify it.","August 24, 2015","true","6.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

It's a lot of fun, especially for an early access game.\n\nIt's a very fast paced game. Now, you might be wondering, "What!? A game like this doesn't look fast paced at all...", but it is. You need to keep restocking items to keep up with your customer flow. You have to repair all your displays. You must sweep up all the dirt on the floor or customers will not like it. And, when a thief steals your health potion, you have to have a fast reaction time to take them out or they'll get a nice potion and you'll get some nice dust.\n\nAll in all, though this game is a little bland at the time, theres still a good 10+ hours of gameplay in it, not to mention it's still in early access.

I like to keep an open mind though, and decided to check this game out after stumbling onto a random YouTube let's play. I bought this game two days ago, and now I'm hooked.\n\nPros:\nBuilding, planning and expanding your store is fun and intuitive\n\nThe mechanics as a whole are very flexible, allowing you to run any sort of shop you could want (keep it small and easy to manage, grow it into a gigantic profit factory, evil company that murders it's customers for crafting materials, etc)\n\nManages to accurately recreate the retail nightmare of dealing with horrible people that leave your store a disaster area, while still keeping it fun (because now you can murder them)\n\nClosing your shop at the end of the day and giving the player all the time they need to clean up and prepare for the next day is a great way of keeping it from getting too hectic, and allows for a well-deserved breather (seriously, it can get NUTS once your store gets big and popular enough).Cons:\nIt's a bit unstable right now (I've noticed a weird effect where the game loses more and more stability while the store is open. It's perfectly stable if you've just launched the game and the store is still closed.)\nThe game is stiill fairly early, and there's plenty of ways the devs could take it. I'd personally like to see more ways to expand your store, more helpers to hire (cleaners, or bots that replace items that customers knock over), and just more content in general. Being able to walk around town, talk to people to see what they want, and even set up advertisements would be great too!\n\nThis game is still fun as hell, even in it's current early stage.

So back to the title screen there you can go play the tutorial or jump directly in the first scenario where you'll have lots of money a great shop and then get murdered by 100 barbarians, great your shop just got rekt everything is gone, but someone wants to help you out so you get some money and some space for objects, your mission: sell 10 of each potion. after that you'll get put in the 2nd scenario and so on, while playing you'll level up and then you can learn skills that help you in various ways, it will end when you played though all scenarios, but you can go out any time and go to the My Shoppe mode where you can like to name says make your own shop without objectives, you'll start with some money after that you decide what is going to happen, clean, build furniture, buy items, clean, set prices, clean and so on.\n\nThere are some things I need to put here because they either bother me or I really like.(aka skip to the end if you don't want idea listing and bugs)\n\nCleaning: While it's not really bad that it's there later in the game you don't have time to do so because you have so much to do.\n\nHelper Robot: While yes he is helpful against thieves and good at picking items he is not able to Restock, clean and fight barbarians.\n\nBarbarians: They come most often in 3 man packs when you are in the starting time later there will be a boss barbarian and so on, while I like the idea of them they are not as good implemented as they could be. There should be some kind of dungeon defenders vibe going around them with maybe a arena or some pre-shop where you defend your shop against them, that would give them a whole new part in the game.\n\nFurniture: It's good and all that they can be destroyed by the barbarians but why the items!? Items don't destroy your furniture just because you put em on the table. Also the placing needs some better work since you cant put things symmetrical without being a god or something, maybe a grid or something, to that you should be able to move furniture after you place it since I can do that in real life just find I have arms and legs.\n\nMushrooms: while they are op as ♥♥♥♥, they suck. You plant them and they somehow get stinky when you let them grow for to long but in your inventory they don't age. That makes no sense.\n\nCrowds: you can land between about 20-30 npcs at once and be ♥♥♥♥ed aka. stuck they will keep on moving and so you can't get out. Don't make small corridors.\n\nPrice-Setting: It's working like it's right now but you should have a menu where you can see all items and set hte prices, not some + - and shift system that doesn't even remember what item had what %, please change.\n\nRPG-system: It's a great addition to the game, but lacks content.\n\nSaving: In the My Shoppe mode you can't save whenever you want and when you end a day it almost never saves(for me) I played a game got 20k profit in the end of the day and lost all due a bug where I couldnt start the next day (the door stay open bug) meaning I lost the whole day and somehow even more. please fix. I can't play like this lost my whole shoppe mode.\n\nFloor-Mats: Yes they are great no more cleaning but they can be destroyed by barbarians and your sword.\n\nSword: It feels as if you never hit what you want but you'll always hit furniture breaking it in almost 1 hit so you cant really fight against barbarians because you don't want to break your shi*\n\nCustomise: Since now you can customise your char you get better tools but to be hones they are cheap. Very cheap and it feels like they are just there to be there, I really hope it will be updated and also made more expencive since they just feel so cheap and not like something you need to make a clean decision if you want to really spend your money on the tools.\n\nNow some things I would like to see:\n-Some way to auto-restock\n-A map-editor or modding support\n-more potions (expensive)\n-more and different shops (having the ability to manage 2 or more shops at the same time)\n-a real garden\n-the barbarian arena or something like that\n-more weapons to use like new magic's swords etc.\n-more skills for combat, cleaning etc.\n-the price list.\n-a Invaders incoming sign or something like that, every npc has magic sense's when they come I want that too.\n-Jumping.\n-a reason to play the later scenarios, like an achievement or something.\n-optimisation. I wont be able to play the game longer than the first few days after that I get 1 fps.\n-Money-Balancing, add something that gives the player a reason to have 100k at one time because all the items aren't holding long enough and the profit is to big so you just sell the best items and it takes 5 days to be at the max of everything. give us expencive ♥♥♥♥ for lategame that are worth about 1-20k !\n-after bigger shops you don't want to keep yourself to look at the entrance all the time so maybe adding a camara that is placeable or a magic portal connected to your had with a pitboy of sorts would be awesome.\n\nHere comes a Bug-list:-You can kill a barbarian before he gets in your shop causing him to be out of reach for cleaning.\n-NPC's can get stuck in a helmet rack causing in after shop modi the doors not to close and the tax time to go on. EDIT: Also causes the game to not go to the next day anymore making it a gamebreaker Please Fix!\n-after you exit the game steam doesn't get that you went out of it.EDIT: Only for some people\n-npcs get stuck at furniture also causing them not to get out when barbarians are attacking.\n-barbarian can't get to the back-room causing the first level to be a barbarian farm level where you can also get the barbarian achievements.\n-floor carpets cant be sold and things can be placed over it but where the carpet is nothing can be placed for sale\n-In main menu musik plays at the basic volume causes ear aids.\n-sometimes you unlock all levels at random. (Intel by a friend)\n-Turning off Edge Detection ingame dosen't work\n-NPC's sometimes slide across the floor\n-NPC's are in the floor with theyr shoes\n-You can build in the pillars\n\nIn the EndAs much as i would love to say this game is mega awesome I cant because the my shoppe mode is to short and the upgrades to op, when you can set everything on 150% and spam your shelves with stacks of gloves, and tables full of mage robes with armor raks full of lots of 350 armor and a moneystack of 30k+ and nothing to do.\nIt also does just the same amount of bad as it does good but the idea just keeps it alive, its nowhere near finished and thats good, becausethat means the community has the chance to change it to be one of the greatest tycoon games out there!\nAlso you get more hours than the price and it's still really cool 9/10 when you consider the price.\n\nDont judge the game whithout having the one week achivement in My Shoppe or else you didn't see the whole game!\n\nNow that I have written this ♥♥♥♥ twice im finished with it for now. I'll update this whenever there is something I want to add or an update came out. Please give me thumbs up so the developer can read it :)","August 27, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Shoppe Keep may be early access, but it's the most interesting casual management sim I've played in a long time. It's a fairly unquie concept, and the designer has a classy sense of humor. Despite a few minor bugs which I'm sure will be resolved long before release, it's a solid game that's well worth the price. As a first generation PC gamer, my golden rule is an hour of play for every dollar spent is a solid gaming investment, and Shoppe Keep delivers.\n\nBugs aside here's a few cons over-30s should be aware of:\n- The wife and I agree: musical score is great, but becomes a bit repetitive. Get your ELO records out.\n- The character advancement needs refining, and a lack of speed controls make for long days at the shop.\n- Late game is a bit dull at this point in development.\n- Personally, I had a bit of difficulty figuring out which items went with which display so it could be sold, but I'm a trial by fire kind of gamer, and dove in head first. A few minutes of reseach could save you this frustration... or it could serve to motivate you like it does me.\n\nRating: Worthy of my review.\n\n\n\n","October 6, 2015","true","13.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The very dirty costumers either buy or stealing your goods. If they steel you are allowed to wipe them from the world or jail them with abilitys, which you can upgrade. You currently have 6 options, which is shoppekeep, Using broom, hammer (repair), combat with sword or magic, clock and build. These options will allow you to run a shop and ordering items, as well letting costumers see the dark rest of their lives.\n\nThere is a questlog (scenario) from having a whole shop, till you get rekt by barbarians and building your way up. There is currently 19 scenarios to play, so there is enough time to learn to be a experienced shoppe keeper and hiding dead barbarians like a professional Hitman.\n\nIf you like the idea of running a shop, ordering items, cleaning and killing your costumers when they either steal or is never taking a bath, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l2E7oSz75g","August 22, 2015","true","3.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","3"

It was a tough beginning but it wasn't hard either -the adventurers seemed to accept most of the things I offered them, maybe because I'm the only merchant in  that part of  the city.\n\nManaged to save some money to sell arms that I ordered from my magical scroll, somewhat similar to a modern day tablet. Business was good until the barbarians decided to visit. Of course the barbarians ignored all the other buildings in the city and every other heavily equipped adventurers, that all feared the barbarians presumably because they run around topless showing their ripped upper torso and also the rad tattoos they had on their faces. I whipped out my sword on my left hand and a magical zapping thunder bolt on my right hand, you know, the standard issue for shopkeepers everywhere. The barbarians started mauling on my display tables and I was busy slashing mice on my shop floor until I realized eventually they're only vulnerable against the mighty broom. Killed the two barbarians and I stood amongst the rubble and mice, pondering of methods to end my life.\n\nI checked my magic scroll/ancient-modern-tablet and swiped left and decided to give farming a try. I spent half of my money to buy mushroom seeds and hoped my luck would change. Alas, it didn't, the mushrooms were harvested a moment too late and were useless, perhaps because preservatives weren't yet invented at that time. In desperation, again I consulted my scroll and spent the remaining of my money... On weed seeds...\n\nI watched closely as they grow, spending no second without them in my sight. As soon as they riped, they were transferred from the garden to the streets. I went from street corners to alleys offering anyone I passed by. The warriors, with their warrior's code and all, doesn't seem to be interested. The more contemporary mages however... Let's just say if they were programmed to buy multiple items of the same type, they'd buy it all.\n\nI bought more seeds to plant which were sold as fast as before, if not faster. I thought to myself "maybe this is it..." as I harvested a new batch. Soon enough I could afford a shelf to display my herbs. Soon I had to buy more shelves to display my weeds. Soon I hired robots to display my weeds...\n\nIt felt just like yesterday, or around 15 minutes in real time that I thought of ending my in-game life after a vicious barbarian attack devastated my shop. Now here I am, relaxing in the garden behind my (still respectful) weed-shop, keeping an eye on my next batch of weed as the cash keeps rolling in.","May 29","true","22.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","6","6","4","0"

Less than seven hours after downloading the game there was an update to fix some glaring issue that I hadn't even gotten far enough to know about yet. As I progressed I found out there were issues with the game that I was having difficulties with. A couple days later, those issues were resolved with a patch.\n\nThe development team seems to be actively squashing bugs and interface issues. In addition to that they seem to be interacting with their player base in a positive and constructive way.\n\nMy assessment of the game does not ultimately change from my original review of the game. Provided the team says as active as they are currently this is going to be a very solid title and I reccomend it now for anyone who doesn't mind the issues that come with early access, if you do mind early access.... wait until it is complete but still make sure you get the game if you like management style simulators.","August 24, 2015","true","25.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It's fantasy related, having you sell potions, swords, and armor for adventurers.\n\nThe added touch is that thieves will come steal your merchandise, the added effect of owning a business. You also have the choice of combat, a sword in the left hand, and a spell in the right, deterring thieves who would steal, and killing those who actually took your merchandise.\n\nGood game overall, 8/10.

Well, wonder no more, because Shoppe Keep is here. A game that will make you hate thieves even more and broom will be your best friend. Expected to manage your own shop by ordering a supplies, changing price tags and defending it from little thieves and groups of bandits; you are supposed to be a greatest 'shoppe keeper' in the world.\n\nThis game so far offers 19 scenarios, each of them more challanging then the previous one (obviously). From selling a few potions, to supplying a town for an attack, you will be the one to profit from it all. But it's not that easy. Various people will have different requirements. While one will be poor and wants a simple health potion, rich warrior will want some golden plated shield and you'll have to satisfy all demands if you want to be good.\n\nNot counting on the fact, that you get minimum profit from cheap items and you will not sell expensive items that easily. Oh, and taxes. Yeah, you will be charged with taxes every 5 minutes. Oh! And thieves. People will steal from you. OH! And dirt... People are unbelievable pigs, broom is literally your best friend as I said earlier. Oh, and... Well, you get the point.\n\nAs you sell various items, you will gain XP points as in proper RPG game. Next levels will give you K-points, which you can exchange for different perks. One will give you a 10 % discount for your order, while another will make deliveries come faster or makes an entry fee for your shop.\n\nAfter you finish first (or second?) scenario, you'll also unlock "My Shoppe" (Free Play) mode. In here, you can build your own shop with stands and tables and simply make yourself at home.\n\nWhen it comes to a graphics of the game, there are certainly few things that needs a polishing, but it's quite nice game offering this (optional) cell-shade tint with enjoyable and minimal dubbing along with some sounds that might get repetitive after a while, but it's not a big deal.\n\nShoppe Keeps is not a one-of-a-kind game, but it's definitely a game worth your time and money. It has its idea and it seems that the creators are going the right way. More items, more shop buildings, more detailed options and this might be a great game.\n\nDo I recommend this game? -- Yes.\nDo I think you should wait for a sale? -- Sale for 5€ game?! Don't make me laugh...\nDo I think that this game is really worth your time and money? -- Well... Yeah. And after all, you can always request a refund, can't you? (Please, don't, it's really worth it)\n\nNote: This is an Early Access pre-review of the game. Full review will come after the game's release.

There is so much potential in this game, but it won`t hit you untill you pass the first "what does this button do" hour. I was a bit disappointed too at first when i bought this game (in early access), but after getting the hang of things...it gets addictive ^.^\n\nPROS:\n- the music. It is amazingly catchy. Be sure to unlock the vinyl thingy, which will allow you to listen to all the soundtrack\n- the super fast response time and availability of the developer team. They indeed seem present and interested to communicate\n- the barbarians system (some kind of hoolingans that will start attacking your shoppe just cuz they can) Not only their numbers increase over time, but there are some funny types of bosses spawning around\n- the thieves system. Honestly, being able to fry/chop/slash into tiny bits a pesky little thief that dares to steal your hard-earned merchandise? 11/10\n- the time management/shop management/dungeon hunting/fantasy-medieval idea - the only other game on steam that fits these shoes (that i am aware of) is Recettear, so if you are a fan of this type of games, this is a huge plus\n- the price. It is well worth it. If you expect to receive some super top polished game for 7 $ then... you aren`t living in the real world, i can tell you that. Only the soundtrack is worth almost that much ;)\n- (this one can also be a minus, depending on preference) tin-man type of characters\n\nCONS\n- maybe the leaving early access was a little rushed, minor bugs here and there\n- no true tutorial phase\n- no access to the key bindings from the playing interface (Edit: fixed with a recent patch)\n- limited hints and tips. If you don`t check the wikia before starting to actually play, you will find yourself starting a new game over and over, as you uncover what this and that button do. (Edit: partially fixed with a recent patch)\n- adventuring takes awfully long, so if you intend to grind for specific reagents in order to craft some fancy equipment, brace yourself for a loooong journey (Edit: time required diminishes drastically after your champ reaches higher levels)\n- very limited options for customizing your char\n- no "rush time" option\n- no way to identify a customer by class unless you hover over him (which is very tricky during rush hours, when the customers are roaming the streets)\n\nAll things considered, I would say a solid 8/10, with a lot of room for improvement and a lot of potential. If the devs continue to constantly keep in touch with the community and working to add new features, I am sure this game will get better and better.\nI would advise to give this game a chance and keep in mind that the dev team is very small.","May 21","true","52.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

Sometimes that makes the corpse unremovable\n- Sometimes the green circle while picking up stuff just stop while picking up\n\nSome suggestions for further Versions:\n\n- How about a real city where you can walk around and buy stuff you can sell in your own shop.\n- Diffrent shop styles like a brewerie and a smith and a clothier or something like that.\nThe smith could buy minerals and create his own weapons and sell them.\nThe others would do the same with their diffrent products\n- Thieves should be rarer but stealthier. You can easily spot them because they try to run pretty obvious\n- Something like a cashier or something its ab bit weird how they just give you the money through magic\n- Natural acting NPCs. They just stand in front of shelves for 2 minutes or so\n- A feature to buy bigger shops or just some ground and build up your own shop from scratch\n- employees: Cashiers, Security, guys who fill the shelves the way you tell them, puplicity people.\n\nGood things:\n- Cute Graphics\n- brilliant idea and concept(reminded me of  Dragon Quest: Chapters Of The Chosen Ones)\n- simple controls and quick learnable gameplay\n- skyrim references\n- Banana for scale in the backroom","August 24, 2015","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

But wouldnt pay more than it is now until there is more content or features.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n\nI havnt played too much of this game in case i might refund but so far its... different.\n\nLet me start by saying the gameplay is really solid; you take on the role of a shopkeeper, you know those ones that you visit in skyrim and never think about? The ones that could be struggling finacially; or have up to their neck in tax or customers that steal from YOU?!\n\nAnyway you take on the role of this person and you have to manage your shop, deal with theifs and customers that dont put items back where they belong when they are done looking at them. You start with hardly anything and build an empire upwards.\n\nThe gameplay is well structured and has a little amount of glitches at the moment; although there have been some glitches like when ive looked outisde my store and noticed NPC's walking through another stores steps and when customers are browing how i seem to hover above them when they walk into me. These are little fixable annoying glitches but can be sorted probably.\n\nThe most annoying bug is when customers are browing and seem to get stuck between furniture and display areas; this then ensues that they dont leave and keep moaning the only way to get rid of them is by switching to sword and scaring off everyone in the store.\n\noverall I would say this game is about 8.5/10 for early access thats great! but until more updates are out it still needs more work.\n\nhere are the pros and cons in my opinion:\n\nPros:\n- Solid gameplay\n- Devs understand where the title is headed\n- Simple and sweet graphics\n- Not demanding on a low end rig\n- easy to understand and play\n\ncons:\n- Little annoying bugs\n- Customers are too messy\n- need more content (there is enough atm but it will definitely need more)\n\nMy ideas for improvement:\n- Bigger better stores to upgrade to\n- being able to walk around the current town and possibly set up branches in different towns/villages/cities\n- more diverce AI (clothing, hair, unique people [possible couples that walk in discussing what they like/dislike to add humour])\n- possibly different types of store to own and have assistants and employees","August 20, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

There is a market cover out in the courtyard with nothing under it im assuming they put it there for future updates but it would be nice if there was a produce vendor there as you can grow crops so it would give you someone to sell them to and also for the other drones walking aimlessly about to interact with for a moment to make the place feel more alive.\n\nThere is no life in game there are no bugs scampering around on the ground no flies and no birds, we have this great big sky with a couple of white lumps stuck in it which i am assuming are clouds and no F""KING BIRDS! i love birds the sky and the world would be so boring without them.  When you stock a variety of items many adventures buy from your store and it can get quite crazy as some customers buy some throw your goods on the ground and others steal so you have to keep an eye out but i find myself even with all this pulse pounding action going on longing for something to happen, there are all these adventurers around so why dont a plague of rats enter the courtyard that they all fight and you can join in aswell and then sell rat hides to crafters and maybe even pilfer your goods back off the bodies of dead adventurers but then it could be more then rats how about seeing a dragon go by in that big empty blue thing at the top of the sky and have that land and start whooping ♥♥♥........ just something..... anything would be nice.\n\nIt sounds like im having a right complain but im just pointing out areas that could be improved on and i have really high hopes for this game... i do enjoy it as it is but i wish it was something more and i understand from the main menu there are only 3 people working on this and its all about finding time to do things.  Really looking forward to future updates i just hope they push the boundaries a bit but firstly at least give the guys and gals different hairstyles and walking animations.","May 26","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Trying to get the next shop upgrade will keep things hectic for a while.  There's not a lot to do in the late game though.  By then you should have nearly everything except ordering automated giving you time to sell directly to people instead of keeping your shop running smooth, but leaving little else to do besides hope for a barbarian attack so you get a chance at a rare item and sending your champion out.\n\nIt's neat to see the villagers eventually come walking by with better and better gear as time goes on, but eventually some day they'll decide that despite paying 1000s of gold for equipment, that 15 gold potion is worth risking their life for and will steal it prompting a lightning blast that ends their life.  It's rare you'll see anyone sporting the full set of any of the higher level equipment because they have so little sense of self preservation.\n\nAlchemy is a great addition too, but unfortunately typically results in you hoarding ingredients until a quest comes along that you can use them for.  Some ingredients don't have a reliable method of getting a large amount of (Such as gold vials/bars).  As such you're unlikely to be able to stock gold armor as a shop item reliably.  Though you can get mihr needed for the enchanted items fairly simply through mana potions.\n\nThe game is fairly solid otherwise but needs a bit more to keep you playing.  New shop locations/items/milestones would go a long way.","June 1","true","38.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I find that with every update they do the gameplay just gets better and better.  Menus are more fluid, things dont dissapear anymore, you could use the bot to pick up stuff that fell through the ground also they no longer get stuck.  The one thing i have to say is you are getting your moneys worth when you buy this game. Its an early access and the creators are constantly coming out with updates and new features almost every week which is far better than any other early access game ive played so far.  costmers feet still kinda dissaper into the floor sometimes kinda funny but they no longer get stuck if that does happen wait till build mode is available and build something where they are usually gets them unstuck.  but all around if they keep up the updates theyve been doing so far this game will be very  polished deffinate recomendation if u like sim games with a little action in it","March 31","true","315.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Sweeping should have to be done often when you have a lot of customers, but there's no reason you should have to walk behind someone constantly sweeping like some sort of reverse olympic curler.\n- Build Mode - Make it so that you can move furniture you've already placed. In real life you don't sell your $250 shelf for $3 and re-buy the exact same shelf just because you put it in the wrong spot in your house.\n- Prices - An easier way to adjust prices, so that you don't have to pick up 30 potions and put them back down just to change the price from 2g to 3g.\n- Ordering in bulk - instead of clicking on a potion 50 times to order 50, a little quantity box would be great.\n- Perhaps a way to adjust your security forcefield? If I'm making bank, I really don't mind if one guy steals a 2g profit potion every once in a while. If the gate only stopped them if they were trying to get away with an item that would net a certain amount of profit (that you set), I think that would be nice.\n- Some female NPCs? Its really kind of eerie that I get hundreds of customers every day but not a single one is female.\n- And of course, a way to customise your shop; decorations, different color schemes and furniture types, wallpaper/paint, flooring, etc.\n\n","August 24, 2015","true","0.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The more you sell the more you have to pay attention to things like thieves(bad) and mushrooms (good). You cant simply walk away from the game and expect to make a bunch of money because all your items will sell/be stolen. There is nothing in the game that allows you to automate the selling of items which is good and keeps the game going. You also have to clean your store and protect it from bandits who only come in to destroy your shelves and what not.

Sweeping should have to be done often when you have a lot of customers, but there's no reason you should have to walk behind someone constantly sweeping like some sort of reverse olympic curler.\n- Build Mode - Make it so that you can move furniture you've already placed. In real life you don't sell your $250 shelf for $3 and re-buy the exact same shelf just because you put it in the wrong spot in your house.\n- Prices - An easier way to adjust prices, so that you don't have to pick up 30 potions and put them back down just to change the price from 2g to 3g.\n- Ordering in bulk - instead of clicking on a potion 50 times to order 50, a little quantity box would be great.\n- Perhaps a way to adjust your security forcefield? If I'm making bank, I really don't mind if one guy steals a 2g profit potion every once in a while. If the gate only stopped them if they were trying to get away with an item that would net a certain amount of profit (that you set), I think that would be nice.\n- Some female NPCs? Its really kind of eerie that I get hundreds of customers every day but not a single one is female.\n- And of course, a way to customise your shop; decorations, different color schemes and furniture types, wallpaper/paint, flooring, etc.\n\n","August 24, 2015","true","0.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I ask you please to rest your but and listen as I tell you about this wondrous game!!! Not only is this a game where you own and manage a shop. This is also a game where you give quests instead of taking them!!! Though the person I give quests to (begnaud) can't even come back from a single quest alive despite being equipped with the most state of the art equipment in the game so far FREE OF CHARGE but that lazy bone head can't complete a single quest. But that's ok cuz I'm rich and paying him is like giving a beggar on the street a quarter. You don't need to do it but your a better person if you do. Also those pesky barbarians, despite trying, cannot get past the front door. And the teifs can't get back out the front door. Unfortunately there is no way to buy the subraro off that stuck up lameo and you can't order them yet but i'm sure it will happen eventually.\n\nI have spent 7 hours on this game so far and I don't regret a millisecond of it. I tried live streaming the game and some of games don't work well with OBS but this did!. It worked great! I recommend all of you buy this game before it gets more expensive. It is being updated and worked on and though there are things I want fixed/added/changed its fun as it is now too.","October 28, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That is probably a fair assessment.\n\nThat particular negative is at least partially balanced by the $10 price tag, the great developer communication in the forums, and the updates which continue to come in.\n\nWhen you add the actual fun /of the game itself/, I believe the game comes out clearly in the "recommended" column.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the game develops over the next six months or so. In fact, if I had to give a current criticism of the game, it would be that it is not balanced well. On the other hand, they have been tweeking this. Recently, they nerfed the strongest items in the game, which I definitely agreed with. That was a big help. It did not make sense that they were as strong as they were. But, without going into unnecessary detail, there is still some work to be done there, I think.\n\nTo put this review simply, if the idea of running a store for adventurers, and occasionally gardening/hiring an adventurer/beating back barbarians seems fun to you, and you don't mind a game that is continuing to shape itself, this is for you.","June 5","true","47.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I mean it seems to be good, the concept seems rather nice. The main purpose of the game is to manage store in an fantasy world, an RPG one in fact to where you offer items to commoners and heroes. Though It doesn't sound that hard of a job to do such an thing unless the heroes go and act like the kind of heroes that players tend to be, those kind to which mess everything up for fun or even steal something out of plain view. You will feel the pain of an typical RPG Shop clerk, having to reorganize your wares, keeping an close eye on your customers, and also have to beware of barbarians who occasionally pay you an visit to ransack your store. Yet, I know I make all of this sound like something that could be an pain, but it's actually quite fun in my opinion.\n\nAs you progress through the scenarios in the game, you get level ups that allow you get bonus things that will help you out along the way and may unlock things from the missions. Also from the start of the game, you have in your possession an sword and an lightning spell that allows you to humorously take care of your thieving heroes and bloodthirsty barbarians, all while you are protecting your wares. The "combat" seems quite good and easy, though mainly with the greedy thieves, but difficult with the barbarians.\n\nThere is even an freeplay mode which allows you to completely manage the store (Yet, I don't know if you can change the style and structure of the entire store, maybe it will be possible in the future.), which you lay the display containers where ever you wish, though I would strongly advise that you keep them away from the door until you have no choice or your thieves will make an quick escape. Also I did mention that you unlock things in the scenarios, did I? Well, these things are usually new items to sell that will give you more profit. The difficulty for freeplay mode will increase as you proceed.\n\nI will have to say that game is pretty decent for it's concept and current price, though I look forward to more improvement in the future. This game reminds me of an game "Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale" in it's current form except you don't kill your customers in it for an Health potion and the heroes are kinder than in this game. When I get the time, I may even make an video of this game once sometime has passed by. Currently, I haven't yet found any bugs within the game. This game is worth an look into for those who love management and trading games especially those who know of the cutesy Recettear game. The game only cost about $5, an pretty good price for an early access game like this.","August 20, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The low-poly graphics aren't up everyone's alley but it's style is a breath of fresh air (at least for me).\n\nI'm...I'm honestly not sure why I love it so much. The graphics aren't amazing, the UI still needs some work, there's room for more development surely but...there's something about this game that just makes me smile.

Is it the rush I get from nuking theives and then sweeping away their bones because you gotta keep a clean shop? I don't know. I think this game gives me a good nostalgia vibe of the old PC games I played in middle school.\n\nI recommend this game BUT I think it's audience is...very much a niche market right now.

If you ever wished to be the shop master in an rpg then this game is perfect. Performance used to be atrocious but it has became a LOT better. I'm rocking an i5 4690k and a gtx 970 and I have a constant 60fps@Ultra settings since a few updates ago. Devs listen to the comunity and are very active, pushing updates often and all of them are significant for the current state of the game.

While I've played the RPG warrior or mage needing to shop for supples and potions more times then I can count, I've never seen the perspective from the shop keeper trying to earn a little chunk of the advenrturers treasures.\n\nThis game offers almost twenty "quests" as you would call them as they are simply goals that start out easy and progressively get harder.  Each one will tell you the goal such as sell 10 of each type of potion or earn 5000 gold as well as other requirements needed to pass it such as paying taxes every 5 minutes and keeping your shop appeal at a certain level on inspections.\n\nTo make a profit, you must order your goods from a list by simply going into shop-keep mode, then hitting your Q button to bring up a list of supplies to order from.  Once an order is placed, you can then place your items on any of your available tables and racks for display but be sure to change your profit margin as it it set to 100% by default which means you will sell it for exactly what you paid for it!  You can hold down your shift key while pressing the + and - keys to change this rate faster and once you set it, it will stay there for that entire level unless you change it again.  You can also charge a different rate for a specific item or items by changing your rate before placing that item(s) and then changing it back.  It's all much easier then I can make it sound here in words.\n\nThe wizards and warriors who come into your shop will bring in tons of dirt and grime which will quickly dirty your floor and lower your shop appeal.  Lower shop appeal equals less customers and could prevent you from passing a specific level as well, so go to your broom mode on the riht side of your screen and simply left click around the dirt to instantly clean up the mess, and be sure you do this frequently!  Thankfully, atleast for me, sweeping the floor never seemed like a chore or like an annoyance, and in fact it seemed to add to the overal challenge and enjoyment I experienced.  It's hard to describe, but it just works well with this game!\n\nAs a shop keeper, you'll also have to deal with the common thieves that will frequently try and steal your goods, robbing you of the potential income those items could earn you!  You can go into fight mode and slash a sword at them or blast them with an electric charge, but they run fast and in a crowded store, this can be easier said then done!  Because you cannot leave your store, all the thieves need to do is escape the front entrance into the street and they are gone with your goods (and money)!  Thankfully there are items and perks you can earn with your experience that will help you deal with the pesky thieves such as an automatic entrance thief zapper.\n\nSpeaking of experience, it is earned from almost everything you do in the game, and lets you add your choice of perks such as extra profit from items sold to quicker delivery times on your orders and much more!\n\nIn addition to all of these quest style levels in the game, you have a free-play mode where you can simply order and sell what you choose to try and earn mass profits over time.  This game mode is tied to the quests however as the more quests you conquer, the more items you'll have to choose from on the order list in the shop-keep mode.\n\nThere's so much more I could talk about here such as the requirement to go into build mode to take out your hammer and repair your tables or they could break over time and rats that invade your messy store or the raiding barbarians that mess your life as a shop keeper up early on!  Add it all up, and for a $5 USD early-access game, this one truly delivers a ton of value and fun!\n\nHighly recommneded for any RPG fan or anyone who enjoys this unique style of game!  Be sure you check out my review above as it gives a much better demonstration of this game then all my wordy words written in text here!\n\nOh, and be sure you sweep of your damn boots before you step into my shoppe!  Is that how your momma raised you!  {{..Takes out my glowing right hand to threaten electricity up your pesky azz!! }}","August 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

It is an early release game, so expect to have several of them for now (some are hilarious).  The nice thing is that the developers are constantly working on this game and didn't just release to ignore it.  They take feedback seriously and respond to majority of the concerns.  Although there may be some flaws now, they do not take away from the game whatsoever.  Rather, they give the game a comical side and allow for some great screenshots!  The storyline of the game itself is still being developed, so for now it's really a "store sim" which you can gather from the name.

Or do you want to be the person selling to those fools who risk their lives for a moment of fame?\n\nIf it's the latter, you might enjoy this game, one part "adventurer tycoon", one part janitor, and all parts fun, this game is about that most loved (still counts if you love to hate them) role in adventuring, the equipment merchant!\n\nThe game starts out a bit slow, order a few cheap items, sell them for as much as you can get away with, and quickly progresses into the realm of real (mostly) legal highway robbery!  Ah, the life of a merchant, just be aware that even in your little slice of heaven you will still have to deal with the most dreaded of adversaries... customers!\n\nIt's a fun little romp of a title that can be a real time killer, but you may eventually get bored with the "rinse/repeat" (buy, sell, murder a shoplifter) nature of the game as it is right now.

Warriors-druids-rogues-wizards is the 4 type of people you sell to at theis moment, each wanting diff items, and each day period there is a " hot item" which will tend to sell out very fast of it to who ever is wanting it.\nAs you sell more and more each day. you can start selling to other types of people and sellling alot more items. There is 4 parts in the day, build-morning-day-evening each one being 5 min irl time, but build has no time so you wont feel rushed when making the place look nice.\nbuild is where you will edit your shoppe, placeing new item selfs or table, taking down a few weapon racks. and even puting up helper bots.\nmorning is when you start selling and its a little slow as you would think it is even in real life, mainly just for if you have alot of inventory you need to stock and you want to go ahead and have some of the things to go ahead and start getting sold.\nday speeds up a pretty good bit and will have you shoppe packed almost most the time and then you mainly just go around sweeping all the dirt they tend to track in.\nevening is around the same speed as day and is when you should start seeing what all is being bought to know what to go ahead and order for the next day.\n\nPast the selling and such you have a chance of getting attacked by barbarians that will come to just breal you stuff and make a messs of things, then you can get a champ who will go on quests and you stock him up with armor and wepons, and potions. You need to sweep the place and you also need to repair your stuff, after so many things have been bought off of them.\n\nAt the end i see very few bugs and even in e.a. id sugest you buy this game and try it out!\n\n","April 9","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll get the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥y customer, who hates that your Mana potion is sold for 3 Gold, but thats what Helper Bots are for!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterhawk88/recommended/381120/","masterhawk88","masterhawk88","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterhawk88/","119 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me start by saying this is my first review, and everything expressed in this review is a matter of personal taste.\n\nThe game is fun. Living the life of a Shoppe Keeper is a cathartic experience that's nice to wind down after a hard day at work. What really appeals to me is you're not forced to kill enough people per level/day to be classified as a medium sized natural disaster, but you can if you want. There's no rule to say you can't murder all your paying customers as well as thieves. There's a tax placed on you for murdering innocents, but honestly it's so small that ocasionally I started zapping people for giggles.\n\nBuying shelves and placing them is fairly simple, ordering items is also simple. It'd be nice to have a snapping feature so I can place tables and shelves and such end to end with no gaps and agenst the walls. But what I have to say is my favorit thing about this early access release is how much effort the devs are putting in to listening to the players.\n\nFor instance, my two personal peeves in the game were how you had to remove every item from a shelf in order to reprice them, and how customers seem to be mudmen from the plannet swampzilla for the amount of dirt they track in. In a quickly implimented patch, door mats were introduced, which stop customers from tracking in dirt, and it was made so that changing the price of one item changes the ones already placed as well. These are supposidly only temporary fixes with improvments comming as development continues. This shows that the devs are listening and they want this game to be fun.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. It's early access, so there's bugs, missing features, and some things that are just kind of obnoxious at present. The tax system for instance seems to be there only to soak up some of your money. There are no guards, no improvments made to the outside town over time ect. I guess the mayor of the town just sleeps on a bed made of solid gold in his mansion made of solid gold or something. It's also a bit to easy to accidently incinerate an innocent with your zap spell because it has a large hit box, but as someone who kills the civies for giggles that's not really a big deal to me personaly. There's also an upgrade that makes it so you can't kill innocents, which I've ignored because every now and then i want to be the evil shop master of the demon realm.\n\nThis game is well worth the price of entry, and if you're looking for something origional and fun it's right here. I truly look forward to this games future and hope that the devs can take this game from good to great. It has real potential to a powerhouse of time wasting.\n","August 28, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Number one make it so you can close the doors in case you need to change something or have a problem. Number two, instead of sharing a precentage of price increase between all the items, let the play set a certain amount for each item. Number three, i dont know how to build, the instructions were not very clear when it comes to how you get to placing counters, shelfs, ect. number 5 its confusing what items can be places were, a guide for that would be useful.

Plent of references to go around, a fair amount of jokes, and more than enough dirt to spare. The combat is kinda "meh", but thats not the main focus of this game. The game revolves, as you can guess, around running your Shoppe! You can set your own prices, decorate your Shoppe, and defend from intruders! You'll get the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥y customer, who hates that your Mana potion is sold for 3 Gold, but thats what Helper Bots are for!

Needs some more work but everything seems to work fine. The theif thing is easily overcome by letting them steal. And as soon as you can just upgrade the door, lots of people complain about this its just a simple add to the game. Things they need to add some kind of music for when attacked by the hordes, more choices on the "customize screen", a "rent" fee or increase on the tax rate as it is WAY to easy right now to buty whatever you want, and quests that are specificly designed to benefit hereos and in return you get rare shelves or something, workers/bodygaurds/cleaners.

This game is a very fun and addictive game to play, you just have to give it some time to develop and put in the time to actually play the game. The game runs very smoothly and has great graphics. I could play it for hours and hours. The only bad things are the taxes, completing a mission yet, it still thinks you haven't completed it, killing innocent people on accident instead of robbers, (but in the game you can upgrade your guy and one of them is not zapping an innocent person ever again) the tutorial needs some working on and should actually show how to do those things because I still haven't figured out how to build  tables and get plants, and OMG, THE REPAIR REPAIR REPAIR TAKES FOREVER!\n\nOverall: This game has great potential and I can't wait to see how it grows, but it can't grow with you getting the game, so get it to help the developers develop the game more. There are way more pros than cons in this game, and I didn't feel like listing all the pros. And remember, THIS GAME IS DEVELOPING AND IT ISN'T QUITE PERFECT SO DON'T GIVE UP ON IT, BECAUSE IT WILL GET BETTER. IT IS DEVELOPING.\n\nP.S.

Living the life of a Shoppe Keeper is a cathartic experience that's nice to wind down after a hard day at work. What really appeals to me is you're not forced to kill enough people per level/day to be classified as a medium sized natural disaster, but you can if you want. There's no rule to say you can't murder all your paying customers as well as thieves. There's a tax placed on you for murdering innocents, but honestly it's so small that ocasionally I started zapping people for giggles.\n\nBuying shelves and placing them is fairly simple, ordering items is also simple. It'd be nice to have a snapping feature so I can place tables and shelves and such end to end with no gaps and agenst the walls. But what I have to say is my favorit thing about this early access release is how much effort the devs are putting in to listening to the players.\n\nFor instance, my two personal peeves in the game were how you had to remove every item from a shelf in order to reprice them, and how customers seem to be mudmen from the plannet swampzilla for the amount of dirt they track in. In a quickly implimented patch, door mats were introduced, which stop customers from tracking in dirt, and it was made so that changing the price of one item changes the ones already placed as well. These are supposidly only temporary fixes with improvments comming as development continues. This shows that the devs are listening and they want this game to be fun.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. It's early access, so there's bugs, missing features, and some things that are just kind of obnoxious at present. The tax system for instance seems to be there only to soak up some of your money. There are no guards, no improvments made to the outside town over time ect. I guess the mayor of the town just sleeps on a bed made of solid gold in his mansion made of solid gold or something. It's also a bit to easy to accidently incinerate an innocent with your zap spell because it has a large hit box, but as someone who kills the civies for giggles that's not really a big deal to me personaly. There's also an upgrade that makes it so you can't kill innocents, which I've ignored because every now and then i want to be the evil shop master of the demon realm.\n\nThis game is well worth the price of entry, and if you're looking for something origional and fun it's right here. I truly look forward to this games future and hope that the devs can take this game from good to great. It has real potential to a powerhouse of time wasting.\n","August 28, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Number one make it so you can close the doors in case you need to change something or have a problem. Number two, instead of sharing a precentage of price increase between all the items, let the play set a certain amount for each item. Number three, i dont know how to build, the instructions were not very clear when it comes to how you get to placing counters, shelfs, ect. number 5 its confusing what items can be places were, a guide for that would be useful.

You are able to decide what you sell and their prices. There are 3 skill trees you can pick and choose from to evolve your shop. There is always the chances of thieves stealing your items to being raided by barbanians to keep you on your toes. I love the cartoony style of the game aswell, and the developers are always open to feedback.\nBut there are some problems however. NPCs track way too much dirt into the store, making me clean over and over, but I guess that gives me something to do while people are shopping. Scenarios take a bit of time [30 mins average for me], and you need those to unlock items for My Shoppe mode, which I don't really have a problem with other than the fact that some items almost never get sold, and some of those are items are items that NEED to be sold, drastically adding time it takes to complete the scenario. Even worse is the fact that Scenarios have no save button, meaning that if I have to go or something in the middle of a scenario I've spent a long time on, I'd have to restart the scenario if I close the game. I hope one gets implemented soon.\nBut that's where my complaints end. I've seen a few graphical glitches, such as NPCs going through stairs, but nothing gamebreaking. Overall, the game is very enjoyable and I would reccomend it. Plus it's only 5 dollars!","August 24, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Tons of bugs, sometimes pretty funny and game breaking, but a true Alpha title, with fixes in the works.  This title keeps you pretty busy, from sweeping the floors, to purchasing / placing your items, it always feels like I'm running back and forth trying to keep up with the supply and demand... and the demand always seems to be winning!\n\nFor being Alpha and having active dev's, I cannot bad-mouth this title one bit.  It works as advertised and so far, from the updates I have seen, they always manage to tackle the big problems and add cool new little things.

If you want to enjoy a handful of hours re-arranging and designing a shop then it's a decent game to try. Later game stock you can unlock takes a lot of time to organize if you want to show all the items. Lots of gameplay is spent sorting it's display furniture (or remaking it after a brawl of barbarians). Anti-theft is something one benefits from as soon as they can afford it and is the only thing I use the robots for.\n\nIf you like collecting achievements and use them as goals to give the game more direction, then I don't recommend this. With both pre-release and the final product I've had to restart thrice to earn achievements I've already accomplished. As someone who gets excited to have even a small amount of completed games, it's discouraging to know that players will never get 100% due to glitches and creator only icons.\n\nOverall I found it fun but lost the urge of replaying it now that it's out. One of the downfalls of longer running early access titles.","June 1","true","82.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You traveled the lands slaying dragons, exploring caves, and hunting down bandits. You were the best. You could chop a dragons head off in one swing. However, then tragedy struck. You were hunting bandits down, an average tuesday for you, and easily cleared the camp. But one bandit hid, and after you sheathed your weapons, shot an arrow. It hit you in the knee.\n\nThe doctors saved you, however, they were unable to remove the arrow. You were never able to jump again. Or adventure.\n\nYou didnt know what to do with your life. You had a sizeable sum of money left over from your adventuring days, but you didnt know what to spend it on. However, you heard a rumor of a famous shop. Apparently, the owner was killed in a barbarian raid, and his wife decided to sell the shop. You bought it. It cost every single gold you have saved up, save for a small amount: 60 pieces. Can you build a shop up from the ground with only 60 gold?\n\nThat is what Shoppe Keep is all about.

Although when first starting the game it seems very slow, the game quickly expands, allowing you to design a small shop however you want.  The game excels at giving the player freedom to purchase their own furniture as well as goods, before allowing you to sell them at whatever profit you want.\n\nThe game can feel at times like one big grind, especially when you spend day after day simply selling goods and raising money.  However, the unlock system and wide range of goods available make this grind feel worthwhile.  It is a great feeling to see your shop progress over time and become more and more successful.\n\nThe developers of the game clearly care a lot about this game, which is evident by the many new features as well as fixes which are frequently added.\n\nPros:\n- Great shop customisability\n- Rewarding to see shop progress\n- Lots of new features frequently added\n- Fun and relaxed gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Basically one big grind\n- Very slow start\n- Occasional visual bugs","March 31","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does start off a little slow however, the first hour I was not sure if I wanted a refund but then I started playing it, and it did start to shine about the 2nd hour. I had finally made enough money to buy a stand and some expensive item such as a shield, then my income just started going through the roof. All of a sudden there were plenty of thieves trying to steal my goods and once I was done killing the thieves people had bought all the items in my store so I had to restock. This is a very hectic game once you get into it. The sound track is also on par with Zelda music, I actually enjoy the music in the game. There are some bugs however that I haven't really cared to worry about. However there are some things I think would be cool.\nI think this game would be great if the combat was worked a little to be more smoothe, and introduce different weapons for the shop keeper and add a different kind of store, a caravan. I think if we could have a caravan and travel around the land and see more than just the one boring town.

Even though it is in Early Access the game still has many hours of fun in it. I didn't notice many issues with this early access build, although the two biggest and most annoying issues was the camera and collision with NPC's. The camera movement isn't exactly smooth and is actually rather jittery which made me a lil' dizzy every so often although it was still playable.\n\nThe second issue was the collision with NPC's. I would be stocking up shelves and an NPC would walk into me resulting on me lifting up into the air and standing ontop of them which disrupted me from stocking my shelves and can prove as an annoyance if your shop is busy.\n\nApart from that the game is great and I can see potention in this if the developers listen to the feedback given from their players and shape a game worth releasing!","August 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\nShoppe Keep is a first-person shop managing game where you, instead of going on an adventure to slay mighty beasts, run a shoppe that supplies mighty warriors, mages and other classes for their own adventure. In the beginning you might find yourself confused on what and how to do certain things which is why game includes a tutorial book rather than a tutorial level that you can access any time while in-game. The game is in Early Access which does mean that you will encounter either unfinished or broken features but, that won't be a problem once its fully out of development. The game gets updated few times each month and developers[i.imgur.com] post frequent announcements about upcoming updates while they still listen to the community. Its your shop - your rules; you can place the objects and set the prices however you want to. Area outside the shop is explorable but be careful, you might get stuck and since you can't jump you are stuck there forever; one more thing that I didn't like about that area is that you can see NPCs appearing out of nowhere. Anyway, the game is ready to be played with few visual and gameplay bugs which will of course get fixed soon, I recommend getting it you will surely have fun with it.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/381120\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Thieves and Barbarians | Each day thieves will try to steal and barbarians will try to raid your shop. You must take them out while watching out at other customers.\nTutorial Book | You have problems understanding few things if you are new, thankfully there is some kind of tutorial book which you can access in-game and on the main menu and it explains a lot of things to the depth.\nBuilding you own shop | You are able to place objects however you wish.\nClass based customers | Each NPC will be assigned a class like warrior or mage and they will have their own weapon preferenceCons:FPS drops after shop becomes crowded | Once your shop gets all popular you will get FPS drops.\nNo Jumping | I don't know if this was planned to be added later or if it wasn't planned to be added at all but jumping seems like this game really needs it, you are glued to the ground.\nNPCs appear and disappear | When you open your shop and go to one of the spawnpoints for NPCs you can see them appearing and disappearing out of nowhere\nTerrain and objects don't have right collisions | In few places you can go few pixels into the texture═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is for everyone that likes management games that still keep some action mechanics. I rate the game 8/10, would get raided in the middle of town again! Early Access Warning: Game is unfinished but still worth the price.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 4","true","8.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This game in my opinion is pretty good for what it is.  Its exactly what the title says shoppe keep.  You basically run a General type store stocking items for the common adventurer.  Everything from potions to swords and shields.  This game lets you do everything a shop keeper would be expected to do.  You can price items however you wish, order more of everything, and set up the shop however you see fit to have a unique shop.  There are extras to you can send a adventure to adventure for more items and you can even defend your shop from thiefs and bandits trying to ran sack your shop.  The game still needs more items and more to do but the creators of the game do updates all the time so its a small complaint.

We've all played the epic style rpg game fighting dragons and undead, but most of us can agree that while playing those we've all wish man I'd just like to be a shopkeeper in a world like this. Well now you can. So far the game has been very entertaining. Love the art style and the simplistic gameplay. So here are my pros and cons for the game so far:\n\nPros:\n1. Great price for an early access game\n2. The free play mode for your very own shop\n3. Zapping those pesky thieves and barbarians\n4. Running the shop keeps you constantly busy\n5. Doesn’t take itself too seriously which leads to some very hilarious moments\n\nCons:\n1. Taxation without representation (pay taxes for no services in return)\n2. Glitchy doorway so makes it pain to chase thieves\n\nAnother thing I’d like to add which isn’t a con but I’d like to see in the game is a form of multiplayer, where you have a bigger shop with more customers to manage and more area to stock items. Other than that, great game at a low price so I definitely recommend it.","August 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

There is so much growth potential for your shops, making you feel your progress. There is more to come, the devs are not done so know more will come.

Really gives you the feeling of owning a little shop, you can run around in the city and stuff people your potions into the pockets even. Just grab your customers in the beginning, don't wait for them to come in.\n\nI am quite early in the game, but i absolutly like it and i am happy that i finally bought it.\n\nI hope the game/devs will prosper, the game is great and got a concept that can very well be continued further.\n\nNow excuse me please, i have to sweep Wolfen's Needful Things.\n\nedit: After some hours of the game under my fur, i am surprised about its depth. Thought it would get bored somehow after a few hours, but it doesn't. Not even unlocked other classes so far and yet its getting almost stressy during the day-sales.

Love it.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are funny and quirky.  To begin with start by selling to customers outside the shop to earn a couple extra coins, then work your way up. Like the fact that you get your money back from removing the furniture. Love the fact that there is a back room, just wish you could decorate it more.\n\nCons:\nUi is eh, only need to put the instructions in the menu rather then just the main menu. Don't like clipping through the doors. I hate the factor that they can walk in between counters, makes catching thieves extremely hard. Also don't like that the thieves run in a straight line to the exit, rather then create a chase through the alley ways to the exit. When a customer doesn't buy something and drops it to the floor you can't pick it up sometimes(sometimes!!).","May 20","true","32.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The most notable is that I get sick playing with it.  The only other game I have had this issue with is Minecraft.  For what ever reason, I cannot play longer than 30 minute intervals without getting nautious.  I think it has to do with the camera movement or graphics, but Im not entirely sure what does it.  Another, more easily fixable issue I have found is that the game is still quite buggy.  Some items that fall on the ground seem to have to be kicked around a few times before the game will let me pick them up.  A very irritating bug is that when trying to put items on shelves,  it seems like every now and then, the bottom corner spots I am unable to place items in.  Makes things very Irritating when trying to start my day with the shelves full..  At first I thought this was due to a shelf being placed too close to a wall or corner, but have found that it happens even to shelves placed in the middle of the floor with nothing surrounding them..  Like I said,  I have had a lot of fun so far playing the game.  Adding the ability to walk around the city and sell to people who arent headed to your store is cool.  The skills and items you can purchase seem well thought out and allow for different aproaches to starting out your shop.  There are a lot of very cool concepts going on in this game.  I look forward to seeing how they flesh the game out down the road.","January 10","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That having been said, however, I actually do like this game.\n\nI think that it would be a mistake to compare this game to Recettear and other business sims because they are different styles of game. Recettear is a strategic money making game where the pressure is on making enough money to pay the bills; in comparison this game puts the pressure on managing the actual shop floor in real time - theres a good reason its called shop keepe - and there is pressure in that you have to work out on the fly what to buy more of and what not to; it's fun but think that the lack of actual consequences for doing a bad job may be detrimental to my future experience.\n\nThe biggest thing to prepare yourself for if you are thinking about getting the game is the slow start. You start with low money and nothing unlocked as expected and that means low customers and thus not much to actually do. Luckily this can be alleviated by going and selling items to people in the street but it is nonetheless initially repetitive in a boring manner. It does get better!\n\nBy far the biggest issue is the tutorial for this game and I really hope that the developers change it so that its an ingame as-it-happens tutorial rather than a text one. This could be done in a way that makes the keybinding clearer too -  like the shifts for the price changes.\n\nOverall as long as you are prepared to play a game about being a shop keeper and not just a business simulation I think you'll enjoy it.\n\nUPDATE: Having played another 6 hours I can safely say that my concerns about future gameplay have been assuaged; once you get going the game gets pretty frantic. The devs continue to update at a steady pace atm with an update done today so I'm hopeful that the UI and tutorials could also be improved in the future to reduce learning curve. Overall still very much recommend.","May 21","true","15.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are a few bugs, as is expected for any EA game, but i have not encountered many. I have a couple of suggestions, such as an alarm you can purchase to alert you when thieves pass with stolen goods and some more types of things you can do, including an expansion to the current open world area, maybe other shops, interactive locations within it, so its not so empty, but otherwise a great game with a lot of potential.","January 25","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Triggrd/recommended/381120/","Triggrd","Triggered","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Triggrd/","68 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI didn't know what to write, so here is the wikipedia page on a chocolate chip cookie.\n\nA chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that originated in the United States and features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other types of chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.\n\nHistoryThe chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows & Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie" which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.\n\nDiffering versions of discoveryRuth Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, "We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie."A different version of events says that Wakefield is said to have been making chocolate cookies and on running out of regular baker's chocolate, substituted broken pieces of semi-sweet chocolate from Nestlé thinking that they would melt and mix into the batter. They did not and the chocolate chip cookie was born. A still different history of the cookie derives from George Boucher, who was at one time head chef at the Toll House Inn, and his daughter, Carol Cavanagh, who also worked there. Contradicting Nestlé's claim that Wakefield put chunks of chocolate into cookie dough hoping they would melt, the daughter stated that the owner, already an accomplished chef and author of a cookbook, knew enough about the properties of chocolate to realize it would not melt and mix into the batter while baking. Boucher said that the vibrations from a large Hobart electric mixer dislodged bars of Nestlé's chocolate stored on the shelf above the mixer which caused the chocolate to fall into the sugar cookie dough mixing below. He claims to have overcome Wakefield's impulse to discard the dough as too badly ruined to waste effort baking them, leading to the discovery of the popular combination.\n\nNestlé marketingEvery bag of Nestlé chocolate chips sold in North America has a variation (butter vs. margarine is now a stated option) of her original recipe printed on the back.Every bag of Nestlé chocolate chips sold in North America has a variation (butter vs. margarine is now a stated option) of her original recipe printed on the back. During WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters from around the world asking for her recipe. Thus began the nationwide craze for the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nPresent dayAlthough the Nestlé's Toll House recipe is widely known, every brand of chocolate chips, or "semi-sweet chocolate morsels" in Nestlé parlance, sold in the U.S. and Canada bears a variant of the chocolate chip cookie recipe on its packaging. Almost all baking-oriented cookbooks will contain at least one type of recipe.\n\nPractically all commercial bakeries offer their own version of the cookie in packaged baked or ready-to-bake forms. There are at least three national (U.S./North America) chains that sell freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in shopping malls and standalone retail locations. Several businesses—including Doubletree hotels, Citibank, Aloha, and Midwest Airlines—offer freshly baked cookies to their patrons to differentiate themselves from their competition.\nThere is an urban legend about Neiman Marcus' chocolate chip cookie recipe that has gathered a great deal of popularity over the years. To honor the cookie's creation in the state, on July 9, 1997, Massachusetts designated the chocolate chip cookie as the Official State Cookie, after it was proposed by a third-grade class from Somerset, Massachusetts.\n\nComposition and variantsChocolate chip cookies are commonly made with white sugar; brown sugar; flour; a small portion of salt; eggs; a leavening agent such as baking powder; a fat, typically butter or shortening; vanilla extract; and semi-sweet chocolate pieces. Some recipes also include milk or nuts (such as chopped walnuts) in the dough.\n\nDepending on the ratio of ingredients and mixing and cooking times, some recipes are optimized to produce a softer, chewy style cookie while others will produce a crunchy/crispy style.[7] Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cookie is fairly consistent in all recipes: First, the sugars and fat are creamed, usually with a wooden spoon or electric mixer. Next, the eggs and vanilla extract are added followed by the flour and leavening agent. Depending on the additional flavoring, its addition to the mix will be determined by the type used: peanut butter will be added with the wet ingredients while cocoa powder would be added with the dry ingredients. The titular ingredient, chocolate chips, as well as nuts are typically mixed in towards the end of the process to minimize breakage, just before the cookies are scooped and positioned on a cookie sheet. Most cookie dough is baked, although some eat the dough as is, or use it as an addition to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.\n\nCommon variants\nThe M&M cookie, or party cookie, replaces the chocolate chips with M&M's. This recipe originally used shortening as the fat, but has been updated to use butter.\nThe chocolate chocolate chip cookie uses a dough that is chocolate flavored by the addition of cocoa or melted chocolate. Variations on this cookie include replacing chocolate chips with white chocolate or peanut butter chips.\nThe macadamia chip cookie has macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips.[12] It is a signature cookie of Mrs. Fields bakeries.\nThe chocolate chip peanut butter cookie replaces the vanilla flavored dough with a peanut butter flavored one.\nChocolate chip cookie dough baked in a baking dish instead of a cookie sheet results in a chocolate chip bar cookie.\nOther variations include different sizes and shapes of chocolate chips, as well as dark or milk chocolate chips. These changes lead to differences in both flavor and texture.\n\nPopular brandsBlue Chip Cookies\nChips Ahoy!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Detoxpenguin/recommended/381120/","Detoxpenguin","Sgt. Red","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Detoxpenguin/","206 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMan it sucks to throw a negative review on Shoppe Keep; after playing for 30+ hours, however, I feel like I've seen more than enough of the game to be informed enough to discuss it's merits.\n\nQuick pro's and con's:\n\nPro's Unique Idea\nInitially a LOT of funCons Busy work that lasts your entire play through\nSingular dimension\nShoppe Keep follows suit of games like Recettear, allowing the player to manage a shop for adventurers to get some items (potions, weapons, and armor). The premise of it, and initial outlook, are a lot of fun! Setting up your furniture to display your wares, scrounging around in trash cans, launching thieves into the air with your lightening. You slowly accumulate wealth, which allows you to purchase more furniture, display more items for sale, and expand your shop size.  It isn't a bad premise.\n\nThe first issue that absolutely destroys the game is busy work. This involves picking up items that customers remove from your shelves (for no reason other than to force you to pick it up, and give you a task while it's open). Once your shop is displaying 50+ items, and your customers throw 20 items everywhere in the first three minutes, it becomes a headache. It's been proposed to further drop the prices: at 130%, it still happens to frequently to be worth dealing with.\n\nThere was what appears to be a proposed fix, in the form of allowing robots to pick up the items for you (among other menial tasks these robots can accomplish); however, the robots cannot understand your floor layout, so you can throw your inventory quotas to ♥♥♥♥, or you can not use them. Even with using them, you still ave to remove each piece of gear from the robots and place it back on the shelf.\n\nThe second busy work is sweeping. Yeah, you get a little broom, and every customer that comes through your shop, on top of throwing your ♥♥♥♥ all over the place, track mud everywhere. So you sweep all day. This has seen an attempted fix, however, in the form of highly expensive floor mats that are destroyed after about 60% of the day passes. Which can give you a leg up in picking up all of the ♥♥♥♥ everywhere, but you'll go back to sweeping before the day is done. And after the day is done. And sweep up all of the corpses.\n\nAfter receiving some advice from the forums, I reattempted to get back into Shoppe Keep, but did so with a stop watch so I could measure the amount of time spent doing "busy work" and the amount of time spent actually managing inventory, upgrades, and the shoddy questing/champion system (more on that later). Of an hour and a half of play time, I spent 78 minutes doing busy work. It becomes tedious, to say the absolute least.\n\nSo then we have the singular dimension I've mentioned. You never see anything but the store. You never do anything but increase your wealth and buy more things. Then sell the things you've bought. On top of sweeping and picking up the damn items. They have something called a champion that you can unlock, and send him on "adventures" (which consists of you clicking a GUI to send him to a location, and then reading the quest log). You can try your hand at gardening, which consists of clicking at dirt and waiting ~5 minutes.\n\nI'm not mentioning the bugs because it's still in development, and it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to call out a developing game for those. They could sweep me off my feet and change a LOT before release. As of now, just go play Recettear.\n","March 2","false","35.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I like shop managment games and gave it a try. Tutorial is a text list (with one screenshot per function), leaves out vital information. For example, it took half of my 50 minutes played to figure out that the controls for raising/lowering prices only work when the items in question are in the inventory chest, not where you pick up the item or where you place it. When the item was placed I got frustrated mashing the keys for raising the price with no effect. So I learned over the course of 25 minutes that you have to pick up the item from the delivery chest, deposit it into the inventory chest, change the price there (and only there), pick up the item again, and place it on display. Not only is it a clunky mechanic, it's undocumented. I'm sure at one point the player surmounts the learning curve and has fun, but the developer doesn't help and I am no longer interested in trying to figure it out. 2D graphics are great, 3D graphics are fine (store, items, furniture etc.), but the customer and player models are awful and the textures look like they were created in MS Paint.\nRefund requested.\n\nSuggestions to the developer:\n1) Rework some of your quests into a short series of basic functions that walk the player through vital tutorial info with prompts. This will get new players past that frustration point where they quit (and ask for a refund, as I did).\n2) Fully document not only the key bindings, but the narrow set of circumstances under which they are functional (i.e. must be in this mode, used only from this location/container, etc.)\n3) Last and least important, improve those player/customer models and skins. They don't look great in the screenshots, and they look even worse in the game.","May 30","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

I honestly think the 2 hour maximum rule is BS. I guess I'm stuck with this game, so here's my experience so far...\n\nFirst of all, do NOT waste your money on multiple tables in the beginning. If you don't have the money for Health Potions, you might as well start over, or else you're going to have to wait until you find an item in the trash to sell. Health Potions are the cheapest items you can buy and re-sell at first. However, the only table available to you that can hold potions has a 1 item limit, so starting out is goin to be a slowwwww one. There is a shelf that can hold what I assume to be 9, but I have no idea how to unlock it.\n\nThere IS a leveling system in the game, and I'm sure that's what is needed to unlock more things to buy, but the game doesn't specify. I think I'm level 5 now, but I still haven't noticed any benefits from it.\n\nOne other thing I've noticed is that you can't set a price for individual items. What I mean is, let's say I want to sell a Health Potion (which is valued at 10g) for 150% or 15g and I want to sell an item I found in the trash (valued at 100g) for 125% or 125g. The problem is, you can't. Every item's price is going to be based off of the last item you set down, which is frustrating because I have expensive items that I can't seem to sell since their price is too high! Yeah, I know I can just sell them cheap and then put my "selling" items back on display AFTER, but how is that supposed to work in the late game, when dozens of people are coming in and out?\n\nI'm not trying to say this is a BAD game based on my demand for a refund. Honestly, it's a fun idea. I just think it was released too soon. I'm sure the bugs will be fixed in the near future, but I'd rather own a game that I know is 99.9% bug free.","May 26","false","18.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Just to explain this a little - NPC's will try to steal things from your shop sometimes, just by picking it up and running outside. You can't go outside yourself, and some counters are placed very nearby the entrance so it takes around 1-2 seconds for a thief to run off. The frequency of the thieves made some scenarios thoroughly miserable.\n\nYou can unlock skills by playing the game which cut down on thievery and even allow for a rechargable magic barrier which will make thievery almost none existant. This made me wonder what the point of thievery was in the first place. It was a mechanic that gave me 3 hours of annoyance and frustration that has now been nullified completely.\n\nI don't want to wipe thievery from the game, I just want it to be fun!\n\nI still can't recommend the game at the moment, because of the issues like;\n\n1) Many scenario's are "Sell 10 X and 20 Y". The frequency of sales is low and the things you'd expect to help, don't. For example, when you have lots of money in the scenario and decide to sell everything for 1% of the original price, there's no Black Friday rush. It's just the same - long and drawn out. The Developer has said that there are some mechanics behind the pricing but it's not readily apparent to me. It's obvious when you've priced something too high, but there's never a low enough price to get the( effect you want.)\n\n2) There's no progression in My Shoppe. There are scenarios to play that unlock new items but there's nothing to spend your gold on. It just feels pointless.\n\n3) Barbarian attacks are every five minutes, and can be almost as annoying as thievery. Especially when you consider that your sword does AOE damage and if you accidentally break a counter in a Scenario, you can't replace it. That means that you might not have space to sell 10 of X and 20 of Y. That means that the two hours you already played are wasted.\n\nThe latest update wasn't really what I wanted to see. A small customization of your own character. I think they're dabbling with frequency rate of barbarians and things like that too.\n\nMaybe I'm expecting too much for a low priced game?

This bug makes the game almost impossible to play, though you can pause the game (or perform any other action that would allow the user to freely move the mouse in-game) and manually re-center the mouse, then unpause the game every time you hit the edge of the screen. Personally I don't think this is a viable fix, it prevents a player from really becoming imersed into the game. This is the reason I sadly cannot reccomend this game at this moment in time.\nPlease remember this review is only based at those using Linux and NOT those using Windows or OS x","October 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

It's barely a beta, and considering the fact that it has been in early access for quite a time, it's also an insult.\n\nFull controller support ? Lol... Can't even navigate in the menu or create a shop without switching back to keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhen you create a shop, it just goes back to the menu with nothing to let you know what todo next, and you have to click play again to see you shop and start a game.\n\nTutorial is so boring you end up not reading it, and therefore, not being able to understand the mechanics of the game. And even though you're brave enough to read those, i hope you have good eyes and like typo changing because they're written with a really small, or really big, or really medium font. I don't even understand the logic behind that.\n\nThere is a hint when you look at the floor of you house. Because... Reasons. And this hint will not disappear until you read the appropriate tutorial ! Great, great idea really...\n\nDo not try to get out of your house using the door. Doors are for weak people, try the hatch on the floor instead...\n\nAs far as I've played, there's only one friggin' music which is so repetitive that it seems to loop every 10 seconds.\n\nGraphics are not that nice and barely ok.\n\nDon't you dare alt-tab the game because you won't be able to access your task bar.\n\n\n\nI'll try it again if it ever gets finished, but for now, it's a big disappointment and i really don't recommend it.","May 22","false","0.3"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","0"

While the trailer makes it seem like there are fun ways to acquire items which you can sell, like farming and alchemy, it's not feasible to play this way, and literally impossible early on. In reality you just click the "Place Order" button, pick up the delivery, place the items on shelves, wait until they are sold, rinse and repeat for the entire game. I was bored out of my mind after just a few hours.\n\nThe game also displays a shocking lack of care. Often a group of customers will enter the store looking to buy a Health Potion, but they're all headed towards the exact same potion. When the first customer to arrive at the potion buys it, instead of simply buying a different Health Potion, the other customers will just turn around and leave. Both the player and customers constantly clip through objects, and the game is riddled with typos and grammatical errors, sporting gems like "Maybe I shouldnt of done that" and "Brake Walls". If a developer cares so little about their own game that they cannot even be bothered to proofread it before shoving it out of Early Access, that alone is a strong indication of a game not worth playing.","May 22","false","5.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","1"

The camera is seriously janky to the point where when someone steals your crap and you have two seconds to notice them, run after them and kill them, you probably spend most of that time running into the same table. You get almost used to it after a bit, but at first I thought I was gonna get motion sick. The tutorial is seriously lacking, and probably should tell you basic things like where the items you buy will actually appear. I got an achievement for completing the first scenario which, in all honesty, I didn't come close to doing. I literally purposefully failled it to see if it would give me hints on how to play.

Dusted it off again after it "released".  Now I can give it a thumbs down.   Raising and lowering prices seem to only work if you rebind the keys first.  + and - had no effect even though they were the bound keys.  I changed them to 9 and 0, then they worked.  30 minutes gone in getting this straightened away.  Ordered a potion and leather gloves for a grand opening.  Opened the store and sold the gloves, orfered another pair.  2cd customer stole the potion.  Zapped him outside the shop and the dropped potion became a static object, couldn't move it, pick it up or sweep it away.  In the time I had to waste figuring that out, 3rd customer stole the leather gloves and made a clean getaway.  Very disappointing going from an early access I enjoyed to a release that had two broken mechanics in the first day  of opening the store.","May 22","false","9.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

What with it being a convenient button to press for a variety of functions. But no, let's make an endless joke about how you have an arrow in the knee and cannot jump. I assume from that that this thing has been in Early Accesss since Skyrim was trendy.\n\nThe gameplay drops you right in without any real guidnace, but I was able to faff about and eventually figure out NOT to buy any furniture except for two pedestals, upon which I placed one mana potion and one health potion. I jacked up the prices to 2 gold, only to have a customer flip me off for being expensive. I then figured out the problem.\n\n2 gold (203%) was too expensive, but it turns out 2 gold (159%) was a perfectly acceptable price. I may have those percentages wrong, but the principle is still sound, customers can tell precisely what percentile you've raised the prices even if the actual gold cost remains the same.\n\nSo I kept going, as a stream of customers proceeded to gaggle into my store, stare at my two pedestals, frantically beg for flowers and vegetables, laugh at my prices, and then leave.\n\nWait, no, they didn't leave. They stood there for ingame hours, continually angry about my lack of flowers and vegetables. At least the satisfied customers OH RIGHT THEY STAYED TOO. Eventually I would murder some from time to time just to clear it up, as only 20% of my customers would leave at any given time.\n\nSo eventually I managed by the end of the first day to get to the point where I could cycle through pairs of gloves, and as I watched the outside world near closing time, the doors closed..trapping me inside. Not my shop, I was trapped inside the doors, and could not move, helpless to watch as I could not pay my tax bill, which...didn't seem to cause any sort of problem whatsoever. Perhaps the inspector was kind enough to realize I was trapped inside a wooden prison, able to see out but forever immobilized.\n\nSo yeah this game's <3<3<3<3ing awful.","September 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","4","16","3","2"

I like games that do not necessarily look the best, but have a unique charm. I had thought Shoppe Keep was going to be one such game.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIn Shoppe Keep you play as a shop keeper (go figure), running a shop selling items for adventurers. Having played Recettear, I thought this game was going to be a blast. And it could have been, had I played for more than 20 minutes. But I could not. I got as far as building my displays and placing some items before I became so aggravated at the clunky control system that I gave up. Even with rebinding keys, the entire GUI is just awful. I had to scroll (with the mousewheel) through my items, with no list to just click what I wanted. And when I finally found the item I liked, I picked up a different one to free up the spot on the shelf and it switched to the item I picked up! I never even made it to the part where I could sell stuff, because it was just unbearable.\n\nThe graphics in the game are not terrible, but not great. I have a feeling older computers could run this no problem, if it was worth running. But sadly, it is not.\n\nThe soundtrack was annoying, as well. At least, the one song that repeated and repeated and repeated while I fumbled around with the controls. Which really held back this game’s potential.\n\nAll in all, the game set my hopes high. But I never even got to experience the whole aspect that made me buy the game: selling things and haggling over the price until they finally cave because they actually do need a sword to fight.\n\nMight try this game in a few months, if the UI gets an update. But until then, I do not recommend spending the money.","May 24","false","0.8"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","2"

It throws everything at you within your first minutes playing. I started the game for the first time and put up a couple of potions for sale. I kid you not, literally within one minute I was raided. It's not as much as a raid as it is full on invasion with an army of 200+ raiders - I only had a couple of potions on sale and they weren't even marked up that much. I died because the raiders can hit you through walls and the wall of their own corpses that builds up.\n\nI realize this is in early access. But I think that having some type of logical flow to the customers and prices would be in the core of a SHOP KEEPING GAME.

It's kind of ironic that I'm suffering buyers remorse for a game about shoppe keeping where, in the game, people as with Steam have no recouse to a refund but do ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly about the products available, as with Steam.\nThat's where the fun really ends for me, and really typing that last paragraph wasn't a lot of fun.  My grammar sucks.\nThe gameplay here could be okay, with a bit more variety and if they just let you relax.  You have to run around constantly though and unsuccessfully try to thwart thieves.

WORST UI EVER!\n\nThere's just no hint for how things work:\n\n--[E] starts the day, once the day is started you can't place any shelves or tables, so if you pressed E by accident in the first day, the whole day is ruined -- you can't sell anything!\n--Those objects in your backroom cant be interacted with. took me minutes to figuare out how to use any of them.\n--You can't place a shield on a pedestal. This is pretty WTF on it self, but get this, nobody's gonna tell it! so you just sit there wonder why those green things stopped showing up.\n\nThe order window, as you can see in the video demo of the game, is a real world object! That made letters on the far side really small and hard to read.\n\nTalking about hard to read, WTF is with the font? Just imagine every word -- instructions, labels -- that you're trying to read is in the font of shop signs, those fancy bulky letters. I mean isn't it obvious it just don't fit?\n\nAlso, when your customer say something, you can only hear or read their speech bubbles when you're REALLY, REALLY close to them. any further you won't hear anything, and the text will be just blurs.\n\nSwinging Y axis by default. This is not even an action game.\n\nThe shopkeeper have 6 "states", the implementations are laughable:\n--The are called "states" in game. STATES!\n--Fighting state is only meaningful when the shop is open, it is avilable throughout the day. Same as building state is only meaningful when the shop is closed, since it is forbidden to build when it's open by the mechanics.\n--There's nothing wrong with ordering items in other states! However, you can only order items in shopkeeper state.\n\nIt's ok the UI does not look good when it's under development, but the interaction should be as intended in a released version -- how else are people going to play it and send feedback? The game also went out of its way to make things uncomfortable for players, my conclusion is the developers don't have the taste for what is important to make a game.","September 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","3"

It came up on my news feed as launched and ive had some luck with indie devs so thought i would give it a chance.\n\nAs they sold this game to me as the finished prodcut i feel its only fair to review it as a finished product. This game isnt very good. The goal of the game i guess is to run a shop which means just sell as much junk every day to everyone to turn a profit and repeat.\n\nIt gets boring quick, and everything is very manual. For instance  you can buy a shelf that holds 12 small items, you have to manually stock it with those twelve items, and as they sell you need to restock each item, also apparently placing potions in a bookcase causes wear on said bookcase and must be repaired.

When you hit 150% you go up to 2 gold on a 1 gold item obviously, before you get to the next gold price of 3, ALL percentages in between SHOULD be useless up until that point, AND here is why. From what I have learned, or experimented, The higher the price, the higher change the item will be stolen instead. And if a potion is selling for 2 150%. And you up it to 2 165%, the chance to steal goes up, however the price stays the same. Thus making it a little pointless, Though a nice feature to change percentages at such a small level.

But from what i've seen, they update the game daily, so alot of these get fixed very quickly.  Plus, if you take a look at the trailers, there appear to be alot more things on the way, I,E. a resource manager, more types of robots, more classes, upgrades and more.\n\nI'll let you guys decide if it's worth your time, but i'd say for 5 bucks, it is.  7.5/10\n\nupdate 9.02 review/ 420 update:\nSo for me, the update came out this morning,and i am quite impressed!  seriously, it was a big content update. first off, the reason i know this as the 420 update,is because they added the ability to grow weed, i'm guessing it's a different kind of weed but still.  It also is teasing at livestock out back of your shop, so maybe things like pigs and cows?  And the shop has gotten a complete makeover,as it now has a much larger back room, and the action to extend sections of the shop.  although i have one thing i found. i believe that in the next update the back yard will be unlocked, and you'll be able to farm crops, as alot of customers have been asking about fruits and vegetables.\nGood job Kris and Otto, you guy's have made a wonderful update. new score: 8/10 much better than before and shows even more potential now!","August 25, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's the sort of game where everything seems so simple, but can snowball into different layers of complexity that can keep you rallying behind the game even in the darkest hours of fantasy retail.\n\nWhilst it can become quite a grind, that somehow seems to add to the addiction, as you're determined to do well in your business endeavours, in spite of opportunistic thieves stealing your best stock, marauding barbarians smashing up your furniture, and the tax man demanding he takes all of your petty cash, just when you thought you could make a great stock investment with it.\n\nThe art and animation style is fun and endearing, the music is, whilst quite repetitive, strangely hypnotic and pleasant.  The overall theme works very well and has me hooked.\n\nFor a pre-release game (at the time I am writing this), it seems like a very well polished product, and I can only look forward to any additions the developers plan to add.\n\nRight, now I have to get back and restock before opening time.

Now is your chance to be on the other side of the counter. This game lets you run your own shop. It is like they took the Pawn Stars iPhone Game and mashed it together with all those old RPG games we used to play. You start off with 25 Gold then you use it to buy items to sell to all those adventurers. Things like Potions, Swords, Armor etc. You choose the mark up but if its too high your patrons get angry and trash your store. Take the profits use it to by more items and displays and repeat. You can expand your shop and you will need to fight off shoplifters and barbarians. You can purchase power ups which give you additional bonuses.

Maybe even a bit boring at times. However, it is still a good game. Unfortunately, this game has some issues to work out.\n\n1: DIRT. A LOT OF IT. So much that you will spend more than 50% of your time sweeping the ground. Sure, you can purchase a floor mat to help, but they break within a minute. Floor mats should last MUCH longer. Maybe at least half a day of dozens of people walking in and out every second.\n2: Day/Night cycle. I just got a bug that broke this. Upon the day ending, the doors did not close, and nothing I could do couold reset the day/night cycle back again. Couldn't skip using the watch, couldn't press e, nothing. Fix that.\n3: Jumping. Not that much of an issue, but it would REALLY help with mobility. That's my recommendation. Screw that stupid message that pops up when you press the space bar.\n4: Staff NPC's. This could really help, since you're just a single player trying to manage a shop for which there are DOZENS upon DOZENS of customers. Some cashiers, some restockers, that sorta thing. The Help Bots that cost 900 (base and bot together) is kinda helpful, but not much.\n\nIf you can get past all these, though, then it's a fun game.

On top of that, you can equip a hero to go loot some nice equipment for you... As shallow as this game does seem on the off, there is plenty to do and plenty of life and depth in this.  I am unsure how deep it goes but am keen to spend more time to determine that.\n\nIts true, its in Early access, so more stuff is being added, like the quests/scenario section being merged into the free-play  'MyShoppe' mode, which I think is a great move from the devs; For an early access game, at this point, I think its pretty decent.\n\nThis is not perfect by any means but it still does alot of good things in my book.  So far, this  indie game is pretty fresh and is a very pleasant and easy to grip, gaming experience...  which is, if not too hard to drop once you have started.  The music is quite pleasant too.","October 26, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Glitchy NPC's can wreak havoc on your store, and helper bots rarely help stop theives. Also, I believe a better way of building should be developed, maybe whenever you go into build mode, the floor turns into a grid, this allows precise building and symetrical shops. It gets laggier the bigger your shop gets. (Duh.)\n\nPros: I can easily waste hours playing this game, it's super fun. At first, theres lots of things you can get, and you can do really cool things with the items the game provides. This game is humerous, and I feel the dev's would be really friendly people IRL based on how this game was created.\n\nMeh?: Once you start getting lot's of money it gets boring due to nothing to buy. The amount of dirt the customers bring in, is just uncanney. The graphics are nice, the choice of textures, are not. (They should be customizeable.)\n\nTldr; Support this game so they can fix the bugs and push out an amazing time killing game.\n\nTip for the dev's: MULTIPLAYER WOULD BE SO FRIGGIN' COOL.","October 26, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a lot of potential and is different than anything i've played before. The biggest issue is the user interface for me. Granted this is early access, doing things in this game is not easy as it should be (easy to understand, hard to get the game to 'do' what you want).\n\nPros:\n1. Fairly unique game play and interesting premise.\n2. has a lot of potential.\n\ncons:\n1. User interface is clunky and currently buggy.\n2. Not easy to manipulate items you buy (like once you buy a pedestal or shelf, if you accidentally place it the wrong way, it's not easy to fix. I sold a 100 gold weapon stand, and got like 3gold back from selling it....wtf.\n3. Once a ton of people go to your shop, it's so easy to steal your stuff.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Need to be able to hire guards.\n2. Need to be able to hire sweepers.\n3. User interface should have a dedicated button for all functions.\n4. Need to be able to open/close when needed.\n5. Would be better to start off really small, like with just a stall (instead of a whole store). Work your way up from a stall to a shop.\n6. Queue multiple orders.\n7. Need to balance price/cost and have fluctuating demand etc.","December 19, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonycz/recommended/381120/","sonycz","Snysta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonycz/","127 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery gut game I have to say. I bought it on thursday. I was like "Oh, lets play for a while, it looks good." Yea, I had to wake up at 8 a.m. on friday, but because of the game, I went to sleep at 3:30 a.m. on friday. I was dead the whole friday while visiting my girlfriend. But faking worth it.\n\nYes, what I suggest is:\n- Some kind of invertory, chest, or something like that, you know, where you can store your items so you dont have to hold them all in your hands! Please developers! <3\n- More items you can order from the list.\n- More recipes of course.\n- More places for planting weed, mushrooms and so on.\n- Taking items back from that adventure man.\n- Taking items back from the alchemy thing, you know, I dont know how it's called in english, because you mess up the recipe you know and then what, you are ♥♥♥♥d up.\n- Reduce the lags, I mean graphics lags. The more people in the shop, the less FPS - Do it better my friends, please, I love you developers! You can do it!\n- Some places you can visit or maybe more buildings where you do your business you know, selling weed and stuff. Or maybe you can choose your building where to sell your things from the begining. Just my opinion, yes, you know.\n\nBugs I would really like to see fixed, maybe I will in the upcoming patch:\n- Problem with picking up items after thiefs steal them or after they just drop from table or whatever.\n- Problem with planting and collecting seeds. You cant really target them, almost the same as the previous problem.\n- After crafting many items, big items such as chests, they just explode or what is that and they can end up on the next side of the shop or they just disappear.\n- Real numbers of HP and Damage on the adventure guy. I mean, you dont get more damage with weed and with sword just 7 or how much... Wait what? You do? Oh sorry, I never smoked weed. Sorry, my fault.\n- Customers get stuck very often. Like imagine my lovely developers, you are like the best business guy in the city, best prices, golden items, so everyone wants to visit your shop. But there isnt so much space, so they are like "Fak yu man, I want to go there..." "No no no I!! Want to go there!" And yes, what happens? They get stuck!\n- Sometimes when you pick up corpse or skeleton, it just goes Whoaaa and its all over the shop. You know what I mean.\n- Cant remember more bugs, but remember developers, I love this game and everything about it, so fix it and maybe I will even marry you. All of you!\n\nPerfect game, I love this game, love the idea, love them developers. Keep up with the good work!\nBuy the game, its addictive. And you can do your own business with weed.

I am a huge fan of the game so far and am looking forward to the full release.","December 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get 60 gold, and a very small shop. You start small, buying cheap items and making a small profit. But, the game very quickly becomes much more diverse and fun. You start buying new, more expensive items, you start crafting, sending your hero on challenges, and most importantly, you start growing weed. You can eventually buy expansions to your shop if you have enough money, making your shop much bigger.\n\nUpdates and Devs\nThe Devs are very dedicated to this game, pumping out regular-ish updates with lots of content added in each. The most recent was the Winter update, which added a much bigger outside area, progressive gameplay, and all out much better graphics. Like MUCH better. They are constantly looking for new ways to improve their game, and they definetely succeed at it.\n\nFinal Rating\nRight now, the game still has lots to work on, but it has so much potential. At this moment, I would give it a 7.5/10, but it has the potential to become a 9/10.","December 24, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's the sort of game where everything seems so simple, but can snowball into different layers of complexity that can keep you rallying behind the game even in the darkest hours of fantasy retail.\n\nWhilst it can become quite a grind, that somehow seems to add to the addiction, as you're determined to do well in your business endeavours, in spite of opportunistic thieves stealing your best stock, marauding barbarians smashing up your furniture, and the tax man demanding he takes all of your petty cash, just when you thought you could make a great stock investment with it.\n\nThe art and animation style is fun and endearing, the music is, whilst quite repetitive, strangely hypnotic and pleasant.  The overall theme works very well and has me hooked.\n\nFor a pre-release game (at the time I am writing this), it seems like a very well polished product, and I can only look forward to any additions the developers plan to add.\n\nRight, now I have to get back and restock before opening time.

It's still in early access, so you have to take that into account for sure. I really enjoy this game, it adds new exciting mechanics to a shop-owner game, like keeping the place clean and maintained and defending from attacks. I think it would be cool for there to be people who you can give quests to (like shop keepers do in a lot of games) so that they can bring back certain special items for you to display that give better appeal or special bonuses, or maybe crafting items. That's another thing too, item crafting would be very cool, instead of just ordering items and selling them, maybe it would add a bit more interactivity with the items.\nCouple things I noticed that I didn't like, although it gave me a laugh and made me enjoy it while it happened, is the customers (peasants?) walk up to me, pick me up over their heads, and drop me behind them! They could just say excuse me and walk around! Also, the dirt that they track around seems to be a bit much. I understand when they come in, but after 5 minutes wandering around the shoppe, they shouldn't be tracking so much around.\n\nI found it to be very hilarious, it definitely gave me a laugh! I like this game and will continue to play it for sure! Thanks for the game, and keep up the great work with it, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game!\n\nI made a video too, if anyone is interesting in seeing!

Assuming this game does not become abandoned by the developers, this will become one of my highest played titles. The game is, at it's core, an exponential management simulation. The game captures the best part of any management sim, which is the ability to create something you're proud of and then sit back and watch it flourish. My favorite thing about the game is that it can be played at any level of concentration; if you focus completely on the game you can run your shop optimally and make tons of money; or you could just simply let the game run in the background, occasionally returning focus to restock some shelves and sweep up.","October 21, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But from what i've seen, they update the game daily, so alot of these get fixed very quickly.

It also is teasing at livestock out back of your shop, so maybe things like pigs and cows?  And the shop has gotten a complete makeover,as it now has a much larger back room, and the action to extend sections of the shop.  although i have one thing i found. i believe that in the next update the back yard will be unlocked, and you'll be able to farm crops, as alot of customers have been asking about fruits and vegetables.\nGood job Kris and Otto, you guy's have made a wonderful update. new score: 8/10 much better than before and shows even more potential now!","August 25, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Over the days you take small profits earned and invest them back into the shoppe in the form of new displays, room expansions, and of course purchasing new inventory. Unfortunately, it's not an incredibly deep game as of yet. There is a system of crafting that is rather convoluted and will require a guide if you want to actually make an item rather than waste money. There is also a champion in your shoppe whom you can send out on quests resulting in either new (potentially rare) items to sell, or a KO and a waste of your investment.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, if a bit samey (you'll be hearing the same few pieces several times per play session), and the game has a sense of humor to it. There are definitely aspects that need to be fleshed out further (and I suspect they will be as the game is developed). Additionally, there are some quality of life updates that would go a long way to make the game more enjoyable (e.g. an ability to sort your inventory).\n\nDue note that there have been some major bugs during development. The devs have shown that they're on top of getting things fixed as soon as they can, but you will still possible experience points where the game is very frustrating to play due to bugs. Shoppe Keep is quite clearly an example of a game much earlier in development than some others that have been bade available for Early Access.\n\nAll that said, this is a fantastic concept, and thus far shows really strong promise. It's very much playable as-is, and can be very engrossing if you let it get there. It's not particularly deep as of yet, but it's definitely deep enough to get your money's worth.","October 22, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I have 1 main problem, that could be split into two. And thats balancing.\n\nThe early game potions are good, but mushroom seeds are incredibly cheap (18 gold) and the grown mushrooms sell for a base amount of approx 90 gold. Which means within 2-3 days you will be able to have over 1k gold, which is a huge amount. The skills are also incredibly cheap, as you could have all of the skills before the end of day 2. Which means you could essentially finish the game before the end of the first week. And as each day seems to be at least 10 minutes, but probably more, there is not much (that I'm aware of) to keep you going.\n\nOf course as the game is still early access these could all be easily remedied in the future. But otherwise there are few, if any bugs in the game right now.\n\nAnd the best part of the game is jumping. Seriously, try it.

The game has been updated and fixed to where there are no game breaking bugs, the only problem is the Helper Bot gets stuck in corners sometimes. This game is really fun and kind of unique. First Person perspective of building and maintaining your own fantasy/medieval shop (as you can see from the videos). Sell potions, upgrade shop. Sell weapons and armor. Craft, enchant, and modify weapons and armor, sell for more gold. It's a great, playable game. Thieves will come and steal, but it isnt too bad because you can, A. Chase them down the street and kill them. Or B. Spend a few XP and get an electric barrier for theives to be blown to bits before they get outside. Barbarians will come and try to destroy all you have worked hard on. Get the advantage by fighting them outside. Rinse and repeat, make more gold, sell more items, upgrade your shop. Not a bad game in the state it's in. Just needs more items to buy/craft and sell. Good enough to spend time while waiting on WoW queues or dailies to reset. That's all I have to say about that. Cheers.","October 22, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However... There are so many game breaking bugs that I just can't recommend it as it is. The 2 main bugs I've experienced are The shop refusing to save your shop, even when you click the 'save shop' button. And the second is the shop not closing for the end of the day, that combined with the first bug can undo an hour of work. And both these bugs have happened to me the last two games I've played.\n\nI'm sure this will be really good in the future, i even find myself going back to it now even with these bugs, but right now, i can't recommend.","October 18, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Assuming this game does not become abandoned by the developers, this will become one of my highest played titles. The game is, at it's core, an exponential management simulation. The game captures the best part of any management sim, which is the ability to create something you're proud of and then sit back and watch it flourish. My favorite thing about the game is that it can be played at any level of concentration; if you focus completely on the game you can run your shop optimally and make tons of money; or you could just simply let the game run in the background, occasionally returning focus to restock some shelves and sweep up.","October 21, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hate wizards? Don't stock any mana potions. Want to get straight to the point? Only sell swords! Think your back wall keeps looking at you funny? Knock it down!\n\nSo far Shoppe Keep has proven to be an interesting and entertaining little game where you get to run your own shop, your own way.

Maybe even a bit boring at times. However, it is still a good game. Unfortunately, this game has some issues to work out.\n\n1: DIRT. A LOT OF IT. So much that you will spend more than 50% of your time sweeping the ground. Sure, you can purchase a floor mat to help, but they break within a minute. Floor mats should last MUCH longer. Maybe at least half a day of dozens of people walking in and out every second.\n2: Day/Night cycle. I just got a bug that broke this. Upon the day ending, the doors did not close, and nothing I could do couold reset the day/night cycle back again. Couldn't skip using the watch, couldn't press e, nothing. Fix that.\n3: Jumping. Not that much of an issue, but it would REALLY help with mobility. That's my recommendation. Screw that stupid message that pops up when you press the space bar.\n4: Staff NPC's. This could really help, since you're just a single player trying to manage a shop for which there are DOZENS upon DOZENS of customers. Some cashiers, some restockers, that sorta thing. The Help Bots that cost 900 (base and bot together) is kinda helpful, but not much.\n\nIf you can get past all these, though, then it's a fun game. I really enjoy it.","August 27, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short, if you like RPGs - Buy This Game. It isn't actually an RPG, but the setting and things you sell are in that realm. I would define it as a Store Simulation game. It is a very fun game.\n\nWhen you begin a game the learning curve is STEEP, but do not let that deter you. In my shoppe at around level 5-6 I COULD NOT keep up with the customers!! Wizard's Hats were flying off the hat rack!!! Never thought I'd get rid of those robes, though. Gloves sell pretty well, too. Just don't get greedy and try to sell too high.\n\nTry to "thief-proof" your shoppe ASAP using the points that you gain from playing. And keep that floor CLEAN. And Repair those displays, too. Did you order more inventory yet?? AHHHH!!!\n\nAnd I'm just STARTING the game. Can't wait to buy a Bot.

I absoultely love it. I'll place a basic list of pros and cons that should suffice anyone unsure of making the purchase.\n\nPros:\n\n- At $5 USD this game is WELL worth it\n- More video and audio options than expected\n- Clean, easy-to-use interface\n- Progression system featuring several unlockable skills\n- Barbarians will attack; however, they're very easy to thwart\n- Farming plots are available for you to grow three products\n- Several objects may be purchased and placed freely to display products\n- Additional rooms may be purchased to expand the size of the store\n\nCons:\n\n- Barbarians take literally two hits to kill; making them little to no threat\n- Thieves will steal from you even if you're standing directly next to them - this feels very unrealistic\n- There is a severe lacking in the items you can sell - I believe roughly 20 - 30\n\nNow, I do understand that this game is early access. Hopefully some of these issues will be addressed, along with the bugs. I myself have encountered only one bug so far, and that's with the doors to the shop not closing; causing the game to stay on that day and never progress. The only solution I've found is to completely restart. I BELIEVE this is caused by floor mats. Any time I place a floor mat, the following day the bug occurs. Maybe that's the solution?\n\nOverall, this game is well worth the purchase. If you enjoy management games, drop the $5 USD and give it a try. You likely won't be dissappointed.","September 19, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now is your chance to be on the other side of the counter. This game lets you run your own shop. It is like they took the Pawn Stars iPhone Game and mashed it together with all those old RPG games we used to play. You start off with 25 Gold then you use it to buy items to sell to all those adventurers. Things like Potions, Swords, Armor etc. You choose the mark up but if its too high your patrons get angry and trash your store. Take the profits use it to by more items and displays and repeat. You can expand your shop and you will need to fight off shoplifters and barbarians. You can purchase power ups which give you additional bonuses.

I bought it on thursday. I was like "Oh, lets play for a while, it looks good." Yea, I had to wake up at 8 a.m. on friday, but because of the game, I went to sleep at 3:30 a.m. on friday. I was dead the whole friday while visiting my girlfriend. But faking worth it.\n\nYes, what I suggest is:\n- Some kind of invertory, chest, or something like that, you know, where you can store your items so you dont have to hold them all in your hands! Please developers! <3\n- More items you can order from the list.\n- More recipes of course.\n- More places for planting weed, mushrooms and so on.\n- Taking items back from that adventure man.\n- Taking items back from the alchemy thing, you know, I dont know how it's called in english, because you mess up the recipe you know and then what, you are ♥♥♥♥d up.\n- Reduce the lags, I mean graphics lags. The more people in the shop, the less FPS - Do it better my friends, please, I love you developers! You can do it!\n- Some places you can visit or maybe more buildings where you do your business you know, selling weed and stuff. Or maybe you can choose your building where to sell your things from the begining. Just my opinion, yes, you know.\n\nBugs I would really like to see fixed, maybe I will in the upcoming patch:\n- Problem with picking up items after thiefs steal them or after they just drop from table or whatever.\n- Problem with planting and collecting seeds. You cant really target them, almost the same as the previous problem.\n- After crafting many items, big items such as chests, they just explode or what is that and they can end up on the next side of the shop or they just disappear.\n- Real numbers of HP and Damage on the adventure guy. I mean, you dont get more damage with weed and with sword just 7 or how much... Wait what? You do? Oh sorry, I never smoked weed. Sorry, my fault.\n- Customers get stuck very often. Like imagine my lovely developers, you are like the best business guy in the city, best prices, golden items, so everyone wants to visit your shop. But there isnt so much space, so they are like "Fak yu man, I want to go there..." "No no no I!! Want to go there!" And yes, what happens? They get stuck!\n- Sometimes when you pick up corpse or skeleton, it just goes Whoaaa and its all over the shop. You know what I mean.\n- Cant remember more bugs, but remember developers, I love this game and everything about it, so fix it and maybe I will even marry you. All of you!\n\nPerfect game, I love this game, love the idea, love them developers. Keep up with the good work!\nBuy the game, its addictive. And you can do your own business with weed.

You start off really small with maybe a few pedestals on which to pedal your potions and make a few gold. After you've sold enough potions you buy a table so you can sell bigger and better things, and before you know it you're running any RPG player's favorite supermarket.\n\nPros:\n\n+Excelent music, after several hours I never got bored of listening to the game's soundtrack\n+Very good art style, the graphics aren't very good but the game is still nice to look at\n+Kind of addicting, I love starting this game up every now and again to sell some items and watch my shop grow\n+Selling items is very satisfying, the cha-ching of gold being made is a very hard sound to get tired of\n\n~The game has some pretty hilarious graphical glitches with dead bodies that I love to exploit, not sure if this is a pro or  a con for some\n\nCons:\n\n-Pretty buggy, but there are no game breaking bugs I am aware of. These are mostly graphical and don't impact gameplay a significant amount at all\n-Perhaps a little too easy\n-There are a few seemingly useless mechanics in it, such as the grinder and the cauldron. I never used these and my shop still makes bank.\n\nThe Verdict: Excelent game in which to sink a few hours and have a pleasant time. I hope the devs still update it often and keep improving it. I can definitely reccomend it in it's current state, most of the game is done and is very enjoyable.\n","December 21, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a lot of potential and is different than anything i've played before. The biggest issue is the user interface for me. Granted this is early access, doing things in this game is not easy as it should be (easy to understand, hard to get the game to 'do' what you want).\n\nPros:\n1. Fairly unique game play and interesting premise.\n2. has a lot of potential.\n\ncons:\n1. User interface is clunky and currently buggy.\n2. Not easy to manipulate items you buy (like once you buy a pedestal or shelf, if you accidentally place it the wrong way, it's not easy to fix. I sold a 100 gold weapon stand, and got like 3gold back from selling it....wtf.\n3. Once a ton of people go to your shop, it's so easy to steal your stuff.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Need to be able to hire guards.\n2. Need to be able to hire sweepers.\n3. User interface should have a dedicated button for all functions.\n4. Need to be able to open/close when needed.\n5. Would be better to start off really small, like with just a stall (instead of a whole store). Work your way up from a stall to a shop.\n6. Queue multiple orders.\n7.

The only other game I can think of that was close even if for a bit is Recettear. I love the soundtrack, the art, the idea, the game is even stable for an early access game, it's very promising. I highly recommend it since this genre is very rare and it's crazy fun to play, but I will list what I don't like about the game rather than what I like about it.\n\nMy problem with the game is that it gets repetitive very quickly. Cleaning the floor after customers gets extremely tedious, and the matt can only save you for one period of the day (Morning period). I wish we could have someone to help cleaning, returning items to their place after getting thrown away by customers. Add an employee option and put a daily payment to him as a salary. The shop gets big, way too big and there's no way to just manage everything by yourself.\n\nThe other thing is stock, I wish we can control which stock is for each spot (table, cabinet, etc) So when we buy new stock we don't have to go every damn time to put the new stock in the spots while you have to also clean the floor, return items after being thrown, chase thieves, buy new stock, I mean there's a limit to what one man can do. It might sound like I want this game to be easier, but no, I want it to be convenient but still challenging, I own the shop but it feels like I am being punished rather than running a shop.

I know there's a quest system but it needs more depth.\n\nAs it stands right now, I'm shocked that people have to pay money for these games under the guise of being 'early access'.","February 20","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just bought the game and i've already put 4 hours in it. For the 7$ I payed for it, I would suggest it to anyone and everyone. The game is clean fun, great for children and adults alike. It does have some lacking features, but hey, what game doesn't while in Alpha. If the game were to do something with a barter system outside of your shop, maybe competetion with other shops, or even multiplayer with friends, that would set it off completely. But not to jump topics too much, the game is great and is going on the right track at being a game of its own kind.\n\nWhat to expect:\nSlow mornings, over bearing days, some glitching AI at times (pathfinding directly into my right wall that hasn't been torn down.), and I found this hilarious, TONS of women thieves. I laughed pretty hard after my first thief, which was a male and after that i've literally played 3:30 hours more than that and i've had NOTHING but women thieves. Anyway guys, keep up the good work on this game, it's worth the buy for sure and I hope to see more updates coming through.\n\nWhat to fix:\nWhen you are adding the audio, instead of making it load at the location where you press space, try making it set to your camera. That will allow sound to travel with your character.","February 21","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it for around $6 during a sale. I have put almost 40 hours into it. Since the game is in alpha state, one would presume that there is much to look foward to in the future for this game. I already enjoy playing it, but it becomes a bit monotonous after playing for an hour or two. I am sure that once the game is further into development that some of the tedium will be relieved by more features. I am looking foward to the future patches to see whether they turn this game into a true gem or go the other route. Hopefully they will not abandon it or choose poorly during the development of this game.","February 9","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I highly recommend the game. The Devs stay on top of the game design and they talk to us and let us know that they hear us! Not sure how to get a message to the Devs but thought I would report a few minor needs. We need to Jump and Crouch, even just for the sake of doing those things. Cannot reach the bottom of the shelves for example or placing furniture around and you cannot get to the middle one because there is no snap to floor for placement. Not sure if its going in the Devs future plans, but I think certain items should sell better during certain Seasons and Weather conditions. ie. That there should be a 1 or 2 day warning that a Big Black Dragon is in the area and "immunity to acid breath potions will be in great demand" so you can higher the prices. Would be nice to see the adventurers interacting. Various things like that would add a lot of depth to the game. Still! Fun game!","January 5","true","74.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I downloaded it and tried playing it, excited for an interesting new concept. It wasn't a good first impression: I was utterly confused, had trouble with the menus, bad graphics, and they just took out the major feature of scenarios. I was pretty bummed that I couldn't play it, but I knew it was in Early Access and had a ton of faith in the game, so I kept it in my library.\n\nOpened it up today after seeing consistent updates, and tried it out again. It has improved so much, and I love where the developers are going. I haven't gotten too far into everything, but it's looking great, and I know there's more I gotta unlock. The graphics look pretty decent for early access, but could still use a lot of polish and fine-tuning.

Do not buy in the current state, this game is early access and had no business releasing. Wait a few months, see if the updates keep coming in like the devs claim they will.

I already enjoy playing it, but it becomes a bit monotonous after playing for an hour or two. I am sure that once the game is further into development that some of the tedium will be relieved by more features.

You need over 5K in skill points not including the 2K extra you need from the main menu from other things. The game requires you to do a lot of repeat things like sell, restock, and buy. As per the name: shoppe keep. You own a shop.\n\nI can recommend this for adult who are bored but not for people that want fast progress as the game is super grindy. There isn't a lot to do other than buy, sell, restock. You get something called keep points, you will nmeed that to expands and keep playing. However it will not hold your attention. The game devs seem to be at a point where game updates are slow because it all depends off of one human being. So this will be a 1 man project for an endless amount of time. It is in phase 2 of developement. Many bugs harbor it. You can't even play comfortably in high rez. So wait a wait until it's fixed. Too much broken stuff currently.\n\nThe game devs had a huge part into what they offer including the drug scene. I dont recommend this for children as you will be growing a lot of drugs for npcs. With that being said, there is no real emerision so I suggest waiting until this game has more to offer and keeping it away from children. Seems cool but doesn't have all the things I wish it did. It's kinda boring after you reach a certain point. You can't zoom out. With only 1 real dev, this will take yrs to finish.","February 14","true","172.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I emailed to developers and they told me i'd have to wait for the next update. Finally after checking it every week for an update, after about 3 months of waiting, they finally updated it so i could play. The problem is thier was way too many bugs and it was really choppy. This is really weird because i have a nice enough computer to play Fall out 4 on high graphics, but i can't even run this game on low. Every week i still check back when they update and  everytime i play it's still really choppy and the list of bugs keeps adding up. Its really nice that they are adding new content, but i feel like they should probably put some focus on making this game some what playable.\n\nCons\n-Really choppy/lagging even with a good computer\n-Everytime they update it thier is a new bug\n-They never go and fix the bugs\n-When you try and contact the developers to help fix things they tell you just to wait for the next update\n\nPros\n-Constant content updates(Not much bug fixes)\n-Fun game(If you can play)","February 5","false","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechanics are all great and function well enough. There's a minor bug where to place items you have to open up the order menu and then back out, but it's still early access, so it's okay. You can enable Xbox 360 controllers, but it doesn't work in menus at all and while you can use the mouse in the menus, you can't see the cursor, but, again, early access. I'd say it's a good buy and I can't wait to see where it goes.\n\nThere are quite a few bugs, but the game shows a lot of promise, so hopefully everything will get fixed and I'll have a nice little time waster.","December 11, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As simple and dumb as it might seem it's actually very fun but very broken at the same time. Having frequent bugs is keeping me from playing like I should.\n\nThe time would keep extending, keeping the doors from closing and having a new day start. Occassionally the ordering system wouldn't work, keeping you from ordering any new product. Sometimes when I would exit the game and reload my save all the product would sell for 0 creating a massive loss. Maybe it's just my configuration (Windows 10 64bit) but Shoppe Keep is pretty near impossible to play in its current state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSinnersCreed/recommended/381120/","TheSinnersCreed","TheSinnersCreed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSinnersCreed/","119 products in account","So as of my review I have put 3 hours into this game, 1 over the refund limit. That's okay, I'll keep this buggy gem however a few words of caution to the less patient gamer(s) on STEAM...\n\ntl;dr Buggy but shows promise, pick it up if you're not strapped for cash and enjoy managing your patience and shop simultaneously.\n\nFirst off, the major turn off, we'll get this outta the way first. Dev's pay attention, this early deal breaker will frustrate about 75% of your early supporters and have an overall negative impact on sales.\n\n- Controller ALMOST Supported. The buttons overlap one another and even the main cursor on the home screen disappears if you hit a left or right key at an inopportune moment. If you tap left or right while in game and do not have an item in hand, it'll stil affect the price change differential. These over-lapping commands can be very frustrating, especially in the in-game menus such as ordering and skills/perks and when trying to interact with customers directly while out and about in town.\n\ni.e. I walk up to Warrior Smith and hit the action button, the dialogue box pops up however the default cursor position is nowhere to be found. If you hit up, right or left the cursor will just never appear no matter what other button combination you press and instead you MUST hit down to have it default to the center option of the three.\n\ni.o.e. On the VERY FIRST SCREEN of the game, where you pick the controller option itself once you do you can hit the confirm button to get in after you hit up on the cursor pad instead of it defaulting to the start option and then once it gets into the main menu you must again hit right to get it to populate onto the options such as load game, new, ect and this persists throughout.\n\n\nNOW, that's aside and fully detailed let's get onto the good aspects of this game and why I'd recommend this game (especially in its final form)..\n\n- As a SIM game goes it's a good one. Granted I thought I was going to unlock new furniture by level but yet it's by "K" points so I was a few days behind having proper shelving but that aside it's a decent RPG type Sim as in you sell Potions and Gear. This alone would make it worth $5 on sale because even a solid premise like this is hard to come by.\n\n- Decent selection as you progress. Obviously you're going to sell the Plate Gear but people will still WANT the Leather stuff too. The balance could still use some tweaking but overall people still are generally okay with buying a decent spread of items if you allow your shop to have them.\n\n- The game is growing and it appears the Devs are trying to fix things. This is a big plus, considering how STEAM is full of "Let me try to make a game, oh wait I hit a bump; let me take the small amount of money I made and scram because I'm in over my head" Game Developers that buy RPG Maker or some like engine on sale and make some rudimentary muck.\n\n- Music is catchy, humming worthy actually. While they could use some work on timing, as one will bleed into the other if it coincides with a change of day mode (morning, afternoon, evening).\n\n- Once you get the hang of the bugs the game becomes fun. They will be fixed I presume and that's really the biggest drawback.\n\n\nNow there are a few places that could use work...\n\n- Obviously the graphics, I mean even the generic ground texture outside looks like it's from Windows 98. I get that its trying to balance for optimization but c'mon... this is like Runescape level comapred to what you can do with most engines..\n\n- Music DOES get a bit repetative because the scale of the tracks aren't that varied. Not horrible but sometimse that humming isn't because you WANT to... if you know what I mean..\n\n- Quest / K-Points. First off, I mean... K points? Really? Can't be "Influence" or "customer loyalty" or "generic term here" points but just a letter with no real symbolism beside it? Also the Quests need some work. Having 5 quests avialble and three of them are the same potion quests and the other two are the OTHER potion quests are ... a bit ... lacking? Yes, lacking. You have all those items and like, 8 quests?\n\n- I had a whole day, right after I bought Plate for the first time, that I did not get a SINGLE CUSTOMER. I sat there for 15 minutes staring at an empty room. I honestly felt like I was trolled by the game at that point. I'm amused now, but at the time not so much.\n\n- Buggy Menus. You know why... you know what to do... don't make me say it a third time.\n\n- See Above.\n\n- As always, more items, customer types and furniture but these are things that will come with time so whatever.\n\nSO FINALLY! To those who made it this far let's give it the final breakdown!\n\nGraphics? 3\nSound? 4\nControls? 1\nGameplay? 5\n\nVerdict? You'll spend $10 on something that'll be worse for your health in the next week than this game; at least you'll enjoy this longer.\n\nWhat else can I say? If you have the spare money, kill an innocent or two. If you're going to be known for being a crazy shop keeper that'll kill you if you don't buy anything is better than not being known at all. Also, dumpster-diving, not just for bums and my ex girlfriend's body.","June 1","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
