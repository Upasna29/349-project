But be aware that it's a way outdated (made in 2005), and even then it wasn't able to compete with Splinter Cell.\nWhy buy it? Well, it's cheap, and it's a spy-story stealth game. You can pass without killing, by fabricating your own devices like rubber bullets, silencers and ether mines from a junk and using cool x-ray camera to look behind, well, almost everything. Oh, if you remember old James Bond game, Nightfire - sorry, it's not That cool.\nJust keep in mind that there are great games for this genre, like NOLF or Deus Ex, and there are some mediocre and generic, like this one or that JB Nightfire I've mentioned. Some levels are repeating, some actions are boring, but, all in all, it is still a solid piece of gaming, if you're up to this genre, in first place.\n\nBest of luck for you, anyways!","January 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 247 of 310 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","247","310","0","5"

It felt like I was interacting in a cheesy spy novel, and it did a good job at it. Well, this is a third person stealth/action shooter. The first six to eight levels are more stealth oriented, but once the Russion Special Forces, (spetsnaz) are sent after you, you can pretty much kiss stealth goodbye. It's all shooting from there. It implements a system where you can collect gadgets lying around like rags, alarm clocks, plastic bottles, cans, chemicles, ect. and McGyver them into cheep tools for temporary use. For example, you can use a plastic bottle and rag at the end of your barrel for a cheep, disposible silencer. You can also make explosives, paralyzing chemicle agents, and other completely implausible but fun innovations. But not to worry. It is a very easy system to pick up with very little learning curve. The story is told through a series of comic book-like cutsceens between missions with corny, voice-acted Russian accents that, (in my opinion) adds a lot of charm to this game. I found myself drawn into it and empathizing with the characters. Also I loved the ending! This game is cheep, the controls are very good, the graphics are great for 2005, there is a quicksave system as opposed to a checkpoint saving system, and I ask you: what other game allows you to have a shootout inside of Lenin's tomb? This game has a lot of atmopshere and I highly recommend it. Honestly, if there is anything even remotely negative I can think to say about it, it is that the character moves kind of slow, and has a lot of wide open ground to cover. The sprint system only works for a few moments before your character gets tired and has to rest, so traveling while sprinting isn't too much faster in the long run than walking. Traveling from one side of a map to another can be a bit tedious. But this is a very minor complaint. This game is a definite winner.","May 1, 2014","true","16.0"," 60 of 73 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","60","73","0","7"

It is some kind of 3rd person view No One Lives Forever with hand-made gadgets which starring a journalist. It was really good first. I even planned to recommend it to you, but then, i got bored because of some problems and changed my mind. There are some summarized pros. and cons. below:\n\nPros	 + Story is interesting enough\n+ Graphics are already outdated but it isn't ugly at all.\n+ Some unique attractions like gadget crafting and X-Ray camera\n\nNeutral	  No widescreen support. Control scheme a little bit weird and dull, but somewhat useful as well. Especially setting your walking speed with mouse wheel is a good idea. Music is OK but repetitive.\n\nCons - Stealth is a little bit dull. You can't do so much actions for best stealth results. Furthermore, at the last half of the game, say goodbye to stealth.\n- Characters you control can't run. They pretend to do so but they seems like they are taking a stroll on the park. Any NPC runs well though.\n- Aiming is bad. You can't change shoulders while aiming, so, time by time you can't see the target properly.\n- You're playing on same locations over and over again.\n- Planting gadgets like mines is deceptive. You have to stop the desired plant location first, then you have to highlight the gadget on the menu and left click to insta-plant.\n- Background sound effects are annoying.\n- A frustrating bug on Meltdown level ( spoiler:  When you try to stop meltdown in Chernobyl, you have to press two buttons and start the crane, right? Be careful, you have to use these buttons first or else... you can't use crane again. That means you need to restart the level.  )\n\nAfter all, it worth for $1,25 but don't expect too much. Especially after the last half, quality of the game started to decrease in my humble opinion.\n\np.s. written in 26 August 2014\nedited for new formatting options only (blue texts)","August 25, 2014","false","9.9"," 54 of 69 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","54","69","0","0"

The AI's fairly solid (although sometimes they are somewhat blind), and a few parts of the story are a little bit out of place, but overall it's a great game. There are quite a few cool strategic items that can be crafted from basic components, and the maps have plenty of hiding places. Enemies are able to lose you but will work together to corner you at times. The campaign lasted about twelve hours for me, but that includes a lot of searching and backtracking for items, because that's the kind of player I am. Someone who just rushes through might only take six hours to finish the game.\n\nThe mechanics are solid, the graphics are nice for the time it was published, the sound is well-done, the levels are challenging, and the gameplay is fun overall. If you like third-person stealth-'em-ups then this is the game for you. Even if it is a bit over 8 years old, it's still worth the five dollars, or perhaps a tad more.","January 9, 2014","true","12.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","29","46","0","0"

My initial impression was mostly correct, this is essentially a low-budget version of splinter cell, but it is done well and if you enjoy stealth games you will probably like this.\n\nThe stealth is handled well, you have a visibility meter which shows how visible you are, and you have 4 movement speeds.  The slowest movement speed moves very slow(obv) but the enemies cannot hear you even if you are right behind them and as you increase in speed the enemies will be able to hear you from farther and farther away.  Movement is easily toggled and as you learn the correct distances to which an enemy can hear you, quickly toggling your speed becomes second nature.\n\nYou also are kind of a MacGyver, you find junk lying around(cans, plastic bottles, etc etc) and you can use this junk to craft al manner of items which make being stealthy easier and easier.  You unlock blueprints as they game goes on and once you unlock a print you can craft that item if you have the proper junk for it, is is all easily done and very intuititve.  The gadgets overall are very cool, you can make a slingshot and craft all manner of silent ammo for it, you can lay traps for enemies(both quiet and non-lethal to loud and boomy) and you can even create luring devices that will make your enemies plod right into your mine, provided you lay the trap in a dark place.  If you drop a mine in the light the enemies will see it and disarm it.\n\nYou also get an x-ray camera weapon which is beyond cool, it lets you see through walls and locate enemies before they can see you, and it even damages enemies through walls, although ammo is limited for it, it is very cool to be able to just blast enemies silently through a wall.\n\nThere are only 2 guns in the game, the pistol and an ak-47.  The vast majority of the game is stealth but there are a few run n gun sections, and luckily the gunplay handles well enough, although it is easy to bait the enemies into choke points and just blast them as they walk through.\n\nThe story is good, and rather lengthy, the game took me about 11-12 hours to complete and there are several twists and turns as the story progresses, it is entertaining and mostly well done.  There is also a save anywhere function which comes in handy, just be warned the game only auto saves at the start of levels so make sure you use the save system because the missions are generally pretty lengthy.\n\nAt a sale price of $1.24 this game was a steal, but even at the full price of 5 dollars you are getting your moneys worth.  If you enjoy stealth games like splinter cell you should pick this up, it is not as good or polished as that game, but it is a good time and well worth the low asking price.","August 24, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The conspiracy in here buffs up the plot quite a bit.\nIf you can find this on sale, do it. You may get a couple days of gameplay out of it, depending on your styles. I'm glad I found this on sale.

Sure, the animations are a bit wonky by today's standards and the highest available resolution is 1024x768, but the game runs at  smooth 60fps at my crappy lappot with stuff going on in the background.\n\nThis game wins my heart because of its setting and story. There is no other game in which you can stealth around Charnobyl, Kremlin AND Lubyanka. The AI is good as well, it is not perfect, but enemies will seek cover during firefights instead of standing in the middle of the room like bunch of idiots. They are not pansies too, they were trained in the Glorious Soviet Union, so they hurt. Really hurt.\nThe crafting system is good, I have no idea how Carter knows how to make a mine out of a can and three bullets, but it works in the game and is balanced, so I won't dig much. Maybe he was trained by the CIA after all... The 'camera' is a great gameplay tool as well.\n\nThere are of course some bad things. Apart from a bit dated visuals, which do not look bad if you ask me, the missions in which you control Comrade Grushkov are in my opinion the worst. Sure, I get it, he's a soldier so he does not sneak around, but in one of 'his' levels the enemies literally spawn in front of you. This also happens in one place towards the end of the campaign. All in all, the final few missions are IMO worse than the rest of the game, but your milage may wary.\n\nAll in all, for the asking price of 5EUR, and possibly even lower if you consider buying this on sale, it gives you a solid campaign with very unusual setting and challenging gameplay. I've finished the story in 7 hours on normal, but I've played the game at least twice few years ago, so I still remembered what to do and where to go.\n\nTL;DR: If you're not terrified of dated visuals and have few bucks lying around, give it a try.","February 15","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
