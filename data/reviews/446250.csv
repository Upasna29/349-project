Either it sucks or it sucks so much that Steam have to call in extra employees to sit on the edges of the storefront, lest it collapses in on itself like a neutron star and murders us all.\n\nSilver Bullet: Prometheus isn't a horrible game which makes it all the more unfortunate that it turns out to be a victim of its prior Android/iOS mechanics. Originally, the game was played by tapping enemies for your run-of-the-mill-foxy-lady-with-an-attitude protagonist to shoot, rather than giving you independent control of the gunplay. This has been switched out in favour of just right-clicking in the general area of whatever zombie, drug-dealer or robot ghost samurai you're trying to kill, making it nearly impossible to single enemies out.\n\nWhile that makes it mind-numbingly simple to navigate the first half of the game (honestly, closing your eyes and clicking the screen would yield very similar results), the slapdash targeting becomes frustrating in boss battles, especially when you come up against mechanoid terror spiders that fire an onslaught of missiles at you that need shooting down.\n\nVisually, Silver Bullet looks lovely and the chunky arcade UI and character modelling is a big plus. There's 45 stages to plough through with objectives varying from escort, base defence and outright slaughter as well as an arena mode to level yourself up in for an in-game advantage. It just hasn't translated at all well from its point of origin. A shooter where you have precious little control over what you actually shoot. Can't recommend it sadly.\n\nFull review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ_fpIFukS4","April 8","false","1.8"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","85","58","68","13","2"

At times it even says to "touch the screen"\n\nThe game is incredibly repetitive, there are some levels where there is only 1 enemy type, duplicated over and over again. There is no randomisation of sound either, so all these identical enemies say exactly the same thing when they see you, and when they die. you're running through the level and it's just this constant  loop of\nHEY! URG! HEY! URG! HEY! URG! HEY! URG!\n\nI played about the first 10 levels, there is some (very limited) variation in the objective and a few (simple) bosses.\n\nIt's not terrible, but there are better top view shooters out there.\n\n\n","April 29","false","0.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The story is interesting and has a touch of a dark feel. It has varied enemies with good story progression and bosses that take a mix of skill, evasion, and timing to defeat. Not overly difficult and just plain fun to play.","May 2","true","0.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Though there is some cool features, this game is basically not so kind to players, not so speedy, not so easy. The worst thing is poor UI.\n\nBut, in my case, this game is not so bad. Actually good. I like the stylish targeting & shooting. I like the bosses that have each other characters. I like the story - some people think it is poor, as there are just dialogues without any cut scene or ilust image, but it remind me the old Metal Gear.\n\nI'm playing the chapter 28. The half of the game was easy and predictable at first, But now there are more puzzles and it is getting more challenging. I expect this game is getting more interesting.\n\nSo, that's all. Choice is yours.","May 6","true","9.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
