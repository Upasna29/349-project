She was beautiful, the game is gorgeous. She had such elegance; WoP is very polished as a game. She has these abundance of little quirks (twirling hair, giggle, etc) that made you go wild, WoP has features to drool for (storyline, video replay, squadron control, etc).\n\nThen one day you just don’t get excited to spend time together anymore, the romance fades, you realize she has no personality and is becoming obnoxious with her emotional issues. The replay ability is lost, you get frustrated with the poor aerial match-ups, there is no customization or sand box mode, and your AI enemies always seem to defy the laws of physics.\n\nBut no matter what, it was a fun ride while it lasted. 80%","July 1, 2013","true","9.9"," 68 of 78 people (87%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","87","68","78","34","2"

However, the graphics look really great, I have it on ultra-turbo-awesome and it's very noticeably different from 360.\n\nThe best part is the immense configurability for joysticks. It's so good that I spent the first 45 minutes just making small changes to the layouts, including sensitivity of axes, deadzones, and non-linearity. With a little effort, you can get your dream control scheme on any joystick.\n\nAll this for $10 is a solid deal in my opinion.

I had forgotten what a fun little game this is.  It really sucks that the multiplayer is degraded, but it is still fun.\n\nIf you are looking for a high fidelity sim then look elsewhere.  This is not a study sim like Falcon 4, DCS A-10C, or the IL-2 Series.  It is a bit arcadey but the physics are fairly responsive and realistic and the visuals are outstanding.  Campaign missions flow in their own way, and you get to experience several different sides to WW2 flying.  With the addition of the Luftaffe DLC it seems to provide a reasonable all round experience.\n\nCombat is a bit arcadey with fairly predictable AI and an overwhelming urge to be the lone saviour of every battle.  It is, however, easy to task wingmen to perform essential roles thus relieving you of the burden of the missio0n so you can go round shooting everything that flies :-).\n\nAs for controls, being a bit of a flight sim nutter, I used one of my simple joysticks with no issues. I cannot comment on any other control method as I have not tried them and don't really intend to.  Joystick was simple to set up and allowed me to use almost every function from the stick without having to resort ot the keyboard very often at all.\n\nAll in all this is an enjoyable semi-sim.  I would recommend it if you want an easy to get into light sim.  For a flight sim nut...probably not unless you are looking for an entertaining session of blowing s**t up.","December 27, 2013","true","11.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

Looks and sounds great, exciting to play, but lacks in mission design, AI and flight model.\n\n+Lots of missions and planes.\n+Great visuals. Variety of day/night and weather conditions. Nice effects: glare, cockpit scratches, damage (bullet holes, damaged ailerons, broken gauges etc.). Cockpits look great.\n+Immersive 5.1 sound.\n\n-Some of the missions in the campaign are frustratingly difficult. Some are bugged (e.g. objectives not triggering correctly).\n-Stalls are a bit unrealistic.\n-Poor documentation: Some things are never explained, like how the I-16 engine will die if you pull negative Gs, or how to use propeller pitch and radiator.\n-Haven't played MP, but looks like online is basically dead.\n\n~TrackIR is a big advantage, both for watching your six in dogfights and for spotting ground targets.\n~Joystick (preferably HOTAS) is a must.

Not only is the multiplayer now obsolete (thanks in part to Gaijin's recent F2P release in WarThunder) but Wings of Prey requires the use of an external client in Yuplay which doesn't like Steam all that much. Aside from this Wings of Prey itself is a fairly by the numbers flight sim, only surpassing its competitors for visual fidelity. While Wings of Prey supports many different controller inputs, including flightsticks, the feel of the controls themselves aren't as smooth as you might hope. The single-player modes offered in this release also underwhelm for having little consistency or flow between levels and the challenge delivered, regardless of adjustable simulation settings and respawn options. Voice acting likewise varies in that English dialogue is exceedingly poor, even though native dialects sound as they should (e.g. Russian radio chatter). Don't get this game, stick to Aces High or any of the older IL-2 titles.","June 26, 2013","false","19.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

To excruciating detail in the game's design and absolutely stunning graphics that bring the whole picture together into one fantastic package.\n\nTruly a beautiful game, with very solid gameplay, and plenty of options to suit novice pilots a flight sim veterans alike.","December 27, 2011","true","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is plenty to do here in single-player, plus standard online multiplayer modes are included as well. I've gotten 100+ gameplay hours out of WoP so far.\n\nHowever compared to its rivals, there are a few things lacking, notably no mission editor so you are limited beyond the missions offered and there have been some issues with multiplayer recently as support has been dropped in favour of its multiplayer-oriented sequal War Thunder.\n\nDespite this WoP is a really great title and frankly if your into WW2 flight games you shouldn't pass up on this (even for just the single-player), however hardcore simulation fans will fill more at home sticking with the IL-2 series.","July 12, 2012","true","118.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty levels are not toggled by bullet-damage and AI intelligence, rather, it's toggled by turning on and off features that increase or decrease the difficulty of controlling a virtual plane. Although I wish that graphics were rendered to be slightly more realistic (ground isn't rendered at times, bad quality, clouds are static and non-immersive), Wings of Prey is still a well-designed game suitable for all levels of flight combat simulation.","October 21, 2013","true","66.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This called for it though. There is a game called Birds of steel on xbox 360. It is basically the same game. Except in this game ( wings of prey ) the A.I. is ridiculous. I loved Birds of steel. It was such a good ww2 fighter sim. In this, you will be one of 50 allied forces flying around or floating below, and the A.I. will only aim at you. And your friendly A.I. do not do a good job of watching your back. While it takes 50 hits to kill an enemy plane, one shot will kill your weak bird. So if you can imagine being in a war except every enemy soldier only has the capability to aim at you and only you, then you can imagine this game. I played on realistic difficulty there is a degree higher called simulator which has more controls to pay attention to and enemy planes have no markers. It's not even worth it when on realistic it is IMPOSSIBLE to pass a lot of these mission without dying. Literally impossible. You will never stand a chance against 20 enemy forces who can only aim at you and no one else on the battlefield. It was fun for a minute but then it just got frustrating. Seriously frustrating.

I picked this game up because it was recommended by a friend on a sale. This review will be written from that perspective.\n\nFirst off, the game just won't start after installation, with the launcher just automatically closing off by itself. Hmm...not a good start at all.\n\nFor anyone who is contemplating on buying this, be forwarned.\nYou might need to follow the guide at this link to even get the game running.\n\nCredits and Rep to SSnoicebox for the below solution:\nNote: You will only need to do this once. If you are playing Single Player only, you will not need to log in.\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=31789933&postcount=22\n\nWings of Prey is a flight sim based on aerial battles across 6 theatres of WW2 in the single player campaign which lasts around 14 hours. (I admit I cheated a little and used a saved game file to get pass some missions only because they were just too difficult due to having a limited time to completing objectives. Eg: Hornet's Nest)\n\nThe graphics look very nice and detailed especially when the fighting gets furious in later missions with explosions everywhere. Music and sound effects also add alot to the atmosphere with appropriate engine sounds and wind swooshes. Another cool thing to note is when you are talking with your Wingman as a Russian Pilot, the whole conversation is in spoken in Russian with english subtitles which i felt was a nice touch. And of course with any flight sims, a flightstick is highly recommended although keyboard and mouse does the job adequately as well.\n\nI am not a hardcore fan of flight-sims and I do not make use of any flying formations to achieve my kills so I will not be able to say if the flight physics is realistic or not for hardcore flight-sim fans.\n\nIt is rather forgiving game though in that you can have 3 modes of play (Arcade, Realistic or Simulator) and have the choice of unlimited tries even though you may get shot down in which you can just press a key to continue the fight as normal. Personally i felt that the game isn't really catered for the hardcore crowd tho, as even when you play Realistic or Simulator, the game will still provide "Bomb Indicator" targeting HUD for bombing so you'll know when to drop bombs during bombing runs. I'm quite sure the real WW2 aces wouldn't have access to such a bomb targetting HUD during their time lol!\n\nMultiplayer Co-op is only limited to the DLC Wings of Luftwaffe, and the whole process of getting online is absolutely tedious. To even play multiplayer, you must have signed in to the launcher when you initially launched the game, which in itself sometimes have troubles logging in. I didn't manage to get any multiplayer going on as my friend had a lot of technical troubles with Yuplay not recognizing his account, website not even recognizing his keyboard thus unable to key in any passwords etc. In short, it was just a horrible experience.\n\nIn closing, I must say that this game is probably catered for people who seldom plays Flight-Sim and provides simple but not overly dumbed down controls. It will probably not appeal to hardcore fans who demand absolute realism. The single player campaign is satisfying enough with lots of interesting planes to fly around.\n\nThe biggest letdown of the whole game is the whole backend technical infrastructure, how it is so cumbersome to even activate the game and register an account with Yuplay, which IMO looks very much like those 2bit Asian Browser MMO pages for gold farmers. (No racism intended as I am Asian myself.) There is a nice game in there somewhere, only if you are willing to get past all the technical hurdles and inconveniences to get to it.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.0 / 10\n(I would have rated it 7.0 had the game been easier to set up without all the frustrating technical issues)\n\nIf you are not fan of Flight Sims, this game will not convert you into one. For Hardcore Flight Sim fans, you will probably find this game too easy. Its best to get it on a cheap sale.","May 25, 2013","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

(Keeping in mind I used a keyboard and mouse, and flight games are not my usual genre..)Here are the reasons why:\n-Good usage of videos for campaign, but horrible voiceacting, and ultimately it is a bore.\n-Horrible bombing. Must switch views and look around constantly.\n-I appreciate the "realism" of the game, but 2 shot kills in realistic mode suck when you get poppped out of nowhere, and its hard to move and look around from cockpit, and endless stalling make the controls irritating. It is hard to turn even remotely sharply without stalling, which slows the game down to a bore.\n-I found it particularly difficult to shoot down aitcraft sometimes, and it appears that the enemy planes are not subjected to the same irritating stalls.\n-Sometimes enemies seemed to "run away" and it felt unnatural.\n-Massive progression wall on one level, approx 20 percent through game. (Then boring after it)\n-DRM is broken.\n\nI must admit, I really enjoyed flight simulator.. but didnt enjoy this game for very long.\n\n\n","May 23","false","9.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Also, please note that this was just my particular experience and not representative of all users.(Also, not sure why it's showing 65 hours of gameplay. Definately lost my patience sooner than that.)\n\nGood: Decent graphics, well done voice overs, realistic and immersive gameplay; You really feel like you in the cockpit sometimes.\n\nBad: Repetive and often cheesy missions plus very non-linear difficulties (i.e. On low difficulties, I could take down a fighter with what felt like a single bullet but on mid-level difficulties I'd get shot down in within seconds of starting even the earliest missions. And to all you trolls out there, I've been playing fighter sims for years so it's not a lack of skill.)\n\nUgly (this is what killed the game for me): The controls were garbage. The keyboard controls made even basic maneuvers a nightmare and mapping keys to controllers wasn't much better. I tried everything from an XBox 360 controller to a joystick specially designed for WW2 fighter sims and still had trouble. One example is how each secondary weapon (bombs, rockets, etc.) had a different button assignment vice a single button and when you DO map them to the same key, you get an in-game error telling you that the secondary weapon is not available.\n\nOverall, Wings of Prey did a good job with display and realism. But, like many games of its kind, mission variety is rather lacking but it's the crappy control scheme that makes it hit rock bottom. As I said earlier, this is just my experience with it but I highly recommend looking elsewhere.","December 24, 2014","false","65.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can go for a full arcade type 'shoot-em-up' or if you turn on some of the more advanced controls and difficulty levels it can become more like a simulator. The game is also quite pretty! Only issue is that it seems to want to run some application called 'yuplay' in the background. I can't figure out what the point of it is, but if you don't turn it off after exiting WoP it still clocks up game hours on Steam so now I have apparently played 26 hours when I have only been in-game for about 3-4 of those!","July 25, 2012","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, please note that this was just my particular experience and not representative of all users.(Also, not sure why it's showing 65 hours of gameplay. Definately lost my patience sooner than that.)\n\nGood: Decent graphics, well done voice overs, realistic and immersive gameplay; You really feel like you in the cockpit sometimes.\n\nBad: Repetive and often cheesy missions plus very non-linear difficulties (i.e. On low difficulties, I could take down a fighter with what felt like a single bullet but on mid-level difficulties I'd get shot down in within seconds of starting even the earliest missions. And to all you trolls out there, I've been playing fighter sims for years so it's not a lack of skill.)\n\nUgly (this is what killed the game for me): The controls were garbage. The keyboard controls made even basic maneuvers a nightmare and mapping keys to controllers wasn't much better. I tried everything from an XBox 360 controller to a joystick specially designed for WW2 fighter sims and still had trouble. One example is how each secondary weapon (bombs, rockets, etc.) had a different button assignment vice a single button and when you DO map them to the same key, you get an in-game error telling you that the secondary weapon is not available.\n\nOverall, Wings of Prey did a good job with display and realism. But, like many games of its kind, mission variety is rather lacking but it's the crappy control scheme that makes it hit rock bottom. As I said earlier, this is just my experience with it but I highly recommend looking elsewhere.","December 24, 2014","false","65.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
