Even if you don't have VR, you can still enjoy this small concert with 2 songs to choose from.\n\nSoundwise, I'd say it's pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the songs, but the soundstage for the concert was pretty good. Changing the camera angles affects the direction of sound. For best results, open back headphones are recommended for this.\n\nIs it worth spending around 10-15 minutes?

Documentation is hidden and there isn't any guidance on anything in the game itself. Menu is only in Japanese with no options to change quality or any of that stuff typically seen in PC games. Game defaults to windowed mode, not even 1080p.\n\nThere is a readme file buried somewhere that is in half Japanese and half English. The controls are only for the camera, but it is very limited, most likely to prevent you from looking up their skirts. The readme says pressing shift does something, but nothing happens.\n\nThere is no gameplay at all as it consists of two different songs and premade dance animations for two catgirls. There are no options to change the catgirls to the others seen on the main menu.\n\nOverall, if you like watching Miku Miku Dance videos and want something slightly interactive, then it might be worth it. Otherwise, not worth your time.","June 5","false","0.1"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","16","32","3","3"

I guess it's a clever promotion for the series, which I don't have. You just watch two catgirls dancing to some Japanese music, one of them quite busty. There's no game. It's a lot more like two music videos. The game doesn't even look translated, not that it has to be. Maybe they want to sell more music as DLC or use this to start making a game engine.\n\nSo, um, I guess "Yes" because it's free and if they do DLC, it'll probably have a purpose (no DLC as of this writing). Also, it only seems to require those system requirements if you are doing VR. You probably don't need that much to run this.\n\nIt seems like you can also move your position relative to the stage by looking around the room and pressing shift to activate one of those paws.

Seriously, if you've got your VR headset on, be prepared for "240p Simulator VR".\n\nIt's not obvious from the Kanji in the menu, but you can use the number keys to change camera angles, complete with a ridiculously long paw-wipe that almost convinced me to give this experience a thumbs-up. If you are a pedo, you'll probably want to stick to angle 2, while if you like large breasts you're better off with 3. The other angles put you so far away from the stage (we're talking entire yards) that all you'll see is an indistict blur, as if you were watching VHS anime bootlegs play on your neighbor's 20 inch CRT television through the window.\n\nYou have to physically bend over and get near to the floor in order to look up the girls' skirts, which is demeaning. Also, none of the camera angles gets you close enough to even pretend like you could grope the performers - unless your playspace is an entire living room, the stage is probably going to be past the wall. Lastly, the large-breasted performer clearly has bad implants, as her rock-solid bosom never jiggles nor sways.\n\nThe performers are strictly amateur; while their dance is well synchronized, the choreography is pedestrian and repetitive. You probably already know whether you like the music, to which I am personally indifferent.\n\nIf you were hoping to molest some hi-res catgirls up close, this is almost nothing you want. Lastly, 66% of the catgirls in the title image aren't actually in NekoPALIVE, so if you're digging girls 1, 3,4, or 6, you'd best look elsewhere.","May 31","false","0.4"," 12 of 48 people (25%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","25","12","48","10","1"

After all, the game is one of the best loved features on Steam. The various live action films and spin-offs since then have been given a lukewarm response. As it turns out, the latest attempt to bring NEKO WORKs' catgirls to VR is a triumph - a painstakingly crafted digital 3D dance concert whose astonishing visual effects are complemented by very sure-footed coreography and tremendous voice-work.\n\nEarly on, when we see catgirl #1 prancing through the forest with catgirl #2 (voiced by Ben Kingsley) or playing with wolf pups at the Peace Rock, it looks as if the experience will indulge in the cutesy, sentimental anthropomorphism that blights so many animated movies. Thankfully, as soon as the vengeful, scarred tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) arrives, the mood changes. The tiger has a bitter grudge against the boy and wants him dead.\n\nThe portrayal of the catgirls is as life-like as in a natural history documentary - we can see every ripple of their muscles.\n\nThis is a far darker title than the previous games. There’s a hint of jungle gothic about several of the scenes. Catgirl's journey, against her will, to the ruined temple presided over by the obese orang-utan King Louis (voiced in purring mobster-like tones by Christopher Walken) could be something out of a horror movie. So could the scene when the little catgirl is mesmerised by the python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) which wraps its coils around him. There’s nothing cosy either about the elemental sequences - the landslides, storms, buffalo stampedes or the fire - “red flower” - in the forest.\n\nNewcomer Catgirl gives a remarkable performance in a role that required her, as just about the title's only live action character, to act in front of a blue screen. (His animals friends were added in afterwards.) She plays Catgirl with a fieriness and gumption which stops the character ever seeming too much like an orphan waifu on leave from a Victorian melodrama.\n\nStrangely, the least effective scenes here are those which invoke the memory of the games. We hear a few strains from The Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You but the songs seem out of place. There’s plenty of comedy here, not least when Baloo the bear (Bill Murray) is in pursuit of honey but there’s also a constant sense of menace.\n\nThis wasn't an easy experience to make. Each individual shot reportedly took weeks to animate. Much of the work was done by a small army of technicians at the effects company MPC in London and at Weta in New Zealand, although the director Jon Favreau was based in LA for most of the shoot. They’ve achieved something both groundbreaking and magical.","June 3","true","0.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no options menu to adjust screen resolution (and the default is not 1080p). The only controls available to those without VR are to control the camera to look left, right, up, and down. However, the "game" is very pretty to look at and the music is wonderful, and this is probably the closest one can get to being part of a Jpop concert involving catgirl singers. Unfortunately however, there is no lewdness in this, unlike actual Nekopara games.\n\nStill, this "game" is free, so I recommend it, at least for the brief enjoyment it can muster.","June 6","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbanhammer/recommended/469990/","thisisbanhammer","dokkan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbanhammer/","79 products in account","NEKOPALIVE, a game that has been released following the previous Nekopara games, is a revolutionary creation. The game has brought Steam to a Golden Age that will last forever. A simple click of playing the game shall enlighten your life. The anatomies of cat and human come together to create this wonderful game.\n\nStory: NEKOPALIVE is a game where one must find the perfect angles and perfect positions of one character. The character in mind would be a girl with cat ears, my personal favorite is Coconut due to her voluptuous appearance in the game. As you progress through the story, you obtain many perks. One of the advantages of progressing through the story is the advantage of using other characters such as Vanilla. The overall conclusion is that it is a very in depth story that brings tears to my eyes every time I go through the game. NEKOPALIVE has brought me, a man that uses steam for fun and games, to my knees begging for more of this beautiful storyline.\n\nCharacters: In NEKOPALIVE, the characters include everyone from the previous Nekopara games. Some fan favorites from the crew of La Soleil include Vanilla and Chocola. All characters come in different shapes and sizes. From Azuki to Coconut, players may choose the character that they most desire. The characters may be a reference to Super Smash Brothers Melee because of the fact that their sizes can relate to hitboxes of different characters. To add on to the aforementioned implication, the amount of characters to choose from in NEKOPALIVE really gives the player more gametime and fun like in Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube.\n\nGameplay: NEKOPALIVE gives the player many options throughout the game. Traveling from world to world, the player obtains many facts about life and the origins of the catgirls. An action packed game, NEKOPALIVE allows the player to see the superior catgirl through casual means. The precise combination of catgirls chosen can allow for a much better game time. The competitive factor that comes from playing NEKOPALIVE shows when the player wants to play with a friend or two. The game allows access through Virtual Reality, but if just on one's monitor screen, two people can play at once. All there is to do is take one catgirl each and then it is set, a valuable time with the friends and family has been made.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10\nThe gameplay is much harder than one would expect. Progressing through five hours of gameplay or one sitting of video games can be hard when too much blood flows to one area. Sitting on your chair and having all your blood go to your buttocks or legs are all challenges to surpass when attempting to play NEKOPALIVE because it will have you playing for hours upon hours. A game free of bugs and full of fun, NEKOPALIVE gives friends and family the greatest time they could have with a child on steam. Games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight are all in the league of this work of art. If you have not tried this game I suggest you do so immediately for it will change your life for the better.","June 6","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
