You can build as much as you want however you want. Once you figure out how the program works, it is really fun and you can make gorgeous things. Gone are the days of being stuck to a stupid grid, forcing strict limitations on where you can put stuff. Also gone are the days where you are stuck with the limited content that the devs provide. Importing new content is easy, and the program is specifically designed for no fuss custom importing of 3d objects, terrain brushes, scenery, textures etc... You can even create and customize your own skyboxes.\n\nSo you should purchase if:\n*You want to help out and support some awesome devs who are open, honest, and passionate about their game\n*You love making pretty things and being creative\n*You want to get involved in the already awesome growing community and start contributing\n\nYou should not purchase if:\n*You are looking for the next Roller Coaster Tycoon game. This is a sandbox pure and simple. There is no money management or scenarios of any kind. Although there is a strong possibility that it may be added in the future.\n*You are a party pooper or a hater\n*You are looking for a 100% perfect feature complete product. It's early access. Do bear that in mind and when they say "Please only purchase if you are interested in being involved in the ongoing development of this exciting project" They aren't kidding.\n\nI will continue to update this as development continues.\n","February 25, 2014","true","25.3"," 233 of 264 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","233","264","0","27"

When I first heard about the title, the word Studio indicated that this was exclusively for theme park design, and not some game. This is actually a dream come true for those that simply want a giant sandbox featuring extensive tools to design an entire theme park. You know what kept RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 alive long after Atari abandoned it? A community of creative people who decided to bend the program beyond its limitations.  I know firsthand, as I participated. We went beyond the two expansion packs using tools written by a few talented members, but it wasn't an easy task, as RCT3 was not designed with user modification in mind.\n\nPantera was aiming to fill in a void, by developing the first true theme park creation engine. One of the major draws is its open arms approach to user modification, allowing creative minds to go wild. As months progressed, more and more fans of this genre jumped on the bandwagon, with interests ranging all over the map. Features that weren't originally planned were starting to creep in, like having peeps interact in your park, or a UI that would appeal to a much wider audience. This in turn caused a lot of rethinking and changes, and would push the release date much further away. Most felt it would be worth the wait, while others became inpatient, and wanted something done yesterday.\n\nWhat came out of this was the decision for an Early Access release. This would mean, instead of backers waiting much longer for a finished product, they could ride along with the developer as each planned phase gets implemented and activated. Early Access would introduce the community to one of the main aspects of Theme Park Studio: Landscaping and Scenery.\n\nThe landscaping tool in Theme Park Studio is quite impressive. A simple, yet powerful tool set allows you to make instant mountains, rolling hills, deep valleys, rivers with flowing water, or even the glaciated rocks of Yosemite. You can concentrate on small areas, or plop down huge terrain maps and watch as it molds the landscape before your eyes. In addition, new textures can be loaded in to simulate all kinds of terrain that go way beyond the default grassy plains. You can also change bump and diffuse maps to add further realism to your park and its surrounding. Top this all off with an equally capable environment editor featuring modifiable skyboxes as well as fog and light vector adjustments, and you're talking endless variations for your massive land.\n\nOne of greatest features of Theme Park Studios is its path making tool. Aspiring designers can simply click and place walkways that curve and stretch any way desired, as the ground automatically adapts to each section planted. Paths can be easily be set to be very wide or narrow, and have automatically generated content like trees, park benches and much more magically adhere to one or both sides; you curve your paths, the tress curve with it! Textures can easily changed from a quaint cobblestone walkway, to a massive stretch of tarmac or concrete. The wrench will be your best friend as you bolt down your paths and everything else you've worked on in the game, to avoid accidently moving things out of place.\n\n\nThe heart of any theme park is its scenery, and with TPS's scenery builder, anyone can put together all types of structures for their parks. The built in primitives are simple shapes that can be scaled, moved and combined with other shapes,  while the copy and paste function reduces repetitive building.  Add one of the many built in materials, and you can have some very impressive results. Those with no knowledge of 3D modeling programs will finally have a chance make their own scenery. You can even save and share your custom made pieces.\n\nSpeaking of 3D modeling, Theme Park Studio will give advanced desingers all the tools they need to import and export highly detailed scenery, whether it be modular building blocks, or complete structures like cafes, shops, bridges and so much more. The flexibility for most of the tools in this game is mind boggling.\n\nThere are many other features in Theme Park Studio, like advanced lighting, colorizing, material editing, and much more.\n\nTPS's early release does not include working flat rides or rollercoasters. There are some, flat rides included, but they are static. The upcoming flat ride designer is set for the next phase which with bring these rides to life with animation. Get set to see an influx of flat rides designed by the community such as recreations of real world rides, along with  new inventions that could be the next best thing!\n\nThe heart of TPS of course, will be its coasters. Expect to see the same flexibility of Theme Parks Studio's other features to apply hear as well. Pantera is working hard to make sure coaster building is approachable for everyone without forfeiting realism like RollerCosater Tycoon 3 did with its odd physics and questionable track choices on certain coasters. The first person experience was hindered because of this.\n\nIt's really fantastic to be in with Theme Park Studio from the ground up. Early Access users get a head start, and can report any further bugs while also suggesting new features or changes that will make this the ultimate theme park simulator.  While waiting for each phase to commence, we can take our time designing wonderful landscapes and create all kinds of scenery to share among the community. Trust me, that alone is a lot to tinker with.\n\nAnd finally, it irks me when I read any negative reviews which complain about missing features or an "incomplete" product. These folks may either not know what the idea behind Early Access is, or are simply the type who add something to their shopping cart without reading or doing any research. It's like being allowed on a movie set, then attempting to review it before production is complete. Speaking of production, this review is a wrap..\n\nOh, and heads up: Custom Scenery is already beginning to flow!\n\n- JCat","March 3, 2014","true","589.1"," 140 of 159 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","140","159","0","8"

A must have Theme Park building simulation tool. Aside from it being in early beta mode, it will grow on you like the previous games have! If you enjoy building and customizing your own parks, then this is what you need right here! If you have no skills in a modeling program, like sketchup, and always wanted to model, Theme Park Studio is a great tool designed for even the beginners of all ages! You can start from nothing in your park or use a preset of parks made from the developers. Also there are many presets of scenery such as trees, lighting, walls, and buildings.\n\nYes, shops, stalls, and rides are in 'static' mode for now, but they will be functioning when the full release comes out. But to learn how to use your controls and how to maneuver your objects is a must at first. Once you get the hang of it, it will be a breeze from there.

And I have to say this game is very well structured. I will give you a list comparing this game to RCT3 so you can have a better understanding of what each game brings to the table SO FAR. I say so far because this game is still in development, and it could change. Here is my opinion:\n\n>>>>Theme Park Studio vs RCT3<<<<\nGRAPHICS:\nTheme park studio wins this one, it has way better graphics, and antialising makes the game look a lot better as well (if you have the graphics card for it). The water reflections look great, and the coaster detail is a lot better. HD!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nRCT3 wins. RCT feels like an actual amusement park game, because it has a lot of features like the peeps, stands, money, financing, etc. This kind of stuff made you feel like you were managing your own theme park. Theme Park Studio is still in development, so they might add some more features like this soon. It just feels like more of a sandbox than an actual theme park game.\n\nCOASTER EDITING:\nTheme park studio is by far the best editor I have come across. There are so many possibilities for coasters, you can truly make it your own.  Each track segment can be edited to your liking, so you can truly make any coaster you have in mind. It is also very easy to use, with some pre-loaded segments like a cobra roll or a loop. When it comes to flexibility, TPS wins.\n\nSOUNDS:\nAlthough I have big expectations for TPS to have a great sound library, currently i would say RCT has better sounds. They are more consistent, and they have better variety.  For example, on the megacoaster, the lift chain sound on TPS does not make much sense at all. Also, there is no fading so sounds seem to come out of nowhere sometimes. I do expect them to have better sounds in the future though.\n\nUSER INTERFACE:\nI'm going to be honest, the TPS user interface takes some getting used to. The RCT user interface in my opinion is more understandable, and it's easier to use. TPS just kind of seems all over the place.  Maybe they will update this soon, i just find it easier to play RCT instead of TPS. But then again, it's also about personal preference.\n\nThat should cover most of the basic categories.  In my opinion, I prefer Theme Park Studio over roller coaster tycoon.  TPS is still on the early versions, and it has A LOT going for it once they start adding people, and adding more management features. Don't get me wrong, I will always like rct, but tps seems like the next step up.  That is all! I hope this helps some of you clear up some differences.\n\nHave a great day ! Dated: January 15th, 2015\n\n*Antialising issue fixed!*","January 7, 2015","true","123.0"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","27","32","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tycooner/recommended/254590/","Tycooner","Plaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tycooner/","17 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been trying tp keep up wih this game to see how the game is progressing through its development stages and how the development team has been responding to the users and the issues they have been having while trying to run the software. I hope this review helps other make a educated decision on whether the game is worth purchasing. I am happy to report the following observations and my take on the game, even after playing for hours.\n\nTPS is a must have for any hardcore fan of the Theme Park/Rollercoaster genre. Not only does the game provide a very strong studio editor for creating your own customized realistic Park, it provides the user with a good educational value of roller coaster physics and 3D edited flat rides. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination.\n\nAt first glance, the UI looks intimidating,  but the staff at Pantera Entertainment have helped users overcome that obstacle very quickly by providing a strong background of how to use documentation included in the game along with a host of how to videos covering everything from building coasters to landscaping your own park. With that said, understanding the UI can quickly become second nature and easily managed after a few times of use. The incorporated Steam Worshop also makes it easy to import custom scenery and rides into the game without leaving the game interface.\n\nThe coaster builder will set well with RCT3 fans, as it employees some of the same techniques while adding the ability to easily manipulate the control of creating banked turns and twisted track with the help of track nodes, something that RCTW seems to also be incorporating with their spline based track editor.  The track editor also has more features than RCT3 and without a doubt is better suited towards this game giving the user the ability to manipulate the track in every way possible.\n\nNow with all that said, everyone needs to understand that this software is still in the early access program phase and that they may and probally will encounter bugs and crashes due to their computer hardware conflicts and not having updated drivers. But with that thought, I must also say from strong observation, that the development team is doing an excellent job of addressing those issues if the users will report the problems they are having in the forum threads.\n\nMost of the people who are complaining and rating bad reviews are those who won't give the team the time to work out the bugs and put out a completed product that is highly polished. I have been able to play the game on a Windows 7 machine that was not build as a high end gaming outfit, very sucessfully. And although I have encourted a crash or two, I can clearly see the power that this game has that can't be found in other theme park builder games on the market.\n\nAlthough the game does not concentrate on the financial management of your park, it still ranks among the top best in Theme Park building games to have for fanatics and should be included in anyone's library who enjoyed RCT3 and/or No Limits Roller Coaster Simulation and for those who are interested in creating a very realistic Theme Park.\n\nOn a scale from 1 to 5, the game gets 4.5 stars for the power that it has to create any realistic park and for the backup support the team has put into the game and continues to provide for the fan base it has.  If it was not for the fact that the game is still development mode, it would carry 5 stars all the way. Bottom line, this game is highly recommended.\n\nSo the only question to gamers who are interested in this game, is whether they want to participate in the early access build or whether they want to wait until the game is completely finished. I hope this review helps those who are on the fence deciding on what the game provides and has to offer in the form of Theme Park Simulation building.","October 18, 2015","true","21.4"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","1"

For the casual player it is possible to just click and place these created objects as well and change all of them to your liking even without creating it yourself.\nTPS is the ultimate themepark simulator for me and even during this early access stage the possibilities are huge.\nFlatrides, Coasters, Theming, Particle Effects, Lights and the list goes on.\n\nI read many people saying it is too difficult to handle but in fact it is not. In TPS you can create any park in a simple to use way but yes you have very advanced features as well which might look more difficult too handle at first but these are not needed in the first place to create a great park. Once you start playing around you will quickly find that even the advanced features are easy to handle once you know how to use them. Every game or software package has a learning curve, it either be big or small. Even in the days of RCT you had to find your way in the game before you could use its full potential.\nAnyway TPS has come a long way already and with all the improvements already made and more to come i would definitily recommend this game to anyone who likes to create their own Ultimate Theme Parks. As a side note the graphics are just amazing in TPS, keep in mind to meet your computer and graphic card specs as most issues reported are related to not meeting these specs.\n\nThumbs up and keep up the good work Pantera! Looking out for what is all coming next.\n\nJust an example of what is possible with Flat rides:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4WwnmbLihXA\nDave","May 20, 2015","true","542.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","4"

You will not be juggling happiness, hunger and money.\n\nIt's a blank canvas that gives you a free hand to design and create almost any park you can imagine. It focuses almost entirely on the construction (and personal enjoyment) of the park. Visitors are merely there to add movement and life.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy the no-pressure pace and chance to be creative when I want to unwind. If I'm in the mood for something with a challenge, this isn't the game to launch.\n\nIf you've ever "played" No Limits, it's much closer in spirit to that than almost any other rollercoaster game, but with a whole lot more detail and flexibility.\n\nFor me, definitely worth the purchase.","May 16","true","3.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","3"

The shear ammount of things you can do is huge. I played alot of rct3 and after a while i seen this game, and once that happened, the game wasnt released and i waited patiantly for the game to come out, and i bought it as soon as i possibly could before roller coasters were released. The game even without roller coasters is amazing, so if you buy this game, be sure to learn everything you can because there is a learning curve, but once you get passed that you will be impressed. This game isnt like rct3 where if you wanted to make a unique roller coaster with hills and loops exactly the way you wanted you couldnt. Now in this game if you want your drop to be so steep, you can. So if you want an amazing theme park game. This is your game.","February 25, 2015","true","172.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","2"

And it's only just getting started! The animated flat rides look very smooth and move in a believable, life-like fashion. They appear to abide by real world physics and they act as real flat rides do. Now, the models to the rides might get updates to detail which would be nice, but this update is all about the animation and it is VERY real. Couldn't do Tower of Terror in RCT3? Well now you can in Theme Park Studio! Want to make Falcon's Fury? Now you can! Want to make an S&S power tower? WELL NOW YOU CAN! Finally, a game that allows freedom and flexibility. When you really look at it, this game has true potential that other coaster related games do not offer. And you can suggest ideas on the forums and know that Pantera will actually listen!

While yes, technically you are not purchasing a game you will get immediate enjoyment from, you still are making a wise decision in buying this game.

Of course you have to take some topics into acount, but when you have imported this models, it is fantastic to walk through this models and watch them from all sides.\n\nAs this "walking" in blender is not possible in a real time walk, I'm wondering how TPS could do this. Great work! It is also very easy to build your roller couster around this buildings and to drive with this coaster and to see the fantastic world you built by your own.\n\nOf course TPS is currently not ready and there are still much things to do, but it is great to see the game growing with every release. The community is really helpful and I like to share my models within the workshop.\n\nFor me it is essential, to start already know and I thank the developer for that, because creating realistic buildings needs time. This is exactly the time I need to create my building and to learn in parallel the usage of Theme Park Studio. When TPS is then ready for release, I hope, that my buildings are also ready, to easily add them to my park and walk virtually through it.\n\nBut please don't expect a game which is already finalized. It is currently not. Take the advantage to include your ideas and be part of the creation of this game.

The concept is/was excellent, custom theme park design in an easy to use interface. This isn't RCT, it is much more detailed. It has many more features which cater to people who enjoy building and designing rides and theme parks. It does not, however  have vomit and peep bowling. So if that's your thing...\n\nRight now, phases 1, 2, and 6 have been released.\n\nThe feature set isn't finished at the moment, but there is still plenty to do. Custom flat ride creation is made easy with the built in keyframer and physics engine. Many people have already designed their own rides from scratch, I'm not that handy with modeling, but I've made several "franken flats" with the built in pieces. The keyframer also makes custom animatronics easy.\n\nBuildings, rides, paths, scenery, etc. are all easy in TPS. Take a look through the screenshots page to see some of the amazing things people are making. It is an amazing tool.\n\nI recommend TPS to anybody. If you enjoy designing rides, coasters, or theme parks, this is the best program to do it IMO. It dives into much greater detail than the RCT series without any added difficulty.","June 3, 2014","true","847.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

No other software short of a 3D animation powerhouse like Maya or Modo can do what TPS can.\n\nIt's obvious that the creator of this software has put sweat, blood and tears into this software and it shows. The coasters are amazing, fun to build and incredible to ride. It's amazing how TPS just automatically adds and adjusts the coaster's supports in response to lifting or lowering track pieces. Node editing is intuitive and fun. You can really get in there and make it perfect by using the node editor and editing by the numbers. It's insanely easy to add batwings, loops, corkscrews and plenty of other amazing inversions and specialty pieces. Lastly, I love how TPS can auto-close the coaster track. You can color or texture anything anyway you want. It has plenty of coaster types (all the major ones), like winged, steel, inverted, wood, mine train, etc) and you can customize the coaster any way you want. Finally, you can add custom scenery to your parks. I've added rocks, buildings and tunnels for the coasters to go by and through - amazing!\n\nThe path editing is amazing. I love how terrain automatically adjusts itself when you raise or lower a path. It's also great that the path's struts, bridges, etc all adjust themselves in realtime. You can put foliage, sidewalks and other things inside and outside paths. You can create traffic circles, junctions and more. Very, very complete path editor.\n\nThe flat rides that come with it are so real! The physics are spot on and you can ride all of them. With Bumper Cars and Boats coming - and Go Karts! - I just think Theme Park Studio is one hell of a good deal and simply cannot be beat in the theme park creation arena.\n\nIt has particles (think fireworks, snow, fire, etc) and full editing and creation of just about anything (you can make buildings, rides, etc).\n\nYou can enter the park and it has peeps that ride the rides with you (kids and adults). There is so much to this software that it's almost impossible to mention everything it can do. If it's THIS amazing in early access, I can't imagine how good it will be when fully released!\n\nNo doubt about it - after logging in tons of hours with Theme Park Studio, i've never been so excited about a piece of software. It just keeps getting better and better.\n\n- Karmacomposer","December 15, 2015","true","117.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","6"

If you ever want to have full control in desinging your own theme park then this is the program for you.  I will not list everything it can do but I will say this it fully allows you to create your own roller coasters and flat rides as well as other stuff.    If there isn't enough selection you can use any 3D program that can export in the 3ds format.  Right now it is in the beta stages.  For those who still don't know what beta is its still in design or an excellent idea that is slowly growing that's becoming better and better.  The newest addition thats going on is enjoying other peoples theme parks live.  This will be extremely interesting.  Keep in mind that this is a tool and the only thing going for it is the power of creating your own parks.  So if you are the one that has always want to build your own theme park then this is the program for you but if you want to experience the business side of it as well then go play the others but you will have very limmited construction abilities in those types of games.

All three titles do some things better than the other and each has strengths and weaknesses when compared, but overall I like Theme Park Studio best because it offers the most customization without spending a lot of time on a single project and the visual quality competes with either of the other products.   I don't have to use a 3d modeling program, everything I build can be done directly from in the game or using workshop items.  I do use .jpg image textures from the internet however.   The thing to keep in mind is this is not Roller Coaster Tycoon or No Limits, it's a different game from a different developer and what it does it does well.  Much more than just coasters there is also custom animations, textures, lighting, landscapes, particles, sounds, and so much more.\n\nThis is like a set of sandbox tools you would find in roller coaster tycoon with no goals or money to worry about, just build your park the way you want it.   The coaster and path tools are pretty similiar to Roller Coaster Tycoon and were reworked a few phases ago to make them much easier to use, now it's simply point and click to build coasters and paths or you can also use the drawing tool to draw a path with the mouse.   For advanced players there are tons of advanced options and controls available to customize just about everything.   They even added multi-core support in the last phase which tripled my FPS.   In the videos below you can see just how far you can take the customizations.\n\nThe game has come a long way since the early phases and soon we will get peeps walking around, 1st person camera mode on rides, many more flat rides all in the final phase.   Since all the rides are physic based and not scripted these are going to be amazing in first person mode.

This game beats it in so many ways.\n\nIt runs really well and the game can handle more stuff in your park than in other rollercoaster park games before.\nFor players who like to create and import their own 3d models into the game. This game cuts the process of importing by a very large amount. It is as simple as exporting the model and importing it into the game. Much hassle by a long shot.\n\nThe game is still in development, but with each new phase, highly requested and relevent options are given to the players to make their park more lively.\n\nSadly there isn't any "peeps" yet so your park looks rather deserted till they finally implement it.\n\nThe coaster creation system feels new and may take just a little to get used to how it works, but after an hour or so of messing with the options it will feel like second nature.\n\nOverall I give the game an 8/10. It still needs improvement and I do find bugs once in awhile, but I logged around 100 hours and enjoy being creative.\n\nHere is a picture of my recreation of Disneyland, CA that I have been working on. Almost everything is my own CS and the game has yet to slow down at all. Very well optimized to handle these things\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4YNUv1x\n\nYou can check out plenty of pictures of full coaster action on their main site.\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","147.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

Understanding that it is only in Phase 2 of development, I am ok with not all of the content having been released yet (coasters), however it is in massive need of improvement on general use and the overall experience. Doing even the simplest of tasks is confusing and requires extensive YouTube research to be able to figure out. Some minor to severe glitching issues, which can be expected, but can make an already frustrating endeavor even worse when you spend hours getting something right, only to have it dissapear or moved accientally. Building a decent park would likely take as long as building one in real life. Having already purchased the game, I am anxious to see how it develops. especially once Phase 3 is rolled out.

My computer isn't great, but i can play almost any game on regular settings and run 25-40 FPS. This game (since its in alfa im guessing), is a little laggy.

They already have an insane amount of customization, the landscape is beautiful, graphics are completely modern and amazing, and its only v0.04, seriously, if they have done this much with a "pre phase" the possibilities are endless, nevertheless, when they finally release the full version, it will be nothing like any other simulation game. On top of all of that, for a cheap price of $30, no one should be complaining, and if you are, then you have absolutely no idea what TPS is about.

Building and re-colouring structures is really easy with the wall sets that are included in-game and more will be added as TPS evolves and of course we have the UGC from steam workshop too!\n\nIf you have a flair for design and use external 3-D packages you can create complex stalls, coaster stations, houses and other types of buildings, basically anything you like.\n\nWith the powerful built in animation features you can take a ride or structure that you have created in an external package and animate it within the game.\nTheme park studio has a whole set of tools in a sandbox environment where you can let your imagination run wild.\n\nThere are lots of theme park games coming to the market, but none are as flexible as TPS!\nThe reasons for this is that TPS is aimed at the imagineer, who wants to create what ever they want without limits.\n\nTo me, TPS is in a similar vein to NoLimits, except coaster building is simplified but also powerful and you are able to build complete parks with guests.\nCheck out the forums for info on the developement of TPS, there is way more to come and you'll enjoy using it.\n","February 10","true","666.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

This genre, which has suffered a severe drought since the release of Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, is finally being revitalized thanks to Pantera Entertainment. Everything about the game blows me away. The physics on the ride are incredible (My stomach sank just from watching the S&S drop tower operate. It's just like the real thing: terrifying), the scenary is virtually limitless thanks to the easy-to-use importer, and the soon to be released coaster module looks like it'll be incredible as well. I can't wait to build replicas of coasters like the Millenium Force or The Beast and ride them over and over and over again.\n\nNow it's important to note that I said, "Soon to be released". This game is still in Early Access. Some of the features shown in promotional videos are still being tweaked and perfected behind the scenes by the good people at Pantera. It's important to remember this. Too many people purchase Early Access games expecting them to be completed experiences. If the game was finished, it wouldn't be early access!\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, the game is a major leap from previous theme park simulation titles. It discards the stylized, cartoon-like rides of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series in favor of a more realistic approach, and TPS nails it. That being said, if I wanted to make a stylized ride, nothing is holding me back from doing so. The tools included in TPS let the player piece together their own ride using prefab parts or lets them import their own parts for use in-game.\n\nA good way to think of Theme Park Studio is that it's the Gary's Mod of theme park simulation games. It provides a great deal of content out of the box, but it's so open-ended you can do just about anything you want in it. Once all of the phases are released, this game will almost certainly do down as a classic for sim players.","June 3, 2014","true","103.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

It is such a powerful tool that allows you to create so many aspects of a fun park… from the paths to vegetation, flat rides, buildings, landscapes & of course roller coasters.  If you can imagine it, there’s a good chance you can create it!  If you don’t want to create it then download the community created items, simple!\n\nAs it is a powerful program there is a lot to learn but I found it a bit easier by choosing one aspect to learn at a time e.g. path building one day & building coasters the next (and yes you can ride your coasters).  A lot of it (for me) felt quite intuitive & there are manuals & videos covering all the main topics.  The community is also very friendly & are always willing to help.\n\nOne of the things I have really enjoyed about the Theme Park Studio project is seeing the developers implementing many of the suggestions that the community have given… they are really listening.  And as it is still in development there’s still time to add some of your own ideas through the forums on Steam or the forums on the Theme Park Studio website.\n\nI’m really looking forward to the future phases being released, in particular the peeps!  Can’t wait to see them entering the park & riding my coasters.","February 11, 2015","true","54.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

I love the rides(thank goodness for the Ride Library updates; excited to check out the new stuff that' come since my last play in October! I (mostly) like the coaster builder (at times, but it can be seriously glitchy if you don't hit the snap point right; check out my snapshot of a piece of track the game made after I mis-clicked onto the path instead of the piece of track), and the peep system isn't too bad; they look realistic, and their AI isn't the best, but it's the best we have for now, at least until Planet Coaster comes out. No use in hoping for RCTWorld to be saved, because 1) Atari is still in charge of making it, 2) the game's developer has changed 6(?) times, and 3) while it looks bucket loads better than it did when the initial gameplay trailr came out, I'm not sold on the product because I made that horrible mistake with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Anyways, let's get on with the greatness of this simulation.\n1) Paths\n-Path system is a hell of a lot better than it was, at least for my unobservant self.\n-Everything is a LOT EASIER to connect, delete, and change around\n-Paths actually look good while functioning at top quality at the same time, which is rare for these types of game it seems. :P\n-Paths are nowhere near as bad as I made them seem in my negative review before! :)\n2) Building Crap\n-Still a bit "meh" every once in a while when it comes to resizing, but overall the system is nice\n-Benches are a TON easier to actually place on TOP OF the pathways; before the simulation loved to just place them on the ground and pretend no path was even there\n-Lamps and whatnot are easier to rotate, and the system as a whole is a lot better and much easier to learn than it was before\n3) Coaster Builder\n-Top notch customization, although connecting tracks at the end can be kind of hard\n-So much better than RCTWorld's coaster builder will ever become\n-Typically lagless, unless you place something wrong, and you KNOW when you have hit the wrong button or done something bad. xD\n4) Ride Library\n-Very impressive rides in a pretty massive selection compared to what I expected\n-Great deal of customization; you can even make your OWN rides!\n-Incredibly easy to rotate, place, customize, and control; no question from me (a first xD)\n5) Effects and Environment\n-Effects are sorta basic, but can add a lot to your park\n-Environmental features are THE BEST so far. Suck on that, NoLimts 2! :D\n-Customize everything from effects color and type, to height, start and end, and with environment, everything from the skybox, to the weather and sun/moon position\nFINAL REFLECTION\n-Amazing simulation; by far the best product on the market, but we'll see when Planet Coaster comes out. :P\n-Everything is done so well in this game, it's crazy! No wonder why it took so long for most of the stages to come out. :3\n-Everything is fully customizable(except the entrance?), and can be changed in terms of color, size, and many, MANY MORE options!\nOVERALL RATING: 9/10 Good job Pantera Entertainment! You learned from that...other coaster game you made a long time ago. :D","January 24","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

From the start this feels more of a Tool then a game, but a great one at that, THEMEPARK STUDIO is a sandbox theme park building simulator with impressive features such as object, lights , scenery and the terrain feature which is unbelievable its extremely easy to use from beginning and from this you can create fantastic vista and scenery at a press of a button.\n\nEvery time I play this I learn more and more and I become more confident towards creating new objects and scenery,\nAnd this is only the beginning for this tool, there are many more phases that Panera entertainment want to implement and you can see the amount of care and attention have gone towards this it certainly puts a huge smile on my face and at the end of the journey the vastness of content will be  out standing and this will be great for new comers.\n\nPeople should understand this is early access this is no way near the Finshed Product i'm here to help them and give my input towards Theme park studio. The more people that buy this the better community involvement and from this pantera know what features to fix, Patch, update or even implement new features It seems unfair to the Dev’s especially the comments they have received it seems some people still don't understand what Early Access actually is. If you’re expected a Whole 100% game then early access is not for you and you should wait however if you want to join Pantera entertainment and go with them on a  Journey and see how this Tool Develops with in time then you should Jump aboard,\nThis is a Ride I wont forget !","March 3, 2014","true","37.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Don't expect this game to be completed. I'm making this review based on things I've tried for myself.\n\nTheme park studio is a great tool for people who want to Design their own theme park. Yes I said design. This game is all about designing a theme park. Not about running one. That means that in TPS (Theme Park Studio) you don't have to care about money. As I said this is a game to design your own themepark. In TPS you will be able to install/make custom content (Scenery, Rides, Textures, Height maps and much more). Using this custom content you (almost) have no limitations to your imagination. A great feature that makes this game different from other theme park related games is the fact that you're able to work with or without a grid. This allows for more natural looking parks instead of having everything line up with each other.\n\nLet's talk about some stuff I really like about this game (Those are more opinion based).\nThe path system in this game is nice because you're able to make curved paths without having to download custom content. This also brings some problems (Those things might be fixed in future updates). Building a Y formed path may be hard sometimes. Currently (18-3-2014) you've got to be very creative to come up with solution to prevent strange side walks. But I'm sure this will be fixed.\nGraphics are something I just love about this game. Having the ability to use high poly models without to much problems really is a thing I like. Also textures look really nice because of normal mapping (Mini 3D details that aren't actually 3D).\n\nAfter all I really like this game and I'm excited to see what Pantera will bring us in upcoming updates!","March 18, 2014","true","18.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I bought it because it's Oculus Rift DK2 compatible. Despite my rating, I say do not buy it yet unless you're interested in providing feedback for the beta and don't mind dealing with an incomplete and very buggy game. It's got issues, big ones.\n\nIt's extremely unstable. It's crashed several times and I had to verify file integrity twice because crashes corrupted the defaut demo parks. Took me the better part of an hour and a half to get it to work well enough to test out one of the coasters. I downloaded the coaster of the month from the Workshop for this because there isn't much to the demo parks that come with it by default.\n\nIt loads slow as well and has a tendency to get to the edge of crashing during a load. I've found the best thing to do is sit back and not touch anything while it's loading. A few of the windows and taskbars will go white while it's loading, but after a few moments it finishes and everything ran fine for the most part.\n\nMy crashes were mostly related to loading errors and Alt-Tab, the game does not like Alt-Tab and has a nasty tendency to freeze if you do. Once everything was loaded it didn't give me any trouble so far, but still remember to save often if you're building something because I wouldn't trust it to not crash while I was building after a while right now.\n\nThe only rides you can test are the roller coasters. Hoping that will change in the future. The coasters are cool, but it'd be nice to have a go at anything in the park you can build, including the flat rides. Still worth it for only the coasters, but I'm hoping there will be more to it than that later on.\n\nI got stuck a couple of times in some of the scenery when walking about. Not a huge deal, just hit the ticket icon to teleport back to the entrance. Not really a big problem, but it does happen on occasion.\n\nIt also very badly needs a mouselook button. A lot of the rides and scenery is very tall, but as far as I can tell you can only look about at ground level and can't look up at anything when roaming the park in first person.\n\nDK2 support needs work. The view doesn't twist or turn with the ride and simply remains level while rising and falling with the height of the ride and never twiting or inverting with the track. Also, positional tracking for leaning forward and back is reversed, leaning forward makes the player move back rather than forward. That might work for a very basic coaster with no banks or loops, but it doesn't cut it for anything complex enough to be fun to ride in VR.\n\nHopefully Oculus Rift support will be expanded in the future to include wandering about the park itself and trying the other rides as well. Right now it's limited to testing out the coasters only.\n\nWhy recommend it then?\n\nWell, this has huge potential. The Workshop support means that there will be hundreds if not thousands of coasters to play with in the future. People can get really creative with this and it's sure to impress, especially if there's more to it than just riding coasters. It also gives me a solid framerate and no judder on my system, I've got a very nice PC 7970 and 3770k, but I can crank everything to max and have it run smooth in VR, which is very nice. A comparatively weak system should be able to run this at lower graphics settings in VR without too much trouble and it still won't look bad either.\n\nNo management. There are no resources or management happening. It's a creative toy that doesn't need to be managed to enjoy. The focus here seems to be about building and experiencing the rides, not worrying about customer happiness, whether there are enough bathrooms, or the price of hot dogs.  I like games that do that sort of thing, but it's nice to have something like this that is a purly creative tool that can be experienced and shared.\n\nDespite the flaws of the Oculus support, it's still a lot of fun to ride the coasters. The camera desperatly needs to be fixed, there are demos that far outclass what this can currently do because of this issue, but when that's fixed it will be a worthy investment due to what can be accomplished with this game.\n\nIt's also pretty, not amazing or anything, but the graphics look good for a sim sanbox type game. They run well in VR and look good in the DK2 HMD.\n\nI recommend this game because it's got huge potential, especially for those with VR. It's not there yet and if you may be better off waiting until the game is further along before picking it up. It's an early Beta though, so it's issues are not unexpected, though it is a bit more unstable than I'd like and that alone almost got it a "no" for now.\n\nThe creative freedom it allows for, the ability to share and download parks, the potential it has in the future, and the fact that it's still fun to play with despite it's flaws made up for that though. If you've got a DK2 I don't necessarily recommend buying it now, but keep an eye on this one and mark it for later. It will be worth picking up once some of it's problems have been ironed out as the beta progresses.","October 6, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I backed the project back on kickstarter and this game was very close to not even getting made so was really glad when we got to the goal amount just before it ended so lets actually get into why this game deserves a look at.\n\nOk so the game at the moment has been said many times that this is an alpha and anyone who has paid straight up not looking into the info stated are the people moaning that there is no coaster building yet...  all I can say to that is do some research and stick to updates of the game then you wouldn't run into these problems, I've been following the project since day one and have been amazed with how much Pantera has taken on board from the input they have had from the community so they clearly care about their fanbase unlike other devs these days which is a bonus for them and us.\n\nOnto the actual game, many people have come into this game thinking it is RCT3 and that is understandable but this is not as this game tool is much more than that. This game has so much potential to be the greatest theme park game ever created, currently it is still in Alpha so don't expect every feature yet but once we get to that full release I can not see this game failing, the community have already started making Custom scenery to add to the game which is amazing for a title what is not even fully released yet, just shows how well intagrated and open the games own tools are. Ok onto the games controls, they work perfectly in my opinion and you can even go upside down with the camera if you truly wanted to.\n\nHow does the games building tool work in the game ? Well I find the building work on this game to be great, the benefit aswell is you can turn off grid lock mode and just free roam your object anywhere, any direction or even tilt the object if you require it. I think that is truly incredible and just shows in one simple task of the games features how powerful their game tool is already and THIS IS JUST ALPHA at the moment so how can you possibly grumble at it. Paths can be either simple or complicated, currently the paths are created freely so you can place the paths where you want and curve and get really nice arc shaped paths, you can even bend the paths and raise or lower them if you must. One of the main features in this game is the resize option which allows me to resize any object if i feel the need to but I use this all the time on tree placements to re design trees into bushes which I find perfect and can cover up all them empty parts of your park easily if you want to go for that U.k looking park style. Flat rides, there is a couple at the moment which don't have animation until phase 2 but the models of them so far just look stunning. I really am looking forward to phase 2 of this game though as coaster building and flat ride animation will be introduced to the game and if the coaster building is as simple as the other elements have been for me then that is also a bonus. I also messed around with textures, water, lighting and particles but I don't feel I should say too much about them yet when I haven't really work with them enough but I will do once my videos are up so keep an eye out for that.\n\nOk so you may think this guy is only saying good about the game ? Well to be honest I haven't found many issues so far apart from that this game still needs one feature for it which currently isn't in the game and that is a return button feature to return mistakes of deleting a full building you was working on, seriously I have done this a couple of times and it is frustrating but I am sure they can offer us that feature in the future as I know this game is not yet complete.\n\nOver all If you truly want a modern THEME PARK SIMULATION GAME  then this game is truly above anything we have had in the past and it should be. I love it!\n\nIf you have any issues or need a couple of free tips on THEME PARK STUDIO, go check me out on  http://www.youtube.com/talbotdreamOfficial\n\nAlso Park guests keep getting mentioned by people, they are coming but won't be in the game until release :)","March 28, 2014","true","85.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And being apart of the rct3 community this game has a lot of promise to be something great! While being the early release it is expected to have bugs, and what not. But to be apart of a game this early and too be listened too by the developers really is a great attribute! It brings it a step closer to becoming the game that theme park and amusement fans dream of! Customization is a key idea in this game, you can create custom scenery, import easily, make custom paths move the way you want them, resizing, no grid to place things on which makes placement really awesome!

Theme Park Studio, while still in Early Access, has consistently improved phase after phase continuing to add features that the community requested. I have watched the feature sets get better as well, with some of the best features yet to be released. IMO Theme Park Studio is very easy to build a realistic looking park with just a little practice getting used to the controls. The controls are easy to get used to for the beginner, yet has advanced tools that can be comparable to some of the best professional studios out there today. The animation/physics engine in TPS has features that you can't get in any sandbox studio on the market to date. With improved path tools and a new coaster editor, TPS has come a long way since it was first introduced as Early Access to the community. For those of you that are looking for a complete suite of tools to build anything you can imagine, then I recommend that you give Theme Park Studio a try. With Phase 8 coming soon packed with peeps, the ability ride all flat rides, a new 1st person (simulation) view, and a new 64bit build that eliminates any memory problems that existed in the 32bit version, now is the time to check out Theme Park Studio as it's getting better and better.","June 29, 2015","true","248.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","4"

(a better position than a lot of people who have reviewed with under 1 hour of play time).\n\nThat's the thing you see, TPS needs time. Time for you to scrape away the deep layers that reveal itself over hours of play and time for Pantera to release more of the game to us like the ride and coaster modules.\n\nWhen I first had a go at sketchup I blasted it for being nonsensical and useless but then I came back to it and persevered and discovered that it was actually a very powerful design tool. TPS is the same in that the more you put in, the more you get out.\n\nThe UI seems logical and practical enabling me to feel familiar with all the buttons within half an hour or so. The camera is a bit awkward but I understand this is being worked on as we speak.\n\nLaying paths takes a bit of getting used to and is the thing I struggled with most initially. I was frustrated that paths were taking so long to learn and lay but then I realised that actually the reason for this is because you are given so many different ways to manipulate and dress them, it creates almost limitless possibilities and once you get to grips with it, the time invested in tweaking the paths really pays off.\n\nThe graphics are astounding. I have taken some screenshots that look almost like photos. You can zoom into individual leafs on a tree if you really want to. If you want to alter the shadows and water reflection properties, go right ahead.\nAfter investing some time into TPS you realise that you have an open access pass to do whatever you damn well like and I haven't even began to play around with the texture editor or started importing my own customer models yet. And all the while, with all these options, it does not feel like you are writing your own computer game.\n\n\nSome have voiced concerns that without a money aspect to the game, there is little to do in TPS but those people are missing the whole point. The payoff is yet to be realised. If you would like to design a theme park and then walk around the curvy streets looking up at the rides spinning and the coasters zooming by amongst the hustle and bustle of a theme park atmosphere then this *will* appeal to you. Coasters, flat rides, ambient sounds and people have not made it into the game yet so we have to imagine them all for now while we go through the early access process but even at this early stage, Theme Park Studio already presents itself as a competent design tool that will emerge into a comprehensive and immersive theme park experience.","March 3, 2014","true","393.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Other than crashing, the game is amazing, the amount of detail you can put into the rides is incredible. Comparing this to RCT3, the game can be a little difficult jumping into, but you get the hang of it pretty quick. The terrain scuplting is actually not bad, much better than RCT3. Painting tracks is a bit awkward, So far I have only been able to figure out how to paint the rails, the ties always turn white...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirdamnwright/recommended/254590/","sirdamnwright","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirdamnwright/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlmost ten years after no alternative option to RollerCoasterTycoon 3, Pantera have stepped up to bring us Theme Park Studio, a game that from screen shots and trailers promises to be intuitive in every sense of the word and a worthy successor to the king of theme park simulation franchises.\n\nTo those of you who felt constrained and restricted in other rollercoaster and theme park game franchises, Theme Park Studio is the game to set you free from these virtual chains. The placement of objects, structures, rides and paths is far more open and varied than the clunky placement of RCT3, which somewhat won over our hearts with its cartoony graphics that seemed like a step backwards from its predecessors. Theme Park Studio however benefits from somewhat realistic graphics [depending on the textures the user decides to unleash]. There are one or two rough areas regarding the graphics thus far, but when the game is fully released and every function becomes available, the landscapes users will be able to create will inevitably look gorgeous and will be leagues ahead of any other franchise.\n\nSome of the exclusive modules such as the coaster train designer permit even more creativity from users, promising each park, ride and attraction will be totally unique. One of the most desirable features users have wished for in any theme park franchise to this date is the developer opening their arms to users being able to submit and import custom scenery, rides and attractions easily. With Theme Park Studio, this can be done in a mere few clicks, and downloading CS from the internet will ensure any regular CS users from the RollerCoasterTycoon franchise will be familiar with the location of folder placement.\n\nWhilst the game may feel bare at present, there are still plenty of features to explore and master before the game is fully released. Considering the game is in an early access phase and is set to be released in phases, the results that the community have created thus far are incredible. Replicas of the iconic Main Street USA, a theming element featuring the Incredible Hulk that Universal could only dream of, and an extensive plethora of custom designs already on hand thanks to the extremely varied and creative community. By the time Theme Park Studio is fully released, the community contributed material itself will overwhelm the bog standard library content provided with other franchises. And that's without taking into account the gorgeous features Pantera has promised further down the line.\n\nI hasten to mention that due to the game being in an early access stage, there are negatives to the experience. Users have reported a series of crashes, path designing being far too complicated and users attempting to get to grips with importing custom models. The latter has been solved by the community, who are dedicated to helping and learning from one another. Pantera went out of their way to address the path issues by adding unplanned elements in the game that allows users to add new intersections and transitional pieces to make paths look even better, as well as a detailed video making the process seem as easy as buttering toast. The developers have been dedicated to release a series of updates [including fixing the camera controls which was a much requested feature since day one by the community] and continue to do so on a small basis before the next phase arrives.\n\nIf you've been with the theme park and rollercoaster designing franchises since day one, Theme Park Studio is certainly the up and coming development to consider. Whilst the fact that the game is currently only in early access and the remaining features remain yet to be unlocked, the game is promising to derail any other games futile attempts at claiming the throne of theme park and rollercoaster simulators. Whilst the community have had their eyes opened by the prospect of RCT4 being released this year, that will only consist of being 'a PC experience'. Theme Park Studio will be THE PC experience, alongside being an actual video game rather than an internet focused module of course.\n\nIf you want the full package then unfortunately, you'll have to wait a little while longer before purchasing. But with that said, the content Pantera are promising to deliver is unrivaled in any shape or form, so I fully suggest if you are a potential buyer that you do so now to familiarise yourself with the current system in place. There is going to be a lot of brand new features down the line which thanks to the intuitive features this game boasts, is going to take a while to learn [that said, the learning curve isn't steep and the process is not arduous]. If you haven't been convinced to purchase this game yet, take a long hard look at the videos and screen shots that users have created thus far. I think they'll undoubtedly win you over.\n\nDanny.\nhttp://forum.themeparkstudio.com/index.php?action=profile;u=97","March 27, 2014","true","10.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

TPS is extremely flexible and customizable. Any object can be colored and given a sound, paths and coasters are entirely freeform, as well as the placement of objects. Because TPS does not have a money management aspect, it focuses on realism and additional tools to make the best theme parks possible. Most of the tools are simple to learn and simple to use, but it does require some practice before getting the hang of it. I am able to create the parks of my dreams and walk through them in first person! Not only am I walking through it, but there are also realistic guests who queue in line, ride the rides, and walk around the park with me. It really makes my dream parks come alive. With TPS, I can easily import, build, and animate custom flat rides, as well as make my own custom roller coaster trains. With the Steam Workshop, I can share my parks as well as download parks other people created and walk through them in first person.\n\nIf you have any interest in building your own realistic theme parks or only played sandbox mode in RCT, TPS is for you. If you are interested in managing a theme park, TPS may not fulfill your expectations.\n\nI have been a part of TPS since the Kickstarter and it has only gotten better and grown since. The developer is extremely responsive to the community and our demands. The TPS team is focused on making the best theme park creator out there, and keeps impressing me with every update.","February 9","true","208.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You know, the really good ones?   I actually felt like I was on one of those. :D\n\nThe ride you should defo go on first (the one I am gushing about) looks like a wind turbine, with just one long blade spinning in the middle and a cage at either end of the blade.  In VR it's awesome!  You watch the safety bar go down over you, the platform drops and then you start spinning.  It's convincing.  It's probably the VR experience I have enjoyed the most so far on any game.  It's also quite a buzz standing underneath the ride just watching it.  It's that good!\n\nThe game clearly uses physics too.   The trains feel like actual trains and to my laymen's understanding, behave like them.  For instance if a train doesn't quite have the oomph required to get over a crest of a peak, it will rocked back and forth between the slopes it is in until it slows to a stop. The rollercoasters are fully simulated rides and quite convincing in VR!\n\nApparently the game's main feature isn't VR but the comprehensive set of design tools used to create and share your own rides.  I didn't bother with those but if anyone out there wants me to try out one of their creations, the intenser, the merrier. Bring it on!\n[Please please PLEASE! When / if designing for VR, make it convienient for us to get to your rides i.e. please make it easy to get straight to the good stuff! Thanks! ;) ]\n\nAlso, constant 75 fps using DK2 on my rig, which is just shy of Oculus' recommended specs too.\n\n[CONS]\nMost of these issue are about getting to and from the rides, the rides themself are fab!\n\nSome things will no doubt be fixed, probably by the time you read this, e.g. at the time of writing the movement controls could do with some refining - strafing left and right would be handy etc.  Oh, and you have to do the Oculus Home confirmation screen each time you load a map.\n\nIn VR (only concerned with VR!), the fact the game is first and foremost a theme park designer, means at the moment it is a little rough around the edges.    The player can sometimes clip through objects or go to areas they shouldn't.  I have found I try to behave and follow the path like a good Theme Park customer!  Also, the gates can be a little tight for us to get through.\n\n@Developer: Would it be possible to provide a small set of tools for those designing parks for VR?  These could include extra wide gates to make it easy for us in VR to walk through!  Simply doubling the size would resolve this AND double size would mean the fences used for the rollercoasters would still match the train's doors?  :)\n\nTBH, the rides are the main feature and they are awesome!

But that recommendation is based only on the the rollercoasters.\n\nThe path system is difficult to use, and doing things like intersecting or splitting paths requires either special pieces which severly limit your designs, or you have to settle with goofy looking overlaps, in other cases you just can't do what you want. There are very few flat rides in the game and very few on the Workshop and those are of varying quality. It's almost as if the developers may plan on relying on their customers to make most of the real content. Most of what I see has me thinking that these guys may be in a little over their heads, or they simply released too early for even early access. I should probably note that my problems with the path system made me largely ignore the terraforming and landscaping tools, so I don't know much about those.\n\nBut now there's coasters, and while the interface isn't the best, it's not bad. The only tool I find myself really wanting is for the length slider to allow for longer track pieces. The coaster selection is slim but reasonable for the first release, as is the selection of premade special track pieces. You can however make just about any track shape you want, however it's not easy to get things smooth or symmetrical at this point without using the easy editor.\n\nSo if you just want a really good, likely to be great coaster editor, go ahead and grab this game. Just be willing to accept that development on other aspects of the game may be slow or incomplete, but the developer could finish the game as described and any future RCT titles may be in trouble.","July 2, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

They are going to introduce hot keys to get direct to the ride as I have had motion sickness just by walking to the ride with the controller.  The big mystery of how to walk in VR without sickness is yet to be solved.  The hyper jump just ins't convincing for me.\n\nSounds on the coasters could be improved but not bad by any means.  Thery have also fixed the seat issue which had you floating around the seat which is good to see.\n\nThere are other rides you can try.  In California there is some 2 pod rotating ride, it has nice wind sounds and it defintely makes you feel like you are on the ride and I prefer this to the coasters.  There is also a karting track, but I personally I don't feel it adds anything to the game.\n\nOverall in my 2 hours of trying the VR side this is a great start.

This is nothing like rollercoaster tycoon, this is way more advanced. If you're looking for something like RCT look elsewhere. This is pretty much just an empty landed sandbox that you can build park rides in (if you figure out how to do it). No one visits your park or rides your rides unless they are built into the ride. Maybe it will be a future feature, maybe not. I found this game way too complicated for me. Now this is just my personal experience, some people may find it easy and fun, but a lot of us aren't very construction savvy. I'll stick with RCT for now and see what developes with this game later on down the line. :)","December 17, 2014","false","2.7"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","10"

Sadly I only had time for a quick look and can still see some areas that need further work but there's no doubt that significant progress has been made that leads me to believe that these areas will also in time get attention. Certainly from  the quick look I had I've got little doubt I could now work around any other issues such that they would no longer detract from my enjoyment too much. Based on what I've witnessed I now feel able to recommend this title to those who are interested.\n\n**********\n\nBeen keeping an eye on this and No Limits 2 for a while and decided that now that the first 2 stages of designing coasters had been implemented I'd take the plunge as I wanted a tool for designing a wider world than NL2 is really intended for. I can see the potential in it but there are so many frustrating design flaws that I really haven't enjoyed my time with it so far.\n\nFirst issue is basic camera control. Apparently most users found the original setup really bad so they improved it. If this is the improved version I'd hate to think what the original was like. Okay, it's not terrible but is still very clunky and for a game that involves construction and therefore moving around all the time it should be better. Worst element is that although you can refine the controls there are bugs that mean the game 'forgets' your settings or jumps camera position at times. Bugs in elements like this should have been fixed much earlier in the development lifecycle.\n\nEverything from landscaping to placing track pieces is simple but simply complicated if you want to move from default values. The landscaping tools are an example of where you can set parameters, use the tool, use another tool, move back to the first tool and bam, your settings have reverted to defaults again. Because the settings are hidden behind another button you don't see them, click on the screen and damage your landscape. There's no undo feature so getting back to what you had can be a real pain. Forgetting to include an 'undo' function in a construction game beggers belief!\n\nPlace track and ask it to cut into the landscape - instead of cutting to just below the track surface it sometimes decides to eat a much bigger hole out of the ground instead. Try to raise blocks of terrain to resolve - it seamingly raises or lowers as it sees fit based on surrounding tiles! It's frustratingly difficult on occasion to grab a single terrain tile and raise 1 step at a time.\n\nDesigning flat rides in game is complicated. Elements like joints etc are in a different group to beams and blocks so you are constantly switching back and forth. Once built you need to add keystone animation. Why not have pre-built ride types where you can just click on individual pieces and edit each bit to create something unique which the game then compiles into an animated finished item using a built in physics engine? The more advanced tools could remain for those that want them. The building blocks are all in game but most people seem to be using an external tool for construction which speaks volumes.\n\nI can see the potential in the title and the fact that they wanted to create a powerful design tool to build your theme park but the same level of power could have been achieved in a far more user friendly way. Yes it's early access so bugs and other issues are understandable but there are fundemantal flaws in design concepts that will always exist. RCT3 was simple but limited in building blocks. Pantera should have 'borrowed' the same basic concept of simplicity in this title but expanded on the blocks and their functionality to increase the power. Click and place is fine but more expansive tools and features just aren't as obvious as they could have been. Sure you could design some beautiful creations in this over time but it's just a question of how often you want to bang your head against the wall in the process","October 11, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","9"

I love the concept and wanted to support it's development which is why I purchased it while in early access.  After starting the game there are currently several problems I am facing with it.  First and formost the game is very sluggish making it very difficult to work with.  Second the game crashes when trying to load a template, a premade park or a flat ride that is already created.  I want to like this game a be able to recommend it once iti is completed,  However if it continues to stay sluggish and crash on me once the game is completed then I will have felt like I wasted my $30 for a piece of software that doesn't work properly and i will not be able to recommend the game.

Although this is more of a tool than a game it still feels like a game. I recommend anyone who likes building theme parks to get this as it's such a cool program.\n\nI highly reocmmend watching the video tutorial which is accessed via the help menu :)\n\nOriginal review:\n\nPlease note this is a tool not a actual game, The main reason I got this was because I thought it would be like RCT but I was seriously wrong, You can build a park and that's it which was a bit of a let down, I'm hoping they add this sometimes as it's kinda boring right now being able to build a theme park but not actually do anything with it, such as riding stuff or anything. The "game" itself is pretty nice, I found myself struggling more to figure out how to build in this then I did with all the RCT games which was very surpising after reading other reviews.\n\nI think the major issue I have with this game is the description talks about stuff that isn't in the game, sure they will be coming in the future but the description suggests they are already in the game right now. Good tool if you just want to build a theme park but don't want to do anything else with it, bad if you want a RCT style game where you build a theme park, get guests, make money, expand etc.\n\n(I will be adding and changing this review as the game progresses as it's in early access)","April 8, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","11"

I heard the next one should be coming out later this year.\n\nReally, I could take the time to learn this game/simulator but I just decided to wait for the next Roller Coaster Tycoon. One of the things I loved about Roller Coaster Tycoon was being able to download and experience park recreations by other people. I think the ease of use of the game made it so more people could have the ability to make and upload them. For this game, the workshop is slacking and I think it may be because of that learning curve I mentioned earlier.\n\nI only recomend this game if you're willing to put the time and effort into it. I just went back to RCT3","August 11, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","9"

Created a coaster, used the undo-button once and the whole project was destoyed (coaster went underground, track was destroyed, ...).\n\nAlso the developement is a failure.\nNow there is a feature called "livepark" ...  some "networking" thing.\nThey put a lot of time in it, but that does not make sense, since the bugs are out.\nYou cant even load or save your park, also this is bugged, and then they work on such a feature ???\n\nWater is still only on one level possible, that is also not realistic, you cant build seas or realistic terrain with that, and the next thing is, if you want to include the bumperboats you also have the problem with this "only-one-waterlevel-thing".\nThe guys creating / programming this piece of sh*t do not know how to build a game.\nWatch a little bit deeper and you will see many awful things .. like : Ride-Lights are flat pieces and only depend of textures.\n\nOne of the best things is themselves. In their forum is a subforum called "Darkrides", managed by someone whos called "Bill Zanetti". Nothing happens in this subforum or this thematic, dont know if that guy is still alive or watching coasters from underground.\n\nIf you have a question about darkrides you still get the answer that it is not possible because it violates the rules (they are strong christians, and it seems that darkrides are generally a bad thing, like the Spongebob-Squarepants-Darkride).\nThats not understandable for me anyway and anymore.\n\nOver two years and still a not useable result, thats not acceptable for me. The developement is very slow, much too slow. They say they are only a small team, -> thats Ok, BUT you cant give customers a vision of a powerful simulaton-software, when the company is only a "Two-Men-Show" and you dont have the manpower to do so.\n\nTPS is one of the few things in my live where I am very unhappy with spending money on it.\nRefunds? Not possible, because working with this bugged "program" took too much time to figure out that it will even not get what it was supposed to be, maybee in the next comming 3 years, but I am not willing to wait for that time anymor after the last 2 years.","March 27","false","22.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

As with many others before me, I desperately have been on the hunt for a modernized replacement for Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 for over a decade.  Theme Park Studio, while still in beta, seems like it will never acheive the calibur of it's predecessor simply due to the vision leading the game's development.\n\nThere are no campaigns or objectives, other than building your dream theme park, and no indication of adding them either.  UI falls flat and dated, showing more hints of a coaster engineer's design tool than ease of use for casual gamers.  Design tools are very intricate and detailed, as they should be, but this makes the casual designer feel very daunted.  For example, learning the pathing tool took several hours and I still feel months of practice is needed to be able to plop down paths quickly when expanding the park.\n\nOn positive notes, the realism of coaster design, physics and mechanics are downright amazing.  The coaster building tool is easy to use and easy to get the hang of and very rewarding when a custom coaster is finished.  Transparancy with the development team is appreciated, but I do wish updates would come in quicker.  VR compatibility should prove to be innovative, but I forsee it only being used to showcase new designs from actual coaster manufacturers.\n\nTheme Park Studio seems like a great product to design a coaster and ride it every once and a while, but I doubt I'll ever see micromanagement of peeps, burgers and ticket prices in this "game".","May 10","false","17.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","5"

I like some of the features, but most features I dislike. I understand that the game is in Early Access, but I think I'll wait until the game is released in Beta.\n\nThere are a lot of things missing from the game. People still have not been added, so I'm waiting for that. Building paths and coasters can be confusing. I like the way paths could be constructed in RCT3, where it was easy to do things. TPS has more free flow, but intersections are almost impossible to make.\n\nCoaster building is somewhat like in RCT3 where there are premade sections you can build. It also has a touch of NoLimits because you can have more free flow to your rides. There's just a problem with block sections and adding new trains. I could not find a way to color my rides either. Smooth and straight options are desperately needed.\n\nIf you decide to terraform, make sure you do it before adding trees. If you add trees first, the terrain will raise around the trees so it looks like the trees were dug into holes in the ground.\n\nI found many bugs and glitches in the game. It never completely crashed, but it froze many times. I stopped playing it mainly because of that.\n\n5/10 - It's okay, but needs a lot of work.

In the end the TPS Alpha is running heavily unsmooth and is filled with a bunch of bugs. Even Bugs which existed in previous versions of TPS. When Buiding you're Park or you're Roller Coaster, be sure to save at least every sixty seconds due to crashes. When Buiding Roller Coasters the Build notes really like of beeing stuck and can't be altered in anyway if you want to smooth out a track piece or to widen a turn etc.\n\nCurrently it feels likes bugs ar not getting fixed as may previous extings bugs wont get fixed and if you're looking to other Games which are in pre-Alpha State like Unreal Tournmanet you will find out that there are pre alphas which actually can run smooth\n\nAs of Today i rate TPS with a 3 out of 10.\n\nIf all those bugs, crashes and low fps issues would get fixed and if more realism would enter the game in order to build realistic looking Coaster like you can do in No Limits, TPS could get a 10 out of 10.","May 16, 2015","false","54.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","3"

Although the idea of a next-gen RCT3 is great, this game fails to deliver. Although I understand that the game is in EA, it does not feel like a game and is nowhere near fun. The textures are gloomy and the ambiance is very dull-looking, as opposed to the fun and jolly RCT series. It feels more like an engine (without rollercoasters and ride-ins) than an actual game worth $30. I will update this review as new updates and phases come out, with my review hopefully changing for the better by than. It's a no buy for me at the moment though.","June 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","13","31","0","7"

If you buy this game you'll regret it.\n\nNo Limits 2 is a million times better and in terms of physics and performance, is how it should be done. No Limits 2 has much better community activity where you can download other people's coasters to ride. Supports Oculus too.\n\nFurther more, if you make a contribution to the forums about TPS, you may regret that too as you could be banned for the slightest negative suggestion. There's an awkward  "keep them in line" attitude, which either comes from an inexperienced teenage moderator, or a crusty old guy waving his ban stick at anything he doesn't like. Fun fact: I found out it's the latter.\n\nI received a permanent ban from the moderator after just one post. When I questioned the ban, the moderator stated that he was a "CIO with 25 years experience in the IT industry". He also stated that he is a "senior manager who sits on four boards etc". He basically ranted his resume at me.  I mean, seriously?\n\nYou don't ban someone after one post. My post was not offensive or anything, it just raised a  concern about the quality of the product and the over-moderation of legitimate on-topic ideas from other users. Their response? Permanent ban with the reason that I was "offensive and broke the forum rules" etc.\n\nAnyway, about TPS. The interface is annoying. Lack of undo is a joke. I don't mean "delete last object", I mean universal undo for all position changes, additions, deformations etc. It's the nature of terrain shaping and object alignment in 3d applications. You could be in for a painful experience if you try to put things back the way you had them a moment ago. In short, you can't put things back the way you had them a moment ago.\n\nIt takes time to get things looking right in TPS. It's quite frustrating most of the time.\n\nThe graphics seem dated, like something from the 90s.\n\nWait until it's free, but by that time the bloat of the program, the tacked on features, and the much better options out there such as No Limits 2, means even when it's free, it won't be worth your time.","October 16, 2014","false","21.8"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","9","23","0","3"

Because the latter is not possible in RCT3, I had two choices: NoLimits 2 or Theme Park Studio, I decided to try both.\nIn my experience, NL2 is far easier to use than TPS and it's also much faster (on my old, terribly slow machine TPS ran at 70% in an empty park, while NL2 still runs at full speed if you ride a coaster without scenery, edit: performance update coming soon). In four hours I'm still far from used to the controls of TPS while I got used to the NL2 controls within one hour, probably less. Good thing is that the path building has been improved (and it really, really needed it).\nFor my needs, Theme Park Studio is absolutely not the correct program (even though I thought it would be), and thus I won't recommend it.\n\nFor reference, this is wanted to do:\n-Design crazy track parts (and randomly add the rest of the coaster), usually without any kind of scenery\n-Ride great coasters made by others\n\nBoth programs have great rides made by others, but where TPS goes more for the simpler just click to build a piece of track (which is easier to get started with), NL2 allows you to easily modify every piece of track into ultimate detail which fits my experimental style of coaster building much better. It took a bit longer for the very first basic coaster (the built in step-by-step tutorial will help), but from then up to the control level I desired was much faster.","June 12, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","17"

I backed it on Kickstarter and eagerly anticipated the launch date. I then got the game, and was slightly disappointed. I understand that the game is still in Early Access, but there are a few major problems that I need to address:\n\n1. Reliability: one thing you'll remember from all three versions of RCT are their incredible stability. RCT1 and 2 were even built using x86 assembly language, which, despite being old, results in an EXTREMELY crash-proof game (except when using trainers, but that's to be expected). TPS crashes fairly often, which, although being understandable for an early-access game, does not warrant the price tag they are asking.\n\n2. Realism: Ok, so photo-realism is achieved in some cases, but not to the breadth I would have liked. The rides look great, but the included shops seem so cartoony that putting them next to rides is pretty odd looking. The built-in scenery editor is useful for overcoming this, but that comes with what I consider the biggest flaw of the game to be, which is\n\n3. Interface: This program seems almost user-hostile. Yes, there are shortcut keys for everything, along with mouse movements, but the control clunky, options don't make sense, and will sometimes do different things in different situations, and buttons exist that have really no right to exist. One of the best examples is with paths: there's a button to build new paths and a button to continue a path that has already been built. But a button with the same image is also used to bring up the path editor menu. The only thing I liked about the interface was the docking system, when it worked, but there were a few times when the docking menu crashed the game (guess it wasn't finished yet.)\n\nI understand the game is still in Early Access, but I cannot in good faith recommend it, especially when better alternatives exist on Steam\n\n","June 12, 2015","false","96.0"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","10"

There are no objectives, no restrictions, and no enjoyable moments to this. If you're looking for an alternative after Atari's RCT World trailer came out, you're out of luck here.\n\nUPDATE: RCTW EA is out, Planet Coaster is in AlphaThe competition has come out. Finally. So first, Planet Coaster looks like it's going to come out on top for those who want a game-like management experience. Roller Coaster Tycoon World looks like RCT3 with slightly better graphics and slightly worse engine. Theme Park Studio, it's an editing tool. Not a management game. Don't be decieved. Don't buy it if you're at all interested in the management side or an actual game, and don't be decieved by RCTW's lower price compared to Planet Coaster for early access. Planet Coaster is the best park sim in the works right now. But if you want a complex studio tool that's EXPLICITLY built for making park rides, then maybe this will be the one for you.

However it's more of an art tool rather than a game.  I'm very disppointed as the sponsored reviews made reference to it being comparable to Rollercoaster tycoon.  After an hour of searching, reading tutorials, and frustration, I was unable to even build a rollercoaster and activate the park with guests.  It's more of a modeling program than a game. If anyone can show me I'm greatly mistaken in my review, I am more than happy to listen as I had high hopes for this game.  Otherwise, I will write this game off as a loss.\n\n:-(\n\nAfter additional reading, I'm learning now that this game is a work in progress with a lot of basic funcationality missing.

Skip this for now.\n\nThis is barely more than a dev kit at this point. There is absolutely nothing to do except pick and place models right now to create the illusion of a theme park.\n\nThere is a road map for updates, and some look exciting, but a "game" built on promises hasn't been a terribly successful strategy in this industry. I expected to see some form of a solid foundation, and am presented with nothing of remote value.

This looked like it could be the best rollercoaster simulator since Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and looked like it could mix the best of the RCT franchise with the detail of No Limits. However, when the game came out I was severley dissapointed. Of course the features were limited at first, but that was expected. But when features rolled out, my buyers remorse incrased. I had originally written a positive review of this game, optimistic of its future. Now I feel ripped off on spending £20 on this game. If you want realism, go purchase No Limits (haven't used No Limits 2 yet but it looks fantastic) and if you want a more fun central game go play any of the first three Rollercoaster Tycoon Games, Parkitect or Planet Coaster (which again I am yet to play but looks stunning). Theme Park Studio is incredibly buggy, features infuriatingly buggy controls and a coaster builder that will make you punch a hole right through your monitor.
