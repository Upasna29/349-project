You are no longer trying to double tap the bottom screen of the 3DS to use an item. Instead you hit Select or whatever the keyboard control and press A on the item. The downside to this is the key items and map are also here, mainly the map. In the 3DS version you could have the map on the bottom, now you have to hit select then go to the map menu. I already beaten the game 7 times now so I don't need the map.\n\n- Better than both prequels. WayForward know how to make good sequels and this out of all 3 shantae games is so far my favorite. Longer story. fair gameplay, not too easy not too hard, it does get harder as you progress etc etc.\n\n- Good story\n- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)\n- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)\n- Challenging but not impossible\n- Excelent Platforming + Puzzles\n- Funny and unique dialouge.\n- Wonderful sprite animation\n- Awesome soundtrack\n- High replay value (After beating the steam version 3 different times I will have beaten this 10 times)\n\nCons:\n\n- Bad for players who do not have a thrill for adventure. This game does not exactly tell you what you have to do and where to do it. You have to use your brain and the tiny amount of hints the game gives to find out where things are. This is however good cause what's an adventure platformer if the game just tells you what to do and how to do it.\n\n- Grinding Gems to get items. The items for upgrades and moves can be way too expensive and useless. Like I said I beat this game a lot of times, I never used the back kick move, or the back dash. Back dash being 100 gems (not bad) and the back kick being 400 which is too much for something I never had to use. Also you have to upgrade your hair strength, whip speed, scimitar, and pistol 3 times which adds up to a lot of gems. It's not that bad to grind for them but it could of been done better.\n\nSo if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game. The story in this one is more deep than Risky's Revenge and the original GBC game. It is totally worth the 20 dollars to get.\n\nThat concludes this review with the 2 minor cons (one being really minor), I still have to give this game a wonderful score.\n\nI give this game a 10/10","April 23, 2015","true","10.6"," 108 of 118 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","108","118","3","0"

Now on to the update:\n\nPirate's Curse has many references to the original GBC game. Many of the songs heard in this game are actually remastered from the old chiptunes of Shantae. While the original game was MUCH more difficult in terms of travel from one area to the next, I feel like Pirate's Curse was a nice change from most of your troubles being day travel (or rather NIGHT travel when enemies were twice as tough) to more emphasis on labrinths, quests, bosses, and overall story.  I still think Shantae is one of the best GBC games out there so don't discount it just because I said Pirate's Curse is better. If you ever do get a chance, play Shantae (GBC).\n\nVerdict: Buy it now out of 10","April 24, 2015","true","42.7"," 90 of 94 people (96%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","96","90","94","21","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/345820/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","(Note: I fully completed this game on the Wii U, so I have the experience to write a review)\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse is a 2D Metroidvania Style Platformer with a little bit of RPG sprinkled in. The game takes place after Risky's Revenge. There's a spirit of a once evil pirate called the Pirate Master. His spirit awakens to find out he's capable of taking over Sequin Land, and tries to spread the area with Dark Magic, effectively ruling it slowly but surely. It's up to Shantae, paired up with Risky Boots, to stop the Pirate Master by going to multiple islands and taking out the areas where he's getting his power.\n\nThis game is SO much better than Risky's Revenge ever hopes to be. It has a much faster pace overall, so it never feels sluggish. Shantae's attack, movement speed, and even the gameplay itself is generally quick, making killing enemies much less slow and tedious, and making the game overall a better, more paced experience. Other than that, it also has a much more interesting story with tons of character dialog and more immersive character development with funny and witty humor.\n\nYou aren't limited to one huge area like in Risky's Revenge, but you now have multiple islands to explore, each with their own individual theme and secrets to uncover; also their own dungeon. It certainly brings a breath of fresh air very often with each of the island's own unique style of puzzles, platforming, and fights. Pretty much makes the game itself very diverse so nothing is boring.\n\nShantae can no longer dance, but find some of Risky's pirate gear so she is granted more abilites. For example, she can find Risky's hat to have herself gently float downwards or use wind to go up, or Risky's pistol to solve puzzles and shoot enemies from afar. You'll find a new item in each dungeon, and they are well worth the journey to get them. Of course, it also makes the puzzles much more varied\n\nThe game is a little more on the RPG side this time around. Shantae's hair and Risky's weapons can be upgraded, and Shantae can even learn some new moves. It takes lots of money to get everything fully upgraded, so spend your gems wisely. It doesn't sound like much, but it's actually alot to upgrade. There's also healing items that enemies drop, and sometimes even attack items. You can access all of that by simply going to the item menu and using it, easy peasy.\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful, and a FANTASTIC step up from Risky's Revenge. If you can get this, get it. It's a wonderful platformer series that has a great, memorable story, and fun, fast gameplay.\n\n9/10","April 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","54","57","0","3"

For the most part, the game is easy, then once you get to a certain island, IT GOES INSANE, then you leave and it's easy, then at the end it suddenly goes insane again.\n\nI'd rate it 85/100.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/345820/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse is a platformer game which was initially released on the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU. It's the third in the Shantea series. I haven't played any of the previous one so I was a little behind on the story here.  The game was released initially in 2014 and was ported to Steam in April of 2015. The 3DS release of this game was actually nominated for the best platformer and was also in the Top 10 games in the Nintendo 2014 survey of fans favorites\n\nYou play as Shantae, who is a half-genie. You goal in the game is to save everyone from "The Pirate Master", with the help of her what appears to be long standing nemesis, named Risky Boots.\n\nThroughout the game you will find various different "pirate equipment" such as pistols and cannons, these items are all used at various points in order to progress through the story. You can also upgrade all of your equipment too to make them more effective. This game is said to be the biggest in the series in terms of how many locations are included for you to explore. We also see a familiar mini-map screen you will have seen in Metroidvania style games before. The actual gameplay is very Metroidvania too, lots of jumping puzzles, thought based puzzles, enemies, collecting jewels and gems to find and chests with equipment and keys in to find.\n\nThe game uses a 2D graphics engine, which I can imagine looks pretty good on the 3DS, however it does look like a bit of an emulated game on the PC. The dialog scenes look nice, but the actual in game graphics are very pixelated, granted some people enjoy that style so that may right be up your street.\n\nI must warn you, this game is not easy at all. You will die, and die, and die plenty of times. It may even have you rage quitting at points that it is so frustrating, but you can't help but load it up again in order to move on. The difficulty curve is very up and down, sometimes you can be going through one level and think its actually quite easy, then all of a sudden you are failing countless times on a specific area in the zone. Being hard is not a bad thing at all; it's actually something I really look for in a game. I did have to revert to Youtube videos for hints on how to get past some levels though.\n\nA full playthrough of Shantea and the Pirate's Curse took me almost six hours. Sadly I don't think there is much replay-ability to be had here; once you playthrough it the once - there is really no other reason to playthrough it again.\n\nThis is actually a well put together port to the PC. The developers have gone to the effort of adding full controller support along with a graphically helpful control screen to go along with it. I would highly recommend you play this game with a controller aswell; playing on a keyboard would be a disaster.\n\nI would recommend Shantea and the Pirate's Curse; but not at full price. I think the six hours it took me to complete along with the zero amount of replay-ability means you should really be picking this up on sale. However I did enjoy playing it, it is in no way a bad game. I am looking forward to trying out the other games in this series now!\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This installment in the main Shantae series from Way Forward Technology, just like the previous installments, offers much more than whipping your hair back and forth, Willow Smith style. A 2D platformer with a stunning soundtrack, Shantae and the pirate's curse is truly a blast to play and is arguably the best entry in the series.\n\nAn uneasy alliance:\n\nShantae is a half genie girl, belly dancer, and the guardian of Scuttle Town. Following the events of Shantae: Riskys Revenge, Shantae has now lost her Genie powers, but instead gets to borrow some of her former nemesis Risky Boots weapons to get by. When the mayor of Scuttle town sells the town for some chocolate to the military madman Ammo Baron, Shantae is forced to spring into action. Bigger problems lies at hand though, as Risky Boots confronts Shantae about the impending return of the Pirate Master, an evil tyrant who was sealed away by the genies of Sequin Land long ago. They reluctantly choose to work together and weaken the dark powers across the land by visiting many different islands and defeating evil creatures to prevent the Pirate Masters return.\n\nHair whipping & dungeon exploration:\n\nShantae's pony tail is something to be respected and it will be your main way of taking on the great variety of enemies that you will encounter. Whipping enemies as well as breakable pots makes gems drop which you can then use to upgrade your various items and said hair. Scuttle town acts as the hub town and you return there many times to buy shampoo for her hair, making your attack power go up and a silky cream which allows for faster whipping. A few damage upgrades are also available for new items that you will acquire as you progress through the story.\n\nA 2D platformer with Metroidvania and The Legend of Zelda (Get item in dungeon, use said item on dungeon boss) style gameplay, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is certainly the best game yet in the Shantae series. Now that Shantae doesnt have to perform a dance (Although she is a very talented one) to transform herself into different animals but instead uses Risky Boots weapons and gear to get around, the pacing is a clear step up from previous titles. The dungeons are fun to explore and the platforming, while not being all that difficult, is still one of the best things about Shantae, mostly because of how perfectly precise the controls are. The dungeons also feature some thrilling boss fights at the end of each one, but I was a bit disappointed in the lack of difficulty and challenge most of them provided.\n\nThere are also Risky Boots army of small dark creatures called Tinkerbats that have been possessed by the Pirate Master's dark magic that Shantae can find in various locations. You can also find heart squids throughout the game that will increase your overall health. Just like in any Zelda game, trying to find all of these isn't all that compelling, with the somewhat lack of challenge that the game overall provides, but a few tricky platform sections and the latter part of the game will surely cause some unexpected deaths. The game lasted me about 10 hours the first time around and it also features a new game + mode, where you get to keep all your acquired items, but not upgrades and heart containers, and enemies do double damage.\n\n\nPresentation & Soundtrack:\n\nThe game looks gorgeous in all of its retro glory and is populated with lovable side characters, witty dialogue and some great 4th wall breaking moments (many of them courtesy of the reoccurring character, the self-proclaimed filler boss Squid Baron), amazing 16 -bit animations and it's the small details that really made me take notice. Shantae, as mentioned previously, is a seductive belly dancer, and sometimes she might start to sway her hips side to side to Jake Kaufman's expertly produced soundtrack. Even when you are crawling on the ground or carrying Rottytops, Shantae's green zombie friend, who just so happens to have a thing for genie brains, Shantae is shaking her behind or stepping to the beat.\n\nThe music is upbeat and absolutely brilliant and accompanies each stage perfectly. Jake Kaufman further enforces my strong need for great musical scores in video games because they can really make or break your gaming experience. With Shantae and The Pirates Curse, its top notch and I certainly don't blame her for dancing.\n\nVerdict:\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse offers superb animation quality, a downright awesome soundtrack and addicting gameplay that will certainly make you want to come back for more. It is not the best Metroidvania style game out there, but it is one of the most memorable and fun retro style games that i've ever experienced. Her hips don't lie and neither do I, so get this game, you will not regret it.\n\n9/10","January 1","true","8.8"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","44","54","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/recommended/345820/","arbco","Alien Rope Burn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/","761 products in account","Wow.\n\nIf you're played Risky's Revenge or read my review of the previous Shantae game, it's a pretty rough entry into the platforming genre. Pirate's Curse is, in turn, a vast improvement.\n\nThough it retains the same sprites that were used on the DSi, the resolution is much sharper, with crisp, attractive backgrounds and new animations thrown in. This also makes the HD graphics used for conversations and menus a lot less jarring, but they still look a bit odd at first. Though enemy sprites are reused from Risky's Revenge, it also adds a lot more of theIt also has a lot more enemies, and new huge, screen-filling bosses help make hitting the end of a level a lot more exciting than before.\n\nShantae feels faster, jumps farther, giving a better feel to the controls, and her speed and leaping ability grow dramatically as you go through the game. Unlike the "lock and key" transformations of Risky's Revenge, which often don't see much use outside of opening up a new zone, you'll find yourself using most of the equipment which replaces the transformations in regular gameplay. The extra movement options also make traversing zones a lot easier. This time, the zones are connected through a central hub, and you readily can get items that return you to the hub. The exploration is much improved, though it still struggles a bit (being able to warp directly to dungeons, for example, would have saved a lot of tiresome trekking). The levels are now quite varied, often with different gimmicks other than just graphical stylings.\n\nIt's also a lot funnier, and... might I say fairly fetishy by comparison, expecially during the early parts of the game. If that kind of thing bugs you, it will bug you. While it's not quite Totally Spies, some pretty odd fetishes feel like they're checked. I just find it amusing, but others might find the humiliating nature of some of the situations more problematic. Still, the dialogue is far more clever than earlier iterations, and generally got me to at least crack a smile at some of the back-and-forths.\n\nEven those "stop 'n go" enemies I hated from the previous game are improved. For example, Riskys' Revenge had mermaid enemies that would try to bore you to death through periods of invulnerability, but now their windows of invulnerability are now far briefer. In addition, often Shantae can dispatch enemies much faster... or, later in the game, just heedlessly charge through them or float over them. Magic has been replaced with limited-use items, though in some areas they drop often enough you may as well use them all the time. Overall, it's a clunky system compared to refreshing magic, but it's not a real black mark.\n\nUltimately, Pirate's Curse is a lot of fun. Where Risky's Revenge relied mostly on charm and nostalgia for appeal, Pirate's Curse has a lot more substance. It often has different sequences where it offers variations on the core gameplay to keep things from being too monotonous, and the new equipment keeps shifting how you play the game. Thumbs down on a final level that suddenly kicks up the difficulty drastically and frustratingly, but at least is capped by a very satisfying end boss.  Though it's not a breakthrough or a massive innovation in the genre, it's a very solid platformer that feels and plays great, and gives me a lot of hope for the upcoming HD sequel.","July 5, 2015","true","14.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nblastmax/recommended/345820/","nblastmax","NBlast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nblastmax/","245 products in account","This is what I call an improvement!\n\nIf you check my profile, you can see that I played and reviewed an earlier installment of the series: Risky's Revenge. While it was lacking in some aspects it was cool enough that after the convincing gameplays I decided to jump back to the series. This is definitely more fun and polished game and I can easily say it is worth your interest with only few hiccups along the way. If the game is solid, then I'm more than happy to nitpick some issues for further ironing out for the next Wayfoward's game. Criticism makes excellence!\n\nThe Good\n\nGame is notably faster than the Risky's Revenge. The previous game was pretty sluggish at times, but the improved controls, Shantae's speed and jumps in pair with good level design, help dictate a reasonable pace that makes you flow through the game. There are no noticeable frustrating moments. Graphics are in my favorite 16/32-bit Mega Man X4-rish style, that didn't really change after Revenge (with recycled sprites), but it still looks pretty nice, especially with the new locations. Bosses are definite plus. While not very challenging, they provide fun encounters. There are a lot of new faces as regular enemies which are good to see. Platforming? No complains there.\n\nMusic deserves an separate paragraph. Jake Kaufman did probably his best score yet. In my opinion it's far better than Shovel Knight's and provides tons of catchy memorable tunes that really "sells" the game. I would say that without this soundtrack, many locations wouldn't be as fun and atmospheric as they are now, since many of them are pretty generic. Mud Bog Island with Village of Lost Souls hidden within it is an great example of climatic location boosted by an amazing music. This stuff rocks.\n\nNitpicking (with Good sprinkled all over)\n\nFirst of... the story. Characters are likeable and unique, scenes are full of humor and plot overall isn't particularly offensive, but...\n\nLogic? Out of commission.\nSetups? Wasted potential.\nLore? Barely touched.\n\nIt looks like the devs had a plenty ideas for funny situations and hijinks between characters. There are lots of mini character arcs that bring this thing together, but logic behind why scene A resulted in events in scene B is completely bizarre. Keep in mind that this is a nitpick and Shantae doesn't need a great story to be an awesome game, but I would say that this is an aspect for further improvement.\n\nUpgrades. They are all powerful and really fun to use... unless we are talking about the Sword upgrade that is only useful for unlocking vertical shafts and nothing more. It gives no advanced mobility and is pretty weak against enemies. No sense in using instead of standard hair whip.\n\nPretentious stuff\n\nThere is also a strange dissonance in level progression vs. classic Metroidvania mechanics. Shantae controls would really shine in level-to-level progression system (intro level shows this), but this series was very exploration heavy from the start. Game tries to bring the best of both worlds, but levels are not-seamlessly connected and they are overall pretty small, so there isn't as much exploration as in standard Metroidvania and there are not enough set-pieces as for classic platformer. You can really feel it, as the game has less adventurish feel and yet doesn't deliver as much level-specific excitement as Freedom Planet or Shovel Knight. Luckily, this is subjective and not very noticeable. It doesn't affect the enjoyment as much, probably thanks to the overall solid experience crafted by the devs.\n\nSummary\n\nThe only proper negative that I can think of is the price. Content-wise, it offers a similar about of fun and features as Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet, yet it's price tag is 5 dollars higher. 15 bucks is a perfect price for fun and enjoyment you will get from Pirate's Curse. It's solid platform game that is definitely worth your interest since it holds up a great quality on par with other genre representatives. If you are a platforming fan, then you are making yourself a disservice if you won’t put it on your wishlist!","June 29, 2015","true","22.3"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","32","37","2","0"

At first i thought the gameplay wasn´t complex enough, but as you progress through the game you will unlock different stuff that will get you abilities such as triple jump, cutlass/pistol that give you some cool functionalities.\n\nThere is also unlockables in the game which are the Squid hearts and Dark Magics, collecting all dark magic will give you the "Good Ending" essentially and longer final boss fight so i recommend doing that. The Music is pretty neat and the characters offer lot of fan service and fun dialogue throughout the game. Shantae does share lot of similarities to Ori and the blind forest on its gameplay mechanics and similar setting where in the beginning of the game you don´t have that much things.\n\nAs you complete the game through first time you will unlock Pirate Mode which enables you to pretty much speedrun the game and get all pirate gear in the very first level.\n\nThe Better Side    Around 18h of Gameplay among NewGamePlus so theres lot of replayability too\nGreat Platform Action & Fan service\nItem System is very refreshing element to a platform game\nThe Characters have great designs and are very likeable\nGreat Level Design & MusicThe Worse Side    The Games last level raises the difficulty quite alot among the last boss\nGame doesn´t always tell u what do you need to do next, even the game is rather linear\nWish there was more audio dialogue, but i guess that doesn´t fit this type of a game in first place (Rather personal request)","April 8","true","18.9"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","25","27","11","0"

The big difference between this and Risky's Revenge gameplay-wise is that the various animal forms are exchanged for pieces of pirate equipment that hit all the cues of a metroidvania; you have your triple jump, speed dash, hover ability, et al.\n\nStage layout and dungeon design are simple enough, but the "overworld" aspects of each island is a little too similar outside of their general theme.  The game is collectible friendly in that each level keeps a visible tally of how many hidden items are each level and how many you have already tracked down.  There's enough stuff to find to incentivize revisiting areas but not too many that looking for secrets feels like a slog or unrewarding.\n\nThe soundtrack is as nice and catchy as is most of Jake “virt” Kaufman's stuff.  The spritework is good and the game controls well.  Using the inventory/map is a little clunky, but not a big negative by any means.  Pirate's Curse is a relatively easy game, though it has a couple of areas that can be kind of a pain, like the stealth section and a final leg that's significantly harder platforming-wsie than the rest of the game, though it's not especially hard.\n\nAll in all, a nice little game that will take most people between 8-12 hours to finish but I can see it having a good bit of replaybility since once you beat the game you can start a new game with all of your pirate skills unlocked from the start, so you can triple jump, speed dash and so on right from the start.  ♥♥♥♥ like that rules and means I'll probably play this again some time in the future.\n\nOne last thing, if the idea of cartoon boobs drives you crazy and makes you want to make a forums post about it, pass on this.  There are tons of boobs everywhere but if you have any background with original property WayForward games, this isn't a surprise in the least.  WayForward loves boobs.

The enemies are well placed in the stages, preventing you from mindlessly steam-rolling through the stage. There are a lot of secret areas too, which rewards you greatly if you find them.

Risky's Revenge had confusing maps and slow gameplay that eventually turned me away from it.\n\nBut here we finally have what I can confidently call an excellent Shantae game. The gameplay is so much faster here and the world has been split up into different islands, making map navigation no longer an issue. And the music, man, I swear Jake Kaufman gets better with every album he releases. Rave in the Grave just blew my mind when I first heard it. It's so catchy. And I was really surprised when Scorching Dunes started out kinda generic, but then slowly evolved into a tune very reminiscent of the old Sonic games. And the tracks actually change a little bit on their second loop, keeping them from getting repetitive.\n\nBut of course, there are issues. The Monster Milk items, which greatly boost your attack power, make most boss fights utterly worthless. The only boss that I kinda enjoyed was the Steel Maggot, because it had mechanics that went beyond just using the item you got in that dungeon. You need a little bit of observation and trial and error to beat it.\n\nHere's the problem with all of the Shantae games. Your most effective method of attack is a hair whip that can't be used while moving unless you're in the air. The devs then have to design the entire game based around that limitation. So levels are a lot of running, then stopping to attack, then running, so on and so forth. It's a lot like Castlevania Simon's Quest. Most regular enemies are no challenge and only serve to hinder your progress. (This is also why I appreciate the new pirate items so much. They let you speed through areas much more easily.)\n\nBosses are pretty much the same. They all have periods where they just stand still and let you hit them repeatedly, which is required because of the limitation of Shantae's hair. It's a fault by design and should really be changed for the next game, Half-Genie Hero. I should never get to a final boss and not be intimidated.\n\nBut hey, Wayforward isn't the biggest company out there. They did what they could and I think they did great. The art, the music, the characters, the humor, and the improved gameplay thanks to the pirate items make Shantae and the Pirate's Curse a memorable experience. I just hope that Half-Genie Hero doesn't squander the achievements made in this game and takes steps backwards.\n\n","January 7","true","12.3"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

It plays exactly like it does there, but there are very minor port issues I have, though it's not enough to hamper my enjoyment of this version.\n\nThe port issues thus far I've noticed is:\n\n1) The keyboard and controller bindings as of this moment cannot be changed or edited. It is a very minor issue, but I do usually like to customize my keybindings to something I find more comfortable, especially on the keyboard. The default bindings are a bit odd for the keyboard; being one of those sets that use the arrow keys for movement & ZXC/ASD for general action input like a game from the 90's would have instead of having WASD for movement & JKL/UIO for action input.\n(Port issue has been fixed!)\n\n2) During the opening level, the screen would continuously shake & quiver. It may have been the explosions of the buildings that shook the screen, but it seems to last longer then in the Wii U version, even after the explosion sounds stop. It does however eventually stop, but I thought it would be something to mention. Nothing that bad, just a bit odd.\n(Port issue has been fixed!)\n\nSo those are my opening thoughts on the Steam port for Pirate's Curse; one of the best games I've ever played on the Wii U, and now, despite than the minor port issues I mentions above, one of my favorite games on Steam; and featuring one of the most charming and adorable videogame characters you will ever go adventuring with.","April 25, 2015","true","13.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

WayForward's trademark heroine is back with a new adventure that will see her join forces with her sworn enemy Risky Boots, and swap her (half-)genie moves with a brand spanking new pirate arsenal.\n\nMuch like its predecessor in the series, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a casual adventure platformer with a charming cartoonish design. As per usual, the new abilities you unlock as the story progresses go hand in hand with increasingly challenging foes and level design. Although some backtracking will at times break the linearity, the game follows a stable pattern of unlocking new areas one after another, each of which will feature some sort of maze-like dungeon where you'll earn a new skill and fight a boss.\n\nAlthough the difficulty increases with each new area, it remains relatively easy on the whole, meaning you'll probably clear this ten-hour adventure without much frustration (only the final dungeon has a few brutal screens). If you've done a good job of amassing health upgrades, the boss fights are pretty straightforward and a wise use of the healing/shielding/offensive items will help keep you alive. None of them are hugely challenging, although the achievements for defeating them without taking damage are another story.\n\nWith the gameplay relying on rather classic action platformer mechanics and only posing a moderate challenge, its true highlights lie elsewhere. The cartoonish design is just delightful, most notably in the dialogue scenes where the character art is all kinds of cute. The writing is tons of fun, with heaps of absurd comedy, mild innuendo and occasionally breaking the fourth wall, all the same ingredients that had already made the previous episode so refreshing. Last but not least, Jake Kaufman's soundtrack is absolutely lovely, with a bunch of energetic, catchy tunes that will stay with you long after you've quit the game.\n\ntldr Recommended as f","May 5","true","18.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

And even though I have not played any of its predecessors prior to it, I can positively say that this was a great introduction to a rather underrated franchise.\n\n\nStorywise, it's pretty much like: "A great evil is attempting to rule over the land and you must stop it." I won't spoil what the rest is, but there ARE multiple endings.\n\nPresentation: The menus are a bit simplistic, but they get the job done.\n\nArt & Animation: Holy hell, are they FRIGGIN' AWESOME! just by LOOKING at the game you can see how much effort they put into character animations, especially in characters like Rottytops. The problem is some of the background can be a bit misleading. For example when I reached the part of Saliva Island with the Heart Squid (They increase your max health) behind stone walls, I thought that there was a secret room somewhere, but then I found out that the architecture on the upper-right corner was just background.\n\nPerformance: The game doesn't take much to run. Always a plus in my books.\n\nMusic: It's awesome, too! You got the pumping tracks of Tan Line Island and Scuttle Town, the dark and dreary Mud Bog Island and Village of Lost Souls, the cheery upbeat tracks of Propeller Town, the Tense Build-ups of the Pirate Master's Palace, and more.\n\nGameplay: Control is fairly tight, and thanks to a new update, a negative review has just been made redundant! The currency they use are called "Gems", but judging by the image in your HUD, they're Rupees. You can use them to buy Healing Items, Temporary attack buff items, Leaf Shie- I mean, Pike Balls, Pirate Flares which transport you back to the docks of an isand (Can't be used inside buildings/labyrinths), and Ability Upgrades/Advanced Moves (Like Jumping while KO'd in midair to recover.)\n\nThe upgrades are rather basic: Increase Damage and Speed with your hair, And damage for the rest. But the abilities are what sell it for me. ALL of them are used throughout the game: The Scimitar can be used to destroy blocks you can't destroy with your Whip/Pistol, the Pistol can be used to deal with distant enemies and switches, the Hat can be used to cross large gaps, the Boots to just speed through the entire thing while destroying everything in your way, and the Cannon, which gives you a Quadruple Jump (Cannonballs included).\n\nDifficulty: It's a challenging game, but the curve is a little bit off. For the beginning islands, the real challenge lies in knowing what the heck to do, but then you enter Mud Bog Island and the challenge ramps up due to the sheer amount of enemies you have to deal with. Then you reach the final level, which is pretty much an obstacle course set to test how good you are with the abilties. Can you reach great heights with the Cannon? Can you maneuvre around Spikes with the hat? Can you dash to the end with the Boots? If not, you will be using at least 3 potions just for the entire obstacle course.\n\nReplay Value: Unless you're a completionist or if the game is so good that you just want to play it again, there's not much replay value.\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nPresentation | 6.0/10 (Menus and dialogue boxes look simple, but it doesn't count much towards overall score.)\n\nArt & Animation | 9.8/10 (The pixel art animations look amazing, the game is bursting with colour, and the character portraits during conversations are a nice touch. But some of the background can be a little misleading.)\n\nPerformance | 10/10 (Always ran at 60 Fps throughout the entire adventure.)\n\nMusic | 10/10 (The score is just plain awesome, nothing else needs to be said.)\n\nGameplay | 9.0/10 (Control is tight, abilities are useful, but the Hat can be a little clunky sometimes.)\n\nDifficulty | 9.6 (The game is fairly challenging, but the curve is a little off, in my opinion.)\n\nReplay Value | 3.5 (Unless you're a completionist, I can't see a reason to replay the game again.)\n\nOverall | 9.4/10 (Apart from a few minor faults, and the fact that there's not much left to do once you beat the game, it's still a great game that every Metroidvania lover will enjoy.)\n\n\nMisc bits of advice: If you played the original Shantae before this, once you have the Boots, charge into the left corner of the first room of the first labyrinth. You won't be disapointed.\n\nEdit: I raised my review score because a recent update now allows you to change the controls, and gave Music/SFX sliders.","April 29, 2015","true","7.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Discovering things on your own is always a delight.\n\nThere's a ton of items and powers to unlock and it makes it so you can explore all the levels over and over unlocking new paths in a Castlevania/Metroid-y sort of way.\n\nThe art design is adorable and every character is adorable and the whole game is just adorable.

This game take place after the events of Risky's Revenge, so if you haven't played it and don't want to be spoiled stop reading the review and go play it.\n\nShantae is trying to remain guardian of Scuttle Town as a full human with no genie magic. Risky come in and tell her that the Pirate Master is returning and they must band together to stop him. The story is nice and got some good developments/reveals for the side characters. I personally like Rotty Tops backstory in the game. It may not be an award winning story, but it good enough to keep you entertained to the end.\n\nThe gameplay is the same in the previous game. A side scrolling platform where you whip you're enemies into submissions. In place of the animal transformations from the last game, you will now use pirate items to help you progress through stages and defeat enemies. At the shop you can buy additional items and potions to help you along the way and upgrade your attacks and pirate gear for more damage. The gameplay is solid, no real fault that I encountered.\n\nAll in all the game plays like Risky's Revenge but with pirate weapons in place of animal transformation, but it longer which is good. If you read my Risky's Revenge review, I said the only downside was how short it was. This game is long enough to keep you entertained and got some backtracking in it if you want get 100%.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse kept me entertained to the end and left me wanting more. A good sequel and a must buy if you a fan of this series or just like 2D side scrolling platformers.","April 26, 2015","true","14.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Compared to Risky's Revenge, this is like 100x better, so if you liked Risky's Revenge, this one is a must buy.\n\nPRO's:\n\n- Perfect controls - never had a fail jump or miss-shot due to controls\n\n- Fun and addictive game - the characters are fun, as-well as the story and you will hardly get bored while playing\n\n- Graphics - a pixelated masterpiece. The characters and environments are rich in color and animation. Not one zone looks the same as another\n\n- Music - what good is a game without some quality music? Each zone has it's specific tune, some new, some remixed from previous titles and will set the perfect mood for each stage and situation\n\n- Gameplay - this is the major improvement over the last title.  They mixed the diversity and complexity of the 1st game with the quality of Risky's Boots and they managed to obtain a solid and lenghty game. When I completed the intro and saw that this game is composed of multiple islands (stages), I snapped my fingers and said to myself: this is promising. One hour later I was drooling at how awesome this is\n\nCON's:\n- If you want to gather all the hidden items, you will need to write the progress down a paper, because the game informs you of this only on the stage (island) select screen\n\n- The inability to tweak the volume and customize the controls...hopefully these options will be implemented with a future patch\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nDoes it worth the full price? Yes! It's one of the few games that I bought it at a full price and didn't regret it. So, if you want a solid platformer, with awesome gameplay, characters and story...then don't look further.\n\n\n\n","April 26, 2015","true","46.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The final area comes in at a 9 or a 10, all due to it's platforming sections.\n\nThere is a difficulty spike for no reason other than it's the final area, I guess, which could put some people off who were enjoying the way the game was the previous 7 to 8 hours.  I know when I got to the platforming sections of the finale, I was like "What the hell?

At a glance, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse may look like a game for kids, but it's actually very deep and expertly designed, appealing on a variety of levels from platforming and exploration, to music and visual style. I love the sense of humor, too – there are tons of outrageous gags that make both the good guys and the bad guys completely lovable.\n\nMore so than its predecessor, Risky's Revenge, Pirate's Curse feels like a platformer, with more clearly-defined levels (islands that you sail to) and difficult platforming segments that require multiple attempts to complete. There's a general lack of warp points within the levels, which can make for a bit of frustration when you realize that you have to go through an entire area again to pick up something you missed. Also, the whole game feels a bit too small, and I wish there were more support items to use (like the pike balls) to add more depth to the gameplay.\n\nProblems aside, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is the most fun I've had with this genre since the classic 2D Castlevania games. It's funny, stylish, and all-around an outstanding game that I heartily recommend.\n\n(Rating: 8.5/10 “Excellent”)\n\nNotes: I played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. I recommend using a console controller like this for all platformer-type games, since it allows for greater precision control.","May 14, 2015","true","19.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This game feels open, sure there is some backtracking here and there but even the backtracking is fun in my opinion because while u backtrack u grind for $ which u could use for awesome upgrades in the shop\n\nspeaking of upgrades the upgrades are fun to use and are very useful. you get some of the upgrades from the story itself like a hat that lets u float or a pistol, or even a sword, while other upgrades are availible in the shop like cream for shantaes hair letting her use her hair-whip faster or shampoo which will allow it to do more damage. there are lots of other upgrades as well\n\nthe bosses are also incredibly fun and funny. i love that they brought back the squid barron from riskys revenge, the best part about it was that he kind of breaks the 4th wall by complaining that he was put in the game as a "filler boss to round out the package". im not going to spoil anything but lets just say the whole thing was funny\n\noverall shantae and the pirates curse is a FANTASTIC game which i highly recommend to absolutely every1. as a platformer it is fun, controls better than any other platformer i've ever played, and has many cool unique spins on the genre. in addition to that the funny bosses, the memerable charactors, and the good story make this A MUST BUY in my opinion. while the game is somewhat short at 7-10 hours in the 1st run it does have a lot of replay value\n\nmy only complaints are that the default controls are a little weird (you can remap the buttons but i usually dont like remapping the buttons), you cant remap anything to the mouse (which stinks cus i have a 6 button gaming mouse and it would have made the controls 10x easier for me), and lastly there are some moments where shantae talks but only says 1 or 2 words out of the whole text so it would have been nice if they could have got the person who does the voice of shantae to record more of the text, i mean seriously either do all of it or none of it dont just record 1 word and ur done\n\nLastly even though i highly recommend this game i cant recommend it for $20. The game is fantastic but $20 is a little much for a 10 hour platformer. i got the game during the steam summer sale for $15 but i recommend waiting until the price drops under $10 before getting it.\n\ni give this game my Rkraiem100 score of...\n\n9.8/10!!!\n\nPROS:\n- Fantastic level design\n- Memorable charactors\n- Interesting story\n- Fun gameplay\n- Unique items\n- Great bosses\n- Funny references and jokes\n- Perfect difficulty curve for beginners and advanced players\n- Not too much backtracking\n- Great replay value\n\nCONS:\n- Cant remap buttons to mouse\n- Game is 7-10 hours long","June 25, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/345820/","yoj","Yoj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/","209 products in account","Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a classic 2D action platformer with metroidvania elements. However, compared to most generic modern platformers, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse distinguishes itself by the highest level of quality, with WayForward's pedigree in game development clearly visible throughout the whole game. Actually, this game is a part of an established series, being the third and latest installment to date.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the overall quality of graphics and animation, with the game being mostly done in awesome high-quality pixel art. Shantae also takes advantage of modern platforms by using high-resolution character sprites for dialogue segments. Everything looks even better in motion — the animations are surprisingly detailed and very smooth, so the fact that there are a lot of them in the game is a cherry on top. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse combines regual 2D pixel-art and modern visual effects, which look together better than you'd think. The game runs at 60 FPS, like platformers used to, and actually, should be played. Super smooth animations and super precise movement — eye candy and a soothing experience where the character moves exactly like you want them to.\n\nMusic and sound effects in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse don't fall short of the graphics, with the game featuring a large number of high quality and atmospheric music tracks, which greatly fit not only the overall game, but individual levels and characters as well. And since we're on the topic of levels, it should be mentioned that level design in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is great, both in terms of visuals and platforming. It's clear that developers at WayForward are masters of old school platforming, employing challenging and interesting design, traps, secrets and everything else that makes this game feel like such classics as Megaman.\n\nEvery world in the game (seven in total) not only has its own visual theme and music, but is also designed around different types of platforming that you'll need to employ. Some levels feature platforming that is heavily influenced by games such as Megaman, while metroidvania elements present themselves mainly through the world being a bunch of inter-connected locations, presence of hidden areas and new locations slowly becoming accessible with new item acquisition.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series, where Shantae used her magic, this time you're faced with the fact that she lost it (in the previous game), so she must overcome the challenges with various items that she'll come across through the game. Usually in a game like this items would be for unlocking / adding abilites, and weapons would be used for fighting, but in Shantae even weapons unlock new abilities to the player.\n\nThe game world consists of different islands that are unlocked after completing boss fights. These boss fights aren't that difficult, especially if you stock up on healing items, but fun nonetheless. Bosses are very large, and have a cool design, which comes in variety - a huge-♥♥♥ tank straight outta Metal Slug, a misspelled fire-breathing monstrosity Dagron, and of course, an abomination to your screen space in form of the final boss (true form only).\n\nTo sum it up, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a joy to play, not only because of visuals and sound, but stellar level design and gameplay. An interesting cute protagonist also helps. For some reason people mostly missed out on this gem, with SteamSpy estimating sales at ~25K. But you definitely should buy and play this game, even if you aren't a fan of the genre.\n\nP.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the CRIMINALLY Low Sales steam curator.","February 5","true","18.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

You play as Shantae, the half genie guardian of Scuttle Town. Recently you have lost your magical powers, but you don't let that stop you from saving the town once trouble comes through. Most of the trouble is caused by evil magic being sent out by the imprisoned spirit of the Master Pirate. It's your job to team up with your former rival Risky Boots in order to stop his minions, collect the magic, and prevent his spirit's escape.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. You can run around, jump, duck, crawl, and whip your hair to attack. Along the way you will receive new items and upgrades to give yourself more abilities and more power. You use these abilities to access new areas in order to find secrets and progress. There are a few light puzzles and fetch quests sprinkled in, but the main play will consist of traversing overworlds and conquering dungeons. You can also increase your health and carry items to heal you on the go or to give you some other battle assistance. You'll need to skilled in combat, platforming, and adventuring to complete this game.\n\nThe music is overall pretty great, being polished and interesting to listen to. The art is a mixture of two styles. The playable game consists of colorful pixel art that is well animates, while the dialogue bits have hand drawn cartoonish representations of the characters. The sound effects are also an interesting mix of higher quality voice and sound sample along with retro style video gamey effects. The controls are tight and understandable. Plus, the dialogue is cute and can actually be funny at time. It's an interesting mixture.\n\nFor those who played Shantae: Risky's Revenge before this as I did, you'll be glad to know that nearly everything has been improved upon in this game. You get lots of new abilities rather than just recollecting the same ones from the previous game. The story is even more interesting with the same quality of dialogue. The hand drawn art is different, but it seems to have a bit more detail. This game has more length, with more places to explore, things to do, things to find, people to talk to, and just generally more everything, which means even more quality playtime. The difficulty is also higher for those looking for a greater challenge, which is welcome since this is a sequel, but not too hard for newcomers that would like to try it as well. The map system has been improved to read more like a standard metroidvania style map and show you where you have and have not been. If you liked exploring, platforming challenges, puzzle challenges, combat challenges, and just the overall gameplay of the previous game, you'll love this one even more.\n\nThere are a few issues with the game though. One that may have just been for me was that sometimes there was a flickering glitchy effect on some backgrounds. This usually only happened in the company logo right away and on the world selection screen, but it also did happen consistently in one temple where I kind of needed to know where the walls and floors were. It was only for that one room in the one temple, but it kept happening after a few reloads so it may be a real problem for others as well. Also, I didn't think the cartoonish characters hand drawn in dialogue scenes meshed well with the pixel style of the game. Mayb it's just me, but I would rather just keeping it all one way. That's minor. The difficulty could be a problem. It's harder than the previous game, which is good for people who played that first and it's not TOO hard for those who want to jump right in, but to some casual gamers it could be a bit too tough to get through. While I like that the map system has been reworked and the sailing aspect works will with giving Risky more purpose, it's a shame that instead of one big interconnected world it's now multiple smaller worlds you have to select separately.\n\nOverall, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is awesome. If you like metroidvania games, it's a great one. If you played the previous game (which I also reviewed on here) and liked it, this is definitely worth looking into. It's a fun, metroidvania adventure platformer with a pretty style. I like how fun, challenging, and yet forgiving the game is to make it a lot of fun to keep playing. Another one of the best games I've played on Steam. Is it worth the 20 dollar asking price? Well, personally I would say that, if you're really interested and liked the other Shantae games, then of course. Otherwise maybe wait for a sale. I got it for 15 and it was worth not being able to wait anymore. If nothing else, getting it at 10 bucks or less at some point is going to be a real steal, especially for all the content here.

Also I really don't get why indie Metroidvanias insist on being twitch platformers because the final dungeon is such a pain in the ♥♥♥. Indie devs need to stop that ♥♥♥♥, it’s one of the reasons why I don't think any of them rival the genre namesakes still.

For starters, I didn't play any other Shantae games other than this. But judging by the trailers for the other games, I can easily assume this is the best. This game came out last year on 3DS and Wii U, and just a few months ago was ported to the PC. Here's my review.\n\nThe game plays like your average platformer. You control Shantae, who uses her hair to whip enemies, although later she gets upgrades like a gun, etc. The controls feel very smooth and responsive. You travel through six locations where you have to accomplish certain things and then go to the dungeon of the world. This heavily reminds me of Zelda, especially considering there are chests, keys, items, puzzles, etc. There are also a lot of secret items throughout the game. You can get jellies, which you can turn into health, and there are also bats I think that give you dark magic (you'll find out the use as you play). Also, you can use money earned from defeating enemies to buy one-time items (spike balls, shields, potions, etc.) or permanent upgrades (faster whip, more powerful, etc.). One thing I don't like is that some items are hidden in places that you either don't see (so either you have to get to them by complete accident or by trial and error), or that look like you can get them but you really can't. For example, there is a section in the sand that has tiny platforms that break upon touching them. I got very frustrated trying to get it, only to give up and learning that you can get it, but only after getting an upgrade. If it was more obvious that I couldn't get it, then I wouldn't have to be frustrated.\n\nPresentation-wise, this game has great graphics. They are in a 16-bit SNES style, although on top of that, there are full artworks of the characters in-dialogs. For some reason, WayForward decided to use a default font for the dialogs, which looks quite ugly and annoying if you ask me. The soundtrack? Don't even ask. It's f*cking amazing. The composer also made the soundtrack for Shovel Knight, Duck Tales Remastered, Contra 4, etc. There isn't full voice acting, only occasional words by certain characters are pronounced, ususally sound good, but can get annoying at times.\n\nWell, this game isn't super long either. You can beat it in three hours easily. Do I recommend it? Definitely. It is a little expensive compared to other indies (20$), but I still think it's worth it. Buy it, you'll like it!","June 26, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is addicting and easy to dive into, whether you play on a keyboard or with a controller.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone, it's just an easy, enjoyable game.

Long story short with the history of me and\nShantae, the gameboy game was a great part of my childhood, and i wouldnt be here reviewing the games\nwithout it.\n\nIn anycase, seeing both the new games on steam, i bought them on an instant,\nas i knew that the games where made by the same guys, so i knew it be a\ngreat experience, just like with the gameboy color game.\n\nI will seperate each review for both pages, so beyond this sentance, the review will be different.\n\nHere is my review of Pirate's Curse. Similar to Risky's Revenge, it has the same sprites and graphical style,\nbut the view is zoomed out, giving you a wider range of the area you play in.\nThe is seperated into islands, and each offers a unique feel, music and challanges, thus giving a more\nvariation.\n\nUnlike the previous 2 games, Risky's Revenge and the Shantae on the Gameboy Color, this game doesnt offer\nany transformations, but isntead, gives you artifacts that gives you new abilities, while the belly dance was\nreplaced with an oil lamp that allows you to absorb dark magic or other gas like materials, wich will come\nessential.\n\nThe musics are amazing, and some of the songs are pretty darn cute, and it certainly requires alot for a music\ntrack to sound cute.\n\nThe sound effects are more 16-bit like, giving a more retro feel.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat more cryptic at times for first time players, so for those that does not like exploring\nor problem solving, they will be getting a little lost at times.\n\nThe Expression of the characters are cute, and really shows the\npersonality of each character during dialogs, and Shantae is amazingly cute in this version.\n\nAgain, Kodus to the developers of giving my childhood game new life, and a great experience\nthat i will forever remember.\n\n\nSo for my thoughts about recommending the game to people? Well it all depends on the person.\nIf you like retro like games, or simply was a fan of the old Shantae game, this is for you.","July 19, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For a single game to be able to do that speaks volumes about its quality. Now let's take this already flawless platformer and make it even better. What do you get?  You get Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.\n\nHOLY COW!!! This game is incredible! It somehow managed to take everything the previous games did right and perfect it. The game mechanics, from hair whipping to hat parachuting to simple running and walking animations, are very fluid and wildly entertaining to witness. The pace of the game is never too slow because you're always getting new items, which each give the game a new level of depth. The various levels you explore are vibrant and colorful, or dark and forboding if it's a dangerous level, but the tone matches each stage perfectly and helps to draw you into the world. All the characters are incredibly loveable and fun, and the character models themselves are stunningly beautiful from an artistic perspective! The music is also ridiculously catchy!\n\nI have tried, but I honestly CANNOT find a single problem with this game. The developers at WayForward have poured their hearts and souls into this game...and it really shows! As I have said previously on my review of Shantae: Risky's Revenge, this is a series that should absolutely be played. I can personally guarentee that you will not be disappointed if you buy this game, even at full price! Thanks WayForward Games for my favorite Half-Genie!","December 26, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Matt Bozon & co. simply know what they're doing and that's that.\n\nPros:\n- Quality action/adventure in the vein of Metroid (in a cartoonish 1001 Nights-inspired setting);\n- Tight controls;\n- Nice difficulty curve (difficulty is only average, but the ramping up difficulty felt properly satisfying to me);\n- Great art and character animations, as is always the case with WayForward;\n- Great soundtrack by Jake Kaufman (other Shantae games, Mighty Switch Force, Shovel Knight);\n- Lots of variety in every aspect, from enemies to levels to music to gameplay mechanics.\n\nCons:\n- Initially feels a bit limited, takes a bit of time to really get going (although never to the point of boredom for me personally);\n- Some people might not like old-school backtracking (e.g. you get an item--now you must find which previously met NPC to show it to);\n- Wacky writing occasionally feels a bit dumb rather than silly, but that's rare and mostly in the beginning;\n- High-res character portraits and fonts clash awfully and quite inexcusably with pixel-painted graphics;\n- Post-game / good ending stuff can get a tad tiresome, although the true final boss is satisfying enough.\n\nAll in all: despite the stuff listed as flaws, it's one of the best games in the action/adventure ("metroidvania") genre. Get this game and play it, you people. WayForward is a great studio. God bless WayForward.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/recommended/345820/","aasha","Aasha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/","111 products in account","While "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse" is a lot like "Shantae: Risky Boots' revenge" in some ways it's also unlike it in a lot of ways as well. It's ultimately still a platformer and a skill-attaining game that opens up more areas, but instead of an overworld you are given stage select screens. And instead of magic you have pirate items.\n\nThe first impression I had when I started playing was that the game was confirming the magic is no longer a thing due to the events of the last game (Risky Boots' Revenge). Honestly Shantae's transformations were a big part of what I found to be entrancing about the previous game. The fact that it was gone for good left me feelign liek there was a little hole in the heart of the game that wouldn't quite be filled by the new skills. And really they didn't fill that hole but they were still decent game mechanics.\n\nShantae's friends played a more active role in this game than they did in the previous game which I totally approved of. In "Shantae: Risky Boots' Revenge" Rottytops, Bolo, Skye, and Uncle Mimic were ultimately just there to exist - they did nothing and were as forgetable as any town NPC save for the fact that they had unique appearances. In Shantae and the Pirate's Curse they actually take part as plot devices throughout the story. They're more like characters and less like decorations - very enjoyable characters too.\n\nOn that note I was kinda meh about the whole teaming up with Risky Boots concept. When the only thing Risky does is sit at the dock and drive you from one stage to the other she becomes decoration. She does have her own part in the story of course, but she's given reasons all the time for why she cannot participate in anything which waters down the whole "teaming up" concept. I think a more interesting way to handle it would be to give Risky the pirate gear and leave Shantae some magic and transformations. It would have required different stage setups, but I feel it would have added something (pirate skills and a true teaming-up concept) without taking something (the enchantment of the transformations).\n\nThe items Shantae finds are all pirate items that were owned by Risky Boots before they were taken from her:\n\nThe pistol is mostly only good at hitting distant puzzle switches unless it's tuned up to max level. The pistol basically replaces the fireball spell from the first game (1-damage). With no limit to bullets there's nothing stopping you from slinging all the bullets you want out there but it's still slower to shoot 5-8 bullets than it is to just go up and hit someone once with her hair. When maxed up (5-damage) the pistol is actually pretty okay as a weapon. 2-3 shots will kill most minor enemies.\n\nThe hat feels kinda dumb in all honesty. It's basically a parachute or a glider depending how you use it. I feel it's just dumb that a hat is given noriety as a pirate item belonging to Risky and the Pirate Master but all it does is catch wind like a parachute. As far as game mechanics go it's alright. When you get the cannon you'll never use it again except for the puzzles that require you use it. I will give the animation credit though; it looks adorable.\n\nThe scimitar is simply a down-thrust while in the air. This works really well in combat as well as opening passages under Shantae's feet. You can also see the scimitar when using the boots which I think adds a little more flavor to the item than a one-trick pony (realistically a sword feels like it should be usable as a weapon but it is what it is. There are a few enemies that are much easier to fight when down-thrusting above them.\n\nRisky's boots are only usable on specific situations: primarily when there's enough flat land for running (technically you can do a back-and-forth run and it'll still count as the building speed phase but no secret areas seem to be level with any of these areas I've tried it on which makes me think the developers might not have actually intended the back-and-forth movement to be a viable way to activate the boots). Once activated Shantae rushes in one direction dealing damage to anything that touches her and tearing down secret hidden walls. It's gimmicky as far as combat goes. You'll only end up using it when the stage was designed for it to be used since it requires prepping to pull off.\n\nRisky's cannon is basically this game's double-jump (though technically you can use it three times per jump). While in teh air the cannon will fire downwards and propell Shantae upwards. Once you get the cannon you'll use it a lot simply for the overwhelming convienence compared to Risky's hat. In combat it's okay but really Shantae's hair and scimitar take care of most things combat-wise anyway - it's good for avoidance though.\n\n\nThere were also certain skills you could learn from a shop in town:\n\nThe Back Dash makes Shantae slide backwards just like the first game. You'll never use it. If it were a particularly fast slide it'd have merit but it slides her backwards at the same exact speed you could just move her in that direction. The animation put into it is lovely though.\n\nThe Back Flip can be a life saver. typically if you're hit hard or hit at all while in the air you'll be knocked back and fall until you hit the ground. If you back flip you'll hop out of that state and be able to control yourself. I found this particularly importanbt when jumping from rope to rope over pits. Backflipping and gliding with a hat or double jumping with a cannon back to a rope kept me alive a dozen times or more.\n\nThe Power Kick is just straight up stupid. It's a slow melee kick that does barely any better damage than the hair. The hair will do about 8 damage and can be spammed. The kick will do 10 damage but you'll take about a half second to do it. That's not even considering the button combo you have to do to pull it off. It is also shorter range if I remember right. You'll buy this to try it (because your curiousity will force you to) and then you'll never use it again. It's a badly implimented mechanic.\n\nThe level design - and the story surrounding each level - throughout Shantae was pretty cool all in all. It never took itself too seriously but it kept me enraptured all through the game. It even managed to make a filler boss battle feel like more than it was. The Shantae games seem to excel at this through sassy comedy and sexy-cute visuals.\n\nI don't mind puzzles as long as they don't stop my progress. For the majority of the game this was okay. I was never hung up on anything long until the very last level. I'm of the belief that any game that has life bars or HP counts in them should stray away from including any instant killing factors (aside for bottemless pits anyway since that's just how it goes with pits). The final level is literally full of things designed to kill you in one hit. You'd probably think "well the last level is suppose to be hard, right?" and you would have merit to think this. But at the same time this game has you putting forth a lot of exploration and effort into finding heart squids to increase your HP. What is the point of this if when the final level comes you'll just die in one hit anyway? Is it challenging? Yes. It's also bad design.\n\nUltimately I did enjoy this game. The animations were sexy, adorable, and happy. The puzzles were mostly moderate or easy. The story was silly and fun. It didn't have quite the same flair as Risky's Revenge (the loss of magic really hit the alure), but I still recommend it.","April 14","true","17.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/345820/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse is a fairly easy 2D action platformer. You play as Shantae, a half-genie who is now just all human.\n\nOddly for a platforming game, there is actually a fair bit of story here; Shantae and Risky Boots, your sidekick/captain, are both reasonably well characterized, and the game makes a lot of call-backs to previous games… which I haven’t played. While the game IS comprehensible, I have no idea who any of these people are so the little side-stories which feature them lack meaning for me. That said, the game is full of funny dialogue, and Squid Baron in particular made me smile with his fourth-wall breaking rants. The game doesn’t take itself too seriously, and he was a particular highlight of that, but on the whole it worked reasonably well, even if it did rely a bit heavily on lampshade hanging for its humor.\n\nGraphically, the game is reasonably attractive as well; the 2D Sprite graphics look pretty good, and the larger character portraits which appear while the characters are chatting look great. The game’s comedic style extends to its art, with the characters having amusingly exaggerated expressions. The game’s art is somewhat sexualized – the artist clearly loves voluptuous women, and the hips of the game’s female characters don’t lie – but it wasn’t to the point where it bothered me, and it is often played for laughs, particularly given one of the characters is an attractive female zombie. Plus, let’s face it – a lot of people like looking at pretty ladies, so that’s really probably a plus for a lot of folks. If that sort of thing DOES bother you, though, this is likely a game which will trigger your distaste, as several of the female characters are a bit bouncy.\n\nSquid Baron, again, really shines here – his sprite is amusing enough, but his character art is great, and his hyper-exaggerated expressions really help sell his silliness.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game is… well, okay. It is a reasonable 2D platformer, but frankly, it is quite easy for almost its entire length. The game, unlike most such games, grants the player an inventory menu containing 12 items, each of which the player can carry 9 of – and this includes vast numbers of healing items, as well as items which block projectiles, damage enemies passively, and greatly increase Shantae’s attacks. You accumulate them over the game, you don’t really need to use them too frequently (especially once you get used to the way the game plays), and by the later portions of the game you will have acquired vast numbers of them, to the point where nothing can realistically challenge you. There is an in-game shop as well, selling items in exchange for gems dropped by pots you break and enemies you kill, allowing you to further top-up on stuff, as well as buy upgrades for your attacks which allow you to deal more damage.\n\nThe net result of this is by about halfway through the game you run out of upgrades to buy and pretty much end up with gigantic piles of items in your inventory which you don’t even need to use. I started using some in the second-to-last dungeon just because I had so many, but I still had enough gems to be capped out by the end. I did use the damage-enhancement items on the bosses because there is absolutely no reason not to, and it makes getting the various no-damage achievements that much easier.\n\nHonestly, the achievements are the most challenging part of the game; beating it is almost trivial, and beating some of the bosses without taking damage is quite simple, while for others, it is moderately more difficult. This sort of thing – along with a few other random optional achievements – are likely to contribute almost all of the difficulty the game holds. It is only in the final two dungeons that the game really starts trying to challenge the player, and while the final dungeon does contain some pretty challenging portions (and a sharp difficulty spike), the final two bosses are strangely easy, with only the optional form of the final boss posing any real challenge to the player.\n\nThat said, the game isn’t that short. While it seemed short while playing it – and the ample save points made it easy to get out of – the in-game timer said it took me a little under 9 hours to 100% the game. I’d guess it probably took about 10.5-11 hours including the time spent getting the side achievements. That said, if you’re looking for a really substantial experience, this probably isn’t it – a lot of the time in-game was spent doing relatively unchallenging things, and there was some backtracking involved in gathering various collectibles. In terms of fresh content, you’re likely looking at 6 hours or so of gameplay, maybe a bit more.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent but not amazing game. I recently played Strider, and that game felt a lot more satisfying to me than this did. Not to say that Shantae was bad, but it just wasn’t exceptional; it is a decent filler game, but if you’re looking for a high-end platformer, you’re better off looking elsewhere. This is middle of the road; it probably won’t be disappointing, but it won’t impress you particularly either.\n","March 22","false","12.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Pirate's Curse maintains those aspects, even improves on them, while having vastly better gameplay than the others.\nItems that can be found take the place of animal forms. These can be used quickly in the middle of platforming and are probably the biggest gameplay improvement. The theme of Shantae's magic powers takes a hit from the lack of animal forms, but it is a direct continuation from the story of RR so it's appropriate.\n\nWhen you beat the game, you unlock Pirate Mode, a mode where you get all the items from the beginning.

It's longer, more balanced, faster-paced, and in general just more fun to play. Though I'd also say it's still far from a perfect game.\n\nA few things to note right off the bat; while this does have a metroidvania-style powerup system and shop and all that, the game map is divided up strictly into levels, each level being decently sized, but yeah there's no interconnected map here. The game does have an actual map system though, something that was sorely missing from Risky's Revenge. And as well you'll easily know when you've collected everything in an area since it shows on the world map.\n\nThe main game mechanics, Risky's various items, are much more fun than the dancing of the rest of the series. No more slowing to a crawl to perform a dance that's mostly only useful in a few select areas, this time you can pull any of your tools out at a whim and practically every one of them has uses both in platforming and in combat.\n\nThe pistol is, well, a pistol. You're gonna be using it for ranged attacks a lot, and though it's fairly weak compared to other weapons it's still plenty useful. The hat is mainly used for platforming purposes to glide through the air, but it's pretty solid. I do think it should pull out faster, there were a lot of points where I felt it was a struggle to use because of how slow it is to pull out (especially in one spot in the last dungeon that's waaay harder than it should be). The scimitar lets you bounce on enemies as well as break floor tiles below you, though you have almost no horizontal movement when using it, which would've been nice and allowed for some clever puzzles, but oh well. The boots are possibly the most fun item, letting you charge rampantly through everything, zoom zoom plowing through enemies, it's so much fun. Wish it was mapped to a button rather than to a context-sensitive timer, but it'd probably be horribly broken otherwise, I suppose. And the cannon gives you three extra jumps AND another aerial attack, allowing for safer fighting and pretty much breaking all the jumping puzzles in the game.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the mode you unlock after clearing the game for the first time that allows you to play through the game with all the tools from the start, speeding up the game quite a bit and allowing for some -fun- strategies against earlier bosses.\n\nThe bosses, then, let's talk about them. They're... a mixed bag. I like some of them, while some others are a bit... bad. The boss of the fifth island, for one, misleads you into thinking you should be fighting it with the gun since that's the most convenient weapon to use, but that is definitely NOT the weapon you actually want to use, you want to hair-whip it to pull it down to the ground, and... eh... I really don't like that boss because of the bad first impression it left on me. The boss on the sixth island is relatively easy, sure, but annoying since it's literally RNG and little else. I'm not really a fan of the movement RNG in these bosses in general, the third island boss, fourth island boss, and first phase of the final boss have it the worst in this regard, though maybe it's because I had to spend time grinding to no-damage kill these bosses, but it's a minor gripe. Overall the bosses are more good than bad though, in the end.\n\nThe enemies and combat in general are also pretty solid, there's a few that annoy, a few too tanky, a few too powerful, and the first area of the fifth island is just a huge pain because of rampant enemy spam, but in general it's balanced well with the platforming. There's a fair number of enemies back from Risky's Revenge, but plenty of new ones thrown into the mix as well. The platforming is also generally pretty interesting and creative, as are the few puzzles scattered throughout the maps. The exploration elements are there, too, even with the map designs, though some parts play out almost like an adventure game, trying to figure out where to go next or finding a specific item you need to progress the story, but poking around older areas with new tools tends to produce results most of the time. It's a very solid, enjoyable experience on the whole.\n\nThe game also looks great, the spritework and animations are lovely, the level graphics and background graphics are all nice, the character portraits look great. The game also sounds great, there's some reused music from Risky's Revenge but a lot of the original tracks are just generally nice and never really wear out, plus it helps that there's quite a ton of music in the game in general, 2-3 map tracks per island, multiple cutscene themes, a few boss themes, really no shortage of good tunes.\n\nIt's really hard to fault this game much, I had a few gripes with it but nothing that adds up to a major problem, and most importantly, it's fun. That's all I really need a game to be, in the end.","February 8","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not bad at all. A somewhat simple metroidvania platformer, not too easy not too hard. It was odd not knowing any of the characters, kind of like skipping a book in a series, but easy enough to learn and fairly understand everyone. Charming characters, humurous dialogue, fantastic sprite art and great soundtrack by Virt (Shovel Knight Composer!).\n\nMy only issues were: it felt a bit short, especially since a decent portion of the game is running back and forth. And the difficulty for the last boss ramps much farther than I felt it should. Only reason I managed to clear it was I happened to have enough healing items stockpiled.","March 7","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With Pirate's Curse, WayForward seems to have drawn what made people fall in love with the idea of these games and jettison the clunkier parts for a streamlined and breezy experience that serves as a tidy little cap to the series. The basic gameplay retains the Zelda II/Castlevania formula of side-scrolling exploration and power-up collecting, while ditching the more tedious map traversal of the first two games in favor of a simple level select hub. For plot reasons, the transformation dances are replaced with pirate relics that handily map to your controller's various buttons. While the core platforming and boss battles are still tempered by a near endless well of health items, there's enough meat to the level design and platforming to keep it from feeling like you're blasting through the game with little resistance. And the impressive sprite work, soundtrack, and, ehem, signature sense of humor that have come to characterize the series are all intact. While I wouldn't say WayForward necessarily knocked this one out of the park, Shantae and the Pirate's curse is a respectable RBI.","March 5","true","8.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Although I am most familiar with the version on the 3DS E-Shop, so I was kinda scared about playing this game again, and playing with a 360 controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/recommended/345820/","coaldust-numbers","Coaldust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/","235 products in account","I find it difficult to rate this game.  Eventually I decided on a positive rating since I am glad I played it.  Besides, I know how this works.  If you disagree with the majority, your review will be downvoted into oblivion and never be seen, even if you have good reasons for your negative rating.\n\nWhile I have nothing but praise for Shantae: Risky's Revenge, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a mostly good game, marred by occasional bad level design and severe balance problems.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse has fun abilities, great artwork and music, good humor, and sex appeal, just like the previous games in the series.  It is longer than Shantae: Risky's Revenge.\n\nThe only technical complaint I have is that it would have been nice to have the window scalable in windowed mode.  The developers have my thanks for adding key remapping.\n\nAs for general complaints about the level design and difficulty, there are many cheap hits.  Zombies often spring from the earth directly under you.  Ghosts often materialize on top of you.  These are an almost constant problem on Spiderweb Island.  The problem with Ghosts also happens on various other levels that include them.  When Scuttle Town becomes corrupted by dark magic, the Pumpkin Fields becomes black, except for the sky, making it almost impossible to see enemies or their projectiles, since they blend in perfectly with background elements like foliage.\n\nThere are several unique, and bad (uniquely bad), level designs.\n\nOn Spiderweb Island there is an area where you have to carry another character.  This prevents you from attacking or ducking, and causes you to die in one hit.  Some timing in this area is unreasonably tight.  The worst offender is the room where you are in tunnels with too little headroom to jump until you reach an area near the end with a platform overhead, and a kissing robot at the other end that is running toward you.  There is only a few pixels of space between you and the robot when you successfully make the jump, which will likely take many, many attempts.  This area is agonizingly long, like most of the problem levels.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, not a racing game.\n\nOn Tan Line Island there is an area where you have to stealthily escape a palace.  This prevents you from attacking or using any special abilities, and causes you to restart the entire area if you are spotted once.  You are expected to make use of new mechanics, like blending into the shadows, without any explanation, and given the severity of the punishment for any mistake, experimentation is extremely unpleasant.  This area is agonizingly long, again, like most of the problem levels.  While I like stealth games (a lot, I am very fond of Thief, Dishonored, and Mark of the Ninja), this is like playing a bad stealth game.  The player has almost no means avoiding enemies other than moving out of their sight.  No distractions, no clever movement options, no disguises…  Making a mistake sets you back far too much.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, not a stealth game.\n\nBy far the worst area in the game is the Pirate Master's Palace.  The area is lifeless except for a few Bats and Save Guy.  It is mostly full of instant-kill spikes.  Like the other bad areas, it looks like it was lifted from other games.  In this case, VVVVVV and Flappy Bird[en.wikipedia.org].  Like other bad areas, it is agonizingly long.  I died around 30 times in the first room before finding a way to bypass the first 3 rooms on Youtube.  After that, I was able to complete this area, but the process left me so infuriated and exhausted that I am unlikely to ever play through the game again.  This area officially “ruined the game for me”.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, not Super Meat Boy or Flappy Bird.\n\nThe final boss is almost as badly balanced as the level he lives in.  Until I encountered him, I had avoided sacrificing any Heart Squid children to make Heart Holders.  I wanted to finish the game that way.  Unfortunately, each hit he lands is enough to instantly kill Shantae without any Heart Holder upgrades, and attacks like his bouncing cannon balls and flying pistols seem to be impossible to avoid even with a Bubble Shield.  9 Auto-Potions was not enough to see me through the battle.  Despite being squeamish about it, and it costing me the achievement, I melted all the Heart Squid children I found into Heart Holders so I could finish the game and write this review.\n\nWayForward, if you are reading this, and I hope you are, please keep releasing more of this series, but make future releases fun, not frustrating.","September 9, 2015","true","18.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Even the maps seem to be more thoughfully designed this time around.\n\nThe soundtrack - composed by Jake Kaufman - is also ridiculously good.\n\nThis is by far the best game in the Shantae series.

The pixel boobs are animated.\n\nShantae teams up with Risky Boots to save the world, which consists of seven different islands, each with it's own theme(desert, jungle, death etc.) As you progress from one island to the next, you grab new items and new abilities, which allow you to revisit older islands, to grab additional extras, or items needed to progress further in the story. The variety of items may not be as big as in other genre titles, but it's still enough to not make the gameplay feel stale at any time.\n\nThe only complaint so far, (and this is a really minor one) is that the generic text boxes don't really fit the game. They look like a flashgame element in a sprite game. Something with a little bit more structure and/or colour would've been much more fitting.\n\nAnd as expected, it's also more on the easy side. The dmg you get from enemies, is in most cases pretty negligible, and plenty of health items are doing the rest, to not make the game feel really difficult. It plays like a Metroidvania-light, but the health reserve/low dmg keep it from feeling like one in this regard.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with the purchase. It's a great and charming game, that only falls short in expectations set by other entries in the genre, but offers enough to stand out on it's own.","September 17, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish we'd seen the return of the belly-dancing transformations, but given this is a direct sequel to Risky's Revenge, I can see why they opted to leave the half-genie stuff out, seeing as she lost all her powers in Risky's Revenge.\n\nGraphics: 4.5 - The colors are vibrant and the backgrounds vary from island to island.  Still, it's a bit dated, but for this type of game, it's not a bad thing at all.  This game is set to stand the test of time as it just looks good and easy on the eyes.  Be prepared for MORE BUTT WIGGLES!\n\nSound: 4.5 - the voice-over work was interesting, but I wish they'd run with it a bit more.  It would have been a bit more engrossing having at least the dialogs between main characters/villains with voice-overs.  Still, Shantae's voice is cute and lovable.  The music does the job well setting up the scenarios and scenes everywhere.\n\nControls: 5 - I'm using a 360 controller that's working flawlessly while I play.  The occasional ducking is a problem, but that's the CONTROLLER, not the game itself.  I fault Microsoft for that one because the d-pad, while great, is sometimes too sensitive and I find myself ducking and crawling when I meant to run forward.\n\nReplay: 4.5 - Even if this game is short, I still find myself always going back to platformers and playing them again.  This is why Super Mario Bros. series has always stood the test of time.  I always find myself going back and playing those games and I'm sure to find myself coming back to Shantae and playing it over again.  Still, I wish there were a few extra things to do during a 2nd playthrough.  Even Risky's Revenge: Director's Cut had the alternate costume playthrough, but still, I will most likely find myself coming back to play this again even after I've completed it 100%.\n\nFor followers of Shantae, definitely worth it.  Those new to the series may find it a little lacking, but the gameplay is solid and flawless in controls.  Anyone looking for a quick platforming fix will find plenty to like in this and the earlier entries of the series.  Steam and the world needs more platformers as solid as Shantae is and hope that there's future entries in this series.","December 1, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The style is great, with cute female characters here and there and sprites looking very good. The gameplay's very addicting and well balanced. You explore the levels, find equipment that gives Shantae new abilities, fight really cool bosses and run through neatly designed platforming sections. The difficulty curve actually lets you learn how to use acquired abilities properly and brings the tough challenges when you're actually ready (not that it'll make you clear the from the first try but all of the sections seem fair and your fail is only yours). All that, plus fun characters and dialogues, spectacular music and some neat easter eggs make this game the best in the series and a great find for all of the platformer enthusiasts out there.

Jake Caufman, you are amazing!\n+ Shantae's voice is great and delightful for ears\n\n"Wait, i supposed to play a game, where everyone is half naked (including the arci-nemesis)? play as a hero, which is a belly dancer (and also a half-genie), who attacks enemies with own hair? play in a friendly shiny world? shoot enemies and dash through whole army with a blade? Eat food to regain health and not even grow fat?"\n\n+ "Yes, please"\n\n? Sometimes you might be confused where you need to go, but... it is Metroidvania game, so you may be smart enough to complete the game without using any guides. Otherwises... well, you know  what to do\n? Pixel-art Retro game. I think i said enough.\n? Dropping-Items-System will suprise you. For Example, skeletons drop milk. Shantae drink it. She is angry now... HELLO, METROIDVANIA!\n\n- Usually game is easy, but sometimes (and unexpectedly) it is hard as hell.\nMud Bog island is trully a nightmare, complete with sad music.

In this installment, Shantae teams up with longtime series antagonist Risky Boots on a quest to tame an ancient curse that threatens all of Sequin Land. Bereft of her genie magic, Shantae must instead make use of powerful pirate items: Risky’s pistol, hat, boots, scimitar and cannon, to traverse the world. The overworld and warp points of the earlier games are replaced with a free-roaming stage select, where Risky’s ship takes you to each of the levels, and she can be talked to at almost any time to leave your current island and travel elsewhere, up to the very end of the game. Easily twice the length of Risky’s Revenge, Pirate’s Curse retains most of the advances made in that game and also brings back a number of elements not seen since the original GBC game, most notably, the bathhouse in Scuttle Town that lets your recover health for free. Also, reloading a save will refill Shantae’s health. Pike balls are once again consumables as in the original, and the storm puffs and fireballs are gone, but Risky’s Pistol provides unlimited ranged attacks and can be upgraded, like Shantae’s hair, for more damage. Shantae can use the hat to glide, the scimitar to pogo-jump enemies a la Shovel Knight, the boots to do a Super Metroid-style boost run, and the cannon to do up to three additional jumps, altogether making Shantae her most maneuverable self yet. The same great sprites seen in Risky’s Revenge are augmented with new character art, new music, and a variety of new environments and enemies that revisit those seen in Shantae 1. Other new editions include consumable items that boost Shantae’s attack damage, food items that drop off enemies and restore various amounts of health, and “pirate flares” that allow you to return to Risky at any time, so long as you are outdoors. Overall, Pirate’s Curse is considerably more challenging then Risky’s Revenge but not to the point of frustration- falling into a death pit or touching the spikes merely removes a single hit point and returns you to the entrance of the current room, and you can have a total of forty, and carry enough health items to render an actual game over a near-impossibility- thanks to the addition of auto-potions that trigger automatically upon losing all your health.

If Risky's Revenge turned you off from Shantae with it's confusing world design that had you jumping between the foreground and the background to navigate the world, you'll be pleased to know that's gone for a more traditional, and much easier to navigate, single plane.  However, if you liked it, you might be disappointed at the simplification.\n\nShantae doesn't have her trademark transformations here, but they more than make up for them with some really fun gadgets that, among other things, let her rocket jump through the air, charge through obstacles, and shoot at faraway switches.\n\n+Pros\n+ Cute art!\n+ Catchy background music!\n+ Fun platforming!\n+ Gadgets mix the gameplay up!\n\n-Cons\n- ...*cricket sounds*","December 23, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tight controls, enjoyable mechanics, great looking pixel art style and amazing soundtrack (that you can get it for free or by donating at least a dollar on Jake Kaufman's website, which I would recommend the latter because his work is great and he deserves it.)\n\nThe story is full of funny and witty dialogues with really enjoyable characters. I would recommend before playing this game to play the other 2 prequels or at least Shantae: Risky's Revenge (which is also on Steam) because this game follows directly after the story of Risky's Revenge and it has many references to the previous games. While I did prefer Pirate's Curse over Risky's Revenge, I still would highly recommend playing both as they are great. Pirate's Curse defiinitely improved many things from the previous games and it's why I consider it my favorite out of the 3 games.\n\nIf you like 2D metroidvania games with a witty and enjoyable story, I'd absolutely recommend you to play this.","January 4","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are wanting for Metroidvania style games, look no further. I played a lot of those when I was a little SNES tyke. At first, the game starts out rather easy and boring. But as you go further, the story and characters really unfurl their wings as the gameplay gets more difficult, challenging, and it starts to show just how much love and care was put into this game. The lo-fi graphics look amazing and are smooth as butter. The characters are all easily identifiable and rememberable. They're also all usually adorable and likeable, too, Shantae especially. She's always bouncing around with a big smile on her face, but she lets out a believable warcry that makes me love whipping dudes with her hair, when I first thought I'd hate it because it'd get repetitive. Nope, love doing it, all the time. Love jumping too... Because she's just so... Bouncy... Sorry, lost my train of thought there... Yeah, she's hot, sue me. Doesn't help that she bounces along to the song in Scuttle Town. Did I mention the soundtrack is great too? Anyway, just buy the game, already. It's an amazing platformer. It's just frickin' beautiful.","November 30, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game made in 2014, it does an excellent job of capturing that classic old platformer feel and gameplay. But the appeal of this game doesn't end with the nostalgia factor. There's some really good humor in this game which makes for a really enjoyable play experience and the puzzles can get a bit tricky; not so much that they become a nuisance, but just enough to make you clever when you figure them out.\n\nThe characters were great and had a surprising amount of depth for a game that shows so much cleavage (pun not intended). There's a lot of character development in this game and, especially by the end, I found myself caring more then I would have expected about what happened to them and their relationships with one another. For me, this was one of the game's most endearing qualities.\n\nOn the negative side, this game does have it's imperfections, too. I mentioned earlier how this was a very loyal SNES-era style platformer and it is, in both the good ways and the bad. Playing Shantae and the Pirate's Curse reminded me why I would sometimes get so frustrated as a kid that I'd throw my controller at the wall. Things like timed jumps and frustratingly narrow gaps between spike filled walls, when not used properly, can easily become a nuisance which detracts from the enjoyability of a game. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse unfortunately succumbs to this pitfall. Long sequences that relied upon me timing numerous jumps perfectly - under threat of being sent back to the beginning over and over and over until I got it right- were aggrivating and the game would've been much better if they had been made so that you only took damage when you made a mistake, instead of being sent back to the beginning. The final journey to the big-boss was the most notorious culprit here, but there were other areas that suffered from the same problem. Forcing a player to replay long sequences over and over and over is annoyingly repetative and makes for a poor impression of the game as a whole.\n\nAlso, while I was able to get my Logitech Precision gamepad to work with this game, it required me to do some serious tweaking with some 3rd party software to get it to work and I was a little disappointed that Shantae and the Pirates Curse didn't include native support for it. "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse" is the kind of game that is really meant to be played with a controller (I briefly tried to play it via keyboard and I found it really awkward and hard on the fingers), so it's a shame there wasn't more effort put in to insuring that the game was more compatible with controllers.\n\nBut I won't let these minor frustrations ruin what was overall a really fun game! This game was well worth the money I paid for it and I will be eagerly awaiting it's sequel!","December 28, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will all be familiar to you, However if this is your first Shantae game, I would put a word of warning on the pixel graphics on a monitor as oppose to the usual 3ds or wii U screen. I found during my play through that while I still love this game, There was a noticeable amount of screen tearing going on. Not exactly jarring but definitely noticeable.\n\nHow does it run? Well considering that it pretty much is just a straight port to PC, It runs pretty well. No experiences with crashes or Bugs during my play through. And pretty smooth as well.\n\nA major up vote from me again as usual is the soundtrack. A lot of us were worried that they would recycle some of the old tracks like they have done with the visuals But I was amazed and taken back by the Games OST. Its a real treat and I would definitely recommend getting it if you can. Big praises to way forward again here.\n\nI wont go into the story as its hard to tell it without spoiling it. Lets just say.... You are a Belly Dancing Half Genie that's the hero of scuttle town.... And Pirate stuff. Everyone loves pirate stuff.\n\nI would say if your a big fan of Shantae, Its a definite must have where as if you are curious about Shantae and the series in general, check it out and see what you have been missing. Half Genie hero is in the making and you may want to see why it was hugely successful in its kickstarter Campaign.","May 24, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The style is great, with cute female characters here and there and sprites looking very good. The gameplay's very addicting and well balanced. You explore the levels, find equipment that gives Shantae new abilities, fight really cool bosses and run through neatly designed platforming sections. The difficulty curve actually lets you learn how to use acquired abilities properly and brings the tough challenges when you're actually ready (not that it'll make you clear the from the first try but all of the sections seem fair and your fail is only yours). All that, plus fun characters and dialogues, spectacular music and some neat easter eggs make this game the best in the series and a great find for all of the platformer enthusiasts out there.

In this installment, Shantae teams up with longtime series antagonist Risky Boots on a quest to tame an ancient curse that threatens all of Sequin Land. Bereft of her genie magic, Shantae must instead make use of powerful pirate items: Risky’s pistol, hat, boots, scimitar and cannon, to traverse the world. The overworld and warp points of the earlier games are replaced with a free-roaming stage select, where Risky’s ship takes you to each of the levels, and she can be talked to at almost any time to leave your current island and travel elsewhere, up to the very end of the game. Easily twice the length of Risky’s Revenge, Pirate’s Curse retains most of the advances made in that game and also brings back a number of elements not seen since the original GBC game, most notably, the bathhouse in Scuttle Town that lets your recover health for free. Also, reloading a save will refill Shantae’s health. Pike balls are once again consumables as in the original, and the storm puffs and fireballs are gone, but Risky’s Pistol provides unlimited ranged attacks and can be upgraded, like Shantae’s hair, for more damage. Shantae can use the hat to glide, the scimitar to pogo-jump enemies a la Shovel Knight, the boots to do a Super Metroid-style boost run, and the cannon to do up to three additional jumps, altogether making Shantae her most maneuverable self yet. The same great sprites seen in Risky’s Revenge are augmented with new character art, new music, and a variety of new environments and enemies that revisit those seen in Shantae 1. Other new editions include consumable items that boost Shantae’s attack damage, food items that drop off enemies and restore various amounts of health, and “pirate flares” that allow you to return to Risky at any time, so long as you are outdoors. Overall, Pirate’s Curse is considerably more challenging then Risky’s Revenge but not to the point of frustration- falling into a death pit or touching the spikes merely removes a single hit point and returns you to the entrance of the current room, and you can have a total of forty, and carry enough health items to render an actual game over a near-impossibility- thanks to the addition of auto-potions that trigger automatically upon losing all your health. It is not however, anywhere near as cheap as the first game, and for that I am thankful. If you liked the previous Shantae titles, Metrodivanias or platformers of any kind, Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse is a treat for your eyes, ears and fingers that should not be missed.","November 11, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game made in 2014, it does an excellent job of capturing that classic old platformer feel and gameplay. But the appeal of this game doesn't end with the nostalgia factor. There's some really good humor in this game which makes for a really enjoyable play experience and the puzzles can get a bit tricky; not so much that they become a nuisance, but just enough to make you clever when you figure them out.\n\nThe characters were great and had a surprising amount of depth for a game that shows so much cleavage (pun not intended). There's a lot of character development in this game and, especially by the end, I found myself caring more then I would have expected about what happened to them and their relationships with one another. For me, this was one of the game's most endearing qualities.\n\nOn the negative side, this game does have it's imperfections, too. I mentioned earlier how this was a very loyal SNES-era style platformer and it is, in both the good ways and the bad. Playing Shantae and the Pirate's Curse reminded me why I would sometimes get so frustrated as a kid that I'd throw my controller at the wall. Things like timed jumps and frustratingly narrow gaps between spike filled walls, when not used properly, can easily become a nuisance which detracts from the enjoyability of a game. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse unfortunately succumbs to this pitfall. Long sequences that relied upon me timing numerous jumps perfectly - under threat of being sent back to the beginning over and over and over until I got it right- were aggrivating and the game would've been much better if they had been made so that you only took damage when you made a mistake, instead of being sent back to the beginning. The final journey to the big-boss was the most notorious culprit here, but there were other areas that suffered from the same problem. Forcing a player to replay long sequences over and over and over is annoyingly repetative and makes for a poor impression of the game as a whole.\n\nAlso, while I was able to get my Logitech Precision gamepad to work with this game, it required me to do some serious tweaking with some 3rd party software to get it to work and I was a little disappointed that Shantae and the Pirates Curse didn't include native support for it. "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse" is the kind of game that is really meant to be played with a controller (I briefly tried to play it via keyboard and I found it really awkward and hard on the fingers), so it's a shame there wasn't more effort put in to insuring that the game was more compatible with controllers.\n\nBut I won't let these minor frustrations ruin what was overall a really fun game! This game was well worth the money I paid for it and I will be eagerly awaiting it's sequel!","December 28, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having never played a Shantae and hearing it was a metroidvania style game, I was dissapointed when it turned out to be a mostly linear 2d zelda affair. The backtracking, unlike in regular metroidvania which makes exploring the world and unlocking new paths exciting and lore-richening, seemed like a tedious chore in this game. Almost like filler that they had to do in order for the game to be just a bit longer. The good thing is that the fast travel things you can buy in the one shop (yeah unfortunately there's only one shop in the very paltry main city) in this game are cheap.\n\nNow some positives. The game plays and looks well, for the most part. The animations, music, and overall style of the game are on point. Usually I find that when a game panders towards an audience it is bad. At a cursory glance one look at Shantae almost looks like its pandering toward that harem big boobied fetish, and there's no denying that it is. Since the game is so tongue and cheek about the whole thing, and Shantae's dialogue is genuinely that of a cute character, I am down with it. It's not one of those visual novels that wants you to fap every second, the big boobs are there to be enjoyed in the background and in this case work as a fine character trait.\n\nThe dungeons, although entirely linear, had great platforming. Some rooms have you dying over and over to reach the goal, which I found quite challenging and awesome. The game starts out pretty easy, but about halfway through there is a major difficulty spike. Each and every boss in the game was excellently animated and a thrill to fight. All of the upgrades of the game got better and better, and by the end I truly felt like an OP character. This is how upgrades should be done, with each upgrade being a standalone good weapon, but also synergizing with the previous upgrades aquired.\n\nAnd since this review, although I liked the game, pointed out some flaws let me just point out one small thing that annoyed me to heck. It doesn't affect the gameplay, it doesn't affect the enjoyment, it's just that when the score and the graphics and the gameplay and everything else has such high production value why does the pause menu look so crappy? Like they used they paintbucket tool on the regular blue setting and called it a day. I know pause menu's aren't the most exciting part of a game, but it always looked out of place.\n\nWell anyway, despite the shortcomings and filler the game was cool. I'll pick up the next Shantae game if it's cheap and if it ever comes out. (At the time of this review the game has been in kickstarter hell for quite a bit of time.)","February 10","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am sad because I have finished it, and I weep for there are no more worlds to conquer.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse is a rock-solid middling-to-hard Metroidvania platformer. A Metroidvania (or IGAvania, or exploration platformer) is an open world game that provides you with a huge environment to explore. As you travel through this world you gain strength, power, and -- most importantly -- special abilities that let you overcome obstacles you couldn't before.\n\nThe game opens with Scuttle Town being sold off by its childish mayor to the Ammo Baron, who plans to turn it into a military base. Shantae, the town's Guardian Genie, manages to defeat him, only to be arrested for attacking the town's lawful owner. While extricating herself from the situation, Shantae runs into one of her old enemies, a Tinkerbat, who's been possessed by dark magic. Shantae's nemesis, Risky Boots, warns her that the dark magic heralds the potential return of the Pirate Master -- the near-godlike entity responsible for the disappearance of most of geniekind. Shantae and Risky are forced to put aside their enmity to team up against the greater evil.\n\nThat's the storyline. The game itself is largely linear; Shantae and Risky arrive on a new island, encounter a series of comic mishaps, and in the course of exploration Shantae discovers the entrance to a "Den of Evil" (dungeon). Each dungeon contains enemies, puzzles, a boss fight, and one piece of Risky's missing pirate equipment -- these last items grant Shantae increased mobility, giving her a downstab, multi-jump, etc. Defeating each boss also unlocks the next island.\n\nIn true Metroidvania fashion, it's completely impossible to obtain everything just heading straight through the game. There are tons of hidden items and secret exits that can't be reached unless you come back to earlier areas with equipment from later ones; some of it is skippable, some of it isn't.\n\nThe first Shantae game was a decent length, with five dungeons and a large overworld, but the second game was pathetically short, with only two actual dungeons and a very short completion time, and since the second one has a PC release and the first doesn't, people assume it's characteristic.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse again has five full dungeons, as well as a few overworld areas that are large and convoluted enough to serve as dungeons themselves. In addition to the usual heart containers, Shantae can collect "Dark Magic" from specific, well-hidden enemies; the vast majority are hidden in fair, guessable locations. (ROT-13 Spoiler: Fbzr Pnpxyrongf nccrne jura lbh penfu vagb fcrpvsvp jnyyf.)\n\nCombat works well; Shantae has a lot of options, especially in the late game, and I rarely found myself blaming the controls. Aside from one boss (and anyone who's played knows exactly which one) fights are mostly about knowing what's coming and developing tactics to beat it, not raw dexterity or luck.\n\nThe platforming starts easy but takes the kid gloves off somewhere around the fourth island. While the later levels are full of one-hit-kill traps, you can nearly always see them coming -- and, in an innovation I'd like to see more of, one-hit-kills and falling off the screen don't mean game over. You just take damage and respawn at the start of the room, Zelda style. I haven't seen this in platform games before.\n\nOne pet peeve I have in platform games that let you explore in every direction is how it's often hard to tell whether falling off the screen means dying or just going to a new area. In Shantae, pits that will kill you are always marked with skull-and-crossbones symbols. No guesswork. I like it.\n\nI refrained from using a guide until the last "clean up" sweep for missing hearts and magic, and got easily about 12 hours of gameplay. Since some of this time was spent searching and/or being stumped by puzzles, using a guide all the way through would probably cut this to 7-8 hours, respectable for a Metroidvania.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* Longest entry in the series\n* Well-designed dungeons\n* Characters are engaging\n* Jokes are actually funny\n* Good difficulty curve, decently challenging by the end\n* Configurable keyboard and gamepad controls\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Iffy replayability\n* One deeply unfair boss fight\n* No clues about certain collectibles\n* Graphics a little pixelated for a modern game\n\n(And yes, I know what the other thing people associate Shantae games with is. I enjoy it -- I'm human -- but I don't think it either improves or detracts from the quality of the game. Unless you've got some kind of hangup about women in bathing suits, almost all of this game is fine for kids -- the running gag in "Run Run Rottytops!" is a little over the line, but it'll probably just go right over most kids' heads.)","April 16","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
