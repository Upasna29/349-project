You also will have just enough time to react.\nStrategy logic is simple and yet, the key factor is how fast you respond.\nI would recommend this game if you whant to kill some time without noticing.\nGood product for the first day of steam release.\nGood luck!","December 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

It's a very simple game which teaches you the ropes very well.\n\nI would recommend it to people looking for a simple RTS/Strategy game and people who are a great fan of the game RISK. I love these games so much so I had no problem fully enjoying this game.\n\nI would not recommend it to people who are looking for something mindblowingly awesome, Unique or innovative.\n\nI have attached my 20 minute preview as I find it difficult to put my words into text :) hope this helps!

There is music that plays for the opening menu that is of that time in history and culture. I believe that it would have been beneficial to have that music continue during the actual gameplay, as it would have added to the atmosphere and immersion to the game, instead of the silence or marching of troops that is the games only sounds during gameplay. The graphics are simple, but it fits to the gameplay and mechanics that the game promotes. There have been a few crashes in my gameplay, but the progress I lost was minimal, and the devs are active in trying to fix any issues. It is clear from their activity on Steam and personally that they care about this game.\n\nThe game has a fair bit of content for the price they are asking, Each campaign is fast paced, and is centered around strategic, military and money management. You can upgrade tools, farming, and livestock to increase your resources.  You have a max of four armies that you can upgrade, each of which need to be replenished after you engage in battle. It would have been nice to be able to replenish entire armies instead of individual troops as a lot of my time was spent micro-managing each army, as it pulled me out of the enjoyment of the game. It becomes a delicate balance between grabbing up available land in the beginning, then harassing enemies in a give and take scenario to keep them from expanding their territories into yours. You are fighting on different fronts, and you are at the mercy of the slow map movement before you can assess how you have progressed.\n\nThe game is simplistic, but overall it works out fairly well. I felt that it respected my time, and was enjoyable. The slow reaction time did pull me out of immersion a bit, but overall the game was fairly balanced. This is an easy recommend.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","December 13, 2015","true","6.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Repetitous with little to do except to build up your villages and armies as swiftly as possible.\n\nTypically you build a strong defensive line, wait until your economy can quickly replace any battle loses, then rapidly move forward in an offensive.\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\nYou do have different units and village improvements that you can choose from,  But unlike good RTS games where careful selection and planning is necessary, the units and improvements in this game are so vanilla that it makes little difference what you choose.  Just fill up your army and village slots and get moving.\n\nIt all feels more or less like some kind of a weird race or puzzle game.  I guess there may be some satisfaction in winning a particular scenario in record time.  But I found the whole exercise tedious and boring.","December 4, 2015","false","4.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

These villages provide rice income which is used to buy everything within the game, you then must raise an army and compete against opposing empires for domination of the map.\n\nUnlike Civ there is no diplomacy victory that I've encountered, it all about the combat conquest which is fun in itself. (And perhaps leaves room for expansion?)\n\nVerdict:\n\nDefinitely not on the 2016 must buy top ign of the year list, but I enjoyed playing the game and will probably come back to it from time to time until completion as I did enjoy it. If you need a cheap fun compact civilization conquest game this is the game for you and at 5.99 can't really complain to much.\n\n17/30 - Not a Top tier game\n(But it's a great game for what it is and for it's price point it more than delivers.)\nBased on the Following Rating Scheme Rating Scheme:\n(0-10 bad game 11-20 Average Game 21-30 Based Game)","December 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a real time strategy game for those who aren't all the good at real time strategy games. This is a category I find myself firmly sitting in. A decent amount of the first PC games that I played (and were good enough to still remember) were real time strategies and my favourite game for a long time was Age of Mythology. With all that being said however I'm pretty rubbish at them. I'm honestly not sure how many of these games I only beat because I used cheats or how many I must have given up half way through the campaigns because it got difficult. The problem I think is that you need to manage so many different things in real time; troops, resources, upgrades. It can be very easy to forget about this or that.\n\nTenshu General is something of a devolution of the genre in much the same way as DiveKick is of the fighting genre. The amount of things you need to think about is very limited. You have one single base and can have up to four separate armies that all move as one. Resource Management is stripped down to a single resource, rice, and upgrading towns to collect more is a simple process. That isn't however to say that Tenshu General is simple. The troops you buy for each army, which upgrades you buy and when, where you place your ambassador etc etc. There's still a large amount of choice and complexity.\n\nThere are also elements taken from grand strategy, namely the provinces. Each section of land is a separate province, of your army is the only one on it you claim it gaining any resources collected there to you. But not only this you move slower through unclaimed territories and you cannot pass through them meaning that spending the time to capture a province with no rice production may be worth it. Each province also has a different terrain which can impart bonuses or negatives on a particular troop type meaning that army composition is important.\n\nHowever Tenshu General has it's limitations. Whilst there aren't enough small factors to consider such that it overloads you they also perhaps don't have enough effect. The way to win almost any map feels exactly the same; capture as much as early as possible and crush your opponents main army before they are able to build it up then simply take out whatever small forces they can muster until you have control of the whole area and have four fully powered armies with which to storm their castle. It hardly matters about positioning and terrain advantage when you have a fully stocked army and almost every game plays out in the same way. The only real difference for this is if you include more players.\n\nAs I said right at the start Tenshu General fills a niche and it does it very well. It's simple on the surface but has just enough depth to it to allow for more interesting play. It's certainly not for a hardcore RTS fan but for those who maybe missed the bandwagon of the early to mid 2000's RTS it's a small and cheap game that would be a great introduction to the genre.\n","December 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no siege weapons either, so you basically need full max armies attacking at the same time to win the game which can drag the match out for quite a while.","January 26","false","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
