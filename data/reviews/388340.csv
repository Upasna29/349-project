Definitely worth your 50¢!\n\n-Note to author\n\nCongrats on your first game! It's great to see that a simple game like this that actually fun.

It's an addictive little game but by God the amounts of unholy rage brought forth by playing this game will leave you broken and beat. After about 40 minutes of straight playing it i decided to take a little rest, because i was about to walk outside and punch the first person i see even if it was a little old lady in the 80's or a toddler just playing about in the street after about. After an hour i decided to have  another go at this level only to my surprise my progress was not saved then i found out there was no way to save...this drove me insane.

This being said, it does offer up a great degree of difficulty considering I could hardly get passed the third level before I decided it was just to hard for me. However, that's not neccesarily a bad thing, the games difficulty turns what would be a rather short game into a seemingly impossible journey. I loved the little bits of physics based gameplay here and there but I often felt like I spent far to much time trying to get them down, but maybe that's just me. Lastly, the games soundtrack is very amusing and honestly I'd rather just listen to the music then play the game.\n\nOverall good game considering the price but it's more of a turn-your-brain-off kinda game,","December 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","3"

Uncommon visuals with a steady curb of difficulty without being disproportionately hard at times. That's really all I ask for from this game, pretty simple, but the issue I have is that its not really a "game" at all.\n\nI'm thrown into a world without context or meaning. No story to drive me, and no reason why I should leave the 90's 2D paradise that is my room. I would be perfectly content there honestly, but I suppose that would make for an even more lack-luster game. Even a single speech bubble would be nice, or a booming voice telling me to go right would do this game a lot of good. But no dice.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty solid, and even though this "game" doesn't quit bring anything new to the table, its worth the low price tag for some cheap (good) rage, and entertaining visuals. Overall, I recommend this as long as you have the right expectations going into it.","May 26","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh and also the level design, give it some substance, not just a ensemble of randomly covered blocks.\n\nWouldn't Reccomend as it is","August 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

But at the risk of sounding like a jerk, I don't think it's good enough to sell, even at such a low price. Based on the Steam page I had been expecting a very basic platformer, but I was also hoping for a quirky sense of humour, some kind of story, an interesting gimmick or two, or at least some kind of art design to justify the title and to brighten up the blocks we're jumping over. There is some fun here - it's a good start and I look forward to what comes next - but I dont recommend this one. It feels very bare bones, more like a practice assignment than a finished product.\n\nPros-\nAddictive 'rage game' quality. Some fun level design.\n\nCons-\nNot very precise in its control or hitboxes, no story or style, backgrounds are mostly just coloured shapes, music is a collection of MIDI versions of classical tunes, no sound effects at all and very few animations (death for example is just an instant reset).","August 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Nothing wrong with that necissarily, but it does show. Super Hipster Lumberjack is decent. Not atrocious, but altogether not terribly memorable.\n\nThe Good:\n-I like the visual style.\n-Simple gameplay\n\nThe Bad:\n-I can't tell if this is a rage game or if the jump is just poorly done\n-The music loops get really old. Fast.\n-No sound FX. This can work if there's good enough bg music, but as stated before, there isn't really.\n-No checkpoints on points that could really use them (Or maybe it's a rage game)\n\nHonestly, the biggest problem with this game is it isn't all that memorable, and lacks polish. However, if you want to help support and indie developer then go ahead and buy it, I mean, It's only 50 cents.\n\n6/10\n\nEDIT:\nOk, so I read the desc. (Probably should have done that in the first place) And this is supposed to be a homage to difficult games, so I suppose some factors are justified. Still, the jump feels a little cheaty, and the controls could be improved.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMercuryGamer/recommended/388340/","TheMercuryGamer","Mercury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMercuryGamer/","67 products in account","How I Found This Game\n\nWhile selling a few crappy CS:GO skins, I made about 60 cents. As always when I have a few cents, I went to "Games Under $5" and sorted by lowest price. When I saw this game, I didn't expect it to be amazing. It was 50 freaking cents! AND IT WASN'T ON SALE! But the reviews were very positive, so I decided to try it out.\n\nDownloading\n\nIt takes 13 seconds to download on my crappy computer. But it's to be expected since it's so cheap and can't be huge.\n\nOptions\n\nWhen you open the game, you are presented with a window that lets you edit the resolution, graphics quality, which monitor to display to, and your controls. The only thing worth changing is the resolution (which you should do max, it's not like it lags or anything)\n\nTitle Screen\n\nOn the title screen there's 4 things:\na New Game button\na Load Game button\na Quit Game button\na volume slider (and it stays on the screen as you play, which is VERY helpful.)\n\nGameplay\n\nWhen you first enter the game, you'll find out quickly that this a platformer. It has 3D visuals, but it's actually just a 2D platformer. The goal is to get to the end of the level without touching anything that's dark gray. It sounds easy at first, but it gets really challenging (luckily not rage inducing). Objects can launch you, move back and forth, move back and forth between foreground and background, and block your view.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGET THIS GAME! I may not have completed it, but this game is a blast! I recommend it to anybody who likes platformer games. Also, it's literally 50 CENTS! That's as cheap as a good game gets! It may be the cheapest game on Steam, but it's also one of the best puzzle platformer games on Steam (ONE of the best).\n\nSO YES! Overall I recommend the game!","September 22, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game sucks ♥♥♥. Bad physics engine, no controller support, rogue-like elements were poorly designed and not enough character progression. Could also use some dank memeage.

After 30 minutes, I jumped into a white hole and I'm not sure if the game crashed or not. Game felt really empty the whole time I was playing.

Had no idea what it was going in, but was a little concerned when the "Unity for Personal Use" splash screen popped up at the start.\n\nThe first time I moved, I feel through the floor and had to press R to restart the level.\n\nOther issues:\n* I'm usually fairly lenient when it comes to art styles, but I thought this game was just really bland looking. The music was okay, but it's also MIDIs of classical music, so that's to be expected.\n\n* The controls are mostly acceptable, but there were several instances where I would land on a platform, turn around, and jump to the next, and the actual turn felt weirdly stiff, which would throw me off and make me miss the jump. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this runs on a pre-built sample platformer engine.\n\n* Jumping at the corner of a platform is apparently as good as landing on top of it, since you get dragged on top of it anyway.\n\n* There are piston platforms that you're meant to jump off with the right timing so you can be launched higher into the air. I'm not usually good at that sort of thing, but it felt especially difficult to pull off here, not helped by me being launched up with seemingly random force.\n\n* I think there's supposed to be a cutscene at the start that's broken and immediately skips itself.\n\n* The levels feel long given the lack of checkpoints.\n\nIf you want a difficult platformer for cheap that has a "retro" aesthetic, go grab You Have to Win the Game. It's free and the art style actually makes sense. Don't spend 50 cents on this.","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMercuryGamer/recommended/388340/","TheMercuryGamer","Mercury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMercuryGamer/","67 products in account","How I Found This Game\n\nWhile selling a few crappy CS:GO skins, I made about 60 cents. As always when I have a few cents, I went to "Games Under $5" and sorted by lowest price. When I saw this game, I didn't expect it to be amazing. It was 50 freaking cents! AND IT WASN'T ON SALE! But the reviews were very positive, so I decided to try it out.\n\nDownloading\n\nIt takes 13 seconds to download on my crappy computer. But it's to be expected since it's so cheap and can't be huge.\n\nOptions\n\nWhen you open the game, you are presented with a window that lets you edit the resolution, graphics quality, which monitor to display to, and your controls. The only thing worth changing is the resolution (which you should do max, it's not like it lags or anything)\n\nTitle Screen\n\nOn the title screen there's 4 things:\na New Game button\na Load Game button\na Quit Game button\na volume slider (and it stays on the screen as you play, which is VERY helpful.)\n\nGameplay\n\nWhen you first enter the game, you'll find out quickly that this a platformer. It has 3D visuals, but it's actually just a 2D platformer. The goal is to get to the end of the level without touching anything that's dark gray. It sounds easy at first, but it gets really challenging (luckily not rage inducing). Objects can launch you, move back and forth, move back and forth between foreground and background, and block your view.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGET THIS GAME! I may not have completed it, but this game is a blast! I recommend it to anybody who likes platformer games. Also, it's literally 50 CENTS! That's as cheap as a good game gets! It may be the cheapest game on Steam, but it's also one of the best puzzle platformer games on Steam (ONE of the best).\n\nSO YES! Overall I recommend the game!","September 22, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game sucks ♥♥♥. Bad physics engine, no controller support, rogue-like elements were poorly designed and not enough character progression. Could also use some dank memeage. Ended up ripping out my hair on some of those jumps. Dem black boxes trigger PTSD if chu know what I'm saying hehe. After 30 minutes, I jumped into a white hole and I'm not sure if the game crashed or not. Game felt really empty the whole time I was playing. Just kind of like how my Dad played me when he walked out on me and mom haha where are you I miss you Dad. Overall 4/10 was not enough water FeelsBadMan -IGN","December 16, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had no idea what it was going in, but was a little concerned when the "Unity for Personal Use" splash screen popped up at the start.\n\nThe first time I moved, I feel through the floor and had to press R to restart the level.\n\nOther issues:\n* I'm usually fairly lenient when it comes to art styles, but I thought this game was just really bland looking. The music was okay, but it's also MIDIs of classical music, so that's to be expected.\n\n* The controls are mostly acceptable, but there were several instances where I would land on a platform, turn around, and jump to the next, and the actual turn felt weirdly stiff, which would throw me off and make me miss the jump. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this runs on a pre-built sample platformer engine.\n\n* Jumping at the corner of a platform is apparently as good as landing on top of it, since you get dragged on top of it anyway.\n\n* There are piston platforms that you're meant to jump off with the right timing so you can be launched higher into the air. I'm not usually good at that sort of thing, but it felt especially difficult to pull off here, not helped by me being launched up with seemingly random force.\n\n* I think there's supposed to be a cutscene at the start that's broken and immediately skips itself.\n\n* The levels feel long given the lack of checkpoints.\n\nIf you want a difficult platformer for cheap that has a "retro" aesthetic, go grab You Have to Win the Game. It's free and the art style actually makes sense. Don't spend 50 cents on this.","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminati-420/recommended/388340/","illuminati-420","Fiery Unicorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminati-420/","59 products in account","This game IS worth 50 cents. This isn't some quick scheme to take your money. It's a well made and responsive game. While there is no checkpoints there are levels and are managable to play from the start over and over. This game is a ver fun platformer and never had I said while playing that a jump was unfair, just difficult. I enjoyed figuring out how to jump and learning the mechanics. This game is made by someone in high school which if this is a game he made in high school, I am VERY interesting in what he makes next! Overall, Super Hipster Lumberjack is a great game, while it doesn't have original music (8 bit classical music) and some levels you could wish for a checkpoint, it would still be worth a dollar at least.","July 21, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for real its pretty good for someones first attempt at making a game. Cool gameplay mechanics and has decent graphics. Music needs a bit of work. The music in the pumpkin level is by far the worst, most ear-rapey thing ive ever heard. The rest was ok though. It seemed kind of out of place. Collision was also weird during some parts but didnt get in the way too much. I was also impressed when i discovered an easter egg (not telling where) although it was not yet complete and impossible to do anything with. The overall game was not too hard and well worth my 50 cents. :D","May 16","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
