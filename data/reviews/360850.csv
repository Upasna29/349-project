Some of the puzzles provide a good challenge, and each puzzle seems to be procedurally generated which makes it likely that you'll never encounter the same puzzle twice.\n\nI would like to see a reset button on the level that resets the level back to how it was when it was generated.  Currently if you go back to the menu and back into the puzzle, a new puzzle will be generated and the previous puzzle will be lost.\n\nPuzzles are always good for the brain, and for the price you can't beat it.\n\nSince it was just released today and has room for improvement, I'll give it a solid 7/10.","June 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","2"

The video clip shows you the gist of the game play, so I won’t try to explain it. It’s actually not an original concept, but a port of the old UNIX based puzzle “Net”. The difference being Electric Circuit’s interface and nice looking graphical front end. This alone is worth the low price tag. It’s also customizable, so you can play on a small easy level, or challenge yourself with larger grids and wrap around connectivity. As the previous reviewer stated, the puzzles are procedurally generated, so you are virtually guaranteed a new puzzle every time. I also agree that a current puzzle reset option would be nice if you fubar it.","February 8","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
