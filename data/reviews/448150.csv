"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000514622/recommended/448150/","76561198000514622","[Mops] TENTACLE BOSS","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000514622/","620 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is brilliant.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-The price point is extremely accessible\n-There are no microtransactions\n-The gameplay is very simplistic and somewhat laid back in a good way. There is a classic charm to just earning loot and new types of spells, leveling, choosing your stats, and exploring new areas with friends in typical classic rpg fashion with no bull.\n-On that last note, this is an absolute must for co-op, collaborating and discovering the fun with others is half the game in my opinion, and this is entirely possible to do since the game is so accessible and cheap, plus this allows for way more strategies in a fight if you are using different classes.\n-The community is friendly and its entirely possible to just launch the game to have a laid back conversation about anything in the chat.\n-All classes can use all the spells. There are no restrictions, just different leveling bonuses. (I.e mages level faster if they use their spells, fighters level faster if they use their swords)\n-There are hats and cosmetics, you can work up gold in game to buy entirely new sprites, ranging from typical class based costumes to being a giant ice cube. Once again, there are no microtransactions and the grind seems pretty fair with more difficult areas allowing you to earn progressively more gold. Enough to make the idea of getting new cosmetics realistic.\n-The devs are extremelly friendly and dilligent, I had issues with the standalone version of the game and they immediately contacted me in the game itself and resolved the issue almost immediately. Plus they are really fun guys to hang out with. (I.e they don't have a PR stick rammed up their ♥♥♥.)\n\n\nSo long as you like the genre and don't mind the style of combat there is nothing bad to say about this game. The only serious improvement I would personally make is to allow players to hit Ctrl once and have your character auto attack as opposed to having to hold the button throughout a fight. That and it would be nice if gold was shared in parties.\n\nBuy it. If you like the genre, and the idea of a laid back simplistic fun game that doesn't try to rob you with microtransactions, with a great community and co-op focus you have literally no reason not to. It's cheap charming and really deserves recognition and your financial support.","March 6","true","16.6"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revadarius/recommended/448150/","Revadarius","Revadarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revadarius/","617 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs I am to point out: Yes, I'm aware I've put 'no' for recommendations... but this game has promise, not a very strong promise.  But nonetheless it does have promise.  The reason I don't recommend it; Well, the reasons I don't recommend it are because the devs shouldn't be charging (even at it's very low and affordable price) for bog-standard alpha/beta testing.\n\nThe game currently consists of a few dozen maps (or tiles, each to their own) and a somewhat large variety of enemies.  But nothing that stands out like a mini-boss or any type of boss character, with a few areas seemingly being pointless to explore, or to even grind in due to terrible enemy types, or locating.. or the plain fact that they're just giant dead ends of nothingness.  To which no rhyme nor reason are there for them to be there.  I do understand the devs are planning to add to the game.  ...but even as an early access game, a lot of this stuff should be there.\n\nThere's currently 3 characters (Warrior/Wizard/Villager).  And the Warrior seems spot on with it's weapons, stats, damage, health all being good in my eyes.  And the game (for what little there is) works wonders.  However the Wizard is another story.  In it's current state it isn't even usable, with most players rolling melee stats and weapons in order to level it - with hopes it is balanced later on.  The list of problems are endless with the class so I won't go in to detail.  Just to note, what I did in 5hrs with the Wizard I managed to do in 20 minutes with the Warrior - I hope this does indeed clarify, even without details, how awkward this is for the games current standing and it's players.  I have yet to try the Villager class, but as weapons and stats aren't character specific.  Nor are skills... I've really tried and tested all skills and weapons that there is to offer - and the character choice at the beginning is to set you up with a free skill if you choice Wizard, and to pre-set your Sprite (which can be changed later with in-game gold).\n\nI've spent the past 15hrs farming... literally just holding ctrl and moving my direction keys in order to whack the crap out of any and all that may lay in my path.  Collecting gold, and items to sell in order to upgrade my gear... to see the vast lands of the game, and to go every place and kill everything has been my goal.  But there's huge things missing.  Like flavour text, to which there's none or not enough. That lack of NPCs that not only have something to offer (like maybe a quest, God forbid that should ever happen) but even to give passing comments when you go over and interact with them.  Not enough lands, features that are visibly there but in-complete or quarantined off.  It's a bit of a nightmare.\n\nThe game comprises of spawning in, harassing NPCs, grinding and upgrading and working out the grind route before you hit level 25-30 and what is the end-game area of the game currently with a few 'secrets' laid here and there.  The drop rates are so-so which makes the grind real, in terms of hoping for loot.  Experience, however, is a b*tch to grind for by conventional grinding.  Especially when it took the best part of 10hrs to hit level 29... and all I did was hardcore farm with no more than 2 drink breaks.  There's no real need for partying or co-op play unless you've taken the magic route and need to be carried or the higher level guys in the area are starving the farms for experience.  PvP is limited to being within a single level (+/-) of another player.  To which your demise leads to you losing an item from your inventory, and there are no areas or ways to have a consentual duel as of yet.\n\nThe controls are awkward - again, the mage route needing you to use 3 hands (mouse for aiming, ctrl/shift for movement and melee attack.  WASD or direction keys for movement and F1-12 for pre-set abilities).  Sadly there's no way to remap the keybindings, though I have reported this - and many other issues - to devs who say they're openly welcome to ideas and bug reports.  I do enjoy that encouragement, but I do find a lot of issues with the game and the state it's been released in to be, frankly, unforgivable - although I am in an exceptionally nice mood at the moment, as the game - though leaving me unfulfilled - has left me on a high note.  And I'm not making this review to tarnish their name or to deter people from buying the product, generally.  I'm just trying to be honest, and calling the game and the devs out on the subsequent release of a product that still needs a lot of work, and using 'Early Access' as an excuse for it's current state.  I understand expansion, and tweaking - but there's a lot of overhauling, adding and subtracting, etc.  Too much to mention which I personally feel is unacceptable, even at the £0.95 it cost me.\n\nI do really like the idea of a 16bit MMORPG.  I've never known or had the chance to play one.  And the base concept, the idea of taking one of the dime-a-dozen RPGMaker games and making it sociable and adding in, if only minor, elements of an MMO(RPG) is quite simply genius.  I'm very fond of the idea: I like to be sociable.  I like co-op games.  I love RPGs of all varieties.  This to me, on paper, is perfect BUT the game as it currently stands is a bit of a joke.  And I really do hope they devs work their asses off and get it up to a more in-depth, diverse, and fully working level of it's development ASAP.  My final score for this game is 3/10.  I'm giving it's due for the potential it has, it's initial concept and - as it is - it's got a good, solid, start.  But it needs a lot of work - so much so, I feel that even the beginning 25-30 levels of grind need to be reworked for any additional features (like quests, hunts, etc).  Though these are ideas that AREN'T promised, planned or even mentioned by the devs, as far as I'm aware.  They're more of my expectations.  And, with a bit of luck, hopefully they may come to fruition.\n\nFinal note:  I will stick with this game, checking back regularly and waiting upon updates and the like and will re-review at a later stage.  I do hope that the devs will do this game some justice, and I'll finally be able to be fulfilled.  So much so that I can up my score, and finally give it a positive recommendation.\n\n*UPDATE* 30/03/2016\nWell.  I decided I'd wait a few weeks (due to slow updates, taking the staff a week to add a few spells.  Eventually adding a new map which leads to a dead end... nothing amazing).\n\nStrangely, there's been updates on Steam for ISP issues and having to change servers.  I spent 5 minutes trying to get the game to start up, then run.  Waiting was the only remedy.  Eventually, I was able to login. But the problem is that my spare account was the only account that would login.  Unfortunately my melee main, for scouting, exploring, adventuring, killing, etc.  The character I wish to use isn't available, and I wasn't even able to leave the house due to the game's buttons not working.  I teleported to a safe zone, checked every key and still wasn't able to figure out how to open a simple door.  Besides that, the game is apparently dead and I haven't even seen a developer on the game since 3 days before I posted this review originally... is this game finally dead?","March 8","false","23.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","1"

It's fun to play and it reminds me of Hylide and Zelda. Some people were complaining about getting PKd on launch day, but the developers have fixed this error and now you cannot be PKd because you can only attack someone who is 1 level different than yours. The game is very new and clearly still in development, and the developers are eager to take suggestions on how to build on the game from the community and often play right alongside you. There are no microtransactions, you pay once and that's it. I can't describe the game anymore than the store has told you already, you can fish also. The game is clearly geared towards growing with the players and for now the game is very simple but for the price, it's well worth it. Graphics are 16 bit retro style, the sprites can use some more animation in their frames, the battle-system is a breeze, the controls are a little clunky HOWEVER as of writing this the developers are fixing that problem and by the time you may read this it will probably no longer be an issue. There's no plot yet, just sandboxing. That's definitely not a bad thing because there is plenty to explore. The developers will be adding plenty more content as this game has barely broken the soil .","March 7","true","20.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Graphics are VERY dated and VERY simple 2D sprites\n2) It's still rough and doesn't have key customization (for example i would love a key to auto target the nearest mob or player and couldn't find such a key)\n3) Sometimes the attack Function keys you can set don't seem to respond when you hit them and they attack/spell is available you have have plenty of spirit to use it.. requires multiple presses sometimes, sort of annoying\n4) Players can steal your mobs even at level 1 and also steal your loot if they move over your loot drop before you do\n5) Because PvP is allowed, players can murder you once you reach level 10 and this might be a negative for some players.  I haven't reached level 10 yet, so I don't know if there is a penalty or karma system or if the victim of a pk murder drops loot or gold.  ..Will update once I find out.\n\n\nStill, a very solid game for the price and knowing there is no micro-transactions is very comforting.  This game scored an impressive 78% on my scoring system in my livestream video above.  Highly recommended for RPG fans who can accept very simple 2D sprite graphics.   Easily worth it's asking price!","March 7","true","2.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

It seems that this game has a lot of potential and can be really good in the future. The game at the moment has no story, therefore you are just wondering around aimlessly in the overworld killing enemies.\n\nGameplayOkay so let's start off with the gameplay of this game. There really isn't much to it, it's a MMO which (at the time of writing this review) has a small community that comes onto the game regulary. The game starts off by having to register, and then pick between 3 classes: Warrior, Wizard or a Villager. Now to me this isn't a very interesting set of classes, the thought of having a villager as a class doesn't sound very appealing against the Warrior and Wizard class. I personally chose the Wizard, because long ranged attacks that the Warrior shouldn't really have. The game starts you off in a small village, there isn't much there at the moment, one of the guys talks about peopel that might try to scam you for you're account (because you have register to play this game) and the other talks about skill points, how to attack and the what each of the stat points help with the characters progression. The tutorial however doesn't seem to tell you how to equip items onto your character. Although it's pretty simple (just double click) it seems that it should at least be mentioned to help the player along. The game to me brought back a nostalgia feel to Zelda, but I soon found that this game doesn't play at all like Zelda. Attacking enemies is very dull, you stand next to the enemie and hold down ctrl to attack the enemie. You take it in turns to attack (I think) and then either you die or the enemie dies. If you die you lose X amount of exp and then get teleported back to the start. If you kill a enemies you get set amount of exp and the possible chance of the enemies dropping a weapon or gold. This sort of fighting mechanic isn't very fun to play, right from the start it sounds like a grind for exp until you can proceed to the next area. Talking about enemies, there is really not much varation of enemies. There doesn't seem to be any mini-bosses or anything other than enemies that are constantly spawning in certain areas of the map. The game requires A LOT OF GRINDING, I wouldn't suggest choosing the wizard. You don't get a spell until you gather enough money (grinding) by killing more enemies (more grinding) and hoping that the enemie drops X amount of gold (Again more grinding). This game just feels like a grind fest, the enemies are unbalanced when it comes to the levels, and some of the areas are too high leveled to be able to kill them. The controls feel clunky, and you are restricted to only squares to walk on, so no walking in the upper left if you get what I mean. The only good thing about thid game that  can think of is that there isn't any microtransactions... yet. I hope that they don't add any that makes you pay for coins or something like that because that will ruin the game completey.\n\nArt StyleMystica: The Ninth Society, the art style are 16 bit graphics and are kind of fitting for the type of game this is. The tiles seem to fit in with the 16 bit kind of art style. I seem to remember the sprite that they are using in other games... except recoloured. There is minimum frames to each of the characters and enemies, the battling doesn't even have a animation, just a red cross or whatever you are using as a weapon that is across the enemies you are attacking. I would like to see some walking animations from each of the characters, instead of it looking like it's sliding across the floor.\n\nConclusionThe game itself isn't worth buying at this moment in time. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done by the developers before I suggest buying this game for £1.59 at this current state. I really want to like this game, but it just feels too grindy, maybe that's just the Wizard set maybe the Warrior set is much easier. I really hope that the developers pull this game up and make it really good.","March 15","false","6.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"
