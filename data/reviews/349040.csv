"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSourceCodeYT/recommended/349040/","TheSourceCodeYT","Juggernaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSourceCodeYT/","164 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I'm a Naruto fan of the series, and can be considered a fanboy in most cases. However, I do give my most honest feedback on what I liked, and didn't like.\nUPDATE: Ignore everything I said about the optimisation issues, it appears an attempt to fix the audio, the develoeprs somehow fixed the FPS as well! Running it at a steady 30FPS with no problems with my specs that I list below.\n\nI'm going to be straight up honest with you, and say this game is beautiful. I'm a hardcore Naruto and fighting game fan, so of course I'm going to love STORM 4, but instead of making this review telling you how much I love it, I'm going to be naming everything that's not only good about the game, but also bad at the same time.\n\nFirst of all, you should know playing this will spoil the Naruto Anime/Manga if you haven't watched/read either one, as it very well tells you the story from the point Naruto breaks Tobi's mask, to the very end of the series. Does that mean you should play the other STORM's? Or go finish the Anime and Manga? Well, it's all a matter of preference, because really, the game did spoil a LOT, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it! I think I enjoyed it more than actually watching the Anime. So that answers that, but that's just my opinion. *flips riot helmet on*\n\nNext, you should know STORM 4 now focuses on more slideshows. If you played or watched the previous STORM games, you'd know that it was all cinematic 3D cut scenes, while STORM 4 relies more on slideshows from the Anime. In my personal opinion, it was either a lazy move, or something they wanted to do it create a more unique STORM game. However you wish to take it as, that's how it is. Just keep in mind there's still a lot of those cool 3D cinematic's, k?\n\nIf you also haven't heard already, this is their last Naruto game, (Or just their last STORM game, not exactly sure) meaning there won't be anymore. Feel like picking up a Naruto game? This is the best choice hands down. Which yes, also means that this is the best Naruto game ever.\n\nHowever, the game has a lot of negative aspects to it, which some don't annoy me TOO MUCH. For starters, the game is capped at 30FPS, and the support characters from the previous STORM games are not included in here, which to me, is a lazy move. Something else I found distasteful was the fact that the online hasn't changed much. It depends on both yours, and your opponents internet connection, and most annoying of all, still has no rage quitting penalty.\n\nNow then, as for the game play and all the cool new graphics and features, just let me say that the new particles are BEAUTIFUL! JUST LOOK AT THIS.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618088529\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618087780\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618088319\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg, there's even more cooler looking ones. But keep in mind, with more better looking particles, the more it will take on your PC, which don't worry, I'll be covering these optimization issues, as well as away to actually fix it.\n\nOK, here's a list of a whole bunch of features STORM 4 has, that its predecessors doesn't.\nLeader switching; allows you in the middle of a fight, or even a combo to almost instantly switch your leader, allowing you to make a ton of cool new combos.\nArmor destruction, which is one of my personal favorite features, as once your character is damaged at a certain extent, it will have a physical appearance on your clothes.\nAttribute damage! Yes, this means water jutsu's are more effective while you're on water, and fire attacks will keep burning you until you extinguish yourself.\nAn amazingly bigger character roster.\nFlashy new sound effects.\nNo longer the ability to flick into awakened mode, meaning that OP flick awakeners like TenTen are no longer a problem.\nCompletely incredible new particle effects.\nAmazing modding community.\nBeautiful team ultimate jutsu's, which are basically a special ultimate attack that depending on the team you have, unleashes a beautiful attack, just like this!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620428122\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620427885\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620427992\n\n\nHowever, there's still some things that annoy me, no matter how much I love this game.\nSuch as:\n\nWall running being only available in story mode, while it was an actual feature in STORM 1.\nNot being able to play in awakened mode from the start of a battle, which again, was doable in STORM 1.\nMore Anime cut scenes than actual cinematic's.\nNo rage quitting penalty.\nA somewhat toxic community.\n\nSome things that might annoy you (but haven't for me)\nThe game is capped at 30FPS.\nNo support characters from STORM 3 and Revolution (Rip Anko)\nOverpowered Uchiha's\n\nSo, yeah, the game has its pros and cons, but the game, it's just amazing, I just simply love it with passion, I can't get over how much they've improved their game to be honest, I'm just finding it down right addictive. I'm sure that it isn't everyone's cup of tea, don't worry, I'm sure of that. I'm also sure that a lot of people are having a hard decision of buying STORM 4 because of its mixed reviews, but listen to me, they are just complaining about the Day 1 issues. What game that has ever been released, has NOT had its first day issues? None, none at all, it's completely impossible. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that as an excuse, as STORM 4 had probably one of the worst 1st day launch issues ever. However, that's no reason to give up on the game yet, as I've said multiple times, the game is amazing!\n\nBy now you're probably asking... "Butt Juggernut, what about the optimization issues and other bugs?"\n\nOK, calm down, don't worry, I'll be discussing that right now.\n\nSo to start off, the developers are already fixing it, they've stated that they're closely looking at all feedback the Steam forums are giving, and have already started the patch: http://steamcommunity.com/app/349040/discussions/0/405691147599686275/?tscn=1455132804\n\nRight now, you just need to give the game some time, as I'm sure by the time span of 1week, the game will have most of its issues fixed.\n\nNow, time for the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS ENTIRE REVIEW. (Or second most important)\nA very clever and helpful community member allowed me to play STORM 4 with max FPS and settings, (except resolution) with a simple download. Don't believe me? Look at it for yourself! http://steamcommunity.com/app/349040/discussions/0/405691147599686275/\n\nMy PC specs:\nAMD 4.0GHz\n4GB of RAM (3.2 are usable)\nand no graphics card.\n\nWith the download fix, you can go even under minimum specs (just like I have) and have no problems with the game at all, but as for you users that go above the minimum specs, all YOU need to do is wait the official patch and the game will run fine as well. Or, of course use the fix I linked above.\n\nFor my final verdict:\nThe game is a fantastic way to end the series, with a bunch of new features and characters, with a story that in my eyes, makes the perfect STORM game. I simply love the Naruto series and universe, and love the game even more so.\n\nI give the game a 7/10.\nAsk any game play or general questions below!\n\nF.A.Q.Originally posted by Reaper:How long did it take you to make this review? xD2 Hours.\nOriginally posted by HamZe ⊙︿⊙ :Why did you say its the last naruto game when they only said its the last STORM game?I thought it was, and still haven't found a definite answer, so I'll just edit the review saying I'm not exactly sure.","February 10","true","85.1"," 256 of 298 people (86%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","86","256","298","31","59"

Just been doing online, and versus.\n\n---\nI normally don't do reviews, and I doubt my review will even be seen, but with the game getting bashed so hard. I wanted to give my opinion.\nI had the game preordered, and saw the reviews were terrible, I was scared the game was going to be bad, and run badly.\nSo I started up the game.\nAnd so far my experience with the game has been quite nice. I haven't had any of the issues others have had really. Maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nThere are some small problems with this game like audio, and the fact that we have to go through the config files to actually change some options. But they can easily be (and hopefully are) patched. And even with the small problems, I don't think it deserves to get slammed like it is now.\n\nFrom what I have seen a lot of people having problems with the game don't even meet the min requirements for GPU and/or CPU.\nThere are exceptions of course of people with great cpus, and GPUs like 970s+ having problems.(Maybe is somehow more optimized for older GPUs? Idk). But again from what I have seen on the discussions page, a lot of the people complaining don't meet the requirements for this game at all. I think people just assumed because they could run Naruto UNS3, they could run this game as well or something.\n\n\nIn closing, the game isn't a bad port at all, BUT at the same time, it isn't a very good port either. It's pretty average, but the fanbase is making it seem like it's Batman AK.\nIf you actually meet the requirements of this game and want the game, buy it, you should be fine, and if not somehow, well at least steam refunds is a thing.\n\n\nP.S. I've also played this on my friend's computer with a gtx 960, and it ran fine as well.","February 5","true","14.4"," 169 of 225 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","169","225","12","21"

Tons of characters which is always what we all want from a fighting game. Graphics are great. You most likely will need skills to play online multiplayer (Competitive or not). Community is fantastic and very nice. Gameplay leaves incredible battles like you have never seen before from a fighting game. Every game you play as something new to offer. Every characters can be played in different ways which makes it almost impossible to actually say: I played all character and seen all ultimates/awakening and now its boring.\n\nCons:\nVery bad optimized for computer. 30 fps lock.  Multiplayer servers from high distance countries will most likely be unplayable (US vs France by exemple). You cannot mute players you are fighting against (which can turn out extremely annoying in certain situations).\n\n\nFinally, the game is amazing, there are way more pros than cons, and the bad reviews given to the game are almost only related to the 30 fps lock/bad optimization.\n\nYou should definitly buy this game if you are a Naruto fan or a fighting genre player.","February 21","true","122.3"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","50","59","0","0"

Fortunately for other people, a patch came out and fixed these (i read the feedbacks of the community).\n\nThe game is 30fps locked for me... So what? I don't understand people who doesn't like a game just beceause it's 30 fps locked. The game is still much more than playable.\n\n\n\nNow let's talk more about the game itself.\nThis is the last episode of the storm series and it explain the end of the manga, The Ten tails awakened, kaguya and more...\n\nSometimes they take some liberties and make battles that do not appear in the manga (Susanoo sasuke and madara sky battle for example) and it work very well, all the story is very similar to the original manga and very well animated.\nSomething to notice, THERE ARE NO FILLERS!!!\n\nLet's talk about the few changes in the battles, so we have new characters: Six paths mode Naruto, rinnegan Sasuke, 10 tails obito and madara, rampage obito, Rin, Kaguya, Guy (All gates opened), Kakashi double sharingan,Sakura with the mark on her forehead (i always forget the name, damn...) , Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Hinata the last, Boruto, Sarada and Hanabi.\n\n\nNow you can change characters IN battle and do some nice combos\nKaton jutsus (Fire based techniques) will burn the enemy and his health will decrease\nRaiton and Suiton jutsus (Lightning and Water based techniques) will get more powerful while standing above water.\nWhile the storm jauge is full, you can do a team awakening.\nFights on the wall are back, but only in story mode :'(\nCounter attack is not as powerful as in Revolution, it only knockback your enemy\nThe changes on the battle system are minor, but they are nice.\n\n\nLast but not least, would i recommend this game for someone who aleready own a storm game?\nI would say yes if he's a Naruto Fan, the battle system is still almost the same but the story mode really worth it!!!\n\n\nLike i said before this is MY opinion as a Naruto fan and people who hate the manga WOULD certainely  hate the game aswell.\n\nA gameplay video recorded by me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLMEsnP5NE\n\nI skipped the cutscenes to avoid as many spoilers as possible.","March 12","true","30.4"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","43","50","5","18"

This is not meant to be a truly competitive fighting game.  Anyone who has played any of these games will know this.  But if you haven't, than know that to start.  But this is a good thing.\n\nAs I said this game is fan service.  It would make zero sense for pre time skip naruto to be as strong as Six Paths Madara.  They weren't even comparable in the manga/anime, why would they be in the game.  Lee would never be able to beat The Fourth, and Hinata would get crushed by Nagato every single time.\n\nBut that makes those moments when this happens EPIC.  You feel amazing beating Sasuke The Last as Lee, or Madara as Kiba.  It shouldn't happen, but it did and it feels great.  You know you are the under dog going in, and that makes it so much better when you win anyway.\n\nThe next thing I would say is that you shouldn't let the somewhat basic mechanics that the game has, for a lack of depth.  It is true that you will be smashing your B or Circle button the most, and your combos have more to do with properly timed cancels of limited number.  You are also severely limited in your Chakra, and that can be a game ender if you are against a good opponent.\n\nPeople will run away and bait you out until you fall into the combo that they know will end the game.  They will be cheap, they will spam the OP characters.  How is this any different than how this would go in a real fight with these characters.\n\nI know that there are a lot of people that like these games, but don't actually read or watch the manga/anime, but those that have, should not at all be surprised in this.  The game finds it's depth, in the quite likely accidental way that it is played.\n\nYou have to have a strategy.  You have to feel out your opponent.  You have to set a trap for them and win.  How many episodes and chapters of this show have involved that very thing.  You think one side is loosing, clearly getting shashed by their opponent.  Only to then realize that it has all been a set up, and they have their enemy right where they want them.\n\nWhile a great deal of a Shinobi's power does come from their jutsu, and how strong of said jutsu they can use, a great deal of their victories, come from the decisions made, and their ability to follow their strengths, and strategies.\n\nA duel between shinobi is just as much a mental game as it is a physical one.  And this game does a great job of representing this to the player.  If you create a synergistic team that complements each other, and know how to use them, you can beat anyone as long as you play to their strengths, and don't try to do things that they can't do.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER-\n\nAs a huge fan of the show, this is a big draw to me, even though it is short.  It is very well done.  There is honestly more cut scenes and dialogue than fighting going on, but it still felt good.  I think it took me about 10 hours to finish the story, doing the few side story things along the way.  It could easily be done in a handful of hours I feel if you were to skip through it all.\n\nThe way they blend the game play into the cinematics is jarring though.  As the Anime has not finished, only the manga, there were no scenes from the show that they could use for the cinematics, and so they are rendered in game, and use the same models as the ones you use to play.  This odd blending can make it a bit hard to stay immersed fully, but that is a small complaint, and while it can be arguable as to how good of a practice it is, I can see the value in using assets from the show that are already made for you.  It cuts costs, from a business stand point, but it also minimalizes your work, you don't have to painstakingly recreate these scenes, and then get torn apart because you got some parts wrong.  There is nothing worse than a developer instilling their "vision" of a story that has already been told, and making it worse because of their changes.  And they don't do that here.\n\nI would caution you though, since the Anime has not finished, and doesn't look like it will be any time soon, you may want to hold off on this game until you can read the manga.  There is a lot less said in the game than in the shows and while the game does get it right still, I would consider it a spoiler, as there are definitely parts towards the end that will be really great to watch for the first time as an anime instead.  I wish I could say that you should still get it and it would be worth it, but you have to play the story to unlock the characters, so if you didn't it wouldn't be a full experience, and you would be lacking the more powerful iterations of the characters.\n\nBut if you want to have a more interactive experience with the story than watching it, I think they did a great job at providing that.  It was a fun way to experience the story, and they did a good job keeping it varied, it isn't just cut scenes followed by a battle.  You do have a little bit of a mix up with QTE sequences, as well as larger scales battles that happen that are essentially horde style missions, but on a smaller scale, and with more of a linear movement through it, instead of camping in one spot.\n\nTECHINCAL-\n\nThe game runs alright in single player.  But as is fairly well known and documented in most of the reviews, the net code is bad, and your online experience definitely will vary.  I've had it be great on some days, and horrible on others.  Unfortunately that has become the norm for these kinds of games though, there are very few examples of fighting games that have a good online experience.  And most of the ones that do aren't ports, they were made for the PC.  It's definitely worth bringing it up, and it is the sole reason why I wouldn't recommend it at full price.  However, it is something that I think a lot of people will be used to if they frequently play fighting games online.\n\nCOMPLAINTS-\n\nI do feel like the character roster is kind of bull ♥♥♥♥.  There are something like 64 different characters, most of them have multiple versions with usually only slight differences between their moves.  And while I don't think that the power difference between some of them matter that much, it really doesn't feel like it has as big of a character pool as it does.  With the different variations of them it has something around 109 characters not including the ones you can only get from pre order.\n\nWhich is my next complaint, and something that very nearly made me not want to buy it.  Especially in a fighting game, you should never ever ever have to pre order in order to get all of the characters.  It's absolutely unacceptable.  From what I have seen, Boruto and Sarada aren't super strong or anything, but I don't know about Hokage Kakashi.  I haven't seem him much.  The problem though is that they are characters that we can not access.  We shouldn't be punished because we were smart consumers that waited to purchase the game.\n\nTLDR-\n\nThe game gets it's depth not from intricate and hard to execute combo's, but from the tactical decisions you have to make, as much as people hate it, running away is a legitimate strategy, setting your opponent up for the finishing move is much more important than getting off that infinite combo for the win, and you will win more if you don't just chase those combos.  Unfortunately the game runs poorly, and the online experience is lackluster.\n\nBuy it on sale, especially if you are a fan of the show, but the online play definitely makes it hard to recommend for full price.","March 31","true","31.0"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","45","57","6","1"

Whaddya expect?\nBut this is the end, the final chapter of Ultimate Ninja Storm games.\n\nAs mentioned before, couple new characters were also added..\nAnd I have to say I'm very dissappointed.\nI feel like they're not even trying to listen to their fans.\nSo many characters have been requested to be put into these games,\nyet we have none of those. WHERE IS ANKO, I ASK YOU BANDAI?\nOh jeesh, thanks for giving us another Sasuke character,\nas if those 6 other Sasukes weren't enough. To make things even worse,\nafter they gave us characters people wanted the least,\nthey proceeded to lock away 2 of the characters as Pre-Order bonuses.\n\nNow, I was lucky enough to get the Pre-Order copy but it saddens me\nbecause I know there are people out there,\nwho deeply love Naruto as a series,\nand were looking forward to playing this game but were spit'd on by Bandai.\nYou should never, and I mean never lock away characters from a FIGHTING GAME.\nYou're not delivering a complete product when you lock away characters.\nCostumes I have no issues with but never f*cking lock away characters again.\nAlso, to go back and talk more about the technical issues of this game..\nAs I said before, I don't really care about how good of a pc port this game is.\nAs long as it works, I'm alright with it..\nBut I am sick and tired of Bandai and some other companies ( Tecmo cough cough )\nFor not showing any f*cking respect towards pc gamers,\nwhy is it that we get treated worse than console gamers?\nIs it because PC ports are so much harder to make work properly?\nOr is it because you ignorant baztards label us all as people who pirate video-games?\nI think it's the latter.\nI honestly think they treat us like sh*t and give us more inferior products\nbecause they don't respect us.\nAnd that is disgusting,\nespecially since Naruto is a huge franchise and its fans have made it what it is today.\nAnd many of those fans are indeed, pc gamers. So please, start showing some respect.\n\nWell, now that's out of the way so I can finally continue talk about the freakin' game.\nThey made some rather interesting gameplay changes, which I approve of.\nIn previous titles you were able to summon 2 support characters in middle of a 1v1 battle,\nthey would do one of their signature attacks, and that was about it for them.\nThis time around you can actually switch the characters in middle of a battle.\nYou can still only play with 1 character and use the others as support if you want to, for example..\nIf the match proves easy for you, you might not even need the other characters.\nTag Fighting is what I would call it,\nyou can now play 3v3 same way as you would in the Dead or Alive series ( which is 2v2 though )\nor in the King of Fighters series.\n\nI SHALL NOW PROCEED TO PRAISE BANDAI\nFOR NOT F*CKING UP WITH THEIR DLC COSMETICS,\nYes, they actually handed this one very well. You can actually UNLOCK costumes in this game,\nno DLC costume packs. Hooray!\nYou can now unlock all the costumes, and there's plenty of them.\nIt'll take some grinding to gather up the in game currencies\nbut at least you don't have to pay for the stuff.\nThis of course, is partially due to all the costumes being from the previous UNS Revolutions game.\nSo it would be very wrong of them to ask money for the costumes, again.\nBut hey, I'm more surprised that they didn't do that. Which is sad.\n\nBut hey good job Bandai, this goes to show that you guys do want us to not hate you..\nThat was a weird sentence.\nThere of course, is the Season Pass..\nWhich has yet to be released. And according to its information,\nIt'll include new characters, costumes etc. *sighs*\nOh well.. I desperately hope at least one of the following characters would be included :\nAnko, Zetsu, Kurenai, Hayate and maybe even Dosu or Zaku from the original series.\nIt would be really cool to see their "Otogakure" abilites in the game.\nWe need more variety in characters.\nSure, the character roster is already kind of big but think about it,\nover 10 character slots have gone to different versions of Naruto / Sasuke.\n\n\nAlso, I totally forgot to mention.. but the games graphics have been significantly upgraded.\nThe animations and effects all look very good. That's the best I can tell you.\nI'm a total tard when it comes to technical bullsh*ggery.\n\n\nI usually make a list of PROS and CONS but I've talked about literally everything already,\nexcept the sound.\nVoice acting is what you would expect,\nand the soundtrack is pretty "meh" nothing special but it ain't bad either.\n\nI'll recommend this game. Why?\nBecause it's everything you would expect from a Naruto: UNS title.\nOnly downside for me I can think of is the Pre Order bonus stuff.\nTechnical issues, I do not care about.\nBut make what you will of that statement. Perhaps it's a bigger deal for you,\n\nSeriously though, pc gamers have high standards. Stop acting like entitled brats.\nAnd to the developers, please start to show your fans some form of respect\nand stop giving us bullsh*t excuses to why we get more inferior products.\nAfter all, we pay the same price as console gamers do so why do we get the different treatment?\n\nI rate : 7.80 / 10.00","February 8","true","38.4"," 174 of 273 people (64%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","64","174","273","19","16"

Otherwise - a must have for any Naruto fan.This is by far the best Storm game in my opinion. Naturally, it would make it better if developers could bring back such features as 4th combo, jutsu clashes, wall running, Storm 1 free roam, etc.. I could ramble about this for hours but nevermind that. They don't care anyways.. What's done is done and those removed features probably won't comeback ever.\nSo here's a handful of pros:• Storyline picks up from where Storm 3 left off and covers everything what's left. It's amazing as always: beautiful visuals, stunning boss battles.\n• Biggest roster yet with the ability to choose between several jutsu for your character. Some characters got rebalanced or slightly changed.\n• Leader switch system. It changed the game drastically. The transition is very smooth and fluid and is accessible almost anytime.\n• Rounds (best of 3). Matches are longer, therefore,  you gain a chance to analyze your opponent and make huge comebacks in the rounds to come.\n• Elemental effects.\n• Charged chakra dash.\n• Reworked counter which helps to balance the game out.\n• Upgraded visuals (more sparkles, particles), some objects and buildings can be destroyed on stage.\n• Faster loading screens. (or should I say instant?)\n• Better online experience: smoother battles, fixed ranked system, matching voices, character usage top.\n\n+- A little bit better in-game settings but still has a lot of room for improvement\n\nCons:• Ugh.. Adventure mode. Boring and unnecessary like in previous games.\n• Rare frame drops.\n• A few stages have been removed.\n• Character accessories are gone (I wasn't a fan of them anyways)\n• Ruined tournament mode.\n• Frequent disconnections while in the middle of the match.\n• Since this is the last Storm game, it lacks some new characters that were forgotten (like Swordsmen). An update to the majority of characters is needed too.\n• Still images taken from the anime (with added effects like water splash or camera shake) during the first half of the game. All the other cutscenes are pre-rendered. Thus, their quality is pretty sloppy.\n• Bingo book freezes the game.\n• No mute option.\n• Multiple exploits\n• A sh*tload of disk locked costumes from previous Storm games which were made into paid DLCs. Although they are easily unlocked by modders and it also works online.\n\nGenerally, despite having some flaws, this game is really enjoyable. 9/10\nMy Storm Revolution review\nMy Storm 3 review","March 20","true","196.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","3"

As for the other problems, I seem to be a lucky one in this scenario, I've played for nearly 4 hours straight (3.8 according to Steam) and have not run into a single crash or even hitch/lag spike. The game ran at a completely solid 30 fps the whole time for me and never dipped below, and that includes the menu screens. The game runs great for me, only flaw still being the crappy 30fps cap. The way I look at it is, no matter what, at least on my computer, it runs flat out better then the console versions. So I am happy with the purchase, and if they patch in a 60 fps boost, even better.\n\nAs for gameplay, if you've played Storm 3, it's essentially the same gameplay, though now there is "armor breaking" similar to Soul Calibur. It's a very "basic" fighting game to the point where someone who is not very good at fighting games will actually feel like they are doing well. Of course it's one of those "easy to learn, hard to master" scenarios, but it still feels rewarding to new players none the less.\n\nAnd as a final note, I will just say, to me, the visuals are just flat out GORGEOUS.","February 8","true","8.6"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","31","46","2","0"

Everyone has different opinions and views of this game and thats fine by me!\n\nFirst off, I was not expecting to actually be able to play this game since I know my computer is not that good in specs and graphics and I just wanted to have it whenever I am able to update my computer. But I got lucky since I tried the game out anyway and was able to play it at around 20-25 fps, which I can personally deal with.\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nI really enjoyed the story mode a lot. Great fight scenes especially with the boss battles and quick times events. The only thing that I did not like was many of the cutscenes just have still images with voice overs compared to the awesome CGI ones. There is still some CGI cutscenes but compared to Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (which was all CGI), it left me disappointed.\n\nFree Battle is off course what it sounds like, able to battle with any characters you want which is fun. The different combat moves and special moves are awesome to see, with many big explosions. Many different characters to choose from as well which are easy to pick up since they follow the same combat input combinations. There are also other modes such as survival which can keep you occupied.\n\nIn adventure mode, you can use Naruto (and if you have the DLC like me, use Shikamaru with Garra coming later) which allows you to explore the different locations such as Konoha while having a main quest to do along with fun side quests mixed in adding to more content.\n\nCollection is there to see everything you have bought from the Bandi Store including pictures for your multiplayer card to new costumes from past games for your characters. It is a lot of content to buy and again would keep you busy to get all the content.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nI do not play multiplayer since my game has slow fps. But if you do go into the multiplayer menu, there are special events that is only singleplayer which they update about every week that you can gain certain awards so that is pretty cool, especially for someone like me who is not really a big fan of multiplayer anyway.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy this game and being a Naruto fan this is pretty sweet.

Smooth, nice looking, and high quality.  This is a very well made game and is easily one of my top games.\n\nPros:\n+Some story missions mix it up with getting to play as  Hashiramas wood golem , or  Kurama in Susano'o  ect...\n+Nice art and animations, really smooth and has cool animations for each ninjutsu, secret technique, taijutsu, and awakenings. Characters have their own stances and movement styles.\n+Adventure mode lets you freely explore the world of Naruto and re-visit famous places and fights from the series.\n+Ultimate Survival mode lets you make your own team and fight other teams from the series untill you loose.\n+Team Secret Techniques with your favorite couples, teams, families, and friends. Special animations with seans from the show and some new ones showing how badass your favorite characters can be together.\n\nCons:\n-This really cant be helped but, as we see in all games, there are cheaters and "trolls" online. Some peope will resort to lag switching, but its becoming less common. As long as you look at their Disconnection rate and Internet connection before starting they can be avoide.\n-Dub voices are a bit off sync with the animation in story mode.\n-Average minor glitches (nothing gamebreaking and they get fixed after updates)\n-Easy to Max Ryo\n-In online mode you might get stuck with 2000 BP, but you'll just have to win a few times and rank up to move on.","May 4","true","205.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","1"

If you are interested in Naruto, the headline applies to you. Otherwise, there are better fighters out there. Harsh, but this is how I feel.\n\nIt feels like this game was made to end the franchise rather than give you the best, last experience. Always nice to have a decent story in fighters, but the long-term aspects found in successful fighting games were neglected. My hours weren't spent training, getting better just happened, but there is no fufillment in improvment outside of messing with people online. I spent the time looking for the game's redemptive qualities, the results are below.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Decent Story Mode Overall\n(A short 4-5 hours, probably couldn't be helped. They tried to stay true to the manga.)\n- Simple New Mechanics, best in the franchise (still has problems)\n- New characters are satisfying.\n- Some minor details from previous games. (YOH!)\n- Best Visuals in the franchise hands down.\n- Less frustrating Ranking system in Multiplayer.\n- DLC offered is ok, outside the lack of quantity.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Bad/Shortened re-playability outside of story:\nX Cannot spectate in player matches. (A must have in Endless Mode)\nX Frustrating netcode, disconnects in low ping.\nX Lack of possible maps and content: story mode environments both in this game and previous, were not transferred into free-battle or multiplayer. (Possible 40 map limit)\nX Lowered room capacity in Endless matches.\n\n- Adventure Mode is lame, DLC content is added to this mode:\nX Walking Simulator with fights and fetch missions, it's a chore.\nX Storytelling does not live up to the effort put into Story Mode.\nX The interface of the story mode is a timeline, the DLC added to adventure would've been better as a new story mode timeline.\nX I think content here should've been used to increase the length of story mode.\n\n- Story mode tried to tie a few of the scenes together with lackluster image stills.\n- Wildly unbalanced hitboxes\n- Cannot mute (either) mic in Multiplayer.\n- On Disk DLC, made worse by exclusive DLC that some will never be able to buy.\n\n(These affect the game as a sequel)\n- There were characters already half-made in previous games and were not re-introduced into Storm 4 (except sound 4, 7 swordsmen shoe-horned as an Ultimate Attack instead of characters, both sold separately ).\n- Every fighting franchise recycles move-sets, but it was not handled consistently here.\n- It wasn't ok to resell old skins to the fans.","May 7","false","198.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

Graphic (only if your specs allows)\n\nCompared to the previous few, NSUNS4 has terrific graphic even at 1280x800. The cut-scenes, jutsu and fight scenes makes it almost close to watching the anime.\n\n2. Controls\n\nSimple combinations of buttons on controller just like the previous series. Nothing much to explain on it other than the fact that even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can easily pull off an ultimate jutsu\n\n3. Story mode\n\nWhile I personally do not really like the previous one with mecha-naruto, this story mode simply blows your mind off.\nIt makes you feel as if you are watching the anime, only that you get to control the characters of the scene to do your bidding. My personal favourite would be the Naruto and Sasuke episode. The whole gameplay for that chapter is filled with emotions that gave me tears in my eyes, and the last time i felt that way from Naruto was when I read the arc where Naruto found out about the news of Jiraiya's death.\n\n4. Characters\n\nNaruto and Hinata from The Last. still a better love story than Twilight.\nOh! and Hanabi is so adorable, both from the Adventure and The Last.\n\nCONS\n\nWhile there are so many positive points one can find in this game, the downside is that the game is easily cleared within days (3 for myself) when one is so familiar with the combo list. In my opinion, it would be perfect if consumers can choose the level of difficulties at the start menu (correct me if i am wrong but so far i am sure i couldn't find anything about difficulty settings).\n\nIn conclusion, I would rate the game 9/10 and recommend anybody who is interested, to definitely get the game.

Tons of new and awesome characters are included in this game ( including the season pass and preorder bonus owners) and many awesome combos are also included which are just fabulous! If your a Naruto fan and you don't play this game, then it will be a shame for the ninja community.\n\nBut no game is perfect! This game too has some cons- like the game is locked at 30fps and in online mode ( apart from the ping problem), if your opponent has a weak pc and he gets an fps of about 10-15 fps then it will lag like hell in your match, whereas the opponent won't get any lag! And not to forget, there's a glitch in this game that sometimes the sound suddenly switches off on its own ( only the SFX sounds keep playing)!\n\nSo overall I give a score of 8.5/10 to this game ( I may rate more if they fix these glitches and bugs in their future updates)!

I was lucky enough not to have any major issues aside from story cutscene dialog only playing voice in one ear (when that's fixed, this game could be perfect!) online netcode can be iffy if you're not battling someone near you, but when you get a good network match it's a great time... so many different varied characters/costumes, all with unique animations and movesets, I'd recommend this over any current fighters, to the point where I think I may even like it more than tekken 6.\n\na mechanic unique to this include being able to swap between 3 characters, with 1 as leader, and other two as support, either call them in as support, or switch to them (even mid combo, to extend your combo further,), which brings good levels of dynamicism to the game as you can swap to a ranged character after you've picked up some distance, and when you're closing in on someone switch to a cqc fighter, a well balanced team is a good part of whether you win or not now.\n\nthat said, there are people with issues, if you crash a whole bunch on windows 10 (Every 15-20 minutes) you should go to services.msc and disable off touch keyboard and handwriting service, if you have low fps(NVIDIA), you should go to your nvidia control panel and make sure your global setting is,(or add nsuns4.exe and set to) your high performance nvidia graphics card instead of integrated... when all issues are fixed this game is easily a 10/10 for both a fighter and true to the anime game, the last game I played so close to source material was south park the stick of truth.","February 5","true","39.8"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","25","46","3","0"

Then I found out that it doesn't support a gamepad. So one of us used to Xbox 360 control which worked fine, then the other had to use a keyboard.... for a fighting game? A KEYBOARD? After playing so many hours on a PS3 and Xbox contoller, I find out that I have to use a keyboard to have any fun at all with my friends? Except we didn't have much fun. I have looked at some discussions but have found nothing that works for me. The gamepad works just fine with Naruto UNS 3 Full Burst, so why doesn't it work this this game?! I am disappointed.\n\nOther things I have experienced:\n\n- Dialog in cinematic scenes comes can be heard only in left speaker (Fixed)\n- Lag/FPS drop during awakening (very minor issue although worth mentioning)\n- Screen tearing! No V-Sync option (Especially on the more cinematic fights)\n- Terrible lag in online battes.\n(I have played on my friend's PS4 and the experience was so much smoother. I have never had a smooth Naruto UNS online match before on PC. I did a bit a of research and many people say that both players need good connections and a PC that can constantly put out 30 FPS in order for smooth gameplay online. Some people do not have problems at all (from what I read) so wheather or not I can blame CC2 for laggy online gameplay is debatable. Just for reference, I am not running the game a toaster PC)\n(EDIT: Playing with people within your region who have 3 bars of connectivity will give you a smooth experience!)\n\nOn the bright side...:\n(Note that I have not played UNS Revolution so I do not know if these changes were made in that game. If these changes were already present in Revolution, this is my first time experiencing them)\n\n- Addtional characters\n- Beautiful new effects/details\n- New sound effects\n- More story\n- Allows you to switch between characters mid-fight (Health remains the same)\n- Sweet looking Ultimate team finishers if the right charcters are selected\n\nKeep in mind these are the only things I have experienced. Other players have experienced worse. If you don't mind the negatives, then the game should be pretty good for you. Still, I'd say hold off until the game is patched up. Paying $50 for a product, I expect it to be working correctly and I won't stand for crappy ports.","February 4","false","27.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","0"

I've never been so disappointed about a game in my entire life. It's not even the fact that the game isn't 60fps, honestly it's not that big a deal. But no vsync, bad preformance, frame rate drops mid combat, menu slow down, etc. Like why? There is literally no excuse for this. Oh yeah, there are only two resolution settings, 1080p and 720p. For me this isnt a big deal since i have a 1080p monitor, but if you have a higher res monitor or something like that you wont be happy with these 2 options. I havent even touched the story in this game yet, and I might not since I'm highly considering returning this pile of garbage.

On here, you get a config.ini which is the only way to enable v-sync.\n\nYou have go in-game & to the settings to change:\n- Resolution (you only get two options, or atleast I did,\nchanging it in the config will bug up & provides no additional boost in FPS),\n- Shadow Detail,\n- Motion Blur,\n- Glare, &\n- FXAA\n\nI also heard that the games story can crash on users too, I haven't been able to check because my game runs so slow, it took 15 minutes before I could start the very first scenes of the game & didn't have the patience.\n\nWeirdly though, if I go into Character Customisation or Presets, the game will go into 30fps, but will go back to 10 when going back to the menus. (the game is locked into 30fps, like all the rest).\n\nTL;DR: Horribly Optimized, not worth anything until patched.\nEven to people whom love the storm series.\n\nIf they fix these bugs (just the 10 FPS bug is enough for me), I will change this review to a positive, but I'm not removing the other cons to entice people without their knowledge.\n\nPros:\n- New Character Swapping Mechanics\n- No more choosing between types, Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening, & Drive are all in one now.\n- Story mode goes onto the end of the manga\n- Fixed crash bugs from Storm 3 & Revolution, like Shisuis Neutral Combo.\n\nCons:\n- 10 FPS Slow-mo even with requirements (Fixed)\n- Sound issues for other users\n- Story mode crashes for other users\n- Lack of settings\n- 30 FPS Locked (even though, I really don't care for that.)","February 4","true","358.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","15"

I bought it on console. But with that being said, I have to say I prefer this game on steam. It ran so smooth for me, and the load times oh my god the load times.. I love playing ranked online and playing the game in general and these load times put it to justice.. On console you have to wait on average 15-30 seconds maybe longer.. On PC this game starts a match in an instant. With less time looking at the loading screen and more time playing I enjoyed it.. But it does have its flaws, the biggest glaring flaw for is the optimaztion, and im not talking about running wise. If you don't have a gamepad this game is either no fun and practically impossible to play.. all the keys are mapped in the weirdest ways and it doesn't help that the butten prompts are of an Xbox controller or gamepad. One other thing in this game i'd have to say is content. Personally since they added "the last" varients of characters, they shouldve kept going. Like with Boruto the movie. Yes you get Boruto, and Sadara. But I'm talking about Adult Garra, All the new Kage.. Yes you can argue its going to be in the DLC or season pass. But that should've been in the game from the start. I don't enjoy practically buying characters, and don't enjoy spending money on costumes I don't use. Needless to say I could go on and on all day about the flaws and perks but those stick out for me.\n\nI have about 120 hours on PS4.. and so far 10 hours on PC\nI give this game a 8.5/10. And I recommend this game to anyone who is the fan of the series like me, likes solid fighting, and has a gamepad.","March 8","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Best anime series second to Dragon Ball Z...and im glad that as an adult i finally get to see how the story ends... With that being said ive played every storm game except the very first one only due to fact that i didnt own a playstation 3 but i did play its counter part the Rise of a Ninja and The Broken Bond...i started with storm 2 and watched how the gameplay mechanics have changed sooo much and can honestly say this is the best storm game if you really want it to feel like elite ninjas are fighting. I feel like the characters movements and speeds really get  captured in this game....and if they do make another game keep it in this format please...\n\nThe story of Storm 4 is incredible. biggest flaw is they didnt use animated cutscenes for everything which means a portion of it felt like i was watching a read along book....but when cutscenes were available they amazing and gorgeous, they took the time to make everything work and feel genuine to the story. I love how they incorporate the flashback aspect of the series into it which if youve watched previous series and episodes you lknow there is some very heart wrenching moments...\n\nI dont play much online but will continue to play adventure mode to see whats that like..\n\nSadly this will be my final Storm game and to stop with the best game is how ill stand.\n\nOverall Score 10/10","March 15","true","15.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yalorda/recommended/349040/","Yalorda","Yalorda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yalorda/","101 products in account","This is it. The final part of Naruto Shippuden translated into gameplay, something which the anime still hasn't delivered to us. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 or NUNS4 starts off with some backstory on who is fighting against who and for what cause which provides some great fights with a fun combat style and a interactive cinematic quick time event finish for most of them that both Naruto fans new and old can enjoy. Other than the main story mode the game has other modes as well which I'll go explain based on how they appear on the main menu (You could also skip to the conclusion if you don't want a detailed explanation of what each game mode has to offer)\n\nSTORY\nThe story mode covers both backstory for some of the main key characters in the 4th great ninja war as well as everything from when the ten tails is first summoned all the way up to the "final fight" as well as a nice ending cutscene.\n\nADVENTURE\nAdventure is a more open-world take on story telling covering a mini arc that happens in between the ending of Shippuden and The Last: Naruto the Movie. To me it felt more like a filler episode but enjoyable nonetheless. In this story Naruto reminiscences of stories dating back from when he was a kid up until this point serving as memorable battles that are a blast from the past. Also mentioned before you can roam around the ninja world just as the after game in Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (Full Burst) but other than completing some of the side quests there isn't that much to explore.\n\n*There are also extra DLC stories of which 2 are out right now featuring Shikamaru and Gaara as the main characters.\n\nCOLLECTION\nAs always there is a lot to collect, some of which you can buy here ranging from voice clips to costumes for characters. You should have enough money to buy what you want after play through the story once. I never felt like I had to grind to get more money.\n\nONLINE BATTLE\nAs I am not a competitive or "pvp" player I cannot accurately review this game mode however I do know that if you're into online pvp and ranked systems this mode will probably satisfy your needs.\n\nFREE BATTLE\nI feel like the name for this mode does not do the actual content justice. There are so many extra game modes hidden away in this non-descriptive name that I could probably split this part up by itself. I'll try to keep it short though. Free battle contains a training mode where you can just test out various characters/teams against a npc as well as a Survival and League mode which mode add a new twist to the regular matches and are definitely worth checking out.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNUNS4 is THE ending I wanted for this amazing franchise. With a giant roster of countless memorable characters and adding on to the gameplay showing that the Ultimate Ninja Storm series has an ever evolving combat system by now giving you abilities like switching character mid fight or breaking the weapons/armour of your opponent. The game looks even more stunning whilst still maintaining the same style as previous titles in the franchise HOWEVER this comes with a cost, the system requirements have been boosted up so I did have to play on low settings to achieve a stable fps count. Anyways if you are a fan of Naruto you really gotta pick up this game as it is the epic conclusion to an epic story as I hope this is not the end but a standard that should be achieved once again as I hope for a Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm 5.\n\n*Disclaimer: Sorry if there are any spelling/grammar mistakes, English is not my native language and I only did a quick spell-check after what kinda seems like writing a book in and of itself. I did this after finishing all of the achievements and purely out of the love for the game/franchise and as such this review is kinda biased(Believe it!).","April 11","true","46.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

PC master race!" debby downers make you reconsider buying the best installment of the STORM series.\nYes this game has its FIRST DAY FAULTS (at the time of writing this) and I am sure Bandai and CC2 are going to resolve these issues, because if they do not that is stained PR and PC gamers surely soured to the core.\n\nTL;DR: If you are a part of the "I am an entitled PC gamer and expect every games company to worship me as I am a part of the Master Race of Gamers" club this game will irritate you with the lack of options and the 30FPS cap, better not even bother wasting your time here, bye-bye. But if you are a normal gamer and/or enjoy the Naruto/STORM series, keep this on your wishlist or pick it up ASAP!\n\nBut let us disregard the "It's only 30FPS" and "Character Audio only comes through my left headset channel in some cutscenes" and "But my 4K entitlement isn't easily implemented and how dare I have to do some manual work in the files of the game to recieve it" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going around right now in this here review section! This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome in where it matters. The GAMEPLAY! (OMG I KNOW RIGHT!)\n\nThere are several modes in this game. You have:\n-Story Mode\n-Adventure Mode\n-Online Battle (Normals, Ranked, Lobbies etc).\n-Free Battle (VS mode, Survival, Leagues, Challenges, Training etc).\n-Store (Using in-game currency and "treasures" to buy customisable tidbits for your online profile and costumes for characters)\n\nThe combat feels faster and more fluid. And the addition of being able to tag in/out your support characters so you can technically do 3v3s (even though all characters share one health pool and chakra pool) and the Round system like in your more conventional fighting games (best out of 3 rounds) has made this game franchise shine again! Kudos to you game developers!\n\nThe story mode goes all the way till the end of the manga so be warned there are spoilers in this game if you only watch the anime! (Don't say I didn't warn ya :P)\nBig Boss Battles are back! Horaaaaaaay! Whack those big baddies down!\nThe animation in in-game cutscenes are fantastic, and the art for the "storyboard" sections of the story mode is nothing but breathtaking.\nI use Japanese VO in this game and it sounds great. Cannot comment on the English VO, sorry you pureist out there!\n\nNow, the dull part. The negatives. Yes this is first day and it is to be expected, yes I can see why people are upset. Is it a big deal though? NO.\n-30FPS and no way to make it 60FPS.\n-Minimal graphical adjustment options in game (Most can be found in the games folder in a file named "config").\n-Fullscreen or Windowed option only (can make it borderless windowed by using a free program called "Borderless Gaming").\n-In certain cutscenes, character audio will only come through the left channel of your headset while music and SFX comes through the right (ONLY IN CERTAIN CUTSCENES NOT IN GAME FIGHTS!).\n\nIn conclusion, the game itself for what it is - A GAME - is a very entertaining and engaging experience which is amplified if you are a fan of the Naruto series or the STORM franchies. Yes it has it's problems (like every other game) and yes the port could be much better than what we got. But this is DAY ONE (when writing this) so give the devs a chance and lets hope they will fix all the problems that the community has had/found to make this game even more amazing than it already is!\n\nThanks for reading this long review!","February 4","true","29.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I really wanted to give this game a positive review but I can't. I experience massive amounts of screen tearing every time I boot it up. My pc isn't a toaster by any means. I have an i5 6600 3.3 GHz, 8GB of RAM DDR4, and a GTX 960 4GB VRAM. So let's run down the problem with the port.\n\n-30fps lock\n-15ps-10fps when navigating menus\n-slowdown\n-input lag\n-sound lag\n-screen tearing\n-no V-sync option\n-There's a delay with QTE in Story mode and they prompts don't appear when they are supposed to so you can in turn fail the QTE\n-I was lucky enough not to experience this myself but when you try to play online the menus will lag in navigation and if you accept a match you will be booted back to the start screen.\n\nI'm honestly disappointed in Bandai and CC2. They said they were going to make the game for PC in mind (a damn lie) and they were going to target 60fps. If CC2 couldn't get the game to be 60fps then they just should have handed it over to DIMPS seeing as how they make great ports and can get games to run at 60fps. If they manage to fix it I will change my review but in the meantime I do not recommend that you purchase this game. If you're eligible for a refund I would suggest that you get it.\n\nIt's honestly sad that there's this mentality that we must buy bad ports to prove that we want more games on Steam even though it's been proven if you have a great port people will buy it simply because they want to see more great games that are well optimized on Steam. Say no to bad ports on Steam. First Tales of Symphonia and now storm. This is not acceptable Bandai.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m39tRc2f35E\n\nA review of my experience with this game.","February 6","false","16.2"," 31 of 59 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","31","59","3","0"

Restarting the computer before each time I load it up fixes this completely.)\n\nIt is worth mentioning (though through coincidence not much problem to me) that the resolutions are limited. You can fix this by fiddling with .ini files but they should just provide all the most common resolutions to begin with. The game runs at 30FPS and in my opinion still feels pretty fluid, but I also kind of don't care about things like that, particularly with games like this.\nIn its current state I don't want to recommend this game because people shouldn't have to fish around for issues just to play the game.\n\nBut\n\nIf you want to deal with that, have a decent computer and a controller it's really fun and pleasant to watch and kind of encapsulates everything the anime could have potentially been. Gamewise I recommend it, and if you want to get it the console versions are probably better at this point in time. I feel like whatever's going on with the menus can be fixed in a patch so be on the lookout for that or maybe a sale.\n\nIt can definitely stand to have more graphical options though, this game is pretty and not having a couple more kinda limits that.\n\nOh and pre-order exclusive characters is just really really irritating. I don't mind buying them but at least give me the option.","February 6","false","19.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

I loved Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and this one is just as fun, if not more so, than the last installment.  The fighting mechanics are a lot of fun, and you get to try out a plethora of characters, so if you wanted to play as the Crimson Beast, you can do so.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the manga, as it stays true to the storyline and gives you the opportunity to play as your favorite characters.  Once you finish the story, you can continue to play in "Adventure" mode, which gives you move missions to complete, so it adds to the hours of fun that you can get with the game.

The gameplay mechanics are improved and there's a great deal of added depth and complexity for players who wish to play competitively.\n\nHowever, I cannot find a single scrap within myself to recommend this game to an average consumer.\n\nSTORY/SINGLEPLAYER:\n\nIt's grossly full of laziness and poor effort.  The cutscenes are literally stills straight from the anime.  The fights are braindead simple, as the AI is designed so that a child mashing a single button can beat the entire campaign.  This may seem besides the main point, as story modes are often neglected in fighting games so that the emphasis of the developers is on delivering a rich multiplayer experience.  However, that front does not deliver either.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\n\nOne word: lag.  It's chockful of it.  The lag you'll experience is horrendous to the point where you'll find it difficult to input any commands unless you're mashing the button.  For some bizarre reason, it's also tied to FPS, so if you're playing against someone with 10 FPS, for example, while you're playing at 30 FPS, you'll experience massive stutter that will legimately make the match unplayable.  There is no specatating in this game, so you won't even be able to view anyone else's match online.  The ranking system is a joke, as anyone can disconnect from a losing game without penalty.  The developers have also not improved the amateurish setup of online play since Storm 3 so random disconnects trying to get into a game are still a problem.\n\nI will continue playing this game solely because I like playing the local multiplayer with pals.  If you don't have anyone to play with locally, don't buy this game.  The netcode is brutally awful and makes for an extremely uncompetitive and unreliable environment.\n\nAll modern fighting games need a strong online multiplayer foundation.  It's a necessity, not an option.  Without having that foundation, Storm 4 will never possess the reliable playerbase and the longevity that other fighting games currently have.","February 10","false","35.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

A lot of people are experiencing problems with their games running at really bad framerates. Developers might release an optimisation soon or it's just that their computers aren't powerful enough.\n\nOnline: I've only played a few matches online, I've only expierenced a half laggy battle once, the rest were smooth. I haven't experienced any spammers (though I don't think this exists in this game since it so easy to block jutsus or ultimate jutsus)\n\nStory: I've only played the first chapter but it's really good so far, I really like the Quick time events, they're just fun to do, and the visuals in story oh.my.god amazing.\n\nThere's a lot of playable characters in storm 4, actually there's so much I haven't even played with like 1/10th of them xD The costumes are pretty cool and if you're a huge fan of the anime (like me) then you'll love the costumes.\n\nThat's pretty much all I can say about this game right now, so far it's 8/10 for me.","February 11","true","74.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

As a fan of the anime and manga, I expected lots of intense action from what’s been presented as the final game of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, and to its credit, Storm 4 delivers. The characters and over-the-top battles look and feel great, and the story pays off in a satisfying way. On the other hand, even the best combat system in the world would be wasted if there are no worthy opponents to be found.\n\n- Pros:\n* Fan-pleasing story mode\n* Strong versus and online modes\n* Huge roster of characters\n* Fantastic anime graphics\n* Three-character fights\n\n- Cons:\n* Utterly bewildering for non-fans\n* Steep learning curve\n* Interminable cut-scenes\n* Poor AI\n* Shallow Adventure mode\n* Connection issues\n* Bad optimized\n\n\n- I hope the dev will fix the problem in game!","February 5","true","135.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

What I mean by that is to you fixate it or modify it to make your PC handle it well. I have Intel Graphics 5000, with a 4th Gen i5 processor, and the game never dips below 27 fps because of my modifications (Which aren't to do at all if you kinda know your way around and unless i'm using a heavy mod or i'm doing a heavy UJ or Awakening, it usually doesn't dip.) The game is fun and clean, although there are many crashes. I have to use a mod to get the characters I can't unlock through story mode, only because I can't get past the Hashirama v Madara level without the game crashing, even with the particles removed or changed. If not for the crashes, I would give this a 9/10. But because of that (And the adventure mode, which is kinda boring), I rate this a weak 7.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyidiot/recommended/349040/","deadlyidiot","Durantye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyidiot/","235 products in account","I've finally finished the story for this game and as far as how it tells the tale is pretty good, much better than usual anyways. I think it does an excellent job of delivering plenty of story content and any who enjoys the series should definitely grab the game, some of the specialized fights are extremely fun and creative. You can tell they put a lot of work into the game to develop it very well, I haven't yet tried Adventure mode unfortunately.\n\nThe only real con I have is that the characters are completely without balance at all, I understand it isn't exactly an E-sport game but many of the characters just have blatantly unfair advantages compared to most characters. It isn't like you'll be unable to beat story mode but you'll definitely find yourself throwing the controller from a BS combo or CPU specific ability getting an insanely lucky combo on you that ruins your S rank attempt or even drops you to B. I have to say that it does suck that the best way to obtain rank S in story is basically just spam your regular ninjutsu (not your special one) and hope for a lucky streak usually you can recover most of the chakra used before they get up, and if you have most of your substitutions the CPU generally won't rush you to stop it either. This is especially effective with characters like Senjutsu Naruto who has a thrown Ninjutsu with extreme range. Otherwise you'll find yourself restarting fights dozens of times each, the boss battles are very very unbalanced as well, the ones with the gigantic fighting or non-character players are generally way too easy, you can get S in these AND do the extra objectives almost accidentally. But the boss battles with regular characters seem overtuned, their ability to spam jutsu and substitution will have you screaming at your screen, yet again the best thing to do is spam single load ninjutsu (they almost always dodge/block double load with insanely inhuman speed). Overall the AI for this game is completely out of whack, at first it seems like a good challenge but it is realistically just their reflexes turned up to insane levels.\n\nBesides the bad character balance and the overtuned AI, the design of the characters is very fluid, some of them have abilities that are blatantly ridiculous of course (pretty much any character that teleports will be easy to win S ranks with). But besides that they look and feel great to play, probably their least balanced game ever but out of the ultimate ninja series their story-telling and design level is out of this world this time around.","April 8","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What i got however was multiple still images with effects plastered on the top earlier on in the game then later a cascade of cutscenes to break up bossfights that feel like they should be hard but end up being very easy. In ninja storm 3 it felt like you were playing the story, being able to move around the world and take part in side missions and extra stuff, in this its boss battle>exhibition>boss battle>exhibition which left me with a sour taste in my mouth as this feels like a huge leap backwards in terms of how the story is being told in the game. Add as many impressive special effects as you want it wont stop the fact that this feels like playing the arcade mode of a generic beatemup rather than a story over 10 years in the making in the fact that i could just get the same effect playing the online mode and watching the anime. also the literally translated japanese dialogue and narration comes across as stilted and awkward compared to how it felt in the manga, could be that it is more noticed due to the impressive amount of exhibition in the game.","February 5","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Feels great and sad at the same time. I'll try to be as honest as possible in my review.\n\n- Premise: Its a arcady fighting game duh! In spite of all the "new features" they added, it feels largely the same as previous reiterations of the series. Which ISN'T a bad thing per se. Some people enjoy this 3D oriented fighting style, some don't. It's not the deepest fighting game. You won't find the complexity of say Mortal Kombat or Tekken, but it IS a visually appealing game that won't fail to surprise you. With the fact that now you can switch up your support characters as you main characters, essentially you get to play as 3 characters every match!\n\n- Story/Singleplayer: Ah, the meat of the game, well atleast for me. This marks the FINAL game of the Naruto Shippuden manga. That's right all the way up to **SPOILERS**  .... Naruto vs Sasuke heh :) Seriously though, the cutscenes, the visual set-pieces....if you have decent graphics, it'll blow your mind. The action is vibrant. Every wanted to know how it felt to be Hashirama riding on your Turtle/Tree/Dragon thingamajig all the while throwing Kamehameha waves that render the earth as it flies off towards Madara and his Susan'o? No? Well I did and I got it in this game.\n\nBasically if you loved the story-telling aspects of the previous Storm games, then think of this as that times 10! No really, the single player itself is worth the price you pay for this game (which I'll get to later)\n\n\n- Graphics: I'm not a huge sucker for graphics in an anime-based game, still I was blown away by how good it looked and played. No complaints there.\n\n- Sound: Eargasm\n\n- Online: Ugh, here we come to the part of the review where I get to butcher this game's reputation, don't worry I won't be too harsh.......STAY AWAY! Now I don't speak for everyone. If you got this thing to run and play fine online, and you're having a blast playing, then all the power to you my friend :)\n\nBUT...if you're me or any number of people I've met you for the love of all things sane couldn't bear the lag, then hop on board. I don't know what it is. Netcode? Connection issues? I can run all games and play them online but not this. It either times out while searching for a match or disconnects in the middle of one. Ugh. Bad, Very bad.\n\n- DLC content: Meh. It's good if you're a completionist. I rarely, if at all, use all and every item from DLC purchases. That and the fact that these DLCs are basically reskins of characters....no thanks. As for the additional story modes, I'm not really interested in knowing about the great and might Shikamaru haha. I'll just wait until a couple of mods drop :)\n\n\n- Price: This was an issue for me. Being in Canada, I would NOT want to pay $69.99 for this title. Yes the game is awesome but lets also not forget that these games REALLY haven't changed much in the 3-4 years that the series has been running. Get it on sale.\n\nVERDICT: If you liked the previous titles, this one if a must-have. If you're a single player junky like me then this is a love letter to you. Why kill yourself by watching filler anime episodes when you can just kill your wallet and watch all the awesome parts in full HD?! Boasting the largest roster of characters too. There is no reason NOT to have this title. Plus this being the last game in the series, only time will tell what "new" game CC2 will have in store.\n\nBTW I own this on PS4 as well, so I didn't really put a lot of time into the PC version, but as you can see, I loved it enough to get it a second time. I'm horrible with my money. Bye,","March 14","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Nope it is not, it is the worse thing I ever seen, but with nowadays developers, it's nothing new, we get ****ed by a bunch of incompetents who are good at nothing but cheating people.\nA future DLC or expansion should be something new, something totally new, have new ideas of characters? Exclusives characters from other games? Go for it but characters that should be in the base game right away?\nThat's just pathetic, no really, It's pathetic.\nYou guys should be ashamed of yourself.\nKurenai, Anko and Shizune are probably never gonna be playable which is really dumb too since they were playable in the older games.\n\nFor now that's all what I can think of so I'm giving this game a 4.5/10 for the moment.\nOverall, It could be a great game if the game wasn't that badly unoptimized and if we could get the basic stuff (stages and characters that should be in the game and damn, even some costumes).\nFor now, I would wait for an update, the game plays better while fighting, in the menu, it is very laggy, this is not normal nor acceptable and hopefully they will remove the 30 fps lock, we're talking about the PC here and it's 2016, PC games were playable at 60 fps even back in 2000 damn it.","February 5","false","13.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It stays true to the franchise in terms of gameplay and graphics, while improving on the aspects of the previous games. I love the new combat mechanic of "tag team," where you can switch between up to three characters during a fight. It adds a new dynamic and makes for some really intense fights and satisfying combos. The combat is still easy to pick up, but difficult to master due to the fast pace. Graphics are great and the animations are a pleasure to watch. The game is locked at 30 fps, so consider that before buying. It would be nice to have 60+ fps, but as long as there is no stuttering, it doesn't bother me. Prior to the patch, there were some optimization issues. But, those have been solved in my case. I'm not sure about eveyone else though. Character selection is great with many to choose from. People are complaining that not that many fighters were added compared to the previous game, but I don't mind since this is the first Storm game I've purchased. Likewise, some animations and movesets are the same as the previous game. Overall, if you want to enjoy the end of the Naruto Shippuden before the anime catches up, pick up this game. I believe it's the best anime fighting game out there.\n\nSpecs:\nEVGA 660 Ti\ni7 - 2600 @ 3.40 Ghz\n16 Gb RAM\nWindows 7 64-bit","February 12","true","79.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I played the story mode without a single unexpected error, the game did not even crash ( and that was even before some patches came out). The only problem I had was a strange audio issue (sound completly messed up) when starting the game for the first time... yet it was pretty easy fixable with some adjustments to my own audio settings.\n\nRegarding the performance, this game is solid, it runs absolutely smooth, I did not have any frame drops and the 30FPS-Lock did not bother me actually, because it somehow did not feel like 30FPS... Maybe I got used to it quick, don't know.\n\nNow in general:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Just epic...\n- A lot of content like tons of playable characters with different outfits (even if a lot are recycled from the past games but the more the better... right?)\n- Combat System improved, it feels better now and you can change your fighter during the fights\n- Great Story, epic fights... and no filler episodes! :D\n- A lot of special Team Jutsus, which are really nice (but some ofc are from the past games)\n- Graphics improved since the last game\n- Japanese Voice acting is awesome, just like in the anime\n\nCONS:\n- During the story instead of showing animated dialogues you somtimes just get a picture with little animations and dialogue...I mean its understandable they save up a little work there so they could focus on other epic staged fights\n- I started the story with english dub, but some actors had a different (worse) voice than in the anime... instantly turned to japanse dub\n- Storytelling is often during a fight and its sometimes hard to focus on the dialogues while beating your opponent... though its not that negative... only sometimes\n- Adventure mode is a little bit... well just to extend the playtime for a little while, not really something more, but not that bad. The Story between Naruto and Hinate there is cute, but too short ( Just watch the Naruto Movie "The Last" if you want see the story between these two :) )\n- I tried the multiplayer a bit, but several times the connection was not really great, the input had always at least a slight delay in it... and besides the opponents spam their moves like hell, while shouting smth to their mum, crying or coughing into the microphone, unaware that I can hear them :D  Yet probably funny against friends.\n\nTo sum it up, this is probably the best naruto game and holds up a greatly done (really animated) ending to the naruto-series and  everyone being annoyed by all the filler-episodes in the anime can definetly finish the story of naruto here in this game without regrets.","February 21","true","22.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Storm 4 is here! Believe it! The finale in the storm series has made its way on the market, and its on steam! To think for one moment I would be playing storm 4 on my pc is pretty unbelievable. Its been a great journey ever since the very first storm game.\n\nNow I know alot of people are going to be scratching their heads. Storm 4 on steam has been given a mixed score. So most people are wondering with the amount of negative reviews there are of why ive taken the liberty of giving a postive review. Well let me just say that it isn't neccisarly the game itself, but more in terms of functionality.\n\nFor starters, many peole are complaining about -\n\n- The 30 FPS Lock\n-Lag (Which reguardless of your specs you will get)\n-Crashing\n-Audio and visual glitches\n-Game is apparently in full japanese for some people?\n-Same game pads aren't working\n\nNow these are just some of the issues, as there are more, more being so in terms of adjusting the quality and visuals of the game. Now let me just say this. My specs can't run alot of games on steam that come out. I have an ASUS gaming laptop, my GPU is a 765M (horrible GPU) while my CPU is a 4700HQ, and with all the issues i've listed, the 30 FPS lock as well as lag have been my only issues, which everyone will get reguardless of their specs.\n\nIn other words, if you are thinking of getting this game but afraid that it won't work for you, don't be, because in most cases the game will work just fine as long as your specs are more then whats required. My GPU is worse then the required GPU and the game works perfectly fine besides the lag. And even if it doesn't work, there is always steam refund.\n\nWhether Cyber Connect 2 fixes these issues, its hard to say, but reguardless fan-made patches will be made eventually.\n\n\nI do plan to give a solid review after I play through the games story mode and beat it. So far the game is looking good. Highly reccomend you get it.","February 5","true","13.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

With different sections to choose means a different story. what i like is gone are the days of 1 to 2 hour story before each fight, now each section tells you how long it may take to play. usually 8-15 minutes for regular fights and longer for boss fights.\n\n-online play\nkeep in mind everything is just first opinion and may change. The online play didnt seem to lag which is nice and the gameplay feels much more smooth. people are now allow to enter awakening and then switch to a teamate if you play team battle. This throws many spins to each fight which keep gameplay fresh. Back again are the ninja cards to customize however you want from titles to images to share with everyone and believe me there are tons of items to choose from.\n\nin conclusion this game is great and there is much i didnt share because im still experincing the game. the changes are very nice and smooth in my opinion which makes a great fighting game. if your a fan of the series i recommend playing but be aware of tech problems until updates come out but these will be fixed.","February 5","true","3.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It runs beautifully, the graphics are amazing, and I just got through the first Story battle, and it was amazing fun.\n\nAnd y'know what's holding it back? Of all the things the developers could ♥♥♥♥ up (and ♥♥♥♥ up this horribly), it's the menus. The menus, and the graphical overlays of the animations. Y'know those situations in Ninja Storm 3 where you have quick time events for boss fights?\n\nImagine those, but the button prompts coming up about two seconds after you have to hit the button. The frame skips in this are absolutely brutal. I don't know what went wrong, but it's clear that I'm gonna have to vote with my wallet here, and I hope everyone else does as well.\n\nDo not buy this game right now. Functionally, it's perfect, but I'm not going to let the devs let a problem this game-breaking slip by and keep my money. Getting a refund, figured I'd leave this here for people who read.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my computer is pretty damn powerful. GTX 780 graphics card, fully updated drivers. Powerful processor, loads of memory and hard drive space, and I don't have a single issue running other games such as Ninja Storm 3, Revolutions, or even games where I noticed this problem before, which would be the Armed Assault series.\n\nThis is actually the first time I've ever been able to relate a Naruto game to an Armed Assault game, and that's because the intro 'sequences' (those intro credits you see, crediting each of the companies who were unlucky enough to work on this port, y'know?) are laggy as all Hell. As such, you can't even navigate through the menu without pressing the A button 5 times for it to register.\n\nRefunding, I'm gonna wait until they patch this. If they don't, then I hope this port sinks and whoever worked on it learns a lesson from this. And that the gaming public also learns a lesson.\n\nIf a title's not up to snuff, then don't bother keeping it. Toss it back and demand something better!","February 4","true","43.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","12","23","4","16"

Aside from that the adventure mode isn't really worth doing and the characters largely don't have much going for them in the ways of options/customization and movesets choices. It is hard to deny however that the game has flash in spades and if PvP in the previous naruto games is your thing then this game should be a nice step up. As I have no choice but to recommend or not and have no neutral ground I will have to rate it down and hope steam eventually gives another choice between the standard "like/dislike" themed options.\n\n**6/10 For a good story mode (strays from source material often understandably) but the rest feels very lacking**\n\nHow to sum it all up: Starts off great, gets old fast (Best to wait till the price drops)","February 6","false","9.7"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

I logged on and saw that it was available so of course i had to buy because i love Naruto and the last 3 games. I first read the reviews and most were negative talking about how the frames were going down to 15fps or game freezing. So i decided to go buy it for PS4 at gamestop instead if the PC port is bad till i found out it doesnt come out till the 9th. I went back home logged on again and saw more positive reviews now and learned that once you finish installing you must restart the computer. I bought the game and hoped for the best and ive been playing it for more than 3 hours now and have not had a single problem. Sure the frames are locked at 30 but you cant really tell and doesnt bother me. The graphics do feel kinda cheated since this is PC but whatever its still such an amazing game and fun.\n\n10/10\n\nUpdate:\nOk after 10 hours i ffinally beat the game.

No more annoying counter stuns, instead it works like a knockback to buy yourself some extra time .  The drive type is gone,  and so is instant awakening. Instead it's saved as a last resort once you're below 20% hp\nYou also have the ability to swap places with your 2 supports of your choice giving the battle much more of a dynamic feeling.\n\nHOWEVER. the game is poorly optimized and tends to crash rather often if you like me tend to tab in and out of the game alot doing other stuffs while queing for a match.\nIt also have FPS drops whenever you have awakenings that give you a susano or other big particle effects and models.\nEspecially if your support also have big awakenins, expect atleast a 5-10 FPS drop.\n\nit's hard to recommend this game  considering the performance issues the game has at point, but if you get the game to run smoothly it looks amazing, it feels amazing, it plays amazing.  easily the best STORM in the series.\n\n\n","February 6","true","28.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Fantastic graphics, amazingly presented story mode, bringing us right to the conclusion of the Naruto story, tonns of content, new battle mechanics allowing for longer and more immersive battles, with a functioning online mode which is comfortable to use as you can play free battles whilst waiting for the opponent. The soundtrack is, as usual, stunning. The new mechanics bear intelligence in their implementation which, as I can clearly see, is going to keep me at play for so much longer. The season pass content seems to exceed expectation and keep the game fresh and give even more ground to be excited for in the future.\nI have not experienced any technical issues with the game, and thus will not subtract any marks from the game for that.

The game itself isn't bad, but the optimization and graphic options are the main reason for the negativity towards Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.\n\nYES, it does suck that so many people are being affected by this and;\nYES, CC2 should really be doing something about this.\nBUT, I'll be review the game itself, not the graphical errors. (I know that it is part of the game too. I fixed my input lag, and frame drop by restarting my PC after downloading it.)\n\nNow, for the main review:\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (Rating against all other storm games) and here's why.\n\nSTORY 9/10 - The story is awesome, simply put. It closely follows the anime and manga, though there are some things that never happened (Various fights put in the game). There was screenshots of the anime that was injected into the story cinematic scenes. This really helped with making you feel like you were watching an anime. The in-game cinematic scenes were well done as well. The animations did feel like they were 'stiff' and the facial expressions were awesome as well (some kinda' look weird at some points but only very, very rarely). My only problem with the story is there was almost too much cinematics. There were several points were I was getting restless and decided just to skip ahead.\n\nCHARACTER ROSTER 9/10 - This is their biggest roster yet, so of course it isn't bad. With that being said, I do hope they add some other characters that the community is asking for (AKA: Toneri Ōtsutsuki, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki). Other than that, the roster is good enough for me. EXCEPT for Adult Naruto and Adult Sasuke being DLC. *SPOILER* They are shown off for a moment at the last cut scene. Why would you put them there and then make them DLC?\n\nMULTIPLAYER 7/10 - Now, I haven't played too much multiplayer but I would like to. Currently I have played 10 matches (won 8 lost 2) and only 3 have them have truly been enjoyable. It seems that this game suffers the same as the other Storm games. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems everyone I face (save for 3 opponents. One of which I lost too.) is playing from the very outskirts of the country with 1 bar of Wi-Fi from a McDonald's a couple miles away. The lag is God Awful and the micro-stuttering is worse. It's hard to time out your dodges, counter-attacks and attacks when you are two seconds behind the other person.\n\nCOMBAT 9.5/10 - I find this to be the most satisfying part of this game. The combat feels fast paced and flows incredibly well. The character switch is amazing and not as 'cheesy' as I thought it was initially going to be. Yes, I'm sure some players can find ways to abuse this mechanic like everything else, but I for one love it. I also really enjoy that you can switch between various ninjutsus on some characters, as well as some Ultimates on a few. The only reason I give it a 9.5/10 instead of a 10/10 is because you can't wall run. Unless I'm completely missing something, and I hope I am, the only wall running I've seen in in Story Mode. In that, it only happened 3 separate times. Why would you put this in and not put it in multiplayer or at least free battle mode?\n\nAll-in-all, awesome edition to the Storm series and a great finish. It's a shame they have optimizations problems at launch, and hopefully they fix it (doubtful but I'm hopeful).","February 6","true","105.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I own Storm 2, Generations, Storm 3 and Revolution on my Xbox, and purchased Rev and 3 on Steam. The fighting in this runs so smooth, even locked at 30fps, every hit you land on a character really feels powerful and hell, they even edited some older characters combinations which was a nice treat. I never really noticed the 30fps, runs smooth, people get too upset on that in my opinion.\n\nThe story mode finally takes itself away from the free roaming around the Ninja land (it was seriously getting dry and annoying) and integrated it into Adventure Mode (which I have yet to try).\n\nMy first online match was super laggy even though the connection was strong which was odd.\n\nA lot of people are having issues with the game where it runs at 1fps, last thing we need is another Batman Arkham Knight. I hope they fix that issue sooner than Warner Brothers did.\n\nFantastic game, cannot wait to try out every new character.\n\n\nComputer Specs\n\nAMD FX-6300 Vishera 6-Core 3.5 GHz\nMSI GeForce GTX 970\nHyperX Savage 8GB","February 4","true","17.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Believe it... Anyway, A lot of pop up command actions, a lot of O-M-F-G artful attacks and so forth. I didn't know what to expect coming into this, but jesus there is a LOT to do on this game. If you are a fan of the game and really want a large selection of characters to play, go for it. If you are looking for a Top of the line, epic fighter. Do Not Go For It. This game is great, easy to play, very beautiful in an anime sense. I give it a hard 8.5/10 for a fighting game, a 9/10 for visual sexiness and a 10/10 for all the effort and all the game play. This will be a game in which you will spend many hours playing, for either the simple battle system with A.I., Friends, or some random girl (Guy In Real Life) online battle play. Again do not go for this game because you want a hardcore fighter, Street fighter/Mortal Kombat/Hello Kitty Island Adventure are for more of your suited juggling taste. :D Good game, overall 9.1/10!","February 6","true","23.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaiiboraka/recommended/349040/","kaiiboraka","Kaiiboraka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaiiboraka/","262 products in account","Man. I friggin’ love this game so much. The story is incredible, and it's delivered so well! And mechanically, it’s AMAZING! They fixed so many things, and expanded upon/balanced so many systems, and it’s all just sO MUCH FUN AAHHH!\n\nDisclaimer: This will be very, very long. So TL;DR 10/10 Best Naruto game in existence.\n\nFor the most part I will be comparing it to Storm 3. I have Revolution, but I barely touched it as it did not continue the story.\n\nPrior to this coming out, I binged through all of Ninja Storm 3 for the story recap, and then when I switched to this one... not only does it continue the story, but it delivers it WAAYYY better than any other Storm game. The pacing is phenomenal. They even usually save the results screens for AFTER the cutscenes, to stop from breaking pacing/immersion. As before there are a few different types of missions: Free Battles, Boss Battles, Mob Battles, etc. Many of the missions have unique mechanics, like Wall-running fights. Quick Time Events make a return, but they remain optional and reward you with a little extra back-story flavour and higher mission rankings if you do well.\n\nThere are some new mechanics that aren't just in the story! Environmental effects, and Armor Breaking. They're both fairly self-explanatory, but let me give you some examples. Kakashi has his Lightning Blade jutsu. If he charges/casts this while standing in water, the water will be electrified, and any opponents standing in it will take damage. Casting a water jutsu while tanding in water empowers it, etc. These environmental effects are only disabled for Ranked matches online. As for armor breaking, after a certain amount of damage, usually with a lot of little hits as opposed to a fewer number of stronger attacks like jutsus, the opponent's costume will take damage, and part of their outer armor/clothing will break off. This mechanic works a lot like Super Smash Bros. 4's Rage mechanic. In that game, the higher your damage, the more knock-back you'll receive on consecutive attacks. However, what's unique to SSB4, is that once you pass a certain damage threshold, your own attacks will ALSO start to deal more knockback. Storm games don't have severely important knockback mechanics like Smash, but they do have damage. When your armor is broken, you will both take and deal slightly more damage than you did before.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT ALL! Storm 4 is even MORE like Smash than you realize! A new feature/system are 3-round fights! We've always had 1 round fights before -- when one person's lifebar runs out, the other person wins. Now, it's like Stocks in Smash. In games like Street Fighter, the game completely resets between rounds, with only EX gauge carrying between. This is more like Smash because the survivor retains the amount of health they had when they won the first round.\n\nThat was worded weird so let me continue my Smash analogy. In SSB4, online "ranked" (For Glory, as its known), it's a 1v1 match where both players have 2 stocks (read: lives) apiece. As soon as a player loses both stocks, the other one wins. Damage persists between stocks. In Ninja Storm 4, you can see a pair of Round indicators by each player's health bar. Pretending these are like Stocks in Smash makes perfect sense.\n\nDodging/Defense has some new additions. Previously, you could dodge essentially by double jumping in a certain direction. The downside of this was having to actually jump first, which meant you had to do it way ahead of time due to the startup. Now you can hold the guard button and you'll immediately dodge in the direction you move, making it very much like Super Smash Bros. (Which is a very good thing)! Additionally, there is now a Counter/Parry mechanic. While you're guarding if you hit X/Square at the moment you are attacked, you'll cancel out of their attack and push your opponent far away from you, at the cost of temporarily reducing your maximum chakra. This cost is incurred whether successful or not.\n\nAssists! "Team" matches that actually emphasize the "TEAM"! On the Character Select Screen, you can see a small icon in the top left corner of their character portrait. This icon indicates which kind of Support action that character has. In the past, all characters could be Attack, Defend, or Balance style of assists. Now, there are a bunch of kinds.\n\nStrikeback: after knock back, opponent bounces back before your feet, allows you to extend your combo or UJ.\nCover Fire: if you use chakra shuriken, your support will too\nCarge Assist: Allows you to charge chakra faster\nBreak Guard: Support assist you with combos while attacking\nCharge Guard: Support covers you while charging chakra\nSecret Technique Substitute: Support will take a super for you, if it would have hit you\nDash Cut: Support will cover you, when the opponent dashes at you\n\nEvery character with their own slot on the CSS always has just a single one of these. These Support abilities start to activate when your Storm gauge is at least halfway full.\n\nOh yeah, the Storm Gauge! This is like the old Team Gauge in the top left. It now sits below your Chakra gauge towards the middle. It fills up as you take damage, like a Street Fighter 4 Ultra, and as you call in your assists to attack. They also fill as you SWITCH LEADERS MID COMBO! You heard me right, folks~! Picking your 3 character team means picking THREE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AS! And NOT just a character with 2 assists!\n\nSo each assist's portrait fills up over time after you use it. In-game this is referred to as the Assist Gauge. Switching leaders consumes only HALF of the cooldown of an assist. You can switch characters mid-combo by moving the Right analog stick in the direction (Left/Right) of the assist in the corner. E.g., if I was Naruto, and Sakura was LB and Sasuke was RB, I would move the Right Analog stick to the right if I wanted to Switch to Sasuke. You can do this at any time so long as the individual assist gauge is at least halfway full.\n\nSo, as I said, switching characters can be done mid-combo, which translates to it functioning the exact same as a chakra-dash-cancel combo extender! It's amazing! You can even do it in the air!\n\nThere are a couple of other mechanics that involve your team, as well. When the Storm gauge is FULL, you can do one of two things with it. The first is Linked Awakenings. So Awakenings are just as before: it's the Naruto universe equivalent of going Super Saiyan. To enter Awakening mode is the same as it was in the past. You need to be below a certain health threshold, and then you overcharge your Chakra, and you transform. If your Storm Gauge is full when you Awaken, ALL THREE of your characters will Awaken at once!\n\nThe other way to use your Storm gauge is similar to the way team attacks worked in the past. Once full, you Chakra Load THREE times and Attack. This will send out each of your teammates one at a time at chakra dash speed to attempt to connect with the opponent. (doesn't cost anything if you miss; you can try again) One of two things can happen. In most current cases, especially with mixed teams of unrelated characters, the Attack that ensues will be identical to past Storm games where your assists would juggle your opponent and your current main character will unleash their ult. However, if you have certain team compositions, they'll actually do LINKED TEAM COMBO ULTIMATES! E.g., Naruto + Minato + Kushina will do a super-powered FAMILY RASENGAN! Or having Neji, Hinata, and Hanabi Hyuga will also bring out Lord Hiashi and all FOUR of them will go nuts with their Byakugan & Taijutsu combo!\n\nIT'S AWESOME!\n\nMan. HUGE Roster, new/improved mechanics, great visuals and sound, fantastic story and pacing, lots of modes and side things to do...  I love this game to death.\n\n\n10/10 best Naruto game in existence.

No flashy cutscenes and no spoken dialogue, but it does expand on character relationships a bit while exploring the ninja world\n\nNegatives:\n-Boring combat system without much diversity between characters\n-New Counter system seems underwhelingly weak right now\n-You can no longer buy clips of character Ultimates\n\nPC Specific Problems As of Right Now:\n-Lack of graphics options\n-Only two resolutions: 720p and 1080p\n-Must change the config.ini file to change V-Sync\n-Story Mode cutscene dialogue only goes through the left speaker\n-Not really a problem, but being 30fps locked is a little sad","February 5","true","34.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game itself isn't bad, but the optimization and graphic options are the main reason for the negativity towards Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.\n\nYES, it does suck that so many people are being affected by this and;\nYES, CC2 should really be doing something about this.\nBUT, I'll be review the game itself, not the graphical errors. (I know that it is part of the game too. I fixed my input lag, and frame drop by restarting my PC after downloading it.)\n\nNow, for the main review:\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (Rating against all other storm games) and here's why.\n\nSTORY 9/10 - The story is awesome, simply put. It closely follows the anime and manga, though there are some things that never happened (Various fights put in the game). There was screenshots of the anime that was injected into the story cinematic scenes. This really helped with making you feel like you were watching an anime. The in-game cinematic scenes were well done as well. The animations did feel like they were 'stiff' and the facial expressions were awesome as well (some kinda' look weird at some points but only very, very rarely). My only problem with the story is there was almost too much cinematics. There were several points were I was getting restless and decided just to skip ahead.\n\nCHARACTER ROSTER 9/10 - This is their biggest roster yet, so of course it isn't bad. With that being said, I do hope they add some other characters that the community is asking for (AKA: Toneri Ōtsutsuki, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki). Other than that, the roster is good enough for me. EXCEPT for Adult Naruto and Adult Sasuke being DLC. *SPOILER* They are shown off for a moment at the last cut scene. Why would you put them there and then make them DLC?\n\nMULTIPLAYER 7/10 - Now, I haven't played too much multiplayer but I would like to. Currently I have played 10 matches (won 8 lost 2) and only 3 have them have truly been enjoyable. It seems that this game suffers the same as the other Storm games. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems everyone I face (save for 3 opponents. One of which I lost too.) is playing from the very outskirts of the country with 1 bar of Wi-Fi from a McDonald's a couple miles away. The lag is God Awful and the micro-stuttering is worse. It's hard to time out your dodges, counter-attacks and attacks when you are two seconds behind the other person.\n\nCOMBAT 9.5/10 - I find this to be the most satisfying part of this game. The combat feels fast paced and flows incredibly well. The character switch is amazing and not as 'cheesy' as I thought it was initially going to be. Yes, I'm sure some players can find ways to abuse this mechanic like everything else, but I for one love it. I also really enjoy that you can switch between various ninjutsus on some characters, as well as some Ultimates on a few. The only reason I give it a 9.5/10 instead of a 10/10 is because you can't wall run. Unless I'm completely missing something, and I hope I am, the only wall running I've seen in in Story Mode. In that, it only happened 3 separate times. Why would you put this in and not put it in multiplayer or at least free battle mode?\n\nAll-in-all, awesome edition to the Storm series and a great finish. It's a shame they have optimizations problems at launch, and hopefully they fix it (doubtful but I'm hopeful).","February 6","true","105.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I own Storm 2, Generations, Storm 3 and Revolution on my Xbox, and purchased Rev and 3 on Steam. The fighting in this runs so smooth, even locked at 30fps, every hit you land on a character really feels powerful and hell, they even edited some older characters combinations which was a nice treat. I never really noticed the 30fps, runs smooth, people get too upset on that in my opinion.\n\nThe story mode finally takes itself away from the free roaming around the Ninja land (it was seriously getting dry and annoying) and integrated it into Adventure Mode (which I have yet to try).\n\nMy first online match was super laggy even though the connection was strong which was odd.\n\nA lot of people are having issues with the game where it runs at 1fps, last thing we need is another Batman Arkham Knight. I hope they fix that issue sooner than Warner Brothers did.\n\nFantastic game, cannot wait to try out every new character.\n\n\nComputer Specs\n\nAMD FX-6300 Vishera 6-Core 3.5 GHz\nMSI GeForce GTX 970\nHyperX Savage 8GB","February 4","true","17.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game itself isn't bad, but the optimization and graphic options are the main reason for the negativity towards Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.\n\nYES, it does suck that so many people are being affected by this and;\nYES, CC2 should really be doing something about this.\nBUT, I'll be review the game itself, not the graphical errors. (I know that it is part of the game too. I fixed my input lag, and frame drop by restarting my PC after downloading it.)\n\nNow, for the main review:\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (Rating against all other storm games) and here's why.\n\nSTORY 9/10 - The story is awesome, simply put. It closely follows the anime and manga, though there are some things that never happened (Various fights put in the game). There was screenshots of the anime that was injected into the story cinematic scenes. This really helped with making you feel like you were watching an anime. The in-game cinematic scenes were well done as well. The animations did feel like they were 'stiff' and the facial expressions were awesome as well (some kinda' look weird at some points but only very, very rarely). My only problem with the story is there was almost too much cinematics. There were several points were I was getting restless and decided just to skip ahead.\n\nCHARACTER ROSTER 9/10 - This is their biggest roster yet, so of course it isn't bad. With that being said, I do hope they add some other characters that the community is asking for (AKA: Toneri Ōtsutsuki, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki). Other than that, the roster is good enough for me. EXCEPT for Adult Naruto and Adult Sasuke being DLC. *SPOILER* They are shown off for a moment at the last cut scene. Why would you put them there and then make them DLC?\n\nMULTIPLAYER 7/10 - Now, I haven't played too much multiplayer but I would like to. Currently I have played 10 matches (won 8 lost 2) and only 3 have them have truly been enjoyable. It seems that this game suffers the same as the other Storm games. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems everyone I face (save for 3 opponents. One of which I lost too.) is playing from the very outskirts of the country with 1 bar of Wi-Fi from a McDonald's a couple miles away. The lag is God Awful and the micro-stuttering is worse. It's hard to time out your dodges, counter-attacks and attacks when you are two seconds behind the other person.\n\nCOMBAT 9.5/10 - I find this to be the most satisfying part of this game. The combat feels fast paced and flows incredibly well. The character switch is amazing and not as 'cheesy' as I thought it was initially going to be. Yes, I'm sure some players can find ways to abuse this mechanic like everything else, but I for one love it. I also really enjoy that you can switch between various ninjutsus on some characters, as well as some Ultimates on a few. The only reason I give it a 9.5/10 instead of a 10/10 is because you can't wall run. Unless I'm completely missing something, and I hope I am, the only wall running I've seen in in Story Mode. In that, it only happened 3 separate times. Why would you put this in and not put it in multiplayer or at least free battle mode?\n\nAll-in-all, awesome edition to the Storm series and a great finish. It's a shame they have optimizations problems at launch, and hopefully they fix it (doubtful but I'm hopeful).","February 6","true","105.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I own Storm 2, Generations, Storm 3 and Revolution on my Xbox, and purchased Rev and 3 on Steam. The fighting in this runs so smooth, even locked at 30fps, every hit you land on a character really feels powerful and hell, they even edited some older characters combinations which was a nice treat. I never really noticed the 30fps, runs smooth, people get too upset on that in my opinion.\n\nThe story mode finally takes itself away from the free roaming around the Ninja land (it was seriously getting dry and annoying) and integrated it into Adventure Mode (which I have yet to try).\n\nMy first online match was super laggy even though the connection was strong which was odd.\n\nA lot of people are having issues with the game where it runs at 1fps, last thing we need is another Batman Arkham Knight. I hope they fix that issue sooner than Warner Brothers did.\n\nFantastic game, cannot wait to try out every new character.\n\n\nComputer Specs\n\nAMD FX-6300 Vishera 6-Core 3.5 GHz\nMSI GeForce GTX 970\nHyperX Savage 8GB","February 4","true","17.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I was able to keep my progress this time.\n3rd time - crashed after I finished 3 missions and switched windows (I was in fullscreen mode)\n\nWhile it is really easy to really rage and act like a child about the hiccups this game is getting, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n1. We are PC Master Race. We get way more options but it isn't like we aren't used to hiccups like this. That's why we are better, we understand what comes with the platform. When they fix this game, it will run flawlessly. Which leads me to #2.\n2. This is the first day the game came out. From what I can remember, it is the first time this released along-side the console releases. My local Gamestop told me I can't even get my copy until tuesday (2-9-2016). I am under the impression this game came out even before the console versions this time around. They can get around to patching it, it will be a very good game.\n\nIn it's current state (Day 1), I cannot recommend it for the crashing. Check back in the a week though because:\n\n3. Within 10 minutes of playing, it is hands down the best Ultimate Ninja Storm game to come out since the original.

No more annoying counter stuns, instead it works like a knockback to buy yourself some extra time .  The drive type is gone,  and so is instant awakening. Instead it's saved as a last resort once you're below 20% hp\nYou also have the ability to swap places with your 2 supports of your choice giving the battle much more of a dynamic feeling.\n\nHOWEVER. the game is poorly optimized and tends to crash rather often if you like me tend to tab in and out of the game alot doing other stuffs while queing for a match.\nIt also have FPS drops whenever you have awakenings that give you a susano or other big particle effects and models.\nEspecially if your support also have big awakenins, expect atleast a 5-10 FPS drop.\n\nit's hard to recommend this game  considering the performance issues the game has at point, but if you get the game to run smoothly it looks amazing, it feels amazing, it plays amazing.  easily the best STORM in the series.\n\n\n","February 6","true","28.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Definitely worth the money.\nFor those that have read the manga and know how everything ends, you will be astonished by the beauty of the animation. Gameplay speaks for itself if you have played the other Storm games.\nStill have yet to try Adventure mode and Online battles, looks very promising.\nNo fillers whatsoever, which was surprisingly great.\nPeople that are complaining about the game being slow or bad, you are the only reason why it doesn't work.

After quite a few fantastic hous with no tehnical problems, I was courious to see the reviews for the game. I am a Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm fanatic (these games are the main the reason why I bought my PS3 in the first place) and I couldn't believe to see that the overal score for the games in 52% mixed... After I read the reviews I understood that there are tehnical problems, fps related ones that affect other people's performance. Myself, not a single problem this far, so I want to say to everyone to give this game a shot. It's fantastic! The graphics, the music, the roster of characters, the story, the boss battles and many other great features exist in this game. I also saw that some people told that they completed the story in less than 5 hours. Well, the story may not be very long, but it is the longest in the entire franchise with many great battles to enjoy. With the cutscenes which are loyal to the anime, the story lasts more the 5 hours. And then you have a lot of things to do if you want to get all the achivements. (replay story battles, tournaments, league, survival) You will get your money's worth, believe me.","February 6","true","32.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously, devs, this is a 2016 PC game. This has absolutely no excuse. The good thing is that the game is fluent enough that it doesn't feel like other 30 fps games.\n- Graphical issues for some AMD cards and stuff, will be fixed by patches and stuff.\n- The removal of support characters instead of fleshing them out as playable. This is the last Storm game and we still don't have Kurenai and Anko as playable characters - what the hell?\n- Toxic online community. Expect ragequits, spamming Deidara+Tobi combos and angry russians shouting at you in Russian.\n\nAlso, the initial bad reviews this game has were due to people trying to play it on their integrated graphics cards and GT 620s and also due to the legitimate optimization issues it had on some goods cards. I've been running it on a GTX 660 and I've encountered no frame-drops whatsoever - solid 30 fps everytime.","February 16","true","226.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Thus making online gameplay a 50/50 chance... or the fact that its still peer to peer hosting...\n\nOr do i "Recommend it" to friends because of the beautiful aesthetic visuals that are a clear upgrade from the previous installments. Scene re-enactments are exciting for any fan of the series and whats better is the new gameplay effects really put you right where your favorite characters are, in battle.\n\nThe immersive audio (NO not the hidious audio bug from launch) that puts you righ in the action from Jutsu explosions to kunai reflection.\n\nHell even adventure mode has gotten a bit of an upgrade, though not as much as i would like.\nYou are able to move MUCH faster between areas not just in terms of player speed but a new fast travel option has been implimented.\n\n\n\nOverall and clearly i recommend the game.\n\nMaybe not for its online game play mainly because of high anxiety gamers who only use 3-4 players. (Last Sasuke, Madara(AnyMadara), Obito Sage and Sage Hashirama) basically you cannot really have fun with this game unless your interested in being hard core. There is no chance you will get a game with someone and just be able to pick anyone and just have fun, win or lose.\n\nWhat i mean by that is Lets say i join a Ranked OR PLAYER MATCH looking to HAVE FUN, win or lose, so i choose a team like Shikimaru, Ino and Asuma... then my opponent is either using Last Sasuke, Madara, Obito, Mineto or Sage Hashi..... You WILL NOT get ANY games for FUN EVER unless you add players on your own and tell them your not interestin in Trying HARD. (By try hard i mean i play to my full potential but i DO NOT choose OP players on purpose ALL THE TIME, FOREVER... i mix it up. i HAVE FUN with this game.)\n\nI love this game when i can play with relaxed individuals who do not take winning or losing as the end all be all.\n\nOnline is fun dont get me wrong ( I have no personal issues playing) from but so many people have funcionability issues and internet incompatibility that when they get online and try to play others without any issues... well... its like putting one dead battery in a remote that has one fresh battery...","February 28","true","97.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

As a fan of the anime and manga, I expected lots of intense action from what’s been presented as the final game of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, and to its credit, Storm 4 delivers. The characters and over-the-top battles look and feel great, and the story pays off in a satisfying way. On the other hand, even the best combat system in the world would be wasted if there are no worthy opponents to be found.\n\nThat's not to say that this combat is the best, but it is pretty strong. Fights are fast and fierce, and are treated like major events by way of plenty of cinematic camera angles and powerful jutsu moves at your disposal. The controls are simple and the most responsive of the Storm games to date. What I liked most, however, was the ability to switch between your active fighter and two support characters on the fly by moving the right analog stick. This let me use my characters for both active and support roles, and didn’t limit them to one task in a fight. In one battle, I was able launch a series of punches with Hinata before calling for an assist from Naruto to deal more damage, and then switching to Hashirama Senju to recharge my energy fast for a  follow-up jutsu attack.","April 2","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So compared to those, I found this one far more enjoyable.\n\n\nPROS\n____\nThe game's combat is intense and fun, even sorta tactical compared to games like budokai which is just non-stop spamming the hit button till your opponent is dead.\n\nA LOT of characters to choose from, over 100 in all, and each have different abilities you have to pick from to go into battle with, which makes planning ahead of time and careful customization very important.\n\nYou can do single 1v1 battles, or 1v2, 1v3, 2v2, 2v3, etc. Letting you mix and match your favorite characters from the show.\n\n\n\nCONS\n____\nThe game's story mode is FAR too short for a $50 game. So if you are hoping to get invested into a good story for a few days or weeks/months, then this is the wrong game. This game is simply intended for passing time, and is something you probably wont sit down in a single session for more than 3-4 hours at a time.\n\nI personally felt like some of the characters need tweaking as they are underpowered vs main characters, but this could be simply because I don't understand how to correctly play them.\n\nI felt like some of the animations could have been better, but this is subjective.","March 22","true","55.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Stable framerate, awesome battles, and the graphics were great. The only Naruto I've ever played was Revolution, so I was really impressed with Storm 4. I love it already. The only problem I have with it is the 30 FPS lock. Seems slow moving on 30 FPS, and I hope they will up it to 60. Other than that, the game has been out for LESS THAN 48 HOURS.

As a fan of the anime and manga, I expected lots of intense action from what’s been presented as the final game of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, and to its credit, Storm 4 delivers. The characters and over-the-top battles look and feel great, and the story pays off in a satisfying way. On the other hand, even the best combat system in the world would be wasted if there are no worthy opponents to be found.\n\nThat's not to say that this combat is the best, but it is pretty strong. Fights are fast and fierce, and are treated like major events by way of plenty of cinematic camera angles and powerful jutsu moves at your disposal. The controls are simple and the most responsive of the Storm games to date. What I liked most, however, was the ability to switch between your active fighter and two support characters on the fly by moving the right analog stick. This let me use my characters for both active and support roles, and didn’t limit them to one task in a fight. In one battle, I was able launch a series of punches with Hinata before calling for an assist from Naruto to deal more damage, and then switching to Hashirama Senju to recharge my energy fast for a  follow-up jutsu attack.","April 2","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Looks like they also finally got some moderators for the Steam discussions as well.\n\nIf the game still runs at lower than 30fps for you, you can always download the mod Tormunds made even though it's for the older version of this game. If you want to play with anyone you will also have to send them that mod as well. You can always rename NSUNS4.exe to keep the old EXE so you don't have to re-verify your cache every time.\n\nAfter about a week, everything seems to be sorted out finally.\n\nNow onto the actual review:\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10\nBeautiful 3D Animu graphics. Definitely an upgrade compared to previous games with the models. They also added in more particle effects and armor/weapon breaks as well. Finally the fanboys can take off the female casts' clothes by playing the game! (Oh yeah, and the fire ballz look better. If you're into that I guess.)\n\nSound - 7/10\nSound effects are not really that different, but they added/changed a few here and there. Whenever you have the quality set too high in the sound driver manager, the audio becomes ♥♥♥♥. So yeah. Don't do that. (And sometimes it's set to a higher setting as default. Just use 44100Hz.) They fixed the bug that made my right ear feel alone. He finally has a friend!\n\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nThey added more gameplay to this game overall. You can now actually use your supports as regular characters or use them as backups without having to change anything. They also added a new 3-round system that can make a salty loser stop talking ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOnline - 9/10\nThe network mode is Peer to Peer connections, so the match is dependent on both players and there's no middle-man server to stop either of you. I haven't personally used the match-making because I don't like to fight randoms, but I heard it got better by a bit. The only time it will lag when both people use a good connection is if one of them is experiencing FPS drops. Nothing irregular here. (And stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about input lag when you're a red bar pls. Also turn off your mics pls.)\n\nReplayability - 10/10\nThere's a lot to do in this game. You have the 5-hour long story mode, adventure mode, and a whole bunch of Free Battle/Online modes to play with. With a cast of over 100 characters and a large amount of stages, there's a lot to experiment with if you're like me and love to play as all of the characters. Also it's just ♥♥♥♥ing fun so y'know that works too.","February 4","true","79.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

So people go straight to the negetive reviews. Others compare it to other Storm games, so straight to the negetive reviews.\n\nAs for me, the game was great. Stable framerate, awesome battles, and the graphics were great. The only Naruto I've ever played was Revolution, so I was really impressed with Storm 4. I love it already. The only problem I have with it is the 30 FPS lock. Seems slow moving on 30 FPS, and I hope they will up it to 60. Other than that, the game has been out for LESS THAN 48 HOURS. People need to stop being wimps and let them have at least a week, before you complain.","February 5","true","54.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

Looks like they also finally got some moderators for the Steam discussions as well.\n\nIf the game still runs at lower than 30fps for you, you can always download the mod Tormunds made even though it's for the older version of this game. If you want to play with anyone you will also have to send them that mod as well. You can always rename NSUNS4.exe to keep the old EXE so you don't have to re-verify your cache every time.\n\nAfter about a week, everything seems to be sorted out finally.\n\nNow onto the actual review:\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10\nBeautiful 3D Animu graphics. Definitely an upgrade compared to previous games with the models. They also added in more particle effects and armor/weapon breaks as well. Finally the fanboys can take off the female casts' clothes by playing the game! (Oh yeah, and the fire ballz look better. If you're into that I guess.)\n\nSound - 7/10\nSound effects are not really that different, but they added/changed a few here and there. Whenever you have the quality set too high in the sound driver manager, the audio becomes ♥♥♥♥. So yeah. Don't do that. (And sometimes it's set to a higher setting as default. Just use 44100Hz.) They fixed the bug that made my right ear feel alone. He finally has a friend!\n\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nThey added more gameplay to this game overall. You can now actually use your supports as regular characters or use them as backups without having to change anything. They also added a new 3-round system that can make a salty loser stop talking ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOnline - 9/10\nThe network mode is Peer to Peer connections, so the match is dependent on both players and there's no middle-man server to stop either of you. I haven't personally used the match-making because I don't like to fight randoms, but I heard it got better by a bit. The only time it will lag when both people use a good connection is if one of them is experiencing FPS drops. Nothing irregular here. (And stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about input lag when you're a red bar pls. Also turn off your mics pls.)\n\nReplayability - 10/10\nThere's a lot to do in this game. You have the 5-hour long story mode, adventure mode, and a whole bunch of Free Battle/Online modes to play with. With a cast of over 100 characters and a large amount of stages, there's a lot to experiment with if you're like me and love to play as all of the characters. Also it's just ♥♥♥♥ing fun so y'know that works too.","February 4","true","79.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillcap/recommended/349040/","skillcap","SK1LLC4P","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillcap/","178 products in account","update:\nMany of the bad reviews you see are from the initial release where many people had performance issues and haven't bothered to change them, I never ran into these issues and I am not using a very powerful PC at all. (phenom 3 with an unlocked 4th core and a 7950). The game never has any fps drops for me, there can be stuttering in multiplayer though. This is because the game doesn't use servers but a peer-to-peer connection, meaning both players basically are hosting so if one has terrible internet both players suffer, luckily you can see the other players connection before you start a match (even with ranked mode) so you can just decide to not play with people with a bad connection. There is also the issue of not being able to mute the mics of other players, which is very unfortunate. Even with these thing the game is still a blast and I totally recommend it.\n\noriginal review:\nRight off the bat you may notice that many reviews are complaining about the 30 fps cap, while I agree that it sucks I will say its a good 30fps, let me explain. Frame times are really good for such a low framerate and its a steady output, which means input lag is very low and the way the animations are put together it appears much smoother than it is. This coming from a guy who thinks anything less than 140fps in CS:GO is a failure. the gameplay feels fluid despite the cap and its lots of fun overall and differs a lot from other fighting games. The battles are skill based and feel epic and fast paced, there's is a lot of variety in gameplay and characters, but the story mode starts late in the storyline so if you aren't familiar with the Naruto storyline you will be completely lost in story mode. The game is a lot of fun, and I totally recommend it.\n\nI will admit there is a bit of a learning curve if you aren't into that kind of thing, but Its an overall great game I rate it 9/10, definately worth every penny and I would buy it again.","March 9","true","61.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game series (1-4) would suffice perfectly if you have missed certain parts of Naruto or the Naruto Shippuden anime.\n\nThe game continues right where Naruto ultimate ninja storm 3 left off and completes the whole anime to the very end.\n\nThe fighting and story cinematics are amazing. the quick time events are great, the gameplay mechanics are improved, the artwork and level design is phenomenal. (Cell Shaded Graphics)\n\nSo far 50hrs + into the game, collected all the achievements and I still keep coming back to play a few rounds.\n\nThe only gripe I have against the game is its Online mode, kinda crappy but nevertheless, the game was great.\n\nLast but not the least, I would highly recommend a controller for the game.\n\nSo, if you do have a controller, your computer specs are optimum and you're a Naruto fan, all I can do is ask you,\n" Why don't you have the game yet?

Another off point is that 75% of the game is composed of quick time events and button mashing I can't tell you how many times I have clicked the o button(using dualshock 4 controller to play). The button mashing wasn't the only thing that was repetitive the combat system comprises of once offensive jutsu and then spamming o with your analog stick up or down(or to the right or to the left) no real diversity as every character has this.

This solution worked for me so far, and dispite the 30fps everone has been complaining, I dont really see a difference, as I am using a laptop (GTX 870).\n\nEdit: the QTE is flawed in terms of its scoring system, sometimes I can almost press it at the last moment and getting a 4 star, and sometimes even when I pressed it at like the middle it gives me a 2 star","February 5","true","67.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

In my opinion if you really wanted to play this, the FPS wouldn't matter. Even though I would've liked 60FPS too, 30FPS is perfectly playabe.\n\nYes it's 30FPS, just like every other Storm games. It doesn't hinder the gameplay or the story. The low framerates issue that people are having are probably due to their rig. I've been running this for 7 hours with a solid 30FPS.\n\n----Actual review----\n\nNow for the actual game, I've been only playing the story so far. In my opinion it's much better than in Storm 3, instead of going through pointless adventure and eventually get some story fights, it's just a timeline that follows the actual end of the Shippuuden story. I also feel that they managed to re-create the content really well.\n\nI'm about 75% in the story currently, the fights so far were really awesome and the visual effects were stunning. The combat feels responsive and feels the best out of all the Storm games.\n\nThe soundtrack is as good as ever, fit the mood perfectly during cut-scenes or fights.\n\nI will update this later once I get to play the adventure mode and the online mode.","February 4","true","10.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But let's be honest the game was delayed  for almost 6 months fps is absolutely terrible on the PC. The online part of this game is even worse players can use modded characters online so if you happen to do a rank match and they have a modded character your odds of winning are one in 1 million. Almost forgot about the standstill animation that they put into the game. Makes every part of the story mode that's not the epic fight look like trash And the DLC absolutely garbage sound ninja five come on they should  have just left them as support characters. everyone's  so far into the series that they don't even matter anymore. Gold and silver brothers would've been an awesome pic for characters. As well as The seven mist ninja swordsman.  This game had so much potential but as every naruto game   Fails to impress it's fans-- and 80+ characters lmao most of those characters are just copies there should be no need to play has five different sasuke or naruto.

Overall the game works just fine, but this is the PC platform so expectations are higher.  Plays just as well if not better than the PS4 demo and the Storm games have always been 30fps so it wasn't a deal breaker for me and it seems the gameplay is built around this anyway.  Looks great to me, but I realize that this is a fighting game and I don't expect super intense environmental detail and all sorts of other fancy effects.  I'd say it's a decent port if you can run it, if not then you can always refund it.","February 4","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Also i would like to see characters such as Toneri and Momoshiki and aswell "The Last" costumes for everyone one else we see in The Last but let them keep their team jutsu such as the Ino Shika Cho. It would also be cool if there would be a lot more team secret techniques with The Last characters such as a Team 7 ultimate, and having Hinata being in the Hyuga team jutsu in her Last variant. Personally a cool one would be Itachi and Sasuke The Last because of how Sasuke has matured and changed. The reason why im going on about it is because this will be the last storm game and i would like a chance to play as all characters.","February 18","true","63.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Bought it anyway and had some frame rate drops on 1920*1080 setting but was fine on the lower res. Games been updated and i can play it on the 1920 res without framerate drops.\n\nOther than the its a fun game plays very similarly to 3 except instead of having instant awakening you can switch to your team characters. Many characters play the same as the other game and few new characters have been added, but i still believe the game is worth it and would reccomend getting it if you like the ultimate ninja series.","February 14","true","15.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Also i would like to see characters such as Toneri and Momoshiki and aswell "The Last" costumes for everyone one else we see in The Last but let them keep their team jutsu such as the Ino Shika Cho. It would also be cool if there would be a lot more team secret techniques with The Last characters such as a Team 7 ultimate, and having Hinata being in the Hyuga team jutsu in her Last variant. Personally a cool one would be Itachi and Sasuke The Last because of how Sasuke has matured and changed. The reason why im going on about it is because this will be the last storm game and i would like a chance to play as all characters.","February 18","true","63.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antihro/recommended/349040/","antihro","Antihero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antihro/","34 products in account","Hey Naruto fans,\n\nI've never written a review for a game before but I felt like I needed to for NS4. I'm a huge Naruto fan, and I've spent hundreds of hours playing Ninja Storm 3 on my 360. I'm writing this review to inform you, a fellow leaf village ninja, on the positives and negatives of this game, the aspects that need to be worked on, and whether or not I think you should buy it right now.\n\nTournaments, endless mode, and ranked were what made NS3 so addicting. I've never focused too much on the campaign's quality or any of the side quests. I already read the manga and watched the anime so I didn't care too much about watching it all over again. The same applies to NS4 - I skipped through most of the cutscenes of the story mode because it was stuff I already knew, but the missions were definitely way more fun than NS3 were. They don't have a lot of walking around, it's strictly fighting, the boss fights were fun, and the ending of the game was superb. But the slideshow style cutscenes seemed like a lazy drawback. The adventure mode is dumb and collections are also a waste of time.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are amazing. I love the new round system and I really enjoy the way the supports have evolved. The characters are fun to play, some are a bit overpowered but balancing doesn't seem like a huge issue at the moment. The new maps are refreshing, and the wall running doesn't seem too useful.\n\nI want to remind you that I did not play Revolutions, so I didn't know that spectator mode had already been removed somewhat from that game. It wasn't until buying NS4 that I realized that they took out the ability to watch your friends play in Endless or in tournaments. That is the biggest flaw with the game right now besides the terrible servers that constantly disconnect you from matches and pit you up against laggy players. CC2 also halved the size of the tournaments and endless matches from 8 players to 4 players. I couldn't believe it when I fought in my first tournament tonight. I immediately went out to see if CC2 planned on fixing this soon and had announced an upcoming patch, but no, apparently Revolutions had already removed spectator mode somewhat and many people had already made a petition to bring it back.\n\n3000 people to be exact. You can sign this petition too here: https://www.change.org/p/bandai-namco-entertainment-cyberconnect2-hiroshi-matsuyama-perfect-the-online-environment-in-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4?recruiter=419566214&utm_source=share_for_starters&utm_medium=copyLink\n\nDespite that, I do recommend this game to naruto fans. It's fun to play with your friends for a little bit, but can get repetitive and boring without spectator mode. You're stuck watching a screen that says "Other players are fighting right now. Please wait." The campaign was good, not amazing, but it did have a solid ending. If you have people over often, or have siblings or friends you can play this with, it's a great deal of fun.\n\nOverall, if I had to give it a rating, it'd be a 7/10. Please watch ShikasCloud's review if you're planning on buying the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L6uOmUnpqs","February 19","true","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The mechanics are awesome and kept the same from ninja storm 3 but with more graphics and dynamics to the mix.

But not all of the cutscenes are like that just some if not most.\n\nAs of now I'll give it a 7/10 since there are couple things need to work out. Hope this review was useful in my perspective!

Some optimization would be great for lower end systems, but honestly I haven't had any crashes or hiccups with the game yet since my system blows past the requirements. The game did initially start up in windowed mode, but I went into the config file to fix just one value. Then I noticed that I can just edit the settings in game. The action and cinematography used during IA in fights adds quite a bit of "oomph" to the gameplay. Played a few matches locally, online, as well as some fights against the computer and the combat feels just as fluid as on the PS4. No lag with controls or lag in online matches, although I did have to turn off the voices since some people don't know their mic is on or just swear at me in twelve different languages. My only complaint is that I'm bad at the game, but I'm having fun losing.\n\nGreat for a Naruto fan (I'm honestly not) or anyone looking for a fun game.

Some optimization would be great for lower end systems, but honestly I haven't had any crashes or hiccups with the game yet since my system blows past the requirements. The game did initially start up in windowed mode, but I went into the config file to fix just one value. Then I noticed that I can just edit the settings in game. The action and cinematography used during IA in fights adds quite a bit of "oomph" to the gameplay. Played a few matches locally, online, as well as some fights against the computer and the combat feels just as fluid as on the PS4. No lag with controls or lag in online matches, although I did have to turn off the voices since some people don't know their mic is on or just swear at me in twelve different languages. My only complaint is that I'm bad at the game, but I'm having fun losing.\n\nGreat for a Naruto fan (I'm honestly not) or anyone looking for a fun game. If your system is on the lower end, I would wait for some patches for optimization and/or a sale.\n\nMy system:\ni7 5930k @ 4.0GHz\n980ti SLI\n16gb DDR4 RAM","February 4","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The boss fights were fun ,even though i have to say that they were more on the easier side in my opinion, and they were executed really well according to which character you were using to fight that certain boss. Yes, there are some kinks like the 30 fps lock and framerate dropping like a ♥♥♥♥♥, but most the problems that i had were fixed when i reseted my computer.

Before I played I read a couple of the reviews.... and I was pretty shocked that it is only 49 % of positiv reviews, becuase of this 30 fps lock and a missing V-Sync option, wich wasn´t really necessary to do  and I also hope it will be "fixed" these days, but in my Opinion this no reason to rate it THIS bad, because it is only stuttering or "lagging", during some cut-scenes and during the fights, which is the most important part in this kind of game, ot runs very very smooth and wasn´t lagging once. I really hope that CC2 take that, not very usefull, frame lock out of the game and add a V-Sync option to it. Because then it is one of the best games I played, cause there are amazing fights, pretty good story-telling, the graphic is, compared to the previous games, amazing and I think it is the last Storm game and makes a great final for the series. So give it a try and dont shed too much tears about the frame- lock, maybe (Hopefully) they will fix it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimatecatastrophe/recommended/349040/","ultimatecatastrophe","The Ultimate Catastrophe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimatecatastrophe/","6 products in account","I guess I'll give my own personal review of the game as well:\n\nThe Bad -\nFor starters, the game isn't playable for more than 10-15 minutes as it crashes, which makes it extremely difficult to get past the Madara vs Hashirama intro for the story; it crashes somewhere inbetween Madara + Susanoo covered Kurama vs Hashirama + Wood Golem and Hashirama's usage of Sage Art: True Thousand Hands against Madara. So for story mode, I wasn't able to get any progress saved and thus I would have to keep starting at the absolute beginning each time only to get to the same points in the story mode; this frustrates me very much. I've also noticed that some of the graphics were flickering as if the game were poorly optimized for the PC. While it happened to me(or I noticed it) only once, I don't particularly enjoy it. With all of these negative reviews floating around, I'm on high alert to notice anything out of the ordinary. So as of now, I'm only able to play in free-battles or anything along those lines; my progression in the game has been slowed severely because of the constant crashing. It is not acceptable.\n\nThe Decent -\nThose are really my only bad experiences; I did experience low FPS during one of the opening cutscenes(I could clearly tell because of the images being really choppy and slow) but I made sure to have nVidia play the game at maximum performance, reboot it(I'm honestly sure you could just reboot and it will fix the low FPS issue. Although I am dissapointed that the game is only playing around 30FPS but every other Storm game played at it, and this particular game has some good animated effects. The game's fighting pace seems to be at a similar rate compared to the others; the game is beautiful graphically, etc. It has a good bit of the magic the other Storm games have. I've even noticed that the game has very short load times. I've also had decent sound, I haven't ran into any of the stated sound problems or they were just so weak that I couldn't tell the difference. Pre-ordering the game did pay off for me as I did get to have some short-lived fun with Boruto and Sarada, so basically I did get some enjoyment from the game. This game clearly has potential to be something.\n\nThe Verdict -\nWell, I wish we had more of a scale-based rating instead of a yes or no, because I would've given this game around a 4-6  rating because some of the game was functional albeit for short periods of time, but because of this and the many small optimization issues I will have to say I will not recommend this game right now. Yes I'm aware of a patch or two that could help the game, but for one I don't totally trust them. I also believe that this game should've been optimized before release like this. I shouldn't have to apply a 3rd party patch from someone who didn't have a hand in any part of the production of the game. I shouldn't have to waste my time googling how I can make the game run without fps issues or how to avoid crashing; this should've been given to us as a solid game from the start. I love the Naruto series and I do believe the Storm games are one of the best 3D fighting games out there, so I'm not bashing the game because of any hatred. This game still has time to be saved if the right people would listen and act. I'd also like it if there was someone to report our problems to.\n\nP.S.\nJust so we are clear, I do meet the minimum requirements of the game:\nProcessor is a i7-4790k.\nGraphics card is a MSI GTX 970 Gaming 4G, in which I just performed an update on it.\nI have 8 GB ram and at least 10x the space needed to install the game, with everything wrapped in a Windows 10 package, with the appropriate drivers.","February 6","false","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saber_Breaker/recommended/349040/","Saber_Breaker","Saber_Breaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saber_Breaker/","156 products in account","Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is the best Naruto game to date. The biggest cast of characters, new mechanics, etc. make for a great game.\n\nNegatives first though:\n\n-FPS lock. Can't go over 30FPS, but that's not a totally huge deal. Yes 60 would be better, but 30 ain't bad.\n- 15 GB of cutscenes. All the full-motion story cutscenes are pre-rendered using the in-game engine and all have a soft, fuzzy look to them along with low anti-aliasing. It means you've got a fuzzy looking story while gameplay is bright and crisp. Not only is it a huge visual downgrade, but that's also a lot of extra hard drive space. The scenes aren't anything incredible so why they didn't just use in-game cut scenes is just baffling to me.\n- Too many slideshows. There are plenty of cutscenes that aren't even animated and just use stills from the anime with some motion applied. It's lazy and, if they were going to go this route, why not just include all the actual animation from the series?\n- Some bugs persist such as story mode dialogue audio only coming from the left channel, some crashing due to regular Windows processes, etc.\n\nPositive time!\n- Biggest cast of characters in any Naruto game. If you have a fan favorite, you can probably play them here.\n- No longer are ultimate jutsu, awakening, and drive styles separated.\n- Leader change system makes for fun combos and switching up of combat. It feels very fresh and fun.\n- Love NUNS games? It's more of the same, just tweaked and improved all around.\n- Replay story at whatever chapter you like. No need to start a new game.\n\nI'd recommend it, for sure. Great game all around and sure to please Naruto fans. CC2 did a great job and, should they patch the issues, it'll be amazing.","February 8","true","16.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Is the game flawless? Hell no, it's in a shaky start. Does it deserve such terrible reviews, I honestly don't think so, this is no Arkham Knight. I don't know my exact specs, but my hardware is a few years old now, so it's not anywhere near top of the line. I'd give it a 7/10 in it's current state. I'll start with the Cons, to get the bad out of the way first.\n\nCons:\n-30 FPS Lock, despite being said that this game would be optimized well on the PC.\n-Slightly lower frames on menu screens. I go down 19 frames at most, usually it's around 24-27. Battles run pretty smooth.\n-No option to turn off mics in online play. Seriously, why? I know how to do it, sure, but I want to be able to fight someone without hearing a tornado rip their homes apart.\n-Slide show cutscenes in story mode. Seriously, this was a terrible desicion.\n-Low framerate when awakening. Usually affects Susano'o characters.\n-Crap keyboard support, as always. Doesn't overly matter to me since I have an Xbox controller to use, but still that should be better looked at.\n\nI haven't experianced some of the other issues mentioned, so I can't comment on those.\n\nPros:\n-Great story. Seriously it was nice to finally watch Naruto come to an end rather than the dub being 30 years behind and the sub being to caught up in the infinite filler to complete the story. (FYI I did read the manga, notice how I said "watch") Loved how they handled the final battle.\n-Animated cutscenes were great. Seriously if we had this quality of cutscenes during Obito's backstory, or when the mask fell off it would have been amazing. They all looked so well done, it's a shame a good portion was just a slideshow.\n-Better English dub acting. By far one of the highest points for me. In previous games several of the characters didn't show enough emotion in their lines. It's especially noticeable on Naruto when he shouts. This is the first time since Storm 2 that English Naruto's Rasengan actually sounds intimidating. This wasn't his actress's fault, but the people who handed her the script and told her to read it, and those who put weak sounding voices in the game rather than rerecording new ones.\n-Overall smooth gameplay. Minus awakening, menus, and not being 60 FPS the gameplay is pretty smooth, and that's really what needs to be done right in the end, as that's what makes the game actually playable, you know?\n-WORKING Online play. Last time I bought a Storm game (Full Burst) I regretted it immediately because the online was broken and by the time they fixed it they'd already begun hyping up Revolution. I can actually play the game with friends, rather than being disconnected partway through every match.\n-Adventure Mode is pretty good, a bit bland, but about what you'd expect from an Adventure mode.\n\n\nIs this game perfect? Hell no. However it's definitely better off than Full Burst was. If they fix up the issues that can be fixed with it I'd easily give it an 8.5/10, maybe even 9/10, but as it stands now, it's at a very shaky 7/10. I have a few more personal things, but overall they're not worth mentioning. I'd still recommend it to fans of the series, as everything seems fine on my end. Here's hoping they fix the issues others are having swiftly so we can all enjoy it.","February 7","true","41.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That said, the patches have been major helps and there is far more consistent support for this game on PC than I personally expected and I have been pleasantly surprised with the game as a whole.\n\nThe game is what you would expect. The Story mode finishes off the series decently well. Some scenes are animated and some are stills. The best scenes were done very well (the last ones) and it was definitely an enjoyable experience. The adventure mode offers the ability to run around and see the areas (fighting arenas mostly) and talk with significant people. Definitely worth doing! It also gives you different "memory" scenarios to relive all of the major fights in the original series and Shippuden.\n\nThe versus is great and the online is fun. Don't be off put by the overwhelming entrance punishment you'll likely receive your first trip to the online lobby. You'll do well in time and it makes the game all the more fun and challenging, further increasing the potential lifespan.\n\nAlso, the character roster is overwhelming in a good way. A decent amount of the moves are recycled from past games but the new additions are fun and worth playing for/with every time.\n\nIf you're a Naruto fan, this game is definitely for you. If you're interested in an anime fighting game, this game is for you. If you want 60 fps precision fighting, maybe look elsewhere. This does offer a ton of fun and a flashy experience.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","February 19","true","27.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Only a true fan would look past Bandai's mistakes and admire this series at it's core.","February 19","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antihro/recommended/349040/","antihro","Antihero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antihro/","34 products in account","Hey Naruto fans,\n\nI've never written a review for a game before but I felt like I needed to for NS4. I'm a huge Naruto fan, and I've spent hundreds of hours playing Ninja Storm 3 on my 360. I'm writing this review to inform you, a fellow leaf village ninja, on the positives and negatives of this game, the aspects that need to be worked on, and whether or not I think you should buy it right now.\n\nTournaments, endless mode, and ranked were what made NS3 so addicting. I've never focused too much on the campaign's quality or any of the side quests. I already read the manga and watched the anime so I didn't care too much about watching it all over again. The same applies to NS4 - I skipped through most of the cutscenes of the story mode because it was stuff I already knew, but the missions were definitely way more fun than NS3 were. They don't have a lot of walking around, it's strictly fighting, the boss fights were fun, and the ending of the game was superb. But the slideshow style cutscenes seemed like a lazy drawback. The adventure mode is dumb and collections are also a waste of time.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are amazing. I love the new round system and I really enjoy the way the supports have evolved. The characters are fun to play, some are a bit overpowered but balancing doesn't seem like a huge issue at the moment. The new maps are refreshing, and the wall running doesn't seem too useful.\n\nI want to remind you that I did not play Revolutions, so I didn't know that spectator mode had already been removed somewhat from that game. It wasn't until buying NS4 that I realized that they took out the ability to watch your friends play in Endless or in tournaments. That is the biggest flaw with the game right now besides the terrible servers that constantly disconnect you from matches and pit you up against laggy players. CC2 also halved the size of the tournaments and endless matches from 8 players to 4 players. I couldn't believe it when I fought in my first tournament tonight. I immediately went out to see if CC2 planned on fixing this soon and had announced an upcoming patch, but no, apparently Revolutions had already removed spectator mode somewhat and many people had already made a petition to bring it back.\n\n3000 people to be exact. You can sign this petition too here: https://www.change.org/p/bandai-namco-entertainment-cyberconnect2-hiroshi-matsuyama-perfect-the-online-environment-in-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4?recruiter=419566214&utm_source=share_for_starters&utm_medium=copyLink\n\nDespite that, I do recommend this game to naruto fans. It's fun to play with your friends for a little bit, but can get repetitive and boring without spectator mode. You're stuck watching a screen that says "Other players are fighting right now. Please wait." The campaign was good, not amazing, but it did have a solid ending. If you have people over often, or have siblings or friends you can play this with, it's a great deal of fun.\n\nOverall, if I had to give it a rating, it'd be a 7/10. Please watch ShikasCloud's review if you're planning on buying the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L6uOmUnpqs","February 19","true","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Before I played I read a couple of the reviews.... and I was pretty shocked that it is only 49 % of positiv reviews, becuase of this 30 fps lock and a missing V-Sync option, wich wasn´t really necessary to do  and I also hope it will be "fixed" these days, but in my Opinion this no reason to rate it THIS bad, because it is only stuttering or "lagging", during some cut-scenes and during the fights, which is the most important part in this kind of game, ot runs very very smooth and wasn´t lagging once. I really hope that CC2 take that, not very usefull, frame lock out of the game and add a V-Sync option to it. Because then it is one of the best games I played, cause there are amazing fights, pretty good story-telling, the graphic is, compared to the previous games, amazing and I think it is the last Storm game and makes a great final for the series. So give it a try and dont shed too much tears about the frame- lock, maybe (Hopefully) they will fix it. And keep in mind that this is just my opinion.  :)","February 5","true","25.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

If I were to rate the game. I wouldn't be able to. The story is already so amazing. The graphics are beyond of what I thought it'd be. The game runs so smooth. I'm glad I pre-ordered. It's also fun playing Vs battle with my brothers and sisters. The game is so exciting, it's hard to rate it 10/10. I wish I could rate it 100/10 xD\n\nCan't wait to finish the story. It's so emerging. Can't take a break from the game even for a minute. I feel bad for others that are having FPS problems. I first had the problem on my computer. So I moved onto a computer that had 2gb's of video graphics or w/e it's called (and it worked after that). You also need a very good graphics card to.. After playing the first minute of the game I realized why the game requires so much to play, and it also might be the V-sync doing something to your game. The FPS I got on my computer was 14fps. The reason I got that much is cause I didn't have a powerful enough graphics card. I met all the requirements for the game, but it's mainly the 2gb of vid graphics and the v-sync (prob doing something). Well that's what I think.\n\nI hope other people can start playing their game sometime!","February 6","true","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Story is great, The actual boss battles are a feeling only experiencing it can describe. The Storm restyle works great for it. Sadly the main problem with shifting away from Adventure is having Generation/Revolution style frame by frame pictures when the characters narration. However the game does have game engine cutscenes at time and when that kicks in. It's great\n\nWithout spoiling much, Without a doubt Storm 4 has the best boss battles. I haven't felt this awesome about facing a Boss since Pain in Storm 2.\n\nI can't say much about Adventure because it's a niche mode. Either you like it, or don't. I've never been a huge fan of the open world Naruto style. Always the FreeBatlle/Story/Online for me. So I can't give a in depth opinion on it. However I will say it was a great idea shifting Story/Adventure away from one another.\n\n\nFree Battle is and will always be the same.\n\nOnline Battles... I could write a huge blog on how the Netcode was garbage in other games and frankly, It's still pretty terrible with this game. Either you have full 1 Second lag or rarely 2 seconds. You better get used to playing .5 at least.\nBalancing will always be an issue with Storm and that's a debate all on itself. Want good characters that work great in lag areas? Minato\nHonestly, If they actually decide to spend time fixing the online battles, this game would be even higher rating. But sadly I can only really enjoy with friends around me or near states.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Conclusion: I think this is for sure the best Storm game to date.\n8/10.\n\nRoster and Costumes are great.\nIf you're a Naruto fan, this game is 100% amazing, but as a fan of both Fighting and Naruto. I have to judge it fairly and the netplay is a huge factor in that.

The game did initially start up in windowed mode, but I went into the config file to fix just one value. Then I noticed that I can just edit the settings in game. The action and cinematography used during IA in fights adds quite a bit of "oomph" to the gameplay. Played a few matches locally, online, as well as some fights against the computer and the combat feels just as fluid as on the PS4.

This has to be my second favorite storm game (right behind of storm 3) because of the way the story was told. You can branch off and experience mulitple sides of a battle and to get a better grasp of when things were happenin to another. The boss fights were fun ,even though i have to say that they were more on the easier side in my opinion, and they were executed really well according to which character you were using to fight that certain boss. Yes, there are some kinks like the 30 fps lock and framerate dropping like a ♥♥♥♥♥, but most the problems that i had were fixed when i reseted my computer. This game is a must buy if you are a storm fan or not. 10/10 would stay up for another night to play this game.","February 5","true","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimatecatastrophe/recommended/349040/","ultimatecatastrophe","The Ultimate Catastrophe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimatecatastrophe/","6 products in account","I guess I'll give my own personal review of the game as well:\n\nThe Bad -\nFor starters, the game isn't playable for more than 10-15 minutes as it crashes, which makes it extremely difficult to get past the Madara vs Hashirama intro for the story; it crashes somewhere inbetween Madara + Susanoo covered Kurama vs Hashirama + Wood Golem and Hashirama's usage of Sage Art: True Thousand Hands against Madara. So for story mode, I wasn't able to get any progress saved and thus I would have to keep starting at the absolute beginning each time only to get to the same points in the story mode; this frustrates me very much. I've also noticed that some of the graphics were flickering as if the game were poorly optimized for the PC. While it happened to me(or I noticed it) only once, I don't particularly enjoy it. With all of these negative reviews floating around, I'm on high alert to notice anything out of the ordinary. So as of now, I'm only able to play in free-battles or anything along those lines; my progression in the game has been slowed severely because of the constant crashing. It is not acceptable.\n\nThe Decent -\nThose are really my only bad experiences; I did experience low FPS during one of the opening cutscenes(I could clearly tell because of the images being really choppy and slow) but I made sure to have nVidia play the game at maximum performance, reboot it(I'm honestly sure you could just reboot and it will fix the low FPS issue. Although I am dissapointed that the game is only playing around 30FPS but every other Storm game played at it, and this particular game has some good animated effects. The game's fighting pace seems to be at a similar rate compared to the others; the game is beautiful graphically, etc. It has a good bit of the magic the other Storm games have. I've even noticed that the game has very short load times. I've also had decent sound, I haven't ran into any of the stated sound problems or they were just so weak that I couldn't tell the difference. Pre-ordering the game did pay off for me as I did get to have some short-lived fun with Boruto and Sarada, so basically I did get some enjoyment from the game. This game clearly has potential to be something.\n\nThe Verdict -\nWell, I wish we had more of a scale-based rating instead of a yes or no, because I would've given this game around a 4-6  rating because some of the game was functional albeit for short periods of time, but because of this and the many small optimization issues I will have to say I will not recommend this game right now. Yes I'm aware of a patch or two that could help the game, but for one I don't totally trust them. I also believe that this game should've been optimized before release like this. I shouldn't have to apply a 3rd party patch from someone who didn't have a hand in any part of the production of the game. I shouldn't have to waste my time googling how I can make the game run without fps issues or how to avoid crashing; this should've been given to us as a solid game from the start. I love the Naruto series and I do believe the Storm games are one of the best 3D fighting games out there, so I'm not bashing the game because of any hatred. This game still has time to be saved if the right people would listen and act. I'd also like it if there was someone to report our problems to.\n\nP.S.\nJust so we are clear, I do meet the minimum requirements of the game:\nProcessor is a i7-4790k.\nGraphics card is a MSI GTX 970 Gaming 4G, in which I just performed an update on it.\nI have 8 GB ram and at least 10x the space needed to install the game, with everything wrapped in a Windows 10 package, with the appropriate drivers.","February 6","false","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm sure the fights are amazing and the art is superb. However until a patch is released don't even think about wasting your money. The game crashes constanly, and when it does manage to run, it stutters and slows non-stop. My PC is far above the recommended stats, and it still can't make this game work.\n\nThis is just another horribly optimized game that has numerous technical issues.

Story is great, The actual boss battles are a feeling only experiencing it can describe. The Storm restyle works great for it. Sadly the main problem with shifting away from Adventure is having Generation/Revolution style frame by frame pictures when the characters narration. However the game does have game engine cutscenes at time and when that kicks in. It's great\n\nWithout spoiling much, Without a doubt Storm 4 has the best boss battles. I haven't felt this awesome about facing a Boss since Pain in Storm 2.\n\nI can't say much about Adventure because it's a niche mode. Either you like it, or don't. I've never been a huge fan of the open world Naruto style. Always the FreeBatlle/Story/Online for me. So I can't give a in depth opinion on it. However I will say it was a great idea shifting Story/Adventure away from one another.\n\n\nFree Battle is and will always be the same.\n\nOnline Battles... I could write a huge blog on how the Netcode was garbage in other games and frankly, It's still pretty terrible with this game. Either you have full 1 Second lag or rarely 2 seconds. You better get used to playing .5 at least.\nBalancing will always be an issue with Storm and that's a debate all on itself. Want good characters that work great in lag areas? Minato\nHonestly, If they actually decide to spend time fixing the online battles, this game would be even higher rating. But sadly I can only really enjoy with friends around me or near states.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Conclusion: I think this is for sure the best Storm game to date.\n8/10.\n\nRoster and Costumes are great.\nIf you're a Naruto fan, this game is 100% amazing, but as a fan of both Fighting and Naruto. I have to judge it fairly and the netplay is a huge factor in that. Which is why this game is receiving an 8\n","February 5","true","19.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was just hoping for additional battle features but the experience from this game will suffice. Anyway, the Story Mode challenges are good but not harder in comparison with the Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. One part of the Story Mode challenges that makes this game good is how hard it is to reach the S rank for certain battles and it seems to me that those certain battles require the player to have a maximum damage of 10% to reach the S rank. For my opinion, that is great because it will give me additional hours of gameplay aside from the gameplay in the Adventure Mode. In the end, I recommend this game for those players who love this series and those who love fighting games. In the scope of PC players, I only recommend this for those players who own PC's that have the recommended requirement for this game or more.","February 8","true","86.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought the pre order thinking that it would be as good as revolution and 3. But I could only bare about an hour of the laggy fps, buggy sound etc... So I closed this game thinking this was just wasted money.\n\nHowever CyberConnect saw our pain and fixed this and I think this is probably the best things I have seen in a while. I played the story mose and loved it but I could not play with the lag especially when using ultimate jutsus it would just lag and it would be like watching a slideshow. However now this is fixed I am getting 60fps it looks amazing, lots of characters to choose from. There is an Adventure Mode aswell as a story mode and free battle which are a lot of modes to play along with the Online battle. Just by playing this game for another hour with no lag no nothing I really think this game could beat the previous Naruto games.","February 12","true","16.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game functions well. Combat is fluid and visual effects are great despite the 30FPS Cap (Doesn't effect gameplay). The game is constructed in the style of older Naruto games (Not Ultimate Ninja STORM 3) in the sense that is just a linear story with no "Free Roam" which I personally feel is a step back from the previous installment. Regardless of that it's a good bit of fun for the fighting game or Naruto fan.","February 16","true","17.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overall, I highly recommend it to people who have enjoyed the series until now and to those who like fighting games. 8.5/10","March 10","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
