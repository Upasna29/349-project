The locomotion is well done, a form of teleportation, but being unique in having the ability to travel in two different sizes (you can do a god mod, and a normal sized mode type deal). The game play is actually fun and there's depth to it, which seems to be lacking in other launch titles. Use of roomscale is useful as a game mechanic as well, giving you better view of the battle field. And then I also got lazy, sat on my floor, and just teleported everywhere. I wish there was a way to chose reorient direction when teleporting for when in lazy mode, but perhaps that will be done in an update.\n\nOverall, It's a turn based strategy that makes you feel like a kid playing with action figures, over all. excited to play some more, but thought I'd post a quick review for people checking it out.\n\n\nedit: also just noticed the minimum requirements list a 980. fwiw, I have a 770 2gb evga card and i didn't seem to have any issues.","April 7","true","0.7"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

The art and graphics and great even if the title sounds weird. Getting to move around the battlefield and scale yourself down to the size of the soldiers really makes the case for this being a VR game. The number of units and complexity of the actual battles doesn't live up to modern strategy games, but the ability to be in the world makes up for that. I can see this as a stepping stone to even more compelling VR strategy games and I'm happy to support the developers taking a chance in this early wild west of VR.","April 9","true","1.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I'm surprised that more people aren't talking about it.  I've been desperate for a good strategy game to play.  It's a turn based strategy game that actually seems pretty challenging so far.  I can't wait to really get some good play time in!  It's a game you could grab a stool or chair to sit on in your play space if you need a break from the active room-scale games.\n\nIf I could figure out how to more reliably end the turns of my units I'd be set :)","April 25","true","7.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"

I think what sells it is that it feels like a tabletop war game but more interactive.  Plus you can zoom into the battlefield and get down to the soldiers perspective.  Really well laid out campaign that builds up nicely not trying to overwhelm you so you can get used to the controls and unit types.  This is one of the types of games I hoped we'd be seeing in VR, just didn't expect this well polished of a game at this point and honestly at a great price.\n\nI went into this game a bit leary with reading it had potential for frame rate drop.  I did experience this same drop however I did some analyzing and noticed my CPU wasn't maxed but was pretty high up there.  I closed everything except Steam and this app and it ran perfect.  I even tested jumping up and down and basically sitting on the floor trying to hide from the lighthouses to see if I could get anything weird to happen again.  Nope ran great.  I'm running a 980Ti stock with a 4th gen i5 so I imagine a newer i5 or even i7 would be more than fine, this game isn't very graphics intense as my 980Ti was barely putting any effort out, it's all CPU here so you know.\n\nUpdate: A recent all around Windows 10 and NVIDIA updates this thing runs amazing now even when I forget to shut down other apps.","April 10","true","5.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Nothing like sitting on a rolling chair and making your way through the battle field with your troops. The music is a little serious for my taste, so I'll probably find a way to play my own tunes.\n\nI had some major issues running the game from a network drive which is unusual for any of my Steam games. The problem all but disappeared when running the game from a local SSD - it still presented a minor frame timing issue that is just a little annoying. Apparently the issue is unique to me, so take my experience with a grain of salt.","April 8","true","1.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","8"

It's a fun and unique experience and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.  While many of the early Vive titles have been dismissed as tech demos or half-baked, Quar stands out as a fully fleshed out title well worth its asking price and one that I hope is the start of new and exciting way to experience strategy games.","April 26","true","9.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I finished this game and there is a lot of content, a good number of well designed levels. I can very highly reccomend this game. The experience is very good fan (kind of addictive). The overall experience is very comfortable: no nausea whatsoever. The art/graphic design/animations are very nicely done, with a very good variety of characters nicley animated in a good looking and very varied environment. You can teleport and also change size to enjoy both a strategic overview in "giant mode", and also become as small as your soldiers to see the action close in front of you. The gameplay is actical, turn-based battles against in a story-driven campaign. You can upgrade your units.\nThe negatives:\nOn the negative side there a few bugs. Very, very few bugs as it ia a robust game, but I have mention one bug because it can be a bit annoying: occasionaly, you cannot click to finish your turn and so the game is stuck. Because you cannot save in the middle of a battle, you cannot undo, and because battles can last a very long time, you can see where the occasional frustration comes from. But, I have to add, it is a rare bug: maybe once every 6 hours of play.\nThere are a few "quick wins" that the developer hasn't added yet to the game, and I hope will be added soon: multiplayer, and a choice of difficulty levels: as it stands, each level is fairly easy to pass at the first attempt.","April 25","true","15.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For me, it could do with being a little bit harder - I basically played through all the battles, only having tor try one once (and crashed half way through one). There are more battles than I first though, and they do slowly get more complex, but not really much of a challenge yet. I'm three hours in so far and it feels that once I'm done there won't be much reason to go back and re-play the battles.","May 5","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

It´s really cool to change the position and take a look on the battlefield in different angels. The zoom-in-function and the fighting animation are working very good and are impressive. I didn´t used it enough because I was too much focused on the next turn, I will change that behaviour in the future. ;-) No bugs or problems in the 10 hours of gaming through the campain. Also no frame problems, I didn´t tracked it but I had no problems at any time and I have a R9 290, an i5-3350P and 8 GB ram.\nI´m waiting already for the skirmish mode, that will be implented next and then multiplayer is coming!!! :-) I already see myself playing this game for a lot of hours, having a really good time alone and with other players. If it´s not a lot more work a 2 vs 2 players mode on a huge map would be sooo awesome. And/or a point system for multiplayer mode where you get higher ranks, medals or such stuff. Always good to see a result of gaming, that´s at the moment really nice in form of upgrading your buildings to increase the abilities of your different troops. But I have no idea how much work this it. I will be already happy when skirmish is coming and than the multiplayer. ;-)\nThe price is really cheap for this beautiful and good game. If you compare it with the prices and content of other VR games it´s nearly for free. ;-)\nHighly recommended, hope to see you on the battlefield in a hopefully not to late future. :-) I`m a big fan already. Thanks a lot to the devs for the great work (if you need a beta-tester for the new modes feel free to contect me ;-) ).","May 4","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is great.  Only issue is the UI needs work.  I never really understood when it was my turn or my moves were up.  It seemed to say select units (when my turn was over?)  "END TURN" sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. I wasn't use what or how to end. I clicked the PAD button... sometimes worked and sometimes didn't.  Did I need to make sure that white dot sliding around the pad was down?  OF course would be better with a real person playing the other side.  I completed - 3 missions. tutorial, king of the hill and capture the flag(s) I used points to upgrade my airport.   But due to UI being flaky - not real sure yet how to play?  moves when? sometimes I can hunker, other times I can't. Though the option is still there?  Maybe this should be in the discussion group. So back to the review... graphics are VERY well done for the VIVE.  (lack of res = ( is vives fault).  This is probably the most polished VIVE title I've played and bought so far. (others are like quickly get them out - or demos).  I recommend highly, but I really help they improve the interface.  Also there was no back to start menu (settings/graphics) and no  "EXIT" I had to remove headset and close the window.  I also couldn't click the steamVR button to get back to VR menu.   "still BUY THIS".\n","May 11","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

If you like turn based strategy this is definitely worth getting as this is one of the few games that has enough content to keep you busy for 10+ hours.  I wouldn't say that there is a lot of replayability, but if they were to add a new expansion with the same number of missions for $8-10 I would definitely go for it.  I would suggest some larger maps with more scenarios, but I expect that there were system limitations that made that difficult.","May 25","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The problem is with the design of standing over your soldiers looking down at them. After a short 5 minutes or so, the weight of the vive becomes a real issue since looking down puts stress on my neck and I cannot play without discomfort. The game is great, I just wish there was a possible design change so I wouldn't have to look down so much.","May 16","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"
