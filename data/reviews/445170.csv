Owo\nI love the classic rpg feel this game gives, looking at the stats of different armor and deciding which one is best, deciding whether you like the quick but small dagger, or the big but slow axe. Choosing from the random selection in the shop and battling through hordes of mixed monsters in chest rooms only to open the chest and find a freaking rusted dagger. (You got me there, but one day, oh, ONE DAY.)\nNice learning curve and hard levels in a good way!\nIt's an awesome game to cater to grinders, nostalgia-junkies, and rpg fans alike.\nI recommend to anyone!","February 26","true","1.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

The weapon and costume combinations are a fun twist that gives the game replayability, it was neat exploring some of the options available and getting a new piece to wear was always exciting.\n\nThe game is certainly unique so if you're a fan of rogue-likes (Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc) or clasic side-scrollers (Ghosts & Goblins, Friday the 13th, etc) then this game may be worth checking out.\n\nPros:\nProcedurally generated levels make the game feel fresh (new enemies, bosses, items, etc).\nArt style has a nice retro feel to it.\nCostume and weapon combinations provide a bit of strategy to the game.\nReasonable price for the amount of content, seems like there's quite a few items and game modes to unlock.\n\nCons:\nGame can be a bit cryptic at times. There may be a few things you weren't taught that can lead to some cheap deaths (but it might just be part of the learning curve).\nMuch like the classic NES era of games Haunting of Billy harkens back to there isn't much in terms of story.\nDifficulty is on the higher end, like most rogue-likes.\n\nOverall, a fun little game from an indie developer that's worth giving a shot.\n\n\n\nNOTE: I was gifted a copy of the game to review by the developer.","February 27","true","3.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/445170/","Dragnix","{FITH}â„¢Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of review.\n\nTarget Audience:    Those looking for a real simple time waster.\n\nVideo Review:  https://youtu.be/MbPF1HLARv4\n\nSummary:\nA cheap is great and all, but it comes down to an opportunity cost. When there's so many games on Steam, you need something unique to sell your game over others, and the Haunting of Billy has none of that. While the game's functional and can do the job in terms of a simple time waster, those looking for any sort of detailed or engaging gameplay are looking in the wrong place. The repetitive nature of combat got boring very quickly, as you're doing the same thing over and over again, even after 2 hours of gameplay. The game allows for higher resolution, but doesn't adjust certain elements, like text boxes and information, appropriately. Honestly, I'm struggling to finish this summary: the fact is, the game is a form of whack a monster: hit them with a melee weapon over and over again while trying to avoid damage, and exploiting the AI to do that. There's better games at a 5 dollar or less price point, even when you aren't looking for a sale title.\n\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nIt's functional. Combat and controls work.\nPremise the game has in the haunted house could have been interesting.\nCan burn through time.\nNegatives:\nBoring. Combat gets repetitive quickly, and without a lot of variety to show for it.\nGame doesn't teach you some things that you need to know.\nWasted story presence in the store page. Doesn't use it at all.\nDoesn't take advantage of higher resolutions. Font is still the same size, making me squint, trying to figure out what's going on.\nAesthetic doesn't do well to tell the story the game has to tell. Creatures don't necessarily look like their counterparts  (the mummy for example).\nFont used can be confusing at times.","April 5","false","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I love that when you die you start from the beginning and it's a different experience everytime. For a while i didnt realize that costumes gave you bonuses, but when i found that out i started playing like how i would any other RPG, which made it a lot more interesting. Great game all around,\n\ngreat moves\nkeep it up\nproud of you\npapa bless\n\n<3","February 28","true","4.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","13","22","4","0"

It's simple but challenging, I keep making it to the second last boss then dying. you really need to think out the custome pieces and weapons you bring to boss fights. Game allows for lots of player preferences, at first I liked using swords and axes but with more skill definitely prefer daggers now. Cons of the game are the fact that you lose your save if you die, but I guess that is part of the challenge. Also, since the game is randomly generated it makes each playthrough unique BUT you can get unlucky with the type/number of monsters that spawn and get wrecked... especially in the basements. Overall I would highly recommend this game.\n\ntip: hoard mummy costume pieces (extra hp) for the first 2 bosses, but do NOT try to fight the 3rd without a bug costume piece (extra speed). Very frustrating if you do not, I died many many times before learning this.\n\n","February 28","true","18.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It grew on me rather quickly. I DO reccomend the tutorial, which I think could use some polishing in the menu department. But, that aside, for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes, you can be enjoying a retro monster romp.\n\nThe price is right, and the game is fun. What more could you ask for?\n\n-Edit-\n\nAlready another game update, and this polishes the tutorial menu. It looks much, much more polished now.

You will have to make decisions in which item you would carry since you can't carry more than what you are wearing at that moment. Dieing makes you begin from the start again, which I think is great and gives this game an even more challenging twist.\n\nThis game is great to play over and over again since it's diffrent every time you play.\n\n420/10","February 28","true","13.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
