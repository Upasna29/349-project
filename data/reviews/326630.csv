"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/326630/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Sports Interactive’s Football Manager franchise gets some flak for its lack of innovation year on year. However at least it gets it right. Club Manager 2015 is an attempt to compete with the might of Football Manager, and it most certainly does not get it right. It has some things that Football Manager doesn’t, but the amount it removes, and the poor quality of the core concepts makes this a product not worth spending your money on.\nThe menu system is appalling, and when the whole game is designed around using menus, you know you are going to be in for a bad time. You open a window to view some information and then have to look around for the button to close it, because it changes based on what kind of menu you open. The localisation is poor, to the point where you are sometimes just not sure what certain stats mean. I spend a long time thinking that “Strength” meant, you know, strength. However it’s actually an overall rating for the team or player.\nThere is a semblance of a match engine so you can see highlights of your games. However it doesn’t use the kit colours you pick for your team, and all it does is rehash the same ten or so animations over and over. Since there are so few options, you would have thought they at least would look good, but nope.\nOnce you turn off all the extraneous stuff, you can blast through a season quite quickly, in under an hour or so. You get into the rhythm of choosing your training program for the week and then jumping into the next match. The training system isn’t robust at all, you simply choose whether you want certain players to work on their general play, their energy, or their stamina.\nThere is an odd way of dealing with sponsorship. Before home games you can essentially bet on the outcome, and if you get it right your sponsor will give you a certain amount of money. You can expand your stadium and change ticket and merchandising prices and the like, but it’s not rewarding. The way you deal with buying and selling new players is bizarre. You approach a player you want to buy, and if they don’t want to join your club it won’t even let you bid any money for them. You can’t even make plans to buy players since it won’t let you do anything on the transfer market outside of the transfer window.Even when you have got the players you need, choosing your team is difficult because the formations don’t look like they are supposed to. Also I’ve still not worked out how to make substitutions during a match.\nClub Manager 2015 has very few redeeming qualities to speak of. There’s no way you can get major things wrong and it brings nothing new to the table. It’s a little bit cheaper than Football Manager, but the price needs to drop a whole lot more for it to be worth the price. If you’re really on a budget and want to manage a football team, just buy an older version of Football Manager, it’ll still be better than this.","July 17, 2015","false","7.0"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","86","95","5","0"

Just moving around screens feels like navigating the web on a 56k, and saving? Good grief. It's not like the game is full of data points that need updating, but you'd think it was 100x the scale of Football Manager judging by how long your first save will take.\n\nIt is designed terribly, too. Menus are confusing, the visual hierarchy is screwed up, and the design language is inconsistent. It's a mess.\n\nThis can all be forgiven but there are little things that make it such a hassle to even start. What's the difference, for example, betweent talent and str? When saving, why does it ask if you want to overwrite a score when it saves? That's just two of many. Honestly, I'm not going to play a game that's a hassle, not unless it's overtly great, and this? This isn't even close.\n\nDon't waste your money.","July 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","22","30","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexxusdrako/recommended/326630/","nexxusdrako","Nexxus Drako","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexxusdrako/","172 products in account","This game, while having it's quirks and limitations is actually a very good football club director simulator. I say director, because there's very little management in the traditional sense. It focuses more on the business side of things, while keeping a level of simple, distilled gameplay akin to that of the DOS games of old (Football Limited jumps out as an example).\n\nThe game only features the German leagues, and quite unrealistically too, as there are 8 divisions down to what is known IRL as the Kreisliga (aka City Leagues) but strangely, the game features a completely 1 to 1 linear structure, not the pyramid football fans are used to.\n\nThe match engine is almost non-existent, with opaque number crunching happening behind the scenes and small highlights appearing every chance or goal, but nevertheless it's solid enough to make the business side of things fun. One gripe I have is that the engine seems to make a big deal of underestimation, where if you have a vastly superior team, your team has a chance of completely being swept aside, although I have noticed that upping the win bonus to about 5000 euros and higher offsets this somewhat, while also giving you an edge in closer matches.\n\nThe facilities building feature is great, you get to pick what parts of your stadium and grounds you want to upgrade, and it gives you a birds eye view of the area, where you can slowly build the crown jewel of your footballing empire. Of course, it's mostly in 2D but it's a nice touch anyway. Adding crowd capacity is easy, as is upgrading them from standing room, to seating with roofs. VIP boxes are also a part of the game, and you can even add catering, TV systems and service.\n\nThe transfer market is quite iffy though, you can only buy players in January and July, with no ability to offer in the off-period and get them when the window starts. The negotiations are simple and to the point, as the game will tell you how close you are to them closing negotiations by shrinking their happiness bar. Contracts are pretty much the same.\n\nYou may obtain sponsors, usually a main sponsor with bonuss based on wins, matches, promotiona and avoiding relegation, and as of update 1.42 you can get other sponsors which just pay a certain fee every month. Also of note is merchandisng, which you must stock for an entire season before July 15th or risk not being eble to sell anything. It's an exciting system which is certainly more fun than checking every so often to restock on a permanent basis.\n\nYou may buy player insurance which pays you when players get injured, I personally haven't used it, but it's a nice touch. You may also speculate on the share market, which I haven't done either. Also of note is socking money away as ban investment and getting it back a 1 to 7 years later with interest. The longer the term, the higher the interest rate.\n\nActually setting the formations is a chore that is confusing as hell, which is why I say it's more of a business simlator, it's so deep in business but lacking in actual management. No tactics to speak of, but I guess that's what makes the game so simple and fun. Usually, I just hire an assistanr manager to do both training and squad picking.\n\nThere's a plethora of stats screens in this game, which is a nice touch. I also love the found a club mode, reminds me a lot of the days when I played FIFA Manager religiously, back when it was actually good.\n\nAnyway, I guess I should close this review now, so let me outline the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n* Good football club business sim\n* Stadium and ground building is nice\n* Financial options are plentiful\n* Plenty of stats\n* You can hire staff to do the actual football stuff\n\nCONS:\n* The actual football side of things is sorely lacking\n* The transfer market is confusing and restrictive\n* Formations are hard, especially with no tactics\n* 30 dollars/euros/pounds is a bit much, prices aren't currency converted either.\n\nOVERALL:\nA good game for the tycoon guys out there with an interest in football. If you like football management games but find Football Manager too hard and complex, this could be good for you. If you're a diehard football manager, keep playing FM, you might not like this. If you love both tycoon games and football, you'll love this game.","March 26, 2015","true","45.9"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","20","40","5","0"

Unfortunately, this will happen every time you start the game; making you click ‘Next’ often, just so that you can get to the main title screen.\n\nOnce you do start though, the game begins to take shape as something well worth playing. As you click on ‘New Game’ you are given the option to name your player; decide on how many players you would like to have in the game; game difficulty; and whether you would like to use an existing club or found your own.\n\nFounding your own club will make the game far more difficult because, unlike selecting a pre-existing club, you start with some money and that’s it. You have to do everything from build your stadium; to buying players; to competing in matches.\n\nUnlike most football management games, CM15 lets you see everything that you can do with your club. You can manage your team by:\n\nchanging your squad layout;\ndefining the training parameters;\nseeing who’s contract will be expiring soon;\nwhether or not you want to keep them;\nbuying new players; as well as\nrenting your own players out to other teams.\nManaging the club gives you the opportunity to hire staff to help you to run the club.  It also provides the opportunity of checking your youth team’s status; and deciding how much you want to spend on their annual training.  You can also check your prestige and view the history of the club.\n\nOnce you get into the finer points of managing a club, your work includes building the stadium and raising finances.As an example, you can’t run a football club without some good revenue coming in and the one way to do this is to make sure that your stadium look pretty. CM15 gives you a view of the exterior of the stadium where you can build everything to help players enhance their skills and even build bus stops for the fans.\n\nThe interior of the club gives you the tools to build your stadiums stands; the floodlights and even the public toilets.  The better the appearance of the stadium, the more fans will come and watch your team.\n\nYou can also set ticket and merchandise pricing as well as purchase the merchandise yourself, as well as deciding on how much you want in your store at any one time.\n\nFinancing the club is also made quite easy. You can apply for credit; choose sponsors; adjust merchandise prices; and get investments, all of which will either make or break your club. You can even insure a valuable player.\n\nYou also have a manager’s pass which will warn you when there is something wrong anywhere in your club. This little tool is very helpful when you don’t want to look through every detail of the club simply to find a problem.\n\nAs you click ‘Next’ you will move up the calendar days until either a match day; match draw; or construction completion comes up, if a match day comes up you will be taken to the match screen where you will have to decide on the line-up or, alternatively, let your assistant coach choose the best line-up. You will then move to the pre-match screen. Here it is made easy for you to decide on how you want your team to perform and whether or not to give them a bonus if they win. Both are slide bars from ;do little; to ;play aggressively. You are then moved to the match screen where you can watch the time run up and adjust the speed of the game. You will also see what penalties are being given and a short cinematic of a goal either being scored or missed.\n\nThe matches could have been made a little more interactive as most of the time you are just watching the time run up. It would be better if there was more control of the team. For example; throughout the match the ability to give commands to players on how aggressive they should be with their attacks. Speeding the match up, just to finish it, is all you would want to do so that you can get back to running the club.\n\nAfter hiring an assistant manager you can give him tasks to do but, the problem here, is that you can’t see what the tasks are because they are all over-lapping each other. The language in the game could use some work too, as every once in a while you will see misspelled words or badly placed grammar.\n\nOverall, Big Blaze Games has developed quite an addictive game, even though some of the playability is a bit irritating.\n\nWhether you are a casual gamer or a hardcore football fan, this game will keep you playing for hours. Even when you aren’t playing, you will be thinking of ways to improve the club’s standings.","December 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 24 of 92 people (26%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","26","24","92","9","0"
