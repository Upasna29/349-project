Combining the gravity platforming from Mario Galaxy with fast pace multiplayer arena combat. Only how the combat works isn't that well executed. You need to auto lock on enemies and use a dash attack to kill them. The frags only count to your score when you self detonate. Combat like Rune or UT99 Instagib would have been better in my opinion.\n\nBut the biggest problem Plain Sight has is that the multiplayer is dead. That's almost always the problem with small indie titles that focuses on multiplayer. You can play against bots. But I would say that it's only really worth it if you got a couple of friends to play it with.","May 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And it was a blast.\n\nIt takes a while to get behind this silly looking little thing and to understand the (3 times changes) mechanics. It looks sooooo simple but theres a lot more to it then just running around and hitting each other with a sword before comitting suicide in an esplosion to get the points. Its really fast, you need to get the timings right, know your movements to get rid of lock-ons, know how to repel, use the perks wisely ... Its really easy to just play but hard to master.\n\nIt had one of the most friendly comunity i´ve ever met in an online game with almonst no toxic players like we used to have today. A lot of the guys in my friendlist i´ve met through this game.\n\nBut ... it died after one and a half year. Then the master server died so nobody could login anyway ...\nSo now the masterserver is back, but no servers to find wich is really really sad for such a fun and exceptionally good designed take on a multiplayer title.\n\nTo the devs, if they read this. You have added joypad-support which is good for a third-person-title like this. You should consider adding a 4-player-splitscreen to this. It would really help to keep the game alive.\nEverybody loves to get some friends on a couch, grab some beer and shout at each other while playing games. And this would fit perfekt. I´ve read something bout plainsight 2 which is great to hear, but don´t let this little gem die again.\nAnd by the way the leaderboards died even earlier then the game itself ;) (not counting anymore)\n\nSo, now i have to activate some buddies to play this (after hosting a server ^^). In fact this is the only game that has me more addicted then rocket-league, which means A LOT!!\n\ntldr: get it, lose a lot of matches while learning, love it, have fun\n\nsorry for my bad english - but i think everybody gets the point\n","May 15","true","275.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Single player, the bots become a little too easy to mash, but the levels are fascinating, the mechanics of the game are innovative and different.   The graphics are very simple, and ensure that you're not having that modern-game problem where you didn't see an enemy coming because of the foliage or mental textures.\n\nThe only thing I'm not overly keen on is the shallowness to the play.  There doesn't appear to be any tactics, or good spots to learn, etc.. Wherever you are, and whatever you're doing, it all comes down to: Who can spin around and attack first.  Because you spend so much time in freefall, and that the enemies have auto-lockon, it sometimes feels that it's just a click-fest.\n\nThat aside, it's whiled away many fun hours, and I've enjoyed all the levels (I think)...   If you want to have a LAN party, and need something light to fill a while between heavier FPS sessions, this is a very fun little game.\n","June 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only issue I would find in this game is that the multiplayer community isn't reall good. So that still doesn't matter because there is single player and servers with bots but not much people though, So I'd say maybe if you want to play this game singleplayer then go ahead and buy it for sure! However if you are looking for a multiplayer game with lots of people I don't recommend this one but you can just buy it along with a few friends and join a server with bots and go like that.

That sounds about right because after about eighty minutes of jumping around and disemboweling myself over and over again I begin to feel like I'm watching that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation wherein the Enterprise was caught in a time loop forever doomed to explode and come back to life. Eventually they figured it out because they felt afterimages (or rather beforeimages) of their past (or rather future) selves. Plain Sight doesn't give you the luxury of premonitions, however its repetitive boringness is self evident in a way that infinite resetting time loops in space can never be. So I guess I should count myself lucky that I was trapped only for 84 minutes instead of thousands of years like Bill Murray. (Picard could kick Murray's ♥♥♥ any day of the week.

Do not bother if you only have a pretty good machine and graphics card. There are no settings for turning down graphics.\n\nPurely an online game.\n\nBy collecting stars you can purchase lasting upgrades. Collecting 50 stars takes a hell-a-long time. There are around 9-16 boosters/upgrades ranging from 50-500stars. You can select 1-3 upgrades b4 a match.\n\nI bought the 4 pack. My son was complaining a player was kicking his butt, I watched and he was cheating hardcore. The player was using every upgrade, when the upgrades were not allowed on this match. (some sort of fight the godzilla mode, & then you get to be it.) The other player was able to kill my sons godzilla in one hit, when it should have taken 1000.\n\nOther than that one cheater, and having to give up my machine so my kids could log on to their accounts (their machines are only pretty good), this game is a whole lot of fun.","December 2, 2010","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do not bother if you only have a pretty good machine and graphics card. There are no settings for turning down graphics.\n\nPurely an online game.\n\nBy collecting stars you can purchase lasting upgrades. Collecting 50 stars takes a hell-a-long time. There are around 9-16 boosters/upgrades ranging from 50-500stars. You can select 1-3 upgrades b4 a match.\n\nI bought the 4 pack. My son was complaining a player was kicking his butt, I watched and he was cheating hardcore. The player was using every upgrade, when the upgrades were not allowed on this match. (some sort of fight the godzilla mode, & then you get to be it.) The other player was able to kill my sons godzilla in one hit, when it should have taken 1000.\n\nOther than that one cheater, and having to give up my machine so my kids could log on to their accounts (their machines are only pretty good), this game is a whole lot of fun.","December 2, 2010","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
