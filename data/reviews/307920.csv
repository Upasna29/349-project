Has a few improvements like choosing skin varients and being able to sterilize animals. The missions are a little more challenging. I liked the new buildings and decorations. I loved the new maps. There are many new maps to chose from that vary in climate and set up. If you like plants, it has crop farming which can replace your greenhouse. I liked the animals better and caring for the plants wasn't very fun for me.\n\nA little buggy for me. The skin varients didn't work for me in freestyle, only in the missions. The narrator for the missions didn't speak (which maybe you prefer, but I would rather hear him talk). Also all the animals constantly vocalized so if you went to first-person mode near a large group of animals you might find all the noise quite annoying.\n\nThe expansions for WLP2 don't tie together very well. For example, if I wanted to play Crazy Zoo, I could still get the Farm World animals, but thats it. None of the plants, buildings, or decorations would transfer to the other expansion, which is kind of annoying.\n\nI enjoy playing the game, it would just be a lot better if they fixed the buggy stuff.","August 2, 2014","true","13.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","19","22","3","0"

The workers you employed will just stood there idling for no reason. My worker which harvest rice just spend whole day swimming.\n\nWorkers - After a while they just stand there not doing anything. Even if you pick them up to the working area, they just walk to the original point and stand there.\n\nGround leveling tools - Don't bother trying this. There are many options for ground leveling but it doesn't work properly. I mean roller coaster tycoon that was released on 1999 works better then this.\n\nItem tooltip - So the rice says it's cold. What do you want? A blanket?\n\nPlanting - You have to plant the rice one at a time. How annoying is that? Secondly, if the rice field doesn't work properly, imagine how many annoying smiley faces you'll see in that area.\n\nSummary - Not recommended.","August 1, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!","May 15, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"
