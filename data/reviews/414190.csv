"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymbioteGames/recommended/414190/","SymbioteGames","Symbiote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymbioteGames/","163 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nAt first glance, you may think that Junk Jack looks like a clone of a much more popular game, Terraria. While the similarities are there, I'd argue that this game's intentions are much different, and the art style is the similar aspect. If you're familiar with Terraria, Minecraft and Starbound, Jack Jack would be its child, introducing all the neat elements of each of those indie games.\n\nPROS:\n- More content than expected on Early Access.\n- Fun graphic/art style.\n- Music is well done (I have a con for this though.)\n- Multiplayer (however, it's a con currently as well.)\n- Wide variety of biomes and monsters.\n- Many things to collect in the game.\n- Simple AND advanced crafting for inexperienced or experienced sandbox-game players.\n- Weather system.\n- Good variety of settings for all areas of the game.\n- When your character falls in water, you're not limited to try to jump out of water. You can control swimming around with WASD.\n- Combat strafing with the CTRL key.\n\nCONS:\n- Combat is too simple, thus making fighting monsters challenging. Limited to a single strike, it's difficult to push back enemies and not be hit with a massive amount of damage.\n- Music is great when it's there, but often the game's music will stop playing for some time.\n- Multiplayer is currently experimental, and comes with bugs. Attempted doing a Steam game with a friend, didn't work. We eventually connected to eachother by IP through a router, but experienced some random disconnects every now and then.\n- Sound effects sound out of place, the quality of the effects don't blend well with the atmosphere of the game.\n- The price tag. Personally, for the current stage, I think $15.00 is asking for a little much. I'd price this game at $10.00.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nSteam has been plagued with many Early Access games, and many of them have turned out to be flunks. From what I can tell though, the Junk Jack developers are committed and have come to Steam with a fairly polished game. Updates seem to be frequent as well, and they listen to those who are interested in the game. Junk Jack, in my mind, is a good purchase if you enjoy indie sandbox adventure games.\n\nRATING:\n\nI'd give Junk Jack a score of 9/10 for now. In my mind, $1 = 1 hour of entertainment. I can see myself spending more than fifteen hours with this game. Happy building!\n\nEDITS:\n\n- No longer have the invisible wall as a con, as a patch added a world loop to replace it.\n- No longer have the Steam achievements as a con, because a patch has fixed them to work now.","May 5","true","3.9"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","10"

So first things first, the history of this game started off as an iOS mobile game, known as Junk Jack. 2 years later, in 2013, the released Junk Jack X which brought a lot more uniqueness to the game. The ability to go to many other planets and multiplayer brought the game to higher standards. Now, its been ported to the PC for Steam. I own all three, and have loved playing the game for 5 years now. A lot of people compare this game to Terraria or Minecraft, and to a degree, they are right. However, you also have to take into consideration that both of those games aren't original either. This game, although a clone, is very well polished and playable for what it is. So if you are a fan of Terraria or Minecraft, you'd very much enjoy this game too, even if it does look "just like another clone."\n\nSo let's go over pros and cons:\n\nPros:Cons:Great and friendly communitybut the community is rather small.Lots of re-playabilitySome of the controls feel wonky/things that ported over weren't implemented well.Multiplayer is pretty fun with friends and items can be traded/bartered. Not exactly as economy but a market nonethelessHowever, the market can be easily abused throught cheaters. And if random multiplayer is ever implemented again, some people abuse the system. (rare, but happens) And also multiplayer isn't 100% functioning.Forum to share maps/ideas/etc.Not always active, and mapping/modding is very limited.Developers are very friendly and active. They actually take time to speak with people on the forums, take a look at bugs that have been posted. Etc. Overall they are great people (2 developers Jack and XsX) and I fully trust that they will invest lots of time into this game.While they are great people, there is only two of them. So don't expect things like updates every day such as Minecraft.The graphics, although dated, look very nice, even on a 1920x1080 monitor. The game and its graphics hold up, and can easily be run on older systems at fullest details.\nOverall, the game is very fun to play, however the main issue is the price. $15 is very pricy for what the game is, and it is still early access at that. I did buy the game at $15 because I have full faith in the developers, however, I'd suggest lowering the price until it becomes a full game.\nI do, however recommend this game to fans of either Terraria, Minecraft, or previous Junk Jack players. This game (as you can tell by my hours) has given me a great deal of fun and I'm still playing. The game, although maybe not rushed updates, won't end up abandoned like other early access games on Steam are. The developers are very trusted to me, and you'll soon agree after buying the game.\n\n-Winter_Snake","May 24","true","118.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

From the Graphics, Music and Game World, Junk Jack delivers on all of my expectations that I had when I first heard that the game was coming to PC. For the more fine details, see my list of Pros and Cons below:\n\nPROS:\n-Smooth Gameplay and Framerate\n-Awesome Graphics\n-Good Music\n-Addictive Nature (wanting to collect craftbook pages & explore the underground biomes)\n-Multiplayer (still experimental)\n-Unique Biomes and world (monsters)\n-Literally hundreds of crafting recipies (foods, crafting benches, armor, weapons, clothes, houses as well as treasure to collect)\n\nCONS:\n-Slightly awkward control scheme at first, but you get used to it\n-No Gamepad Support (as of yet)\n-Price may put off people from buying it\n\nOverall, I'd say that the game is worth the $15 price tag considering it's being developed by two guys, who had to essentially remake the game for PC. Either way, you be the judge!\n\n\nNOTE:\nThe game has/had some issues starting on Windows 7 for me, as well as other users. The Developers released a list of potential fixes on their blog as well as a patch that fixed any and all issues that I was having, so I think that it's now stable on all operating systems.\n\nHere's the link just in case:https://pixbits.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/troubleshooting-junk-jack-issues/\n\nBe sure to give it a try!","April 27","true","22.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Progression and exploration in this game are very rewarding. It's perfect for scratching that Terraria/Starbound itch, doing enough to set it apart from its counterparts.\n\nThings can be a bit rough in Early Access, but report your bugs!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zacktumundo/recommended/414190/","zacktumundo","Zack Tumundo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zacktumundo/","33 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBig fan of the iOS version, looking forward to playing a lot of this on my Mac.\n\nFor those who are asking what the difference is between this and similar games, for me, Junk Jack is all about collecting lots of "junk". It has more pixel crack than a pixelated back alley in Pixel New York City. Tons of rares, recipes, etc. Explore, build up an awesome base, gather all the pixel crack. It's a relaxing way to just dig around and catch 'em all.\n\nThis game also has a ton of crafting recipes, farming, and an extensive gardening system. If you like fighting mega bosses, stick with Terraria. If you like 3D, stick with Minecraft. If you like hundreds of chests filled with all the junk, because you should be the star of a Let's Play Hoarders youtube episode, then this is the game for you.\n\nPro tip: build your base on one world, and then "exit" the game and go to another world to do all your digging / exploring. You can switch back and forth between worlds as much as you want. If you're digging deep in to dangerous areas, carry a stack of beds, and periodically drop a bed, then use it to change your spawn point. This'll greatly reduce the distance you have to run after you get killed.","April 29","true","88.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I just personally would like to see it be a little more smooth, such as in terraria.\n\nAll in all though, if you are looking for a game similar to Minecraft or Terraria, but want something new and fresh for you I would say this is probably a good choice.\n\nWill add more info after playing longer.","April 27","true","0.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game is a port of it's sequel, Junk Jack X, to the PC. It controls well enough, but some of the manuvers that made moving around in the original version are impossible thanks to the lack of touch controls. The trade off to keyboard is well worth that sacrifice though. The main pull to Junk Jack, at least for me, is not the digging or the crafting or all the standard crafting game features. It's the fat loot. Useless, decorative trinkets that can be found all over the place and displayed prominantly on shelves, tables, and display cases. Junk Jack (X) appears to have toned down the drop chances of these bits of loot, which makes them all the more precious when you find them. The game has a large amount of these useless trinkets, hence the name "Junk Jack." Junk Jack (X) comes with a couple new features as far as the series is concerned. One of those is character customization, another is multiplayer. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, so no comment on it from me. Apparently, Junk Jack (X) has other planets you can visit, but I have yet to see them, though from video and screenshots, they look pretty good.\n\nJunk Jack is a naturally very quiet game, with little bits of music popping in infrequently to break up the silence. Ambient noise is provided by nearby creatures such as birds, cats, dogs, cows, sheep, pigs, deer, bears, boar, rats, zombies, skeletons, slimes, etc. etc. etc. The number of creatures their are to mutilate is fantastic.\n\nOne major issue I have though, is the price tag. Junk Jack (X) is a decent investment of around 5$, On the PC it would be a decent buy for 7 or 8 bucks. Junk Jack for PC costs 15$. Fifteen dollars doesn't seem like a lot, but for a game like Junk Jack, it is a lot. I'd put junk jacks price tag at the low end of "overpriced." I have a metaphorical "bin" where I put overpriced games, Junk Jack would be resting right on the edge of that bin, staring down at games like prison architect, clockwork empires, Age of Empires 3, that game where you are trying to escape from prison that I am having trouble remembering the name of, and oblivion while I sit nearby trying to decide whether to push Junk Jack into the bin or not.\n\nOh yeah, and another issue? Junk Jack released compiled for windows 10, so most people couldn't play it right away until pixbits (the developer) released a patch. The patch came quick, but the damage was done. To Pixbits credit though, they have been running damage control very effectively, being fairly polite to people with issues, and helping as best they can.\n\nI recommend this game, but I also caution you. Think long and hard if 15$ is what you want to pay for this game.","April 28","true","34.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was a huge fan of Junk Jack X on IOS so I was very excited to see it on steam (finally! physical keys to press!) I've been happy to see that they've been diligently patching any launch issues immediatly as they arose. The game runs really great now, the movement is smooth and the loot is plentiful. You'd never know this was a mobile port because everything translates pretty seemlessly. For you die-hard crafting fans, theres even Manual Crafting, where you actually place your materials in a grid, ala Minecraft PC style. There are multiple planets to explore, all with with unique biomes. Of course this game isn't perfect, but it's got great potential and already a lot going for it that outweighs any negatives. This game is a welcome addition to the ever expanding Sandbox Platformer genre and I look forward to seeing what they do with it on this new platform.","May 2","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It reeks of its "Early Access" tag. My friend and I have both had problems with character and save data deleting itself, random glitches within the game like tooltips not working and blocks not placing, multiplayer lobbies bringing up false error codes and a multiplayer system that works on and off. While the multiplayer system feature is clearly "Experimental", that doesn't mean it should be broken to the degree that it is. Not recommended until this game is in a more presentable state. The positive reviews are from people that bought it immediately after its release because its original version was on iPhone and they were really reviewing that game.\n\nAnd here come the downvoting, idiot kiddie fanboys whose parents bought them iPhones at the age of 4. These are legitimate problems, I didn't say anything about the game itself and people need to be warned about these problems before dropping $15.","April 28","false","19.4"," 9 of 46 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","9","46","2","2"
