"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KouNkatherine/recommended/380600/","KouNkatherine","Pluviophile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KouNkatherine/","137 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is aiming to be a fishing simulator, realistic fish habits, movement, etc. It's not too realistic that it takes away the fun of it being a game. It's very different from other fishing games I've played. I'd love to see what updates they add to make the game even better. It has a lot of kinks but I expected as much.\n\nPros:\n- F2P\n- Not pay to win, you can only buy exp boost or extra credits (earned by just playing the game)\n- Lots of unique features from other fishing games\n- Not just a "catch & reel" game\n- Easy to learn after a while\n- Different fishing methods\n- Pretty graphics/animations\n- Other players are pretty helpful, especially when trying to learn a new area\n- All DLC content are just items obtainable in-game\n\nCons:\n- Tutorial is bad, by bad I mean, confusing + teaches you almost nothing\n- Really heavily targeted at fishers right now\n- F1 (help/keybinds) is messy, they should probably color code it\n- By multiplayer it means it has a chatbox in-game (Hopefully they're adding other players or something like that)\n\nOverall still a great game, and one of the best fishing games I've played. If you have time, want to try something new, or enjoy fishing, give the game a shot.","August 14, 2015","true","73.7"," 152 of 169 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","152","169","7","7"

They will ban you because of it and give any excuse other than the truth. They keep upsetting a lot of people with their attitude in the forums, short answers and lies too. Before the last update they promised more XP for Common fish and Trophy fish, but they lied and put the XP down on ALL fish types and upset the community. Now they're banning people and without warning, even though posting in the forums that people will get a warning first! I wouldn't trust them so far as to throw them. If i were you steer well clear of this. It isn't that good anyhow, well not anymore!\n\nNow this developer has the audacity to accuse me of abuse thrown at their developement team on my REVIEW!!! See people this is the sort of thing you have to put up with, a bunch of LIARS, nothing more, just plain liars. I did NOT give them abuse, I have witnesses to the fact, that was BEFORE they took DOWN MY POST IN THEIR FORUMS, to hide the truth no doubt!\n\nOH and another thing ALEX, you NEVER WARNED ME AT ALL (again you lied) you just BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING YOU LIAR!!!!!!\n\nThey DON'T like NEGATIVE feedback and try their damndest to get rid of it, they ban you if they don't like what you say, they accuse you of things that you didn't do and don't allow you to protest. Take this on board before you get into playing their simulator.\n\nHERE's PROOF;\n\nThis is part of the evidence within their forum (the rest has been deleted by them);\n\n\nalex  [developer] 3 Sep @ 6:01pm\nOriginally posted by spotme_2:\nYou didn't warn me before you banned me! Why? And in particular the reason you gave wasn't sufficient. You should have a word blocker in place to prevent anbody being offended in the first place. I used a few bad words, but none were aimed at anybody within the lobby, yet you banned me hours later...All i've been doing is trying to do is help others so that they can enjoy your simulator, so basically doing you guys a favour in reality, and this is what I get? Really poor guys, really poor. And now you post this, saying you will always make warnings before banning...?\nYes, we banned users without warning lately but from now we shall give a chance to correct the post prior to ban.\nLast edited by alex; 3 Sep @ 6:\n\n\nNow hide that truth ALEX the LIAR DEVELOPER!!!! YOU BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING. That was out of order and you damn well know it, you lied on more than one occasion, and because I pointed this out you banned me from your damn forum, so don't tell more lies and accuse me on my review, that I gave abuse towards your team, because the evidence is there for ALL to see how you people are!\n\nFREEDOM OF SPEECH you liar!\n\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!\n\nFootnote:-\nWell said Nordek. If they had simply warned me instead of a ban without warning, I would simply had stopped doing what they wanted me not to do, and I would have just carried on playing it. But they went too far (especially Alex) and gave me another ban without warning from their forums because I asked why the ban, and pointed out that they lied about the raising of the XP on Common & Trophy fish, basically I was seeking the real truth behind why they banned me.\n\nFurthermore he then slanted me on my very own review of their simulator with more lies, accusing me of abusing their staff, and basically saying that's the reason they banned me and also lied about warning me to be simply polite! I've been nothing but polite in every way possible, however he took something personal and turned into something rather pathetic to say the least and certainly over the top in banning me for what can only be seen as helping others with trying to catch Unique fish. Which by the way others do frequently day by day on their simulator. Which makes me wonder if they banned me for doing just that, are they then saying they are going to ban all that do that very thing, just because they don't like it...? Seems rather silly to ban people over something harmless as helping others enjoy their simulator, which in my opinion would simply help them to grow...But hey, what do I know?","September 3, 2015","false","186.8"," 248 of 325 people (76%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","76","248","325","24","71"

As it turns out, Fishing Planet is a kick bass simulator that has hands-down the most in-depth modeling of fishing as a whole. Licenses, catch/keep systems, leader lengths, tackle box storage, real and artificial baits...it's all here.\n\nEverything from fish activity cycles to river drift is modeled in a way that's accurate, but still fun enough that you won't want the developer's head on a pike for making something that's as slow as the real thing is sometimes. The early game can be annoying since panfish are near-worthless for leveling up and will often make it difficult to get at the more valuable channel cats, which is a load of carp, but once you get over that hump, your options quickly open up for gear and species, and fights can become really cutthroat.\n\nI played a lot of fishing games back on the NES/SNES, and even for someone as pickerel about their fishing games as I am, I'm enjoying Fishing Planet a lot.\n\n...salmon.","August 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 68 of 83 people (82%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","82","68","83","61","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fragile_illusion/recommended/380600/","fragile_illusion","White.Renard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fragile_illusion/","253 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEasily the best fishing game out there and not because there aren't many fishing games out there but because the game does a great job at immersion with beautiful visuals and audio and you can just relax.\nOf course by relaxing, I don't mean that the game is easy, if you want to go for small fish go ahead, that's easy, but if you want some nice largmouth bass you gotta work for it!\n\nDetailsThe game is full of small little awesome details. Like I only realized recently that there are actual fishes in the lake! I always thought that the game was random and it assigned a fish to your hook (based on location and bait etc...) when you caught one, but no that's not how it works! You can see them if the water is clear and shallow! They move around your bait, poke it, hit it and if you're convicing enough, they'll bite it!\n\nLearning curveFirst thing I'd like to mention is that, you don't need to have any actual fishing experiences in real life to be able to play and enjoy this game!\n\nThe game can be hard at first, specially after you level up once or twice, all the new equipments that unlock can be overwhelming. There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game but it doesn't cover a lot of the stuff you'll need to catch bigger fish later in the game. So you'll have to look up tutorials and read item descriptions to figure out how to work with the new rod you just bought.\n\nAlthough there are some pop up tutorials here and there after you level up, catch a new fish or buy something new, I'm not sure exactly how they are triggered, but they give you some essentional info about for example how to catch a new type of fish.\n\nFuzzy Logic, No RandomnessAlso there isn't an element of randomness to this game when it comes to catching fish, by that I mean that the game uses a fuzzy logic recognition system.\n\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that when you're trying to catch a fish by for example a retrieval method like Stop&Go (there are multiple retrieval methods in the game), your consistancy in luring the fish determines the quality of the fish. That's not randomness, that's as close as you can get to real life simulation! I love these devs!\n\nThe DevelopersSpeaking of the devs, they are great and they know what they're doing. They are active and constantly fixing the game and notifying about the server's status etc...\n\n\nTL;DRIt's an awesome fishing game, with some suprising great little details. Try it, you won't regret it! No need for real life fishing experiences.\n\n8.5/10","August 24, 2015","true","21.5"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","46","51","5","1"

A 0.7 kg smallmouth redlining a 9.1k line on a 10.5 kg reel on a heavy rod ? At half drag setting ?\n- What EXACTLY does the message 'Fish tried to bite and escaped'  ? Specualtion is , hook size is wrong but that doesnt make sense as the same hook can catch a 5.1 kg striper and a 0.9 kg smallmouth , so what fish is struggling to take that hook ?\n\nThese questions could be easily answered and the whole debacle put away for good, but no answer.\n\nThere is also the unrealistic mechanics in place, like...\n\n- Catching 'uniques' , you dont just fish away and have a 'whopper' take your bait... nope you check online videos or lists, or your own excel spreadsheets for 'proper timing and rigs' and fast forward time to the 'correct window' and for an in game hour or two you try catch 'uniques'. You cant be patiant as the time is ticking away, the window is small and the in game time is accellerated.\n\n- The game gives you charts that show when the fish activity is at its highest, but that doesnt include 'uniques' , outside that particular window they are close for business utterly.\n\n- The game has 2 types of in game stores to buy tackle and baits, the megastore that has everything but you cant use it when at a fishing location, you have to leave the location and then access the megastore, and the pay travel to return to your fishing location. There are store local to the fishing location but they make no sense, more often than not they will not stock the bait you need for that location (Wax Worms for Sunfish in Cali - not in the Cali shop).\n\n- Hope you dont like catfish or panfish, they aint worth a damn according to this game, nope you need to catch bass, pike and Salmon for any decent exp and rewards.\n\n- Physics are mess, the fish will be staring at the sky with thier tails facing the bottom yet pulling on your line while being dragged sideways while the fish is in a vertical posture. You will often need to drag fish through the ground, your rod will attempt to use ninja clone techniques while fishing (double rods) and your fisherman will often reveal that they are blue aliens when the skin colour 'washes' off.\n\nDefenders of the title will pull out the old Early Access defence, yet  the title has 4 current DLC packs and has had 2 event DLC packs, 6 DLC packs since August, yet the title has numerous mechanical faults which have been brought up pre-early access during its close beta period, and not addressed.\n\nLooks good, feels good but is not a very good simulator. the more time you invest the harder it gets to ignore the cracks but the developers seem to be staring at stars if you look at their 'roadmap' ... cars, boats, houses, worldwide locations, customisable avatars... they havent even got the basics down yet, nor even added features that should of been in place long ago like quests and tournaments.\n\nIt is the better fishing sim, but in a rather limited race and with very poor competitors its hardly much of a endorsement.\nTry it out but dont expect much in terms of simulation... its a casual feels good looks good arcade game, with some bare minimal simulation.","December 9, 2015","false","293.2"," 155 of 223 people (70%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","70","155","223","22","16"

You're right, it isn't exciting, but you're missing the point. It's meant to be a relaxing diversion, and that it certainly is.\nThe tutorials have recently been updated and have greatly improved the ability for new fishers to learn to play, too. I still recommend checking out some player-made guides and tutorials, but they're no longer vital.\n\nThe thing that sets this fishing game apart in particular is how tactile the controls feel.

I've been dying for a fishing game that's worth anything since sega dreamcast was around.   I want this title to do well, this game has all the right ideas, all the things I would want in a fishing game.   Since it is early access I won't harp on game mechanics and physics as I know they will improve.  My biggest problem with the game is its just not fun.  Let me explain, in Fl in real life I go to a lake I can catch many species using the same bait by adjusting I how I present it to the fish, where I'm from bass,bluegill,catfish,etc,etc will eat a nightcrawler.  It may not be optimal but it happens.  In this game its not like that at all, I find myself searching guides after frustration sets in.  You then find to catch this species you cast in this exact spot, during this time period, with exact leader setting at this amount, using this exact lure or bait and then grind for hours using that exact setup.  There isn't really any rng.  Once you get the xp needed to reach next lake you then go to guides find exact spot and grind for hours on the next fish.  To me thats not fun.\n\nIf you don't like grinding you can spend 150$+ of real money to get the better lures, and xp boosts.   I probably don't play this game mostly because of the costly dlc that comes out that you need to buy if you don't want to play for 12 hours a day to compete with others.   The very first day this game came to steam I spent 20$ for a weekly boost of some sort and it does not go by game time it goes by real time so it forces you to play alot to make it feel its worth it purchase.   I would rather this game be 40$ and come with all content then claim to be free to play.   Its free to play to get you in the door then when you feel the grind you pay out the A##.","December 26, 2015","false","30.5"," 101 of 149 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","101","149","10","9"

I had a reel drop from 95% to broken on ONE fish. It must have been a nice one, but I'll never know.\nI have been fishing for 55 YEARS, and I have NEVER broken a reel in my entire life.  Only one of MANY changes that have resulted in a BAD experience with this game as it is now.  I've lost several thousand in-game bucks since the new & improved version came out.  Can't afford to travel anymore, lose too much $.  No more big fish; even with modest drag settings, the line (or reel or pole) breaks because you can't retrieve the fish.  Still limited access to the trophy & unique fish because of very poorly placed paths & clear areas.  Wear & tear on the equipment?   Totally unrealisitc.  Of course if they make it wear out quickly, you have to but it more often.... but really?   I'm still using the rod & reel set my GrandDad got me for my 13th birthday.

First of all the game is absolutely beautiful, the environments are very natural and serene. The water dynamics like ripples and splashes in the water are amazing. Also there are many locations and over 34 types of fish with more of both to be added in the future.\n\nThe fishing is very realistic, sometimes you can almost subconsciously feel your mouse tremble as you see a nibble and set the hook. The fight of the fish is very satisfing especially with big ones, where battles can last over five minutes.\n\nFishing Planet is a very relaxing type of game that you can lose hours playing. It's one of those games that you don't have to be constantly at the keyboard. You can sit back and relax while playing or get up and walk around to strech your legs, go get a snack, yet your still in the game.\n\nThe game works on a level based system where you earn XP points by catching fish. As you increase yor XP, your level rises. Higher levels allow you access to better rods, reels, baits, lures and tackle in general. Higher levels also allow you access to the other locations where the fish get a lot bigger thus the need for better gear.\n\nThe best kind of free to play model, you don't have to pay for anything. You can purchase three things with real money; in-game cash, a premium account which gives you increased xp for catching fish and DLC packs. None of these are required to play the game however. You have complete access to everything in the game for free, with the exeption of having to grind a little to earn the higher tier locations and equipment.\n\nThis game is in early-access which means it is basically an alpha. Which also means it is not completely finished and has aspects of gameplay not yet added like boats, free roaming and multi-player. These features will be added in the near future but the lack of them still does not undermine the playability of the game. Even without these features the game is still wonderful to play. It also has bugs and game mechanics that will be rebalanced as well. This is the nature of all early-access games. I played a few early-access games and this one is in much better shape than your average early-access game, try it for yourself.\n\nIn closing, Fishing Planet is completely free to play, is a small download about 2gigs and runs well on even lousy computers. Highly addictive and also very satisfying as well, what do you have to lose? Fishing Planet is an absolutely a must own game if you are any fan of fishing.\n\n","October 16, 2015","true","415.9"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","44","56","4","3"

Despite the hours I've clocked up, I can't recommend this game in it's current state..... it's unrealistic and more importantly it's no longer fun.\n\nThis was a very nice game prior to the last update but I've decided I can't justify throwing any more of my cash at "♥♥♥♥ Turpin" style developers who don't really give a toss about the playing community.\n\nI added up my previous purchases of Premium Time/DLC (which I hasten to add, I had no qualms in buying to fully enjoy all aspects of the game at the time) and it totalled £137.66p.\nI happen to think that's more than enough "support" for any early access game and I'm walking away from the game now to cut my losses.\n\nThe latest DLC package alone costs more than the majority of full games on Steam and that's just ridiculous for a few bits of virtual tackle.\n\nI'll go further and state that there is no way that this game should be flagged up as Early Access on the store page.  This game was a polished product (it isn't after the last major update)  being kept in early access by the developers to give them "free reign" to take more money from the players and allow them to change anything they want (even if unpopular with players) whenever they want.\n\nThis is effectively denying the community of any input at all as to how they would like to see the game go forward.\n\nFishing Planet in my opinion, could be fixed by simply selling it for a one time buy price, include options in game to adjust difficulty as required, and support it with regular free updates.  Unfortunately the developers currently appear to be more interested in creating a "cash cow" and taking the players for everything they can get.\n\nI've attached an example below to show how desperate the developers are now getting to take your hard earned in-game cash off you.  This was a response to a player who respectfully asked why he was still fined in game bucks after releasing a prohibited fish he had accidently pulled in. If it wasn't so dismissive and vague you could mistake it for a  joke but it isn't!\n\n\nOfficer 23 Mar @ 10:46pm\nOriginally posted by @@@@@@@:\nOriginally posted by @@@@@@@@@@:\n\nOfficer Response: In real life there are prohibited fish. You can not lift them out of the water. You would be fined if you keep them or not.\n\nPlayer:What are some examples of this? In my state, if you accidentally catch a fish that's out of season, there are no fines associated with it unless you keep it as far as I know.\n\nOfficer: I can't speak for areas other than my own but a simple goggle search of "prohibited fish" will show various species in various states.\n\nNote: I've taken the names out in respecting the privacy of the posters but you can check out the time link and trace it if you need clarification.  The original question created quite a long thread but the developers weren't for moving on this one.","March 14","false","526.9"," 48 of 64 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","48","64","5","0"

You gain xp/levels for catching fish, the better the fish the better the xp, the same is said for cash which you use to purchase things like new tackle,bait,Licences and moving home to a new state should you wish. Gold is a kind of Special currency only aquired by catching really nice fish called "unique's" (you can also purchase gold using real money should you wish) you can use said gold to purchase special items, These Include : special baits, premium rods and reel's and better wearable equipment.\n\nMY experience in Fishing planet- having bought a couple of the DLC packs i thought ide have a look to see if anythings on sale considering its black friday, and i noticed there was so i decided to buy a 360 day premium pack, shortly after buying i noticed the pack hadnt apeared in my ingame inventory like normal when i purchased the DLC so i thought ide leave it a while since the servers had just come back up after some maintence, but still nothing, i thought it must have had somthing to do with the maintence that had just happend. so i decided to email surport and query what had happend.\nThe staff responded Quickly, They are also really pleasant and profesional and after a few emails back and forth solved my problem.\nYou can really tell These developers do Care about there players and about making there game better.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this considering the tarnish that some early acess games/Dev teams leave on players.\n\nOverall this is a really enjoyable game and i cant reccomend it enough to anyone who likes Fishing or even if you've never been fishing in real life but want to give it a try.\n\nTotaly worth the time and money ive spent on this game.","November 27, 2015","true","131.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

Update brings a lot of nonsense to almost all parts of the game ultimately gimping gear, fishing mechanic and fish AI.\n\n- Update 0.3.7 doesn't fix anything (durability system is still broken/gimped, values for gear strength are messed up and so on...) and brings even more issues with bucket full of boring content. There is nothing more anticlimactic than small pond (which they call a lake haha) filled with pretty much same small fishes which are on starting location in this game.\n\n- Developer bans people for bringing up negatives about the game on the forum. They keep ignoring any negative opinions even when opinion is supported by loads of valid arguments and facts. Basically if you have negative opinion and you want to share it on the forum TO HELP THEM UNDESTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GAME YOU ARE VIEWED AS HATER.\nIt doesn't matter how many facts and valid arguments is behind you .. you still are treated as hater whos "supposedly" attacking developer and they will remove you from forum.\nIt's pretty much gaming version of "Amy's Baking Company" from Kitchen Nightmares.\n\n- Their Early Access statement is just one big pile of bs:\n"...our team is aiming to deliver the most realistic and fun sportfishing experience..."\n"...Our main priority is to ensure uncompromised realism of the fishing experience..."\nUpdate 0.3.0 is putting this statement to the grave.\n\n"we intend to use Early Access to polish everything out by fixing any bugs and introducing new features with the help of your feedback"\nThey not only not polishing things they IGNORE feedback and push low quality/broken content while adding new DLC for 30-45 euro. Greed at it's finest....\n\n"...should take us approximately four months, with a full release planned for November 2015."\nThey claimed to have game polished in around 4 months... it's been 10 MONTHS and they not only didn't polished anything they also are nowhere near releasing this game. Game in current state is all over the place with bugs, gimped mechanics and psychics. Just mess...\n\n- Moderator deleting video evidence of game breaking bugs on the forum. Gives false excuses saying that my line broke becasue it was at 0% when in video clearly is on 94% and keeps talking about me not using "pro" meters which would show that my line is at low % which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becasue its irrelevant what meter i use. The point is that small fish broke heavy line and it shouldn't happen so they want to hide it by deleting any evidence.\nGame is broken and it's reflected in 0.8kg fish breaking 3.6kg (and even 4.5kg) braided line like it's made of paper.\nEvidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDkBkwxkeeo\n\n- Most of positive reviews is bogus and there are even threads on the forum calling people up to deal with negative comments. I guess they want to do everything to boost dying game.\n\n- Developer which doesn't understand how bad his development strategy is:\nFP lost most of initial player base and after 0.3.0 even more ppl just left.\n\n- Developer making fishing game doesn't understand how fishing gear and physics works.\n\n- Another developer abusing Early Access,\n\n- Only one server:\nGame server is located in NA so Europe and rest of the world is screwed by over 130ms ping causing game to lag,\n\n- Bad development decisions:\nThey working on VR when almost no one can use it or can't afford it while delaying development of more important key components.\n\n- Quantity over Quality:\nThey keep adding stuff without polishing audiovisial components and mechanics to setup solid base. They keep changing and messing up what was working fine.\n\n- Some sounds can get annoying to the point where you turn of sound or there are sound which shouldn't be there,\n\n- Recommended System Requirements are a joke:\nMy specs are above it and on max settings i get avr. 25fps while facing water.\n\n- Outdated glitchy and average graphic:\nOn low setting it looks like something from 2005. On full setting foliage still looks bad... only water and lilypads looks good but game cause PC to sweat like it's some freaking Witcher 3 or Crysis,\nOur "avatar" in the game is like some weird human shaped alien which glides above ground... Srly???!!! They could deal with it in a creative way... oh wait they aren't creative.\n\n- Graphic lag/Freezes/Client - Server lag:\nBasically everything from switching windows in UI, switching rods or people posting on chat cause performance issues sometimes to the point when you get 3-4 second freezes or you can't cast lure properly,\n\n- Complete lack of optimization:\nGame is so many moths in development not to mention 8 in early access and they still didn't optimize game,\n\n- Boredom caused by how easy to catch are biggest fishes:\nIt ain't unique/trophy fish if you can catch 10+ of them in one IRL afternoon.\nBasically game spoils player with trophy and unique fishes being childishly easy to catch.\n\n- Grind:\nThere is nothing funny in catching over 300 fishes all pretty much same size just to be able to move on to next level,\n\n- Boring  grind events:\nBasically grind based event where you spend few IRL days to get useless rewards,\nLack of creativity is they key problem.\n\n- Irrational decision making:\nBasically they make decision which doesn't make sense e.g.  crankbait have damage indicator but soft plastic lure doesn't... rod is damaged while it's not even under load... and so on...\n\n- Rubbish, ridiculous and overpriced  DLC's with existing Pay to Win factor:\nRight now if you buy DLC you get mostly gear which is for free in the game + 3 rubbish skins for ONLY!! 45 euro... what a nonsense.\nAgain lack of creativity is the key problem.\n\nFP developers: Good DLC is affordable by everyone even those who gain steam money by playing other games so 1.99 euro is perfect price which everyone can afford and support your game. On another hand balanced DLC have content which doesn't add pay to win factor and still brings something fun to the game, e.g. custom made crankbait's with regulated lip/weight or fishing rods with custom shaped handles and "accessories" on it + custom textures, etc.\n\n\nI do not recomend this game and play it only if you're desperate person. At first it can feel good and you can have a bit of fun but soon enough grind will kick in and all the bugs and glitches in the game combined with grind and boredom will simply make you angry to the point where you will uninstall.\nOnly thing keeping this game alive is group of scrubs ready to spend 30 euro on DLC ;)\n\nMy prediction: This game will end like Euro Fishing.","March 27","false","558.4"," 60 of 87 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","60","87","10","7"

Even their website only says "Play the game", yea, nice joke, but no chance to contact them.\n\nUntil that crap isn't handled, I have to say: nope, can't recommend that.\n\nSo if anyone can tell me what to do, that would be nice.\n\n/Edit\nSo people told me the developers are "pretty responsive" on Facebook. Ok, I just deleted my Facebook account because of reasons. I don't want to go back. I have this game on Steam, the developers need to have a contact support system, like a mail address, or contact on the Steam forums, which they don't. Nowhere in the game or here you can even find out who developed this game.\n\nOther people tell me that I am stupid and should log in every day for the bonus credits you get this way. Good idea, I only need somewhat above 2000 credits, so by this method I would need... months of logging in into a game I can not play, just because the developers don't have a support system so I can't tell them about this bug a lot of people have, according the forum threads.\n\nSo please stop calling me stupid or giving this review a thumbs down or calling me troll. I do liked this game, it was pretty relaxing, but I can not play it anymore because of some very stupid bugs, which are bugs and not game related things that I did wrong. It's a bug when you don't play a game for weeks and the game tells you after coming back "Well sorry, you now need 2000 credits to play this game, but if you tell anyone on Steam they will say you are a troll, and by the way you can't contact us.

Until you get to the grind. If you are looking for a fishing simulator I would honestly wait for maybe a year and see where this game is in that time. Fishing isnt about catching and I dont believe the devs and many people actually realise this, its about the thrill of catching the fish, the fight and the thought that you have the chance to not catch anything or catch a fish that you can put in your personal records or the local newspaper. I am level 17 in this game right now and have caught hundreds of fish, If I was on a trawler boat sure I would accept that number but once you are grinding from what I have gathered 313 fish to get 25000 xp for level 18 to get to a new lake and actually catch some decent fish is rediculous, the process of getting this 25000 xp is pretty grueling requiring you to constantly fish the same old bass in the same old spot at the same old time with the same old lure with no real skill involved (promised dynamic fishing system not implemented). So the only way to get this XP is through "Farming" call it what you want this is not fishing its catching, when it gets to the point you are catching a fish every cast every day on the same lure it is catching, after a while this is no longer fun. When discussing this I have had the typical "well go fish somewhere else" "stop calling it farming and you will eventually stop thinking it is a grind". I am sorry but since I spent nearly a month in each of these spots "farming" it is boring and also ineficient as the lower level places give you less XP as you expect. Sure its a fishing game but not a simulation game like advertised which is sad to me. I thought the game would be fun and exciting after the new fish fights, It didnt. The only I see to really fix this game is to remove this XP system completely let people fish again, let them have fun, not every game needs to be about one upping people of stats, let people fish a spot and try to catch the biggest fish to drive a competition, lower the frequency of catches and the game becomes a fishing SIM the way it should be. Keep the money system and add more premium currencey tackle for revenue but please for the love of god dont turn this in to what everyone is comparing to a fishing MMO where it is no longer fishing. Even a license system like the hunter would do me but everyone knows that that would never work because funding a f2p game is a bad thing as as soon as money becomes involved it is p2p (Sarcasm)...","October 20, 2015","false","87.4"," 68 of 104 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","68","104","4","5"

Where before I was pulling in a decent number of good-sized bass with my spinning rod and jigs, suddenly I go hours without a single bite. I went an entire 2 days of a rather expensive fishing trip not getting a nibble, on a lake that had always been super productive the day before, and yes I was fishing with the right bait, rod, reel, hook, and at the right time of day. I went from 3 dozen trophy bass in a few days to no fish at ALL.  Needless to say, it was obvious they had made a change to the game that decreased the number of strikes bigtime.\n\nTo make the game more "Realistic?" Maybe. After all, who can really go to a lake and catch 20 23 lb bass in 4 hours? But you know what I have to say to that? If I want super-realism, I can get in my car and drive to my local lake and stand around for half the day casting and reeling and not catch a single fish. The reason I want a fishing GAME is so I can escape to a fantasy world where I can catch a lot of fish, unlike in real life where I basically suck at it! And no I'm not saying the game should be some easy joke where anyone can just grab a pole and catch a ton of trophy fish, no skills required. But for those of us who took the time to learn the right equipment to use, the right baits that work with the right kinds of fish, the right times of day, and the right techniques to use to catch each fish (stop and go, slow and straight, lift and drop, etc.) - we should be rewarded with good catches! And yes, plenty of them!\n\nNot sure if this is a temporary setback, or not, but time will tell. I can say that if the game mechanics have now been changed to the point where I have to sit around for hours at my monitor not catching a damn thing - just like in real life - then I probably won't play Fishing Planet any longer. Plenty of other games I can escape into for a few hours to get away from reality that provide the rewards I'm looking for in a game.","September 18, 2015","false","73.7"," 48 of 71 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","48","71","4","0"

This game is so good I am spending part of my Fishing Planet time to write this.\nI love everything about this game except one thing, which i will get to.\n\nFirst the pros:\n\n1. The amount of details the developers put into this game is unreal. Every fish species has its habitat you have to fish for it in just as in real life and the habitats are true to life. Even the action of the lure you are using is a big factor just like real life. Same with the bait. Just like fishing in real life combine all those factors and execute your cast and retreival properly and you may have a chance at the fish your hoping for. Odd are though, that it will be just another Bluegill.\n\n2. For an early access game, in my experience this has the least amount of bugs, personally I haven't experienced any.That being said I have heard in game that others have been experiencing visual glitches. As for game mechanics, i have heard nothing.\n\n3. The graphics are quite decent and doesn't bog my graphics card down much, if at all, and im running max settings on an old NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460. The water looks good, pretty realisic. The only thing i would say is add a little more such as the occasional fish jump and more to the fishing gear section such as sunglasses. So if your wearing polarized shades you can see past the glare and be able to see the fish underwater. I know that would be a lot to add but it would just improve the overal appeal of the game and add to the realism of the fishing in this game.\n\nThe only con is the license system. Now i know this game revolves around realism but come on, the only thing worse than buying a license to fish in real life is buying one in a game. Every. Time. You. Go. On. A. Fishing. Trip. Unless you wanna spend an absurd amount of in game money for several months worth of fishing.\nHere's the thing, I live in Upstate New York, The We'll Charge You For Everything Except Taking A Shi%, Oh Wait We Charge For That Too State. and i only have to buy one once a year. And only for a measly 20 bucks at WalMart. I am just glad they don't make you pay real life money for in game licenses, or else i wouldn't play. But catching fish doesnt earn that much money especially when fishing trips in game are ridiculously expensive coupled with expensive fishing licenses. But if i wanted to not be able to afford to go on a fishing trip i would just shut off my computer and sit at my desk and not go on a fishing trip. Lower the prices of travel and licenses, but if you want to keep the prices so expensive have the fish earn more money seeing as that is your only source of income.\n\nOther than that i love this game and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I know some random guy's rating doesnt matter much but ill give it a 9/10, and if the income and/or prices change for the better ill change it to 10/10.","August 24, 2015","true","47.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","23","28","2","0"

These are not currently part of the game, therefore negative review. I understand that this game is in Early Access, and because of this it can't be judged in the same way as a fully released title, but if it was at least mentioned in the store description that multiplayer had yet to be implemented I wouldn't mind. But the fact is that multiplayer is advertised in several locations on the store page, even though there is literally no sign of it being even close to available within the game itself. Therefore, negative review for false advertising or clickbait, whatever you want to call it.","September 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","52","82","2","1"

Not perfect, but absolutely better than the competition.\n\nPros:\nImmensely diverse range of tackle, gear and baits. This is kind of a double edged sword as the depth of options makes for a steep learning curve; selecting the right gear for the right species is problematic, especially for starting  players. One needs only to take note of the subject matter within the in game chat channel--this almost invariably consists of players asking 'which hook/leader length/area do I need to catch X fish'. That said, I don't think the brevity of tackle options should be considered a negative. This balanced a little bit by the number of guides and info videos available online--most of what you need to learn can be gathered pretty handily outside of the game.\n\nThere is a wide vvariety of fish to taget and while most do share similar rig preferences, there's still enough nuance required in order to land trophy and unique specimens which makes for good challenges.Calender events serve as a way for players to catch fantasy fish which are worth fair amounts of in-game currency, which can be used to purchase the best gear and baits. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, although special offers do come along seasonally which gives people the option to purchase extremely high end gear at lower levels--in this sense, the game is technically pay to win. Fighting fish is a fun, and unlike Euro Fishing, the physics which govern these are intuitive and intelligible;  striking, reeling and lure retrieval mechanics are all well concieved  and work consistently, and solidly. The graphics are pretty good for an in dev game, ambient noise is realistic, and the locales are pretty enough to look at.\n\nCons:\nPerhaps ironically, Fishing Planet is possibly too realistic. Missed strikes, incorrect rig, lure and bait choices can result in lots of time spent winding or watching a float bob for no result. It pays to do your  research before heading out. It is also quite grindy; levelling is slow especially in the teens, and this is exacerbated by the fact that gear access is level restricted. In order to catch fish which yield worthwhile cash and experience  relative to your level, you often find yourself needing gear you can't access. The result is that you wind up grinding out fish which are no challenge to catch, and yield little rewards and experience.It's a bit off kilter and hopefully the devs correct this in the future as this is probably the biggest, and most monotonous flaw in the game.\n\nAs far as I can tell, unique and trophy fish seem to drop at inconsistent rates depending on the species. Trophy catfish in the starting area are common, yet you can expect to reel in dozens of bass before landing a trophy specimen. Post patch, alligator gar have become impossibly rare, whereas unique redear sunfish are caught hand over fist. It's a broekn system which requires an overhaul.\n\nOverall, and  considering that Fishing Planet is pre-release, it's definitely well worth playing. The foundations for something great are all there, It just needs some refinement. And there's enough to keep you interested in the interim.\n\nScore: 6/10","April 1","true","152.7"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","29","41","4","0"

O'Neill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonathanJOneill/","378 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA wonderful fishing game thats a little rough around the edges.\n\nThis is an early access review of Fishing Planet. As of this writing, the game is currently on version 0.3.8 with an average update cyle of one every other week. I also have 400 hours in this title since August of 2015. I am a liesurely angler and have only recently reached level 21 in game.\n\nFishing Planet is what I would consider a pseudo-simulator. The primary goal of the game is to relax and fish, though tournament style fishing is planned. As anyone who has fished in real life would know, you're never guaranteed a catch. This is the main point where Fishing Planet leaves the "true" simulation. It must balance gameplay with realism, and as such, catch rates are generally higher than what you would find in real life. On the other hand, you are offered a wider variety of rods, reels, lines, tackle, bait and misc. equipment designed to target a range of fish in a range of situations. You then couple all those decisions with your retrieval style, such as straight retrieves, stop and go, lift and drop, among others.\n\nThat being said, what is planned and what we have currently are two different things. If you come into Fishing Planet at this time, expecting a perfect simulator, you will be disappointed. Fish currently have spawn boxes and set times when they spawn. Venture your lure outside this box or through this box at the wrong time of day and you won't find anything. Fish randomization is something the devs are working towards but, for the time being, the same general strategy is required. There are guides and spreadsheets detailing where to cast, when and with what lure/bait that will, hopefully, be rendered completely obsolete in the near future.\n\nThere is a leveling system in place to limit where you can fish and what fish you can realistically catch. You can't just hop into the game and expect to catch 20kg Muskie immediately. You'll first need to catch smaller fish worth experience and credits to level up and purchase new gear, as well as licenses to higher tier lakes. The devs have recently ended a test in regards to removed level locks on lakes, and as such, it may be removed on all lakes in the future. If that's the case, your only limiting factor will be gear. You will still have to earn your gear by leveling up or bypassing level locks by purchasing DLC packs focusing on certain gear types such as heavy float rods or ultralight tackle. These DLC are completely optional if you wish to take your time and fish.\n\nWaterways are currently limited to North America, specifically, the United States. However, there are plans for European and Asian waterways in the future. Fish species are diverse and dependant on where you are. Current species include, but are not limited to Gar (Alligator, Florida and Longnose), Bass (Largemouth, Smallmouth, White, Peacock and Striped), Catfish (Channel, Blue, Flathead), Panfish (Bluegill, Crappie, etc.), Pike, Trout, Salmon and more.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. Water physics are a sight to see. Ambient noise is great though some lakes can be a tad bit annoying to listen to.\n\nThere are some rough spots though. They range from physics (fishing launching into the air) to fish AI bugs (fish don't even bother fighting on ocassion) to equipment bugs (drag exerting tension on the line even when not under any load). None of them are major or game breaking, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary. I currently would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys fishing as a leisure sport. Perhap, once tournaments are added, more competitive anglers will have something of interest. Arcade anglers, however, I fear would not find this fu. There are no easy-mode toggles such as underwater cam, reel assist, automatic tensioners or the like. If you don't know how to fish from real life experience and are unwilling to learn the basics of how fishing gear works, you may find this a difficult title to pick up.\n\nJust remember that this IS Early Acess, which means things are always changing. As such, don't get too comfortable with how things are. If something is easy to exploit, expect it to be changed, if there's a bug, expect it to be fixed.","May 3","true","495.0"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","29","41","0","1"

Fish seems to be very localized on certain spots on the lake or the river. Once you know where to cast and what to use, you can pretty much ignore the rest of the lake  and concentrate on that one spot, at one specific time of day.  Imagine, throwing your bait at the same distance, the same location and using the same technic to catch the same fish.  Sure, it probably works for bluegills and sunfish in real world, but you won't pull out 35 bass from 3 feet of water from the same spot. Trust me, you won't, unless you are fishing for farm raise fish in a fish farm pool.\nAround level 15, you may not be interested to move on or just cannot, due to the massive amount of fish you must catch to unlock the next area.\nInventory is still a mess.  The information given on your gear is just not enough.  You may match the wrong rod with the wrong reel and wrong line, and you can't throw too far.  You can also waste a lot of money buying all kinds of stuff and your inventory fills up, but you can't resell or trade. You can "delete" it, which doesn't make a lot of sense, game mechanics-wise.\nImagine, 3 different rods, different in price and one maybe 1 foot longer,but there aren't any other advantages. Yes, there are plenty of rod in the real world, but in a game, it's pointless to buy 3-4 rods that doesn't really make it better or worse.   Big and medium/medium heavy for t large fish (20 lbs +) ,  medium to medium/light for most of the freshwater fish (0-15 or even 20lbs) and light and ultralight for panfishing and maybe your typical trout.\nAreas with a lot of weed and dragging stuff on the bottom - use a medium/heavy , so it's easier to get out of snags or pull the fish out of the weed and grass.\nIn this game, you can buy the same rod 4-5 times, but theere aren't any major variations and there is a lack of info for beginner anglers or people who don't fish in the real world.\nOnce you go to a lake or a river, there isn't really a lot of variety. Placing sunfish and golden shiners as extra fish to fish for just doesn't work.  For example, if I'm fishing for northern pike, I know exactly the sizes I'm going catch, there isn't an accidental walleye or another fish or a truly great pike as a surprise.\nTechnics. Many of them are wrong.  Dragging a spinner on the bottom is unrealistic. The last thing you want to do (in real life) is drag yorur spinner bait on the bottom of a lake. Trust me. Dont' do it.\nIf I use a plastic worm, I will drag that on the bottom very slooowly, with frequent pauses.  If I use a plastic minnow, I twitch it in mid water or drop/lift it.\nIf i use live bait in a pike-heavy lake, I should catch a pike with it, or at least have a bite, if I'm pulling pikes out left and right with a spoon.\nUsing live worm, I should expect ANYTHING. Not just bluegills or small bass. Everything eats the worm, except a few vegetarian fish, (grass carp), which aren't in the game anyway.\nNo offense, but it seems like the developers only have a vague idea about fishing and got some things mixed up.\nReels do not brake so easily in real world. I can load up a smaller reel with a medium heavy line (14lbs, etc.) and If I get a snag, my line will snap before my reel goes bad, even with a 17lbs test line.\nSo while we can all say, that "yeah, this is a game and it's still early release", there are game elements incorporated already, which are just not realistic, while other aspects (fish are defined to certain radius within the lake) and the lack of variety makes this game tedious at best.","September 21, 2015","false","68.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","2"

Before update 0.3.0 back in March this was without a doubt my favorite game and I played it any time I had a bit of free time to do so.\n\nAfter the update though the new fishing mechanics were/still are so unrealistic it’s more frustrating than it is fun. You’ll literally fight a fish for hours in game and hope that after all that work that this 5lb fish doesn’t completely spool your 30lb line in the end like it’s a shark or whale. I’d hoped they would fix this and kind of bring down to the level at which it was before the patch but so far we’ve still got these fish that are obviously on steroids.\n\nNever in my life have I broke a rod or reel. While they have slightly fixed this issue they still break way too easy in the game, I think we may be using glass rods and reels. They also made all gear wear out so now you need to repair everything pretty much constantly, which eats a good chunk of the profit you earn.  The only logic I see here is they wanted people to have to purchase more in game currency as before you could play the game 100% free (buying a membership grants you 50% increased experience so I always had a membership for the boost and to help support the game) with no issues. You still can but the less experienced/new players really seem to struggle now.\n\nTwo good things that came in the patch were the gear matching (however the way it’s setup means that having max rod slots is all but mandatory to avoid constant gear swapping) and they fixed the right mouse button spam that plagued the game. To be completely honest I wish they would have just fixed the right mouse button spamming and left the reset of the fishing mechanics alone as they were fine.\n\nIn the end it’s probably still the best fishing game out there however the player base has really dropped off in a short amount of time. I’ll keep hoping they bring the game back to its former glory but as for now I’ve all but completely stopped and I wont recommend the game in it's current state as the fun factor just isn't there anymore like it was before the big update.","May 23","false","66.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","2"

Probably the one of the best fishing sims I've played. You can do most things you can in real life like adjusting drag, jerking your rod to get free from snagging some weeds, choosing where and what time to fish, etc. I'm not gonna lie, it'll take you awhile to level up and you'll probably be catching a lot of bluegills when you first start because certain fish needs a certain bait and time of day to get. Not to mention where you cast on the body of water and how high or low you set your bobber/leader can also make a difference. Took me some time to get to level 3 so I can get the casting spoons for bass but when I got them, it was worth it. There's also an in-game chatbox where other players can chat with one another. I found this useful. The majority of the community is just great in this game. I did however, run into a few people arguing on chat about irrelevant topics and a player who told everyone that they suck and he is the best fisherman on the server but most of the people are willingly able to help each other out if a player needs help or tips on how to do things.

Moreover, despite being F2P is not by any means P2W and not repulsive in graphic/simple stupid gameplay terms.\n\nIn fact, graphic is nice and close to imitate realistic pond and everything you can find around it- logs, plants, boats etc. Audio is calm and minimalistic. Besides intro music (which is great) there are only sound effects which is actually a great decision as it fulfills the calm and silent atmosphere of fishing contemplation. Birds, water and mosquitos are the perfect background to sit back and chill out.\n\nAs for gamplay it is really more complex than throw and tow. You get yourself into two main ways of fishing- spinning and angling. Spinning is where you go for the fighters and predators. You must master several techniques of spinning as different predators respond differently to given bait and its movement.\n\nWhen you get tired of fighting you can take out your angler and do some peaceful casting for some less fierce fish. There you have to know what given fish likes to eat the most, where they hide and at which depths.\n\nThere is a lot to learn and fishing blind and random will result in small blue basses. When you do your research and come prepared, you will get comparable results with big largemouth basses and heavy catfish as there is very little randomness in this game. If you know what you are doing you will get results making it very high commitment-high reward game. It will never make you feel you lost your time, even when you pour many hours into it.\n\nI covered barely some of the aspects of the first fishing place, there are more really challenging lakes as well as more types of fish to catch. Although being still in early access, game provides countless hours of fun and relax and there is lots of competitive stuff planned for the future.\n\nMoreover its free, so you can try it out with no money loss.

To move to a new spot, your basically having to do a 2 or 3 second load to that spot. Overall, there was not much point in adding Character movement.\n\nI was hoping for a bit more freedom in movement and allowing the player to explore the scenery beyond.\n\n- Crashing at the fist Loading Screen, Note: Don't Click or press anything whilst on the loading screen, If you get the Please wait pop-up. Then click please wait and it should eventually load.\n- Crashing on Quit..\n\nThe crashes will obviously get fixed eventually though. :)","August 11, 2015","true","0.7"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Now the new patch is here and they have increased the fish IQ which now makes the fish unrealisticly intelligent. Now they can remove the bait off your hook without causing a disturbance to your float, when you do manage to hook one they race off to the weed beds and wrap your line around the weeds which snares your equipment, leaving you to try and rescue your equipment while the fish saunters off giving you the preverbial 2's up.

It seems to be all about slowly building up your gear with incremental upgrades at prices and stats that are set with only competetive balance in mind.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simplistic and doesn't feel very natural. There is no walking around a lake or getting in a boat- you pick one of two or three spots on the map and you'll be teleported to that particular ten square feet of shoreline where you can clumsily sprint to the water's edge and begin "fishing."\n\nIt's never difficult to tell what the developers are focusing on in a game, particularly when the game is in Beta. In Fishing Planet, you can loot through the tutorials to quickly see that there *are no tutorials about how to fish* but instead only tutorials about how to navigate the menus and buy new equipment. Equipment, mind you, that is most easily obtained through DLC. You didn't misread that- the game which isn't even out of Beta yet is already charging for extra content. Yeah, that's what the world has come to. You'll spend more money on this game that you would just buying a rod and reel and going to your local pay lake.\n\nSo what about the fishing game mechanics? Well, there are a couple different cast types, but I had to figure out how to do them through the in-game chat because there are no key mappings to look up, nor are there tutorials for the game itself. There is no way to adjust the strength of your cast and there is no player skill involved in casting. The bobber appears to be giant and really messes with your depth perception because it seems to always be the same size regardless of it being in your hand or out in the water (which I believe was intentional so you could see it better in the water). But doing that is a moot point, because there is a torrent of meta information always flowing to you that the game insists you should have, such as a large display showing your bobber and the water level on it, as well as information about reeling in your lure too early. The process doesn't feel very developed, and the mechanics themselves are extremely lacking. Any chance they'll work on making the game flow better or flesh out the base gameplay mechanics? Not likely, they seem to be solely focused on adding new fish to the game and new items for the in-game market, like fireworks that you can set off.\n\nSo yes, it's a game. Is it fishing? That's debatable. I don't have a problem with develpers looking for a profit, and that's not where my complaint is. My beef with the game is that the CORE GAMEPLAY has taken a backseat to the in-game market system, and that sets the tone for the whole development process. What you see now in gameplay is likely what you'll see as a finished product, and there are hundreds of fishing games out there that offer better fishing mechanics. Pro Bass Fisher for Windows 95 was a great one, and honestly beats this game in every aspect but graphics.","March 8","false","1.3"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

I would not recommend it... I was banned from the forums for making comments that are not nearly as negative as others in this game.  The reason given was that .. "my opinions do matter".. even though i claim they do not.. WEll if they do matter... then i would not be banned.. But I am.  Of course, as one player said... we should be happy to be able to speak at all.. bc in some places people are punished for this.. especially Women.... well i can understand now.  It is very sad that as a player that has purchased almost every possible DLC, in further support of development of the game.. of a development team that has grown by money paid by people such as me, from 5 to 20 members, would ban a player for making comments negative.  I have played more than 700 hours in this game... and i can't comment about anything.  The game could be great, if they actually allowed people who have played to make comments, if they actually decided also to update the community in steam about progress... where the game is based.  However, they don't update you in steam either.. none of this development team believes it is important to update the community in the forums of steam.  Instead you have to go to a radio show on twitch if you want to find out any information one that lasts hours.. or, also, if you would like to participate in the beta of this early access game.  This is very sad given that it is dedicated players like myself who would like to see this game succeed... They should think about how they treat customers.  They allow moderators... not even in development, to close threads of discussions as they see fit, and to ban permanently members who have been loyal customers.  It is hard to say i do not recommend this game but my feelings about these issues seems every day more to cloud my opinion...I still love to fish.. and it can be a very nice fishing simulator.. too bad the team making this game does not think more of their customers.","May 25","false","841.6"," 68 of 117 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","68","117","11","53"

Yep, I'm a CSGO/Team Fortress player, not a simulator/fishing player. BUT I've fished in my life time):\n\nPros:\nThis is the first game in a long time that has had me "hooked" extensively. The gameplay is fluid and accurate. Stepping into the game I was expecting 1 of 2 things: Confusing and unnecessary game mechanics OR pay for the "best" equiptment as do MANY other fishing simulators contain.\n\nStarting and Controls:\nBOY WAS I WRONG. Off the bat the tutorial gives you the need to know basics for fishing in general which is easy to use and from experience really an amazing portrail of the sport in real life. After you understand the simple and relaxing controls you're off fishing on your own.\n\nGameplay:\nUSUALLY, games like this would start you off with fish in tiers (Example: Start bluegill, then catfish, then bass, and so on). However, you're able to start going for either bluegill, catfish, pike, or bass right off the bat. When it comes to fishing in this game, real world knowledge is amazingly potent in this game. A HUGE plus over other fishing simulators! Catching a fish in this game gives a SUPER rewarding and that's why I'm enjoying every bit of the game play.\n\nMarket Model:\nThere are free to play games I play without spending a dime but are annoyingly hard and VERY long to progress through where I just get burnt out and stop playing. Then, there are games where a majority of everything in the shop can be achieved... PURELY BY PLAYING!\n\nYou don't need to spend anything to achieve special currency. Yep, "premium currency" is awarded through achievments and special fish. Yep, just like the games of old, you can unlock special stuff just by playing the game! DLCs? PSSSSH. Though their DLCs give you and edge early on, you can completely farm up to get all the items in the DLCs just from playing.\n\nAlso, the in game currency is made fast with a bit of work BUT no where near grindy or slow as many other F2P models out there. This game's F2P model is a HUGE plus being a F2P player. Great job!!!\n\nCons:\nLack of Variety and Content:\nOne thing that slows you down is the fact that there's only so many fish you can catch. To many people this can bog down grinding and cause interest to droop off but it's what I expect from a game that just went into release. I know for a fact there's going to be A LOT more content to be added here such as tournaments, quests, missions, and more fish and equiptment.\n\nThough on the plus side to this there are varients of the current fish you can catch and personally that's good enough for an on release game.\n\nGrindy(ish):\nYep, Grindy. Big surprise there from a F2P game right? Well, as to be expected. Every game with progression has a grind but I feel like this game handles it fairly well to a point. Upon reaching lvl 15+ there's a huge gap in exp gain that causes the game to really slow down. However, this is in place so the level split between casual and hard core doesn't grow too far apart.\n\nIn all honesty this is a good move to prevent inbalances when tournaments get released. I would like to mention this is changing a week after this post to increase exp gain all around. The low level grind is decent up until level 10 and then you feel the monotonous grind thereafter. Like I stated! They're changing this in a week so this will change for sure!\n\nEntry Level Steep(ish):\nIf you have experience fishing or used to fish like me, then you'll be just at home here. Like I stated in the pros, this game is SPOT ON with relation to real life fishing.\n\nHowever, if you're completely new to fishing, you might have a hard time getting started since every single fish has their own way of being caught. Though this can be a problem for a little bit, there's PLENTY of guides on youtube, guides here on steam, and help in game.\n\nVerdict:\nHonestly, I went in with expectations set by many failed misses in the fishing game genre from years before but I'm knocked on my ♥♥♥ with how well this game came to rise up to what has been sorely missing in this genre of gaming. The F2P market is both gameplay derived and not pay to win, the gameplay is spot on and rewarding, the graphics are beautiful as all hell, the physics are nice, and importantly to the genre, this game is really accurate.\n\nThough there are kinks here and there with lack of content and poor entry level, this game hit the spot for an alternative to FPS, RTS, and Strategy games that I'm used to playing.\n\nI really hope the devs continue to keep the game in the positive heading.","August 26, 2015","true","49.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The "fish fight" aspect of the game  is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe game claims to be "multiplayer" however is simply a single player instance with a chat box in the corner.\n\nNo customization at all, any gear other than what rod and reel your using doesn't change your appearance at all, in fact you never see more than your own two hands.\n\nIn its current state the game seems like little more than a tech demo, the maps are small, and it get repetitive rather quickly.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nI can't recommend the game at this time.\n\nThe developers I think are dropping the ball, or what has been the case for many EA titles, the game is just a cash grab. They seem to prioritize how players earn experience over the fixing of major bugs in the game. In the first week of release they adjusted fish spawns and exp rate three times and have again since then. Balance in a game like this is important, however all these changes have been "nerfs" to experience gains to slow player progression. In a normal EA title this would be fine, however this one sells a premium membership in the cash shop that gives 50% bonus to experience.\n\nEarly Access or not, if your going to have a cash shop people expect to get what they pay for and not have the game changed in a way that devalues what they purchased. Quite frankly the actions of the developers thus far throws up the   "cash grab" flags in my opinion.","August 23, 2015","false","93.3"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","35","61","4","0"

It's a grind fest, where you must play a whole day getting the same fish if you want to level up and get access other areas. It's not fun, it's boring as hell.\n\nEDIT: after some comments:\n\nI did not mean that i will get the same fish when i cast with specific bait/lure and on the specific spot. I mean you have to "grind" on the place that give a better, let's say xp/hour, in order to level up your account to get acess to new places/fishes. Trout are a example, i have some friends that spend the whole day getting trouts to gain a single level. And there are fishes that just dont "worth" the time because this exp system. I like to get all the fishes, but some species just dont worth the time you spend there.\n\nAnother thing is that when i get a fish, i don't feel "rewarded". Fishes don't really fight, it's easy to get a trophy fish without even care taht your line may break. And since you learned, by yourself or saw any tutorial, how to get a specific fish, the AI of the game will always work on the same way. So if you cast on the same spot with the same lure in the same time (i heard that some uniques are caught exactly at the same minute of the day), you will get the fish. There is no "random" things that always happens on fishing irl. Some times you will get a fish on the "wrong" place and time and this don't happens here.\nAnyways, i read the last news and looks like they will improve exactly what makes me dislike the gam\nWhen this happens for sure i will change my review to positive, because the game overall is good.","August 26, 2015","false","30.9"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","36","63","2","6"

Before the update, you could use the best gear you could afford and while it may have taken awhile to reel in a fish, atleast your line didn't go all slinky and a 4lb fish take 400+ ft of line. The game was good the way it was, but I do appreciate the devs trying to change things. For me personally 500+ hours logged a change this big kinda stresses me out. Maybe it won't be the same for you..so I won't say it isn't worth giving it a try, so I will atleast still recommend you try it... After all it's free.\n\nP.S> Devs I appreciate the time you put into "change" but I hope you plan to supply us with decent float rods in the shop. We've been asking for this for a long time now. How can we pull in 20+ lb catfish and others on bait rods when we only have the best float rod- a gold item the Fenix that cost 40 gold.. that can't handle anything over 17 lbs?? ...maybe to try to convince us to buy DLC? Hope you don't become P2P...I happily bough DLC when it was optional. Honestly......new rods and sufficient gear to match this change in the update would have solved this whole issue. All 20 levels I have been waiting for a better float rod. Still yet to be seen but I know ya'll are working hard and I do appreciate that.","March 31","true","566.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","9"

But thats where it all falls apart, because 9 times outta 10 it is NOT done properly. To many games say F2P but then hide huge amounts of content behind paywalls. To many say F2P but are actually P2W.......\n\nAnd EVERYONE here Im sure know full well what I speak of....I could name games but would rather not....\n\nThat having been said......\nThis is a great game, and a GREAT F2P model. Even the DLC on steam is mostly stuff that you can get ingame playing without ever paying a cent (or there is comparable from what I saw).\nI have not purchased any of the DLC yet but I plan to, seems a great way to stock up on role specific gear AND this honestly has potential to be best fishing sim ever..Im willing to throw some $$ at that!!!\nI have purchased the 3 day premium account. Can say these packs or more than reasonably priced for what you get..and brilliant you can use your steam wallet for this!!\nI did level to almost 4 before getting premium to get a feel for the game.

An amazing feature for any free-to-play game anymore.\n\n- Item mall (real life money items/features) are more for convience.  All of the content in the game (different areas you fish) are capable of being unlocked by leveling and using in-game currency for players who choose not to spend money on the game.  An ideal way of doing the Item Mall.  Only thing I can see people having issues with it is when tournaments are unlocked and players who spend can get a certain lure a level early, but that's far from pay to win in my eyes.\n\n- For the most part the community are more mature players.

It's not a perfect simulator, but what is, aside from pressing a button and a train moving on tracks? The devs are extremely friendly and active, working to make an interesting game. Fishing requires some level of thought, and can be an exciting experience for some species, and a relaxing for others. Some new patches and content comes buggy, but the Devs HAUL to fix such problems, (including mechanics that the majority hates ,etc).

Cant wait for the tournaments, quests and duels which are coming on a later date into the game.\nThey will make the relaxing fish grinding even an better experience for us in the future.\n\nAnd about the microtransactions.\nThis game definitely isn't another TheHunter, if you know what I mean. You can easily play and enjoy this game for full of its content for free and enjoy it as much as anyone. The ingame currency is easy to obtain and gets you the gear and licenses you need for the fishing spots without too much work (Or work at all, cause its fun to earn ingame currency while fishing and turning the fish in).\n\nIf you are interested in fishing or just fishing games, I cannot recommend this game highly enough for you.\n\n","August 24, 2015","true","44.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When you buy items from the bait shop or pro shop it looks like you're actually purchasing a real item.\n- The environment graphics aren't perfect but they are nice.\n- The imposed limit of what you can buy when on a fishing trip is interesting. You are limited to buying small things like extra bait or line but if you need a better rod you have to cancel the trip. It makes planning crucial.\n\nCons:\n- There are certain combinations of items to catch certain fish, and certain spots to catch them. There is very little variety other than the size, length, or quality (trophy or non-trophy) of the fish once you figure this out.\n- Bugs and unrealistic physics. Sometimes when you cast you will just drop the line into the water at your feet. I was told by many other players that they experienced this bug. If you yank a fish out of the water sometimes it will send it into this ridiculous orbital spin where it goes sailing around your body. I ended up not having to struggle with fish anymore because I would yank them from the depths of the river and they would go flying into the sky and right up on the riverbank where I could just reel them in as they sat there.\n- Two forms of currency. A lot of items in the game can only be bought with gold. You can earn it without any form of micro-transaction but it just doesn't make sense. When did you ever go into a Bass Pro shop and try to buy something with gold coins? These aren't always things like special rods or reels...they are consumables like grasshoppers...\n- No weather effects.\n- Poor day and "night" cycle.\n- There really is no multiplayer in this game. You fish by yourself and you can chat with other players but you never see them in-game.\n-  Extremely limited by fishing locations. You can only travel the space of about 20 feet along a bank or dock to change where you fish. You won't be finding any secret fishing holes. Part of the fun of fishing is exploring and finding your own spot.","January 19","false","9.8"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

The fact that it's still early Access is very exciting to me because as good as it is now it will only get better.  For those of you scared off by the thought of spending money on a free to play game rest easy.  If you never spend any real money your gamming experience will not suffer.  As of right now the only thing you can purchase is more in game money which is easily earned by catching fish in game.

If you're looking at this game then you can probably guess its a bit grind and time consuming because its FISHING.\n\nSo the grinding is honestly enjoyable. Theres the thrill of catching trophy or unique fish which keeps me going. This also makes you lvl up quickly. If you do decide to go premium, you get a 50% exp boost  which is not a game changer so this game is definitely NOT pay to win.\n\nAlso I'm not sure why but the loading screen is a little long when you're opening the game but not like 1 min long so be a little patient.","August 17, 2015","true","60.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

People complaining about grinding? It's fishing, it's fun and it takes patience and getting to know what the fish like. You'll be able to start catching fish right away without that, but if you really want to be able to catch the a trophy or catch a unique fish then you'll need to do your homework.\n\nThe community is very friendly and willing to help you out regardless of your knowledge of the game and it's the first online community that has been able to elicited a smile during the hours of playing over the last few days. If you don't have a little patience or a little drive to try and figure the fish out then the game isn't for you. All the information is pretty easily available and there are plenty of guides on the steam forum and within the game itself if you ever get stuck. The gear choice is a little overwhelming at first, but you pick it up quickly.","January 18","true","94.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Still a relativly new game, and as long as it doesn't end up like theHunter, Ill be relativly happy. A few things I would like to see: maybe being able to walk more than 15 feet around a certain area, maybe give us a walkway that takes you a decent ways down the river, then goto map and select the other side. Maybe be able to walk around a small pond.

Wow.. This game.. If you fish in real life and love it this game will pull you in and keep you playing! This is one of the most realistic and fun fishing games ive played in a LOOOOONG time. You actually gotta use real tactics, use the right lure/bait, right rod, line and depth. This is not some arcade game where you just throw out a lure or a bobber with some bait and just catch fish.. But that's the best part in my opinion :)\n\n\nMany of you that has seen theHunter for example on steam might think "oh is this one of those games where you have to pay real money for licenses (Yes there are licenses in this game but ALL of em can be bought with ingame cash even unlimited ones so you don't have to keep paying every time you wanna fish. And keep in mind if you buy a license for  example 1 day it will actually last for 24 in real life hours)\n\nFor now this is a wellcrafted, fun and very realistic fishing game with ALOT of potential to be one of the best ones out there. With more updates coming (boats, saltwater fishing more lures, baits and fish) this game will keep me busy for a very long time :) And don't let the bluegill "farming" let you down in the begining :P It really opens up after level 3. Bass fishing is extremly fun! :D I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves fishing :)\n\nA big thanks to the devs for their hard work trying to keep the servers stable and pushing updates at the same time :)","August 12, 2015","true","102.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But the grind as it stands now is just horrible.  In reality, no arbitrary level of experience blocks me from catching different species.  I really wish the game would throw a few line-breaking bass, pike, and catfish into the mix while you're still in the newbie phase of catching freight train loads full of bluegill.  I also wish it would let you advance beyond bluegill/crappies more quickly, as I'm bored with these two species of fish.\n\nThe sizes of fish really don't vary all that much, either.  I'd like to see some 10/12oz bluegill, some trophy pounders, and some itsy-bitsy ones that you have no idea how they took the bait in the first place.\n\nOther than that, I am definitely excited for the future.  This is an early access game, and a free-to-play one at that.","August 17, 2015","true","503.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Think "The Hunter" but with a higher moisture content.\nVery active Devs that listen to the community and actually seem passionate about fishing.\nWide range of fish from bluegills to bass to pike and everything between.  Muskies in the future.\nSimple but effective casting/retrieving system\n\nCons:\nFish "hot spots" are all you need to know, cast same area over and over again\nGrind - you'll find yourself casting the same spot over and over landing fish over and over to level\nLocations limited at this time\n\nMost of those cons should be fixed once they add more locations and boats.  Being limited to a few shore spots at this time really causes a lot of repetition but once you can float around the lake that should make things much more interesting.\n\nIf you like fishing you will like this game.  If you don't like fishing you might find this game boring at its current build but in the near future things look to be really opening up.\n","August 21, 2015","true","124.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Can be a bit grindy, but it's enjoyable and relaxing.  If you're looking for a chill experience in a game of skill, this one is for you.\n\nGraphically it's pretty decent.  I don't have any issues with it on my machine, and find it faily bug free for the time being.  You get the odd lag spike every now and again, but other than that I haven't noticed anything game-breaking.\n\nA few things I'd like to see:\n\nAdditional Weather Effects.  Rain would be a nice addition.  Wind would also be a good simulation addition to add to the challenge of placing your cast.\n\nBetter social aspects.  Friends lists would be cool.  A guild system (fishing clubs?).\n\nA slighty improved interface for going over your equipment.  It'd be nice to easily compare items to one another on mouse-over...like a hover box when you look at something in your inventory to compare to what you have currently equipped.\n\nThat's my two cents for now.

This is my first review ever for a game on Steam, and I do intend to get better at it as I continue reviewing my favorite games, so don't be too harsh on me, OK?\n\nWARNING: A lot of text ahead! Please skip to TL;DR if you're not into this kind of reviews.\nThis game popped up on Steam, and my first thought was "A Free-to-Play fishing MMO? What's that?". This game was free to download so I decided to give it a try. This game is in Early Access  so many features are absent at the moment but the core gameplay and the main mechanics of the game are absolutely clearly visible and I like them a great deal already. The game has a small but concise and precise tutorial, and a hint system was added recently so anyone new to the game in particular or to the genre as a whole will have a decent possibility to dive right in without any significant problems. In my first 30 minutes or so of gameplay, I realized that getting experience and unlocking new equipment was quite hard and similar to a grind of some kind, but the developers are constantly working on the game and they did improve the experience gain system, leveling up become easier even without a premium account (I hadn't put any money into this game up to this point and I think it won't be necessary at any point in the near future, and this I also like a great deal).\n\nThis game does require a little bit of fishing knowledge to get the full experience out of it. However, this doesn't mean you have to be a fishing expert to play this game properly. I went fishing (IRL, I mean) a couple of times so I have some basic information about where to search for fish, what bait to use and so on. So, from a casual gamer and a newbie fisherman standpoint, this game is quite easy to understand, very chill and relaxing (awesome graphics and sound effects do get the work of chilling you out done quite nicely), and of course it is reasonably entertaining. As of the moment of this review being posted, there are no multiplayer components in this game aside from the chat (which, to be frank, I haven't even used yet), but it doesn't take a lot from the game in its current status.As of right now, this is more of an enjoyable single-player fishing sim than an MMO, but the game is still quite good.\n\nControls in this game are quite intuitive and also there is a full key binding map available if you press F1 in-game.\n\nI have very little to say about the negative aspects of this game, but there are some nonetheless. First and foremost, you have a limited amount of fish you can catch and carry away (in other words, your storage capacity is limited, just like IRL), but there is no clear indication  on the interface itself of whether you have storage capacity left or not. You have to go to your inventory and check that from time to time. In my opinion, it would be more comfortable to see your storage capacity indicated, for example, in the left hand bottom corner of the screen. The second  annoying thing in this game is that your hook may get stuck, the popup says you can free the hook, but out of 10 cases of being stuck I didn't manage to get my hook back. It's either an annoying bug or my hands just being not straight enough (which is indeed a possibility when it comes to gaming).\n\nNow, I quit this extensive babbling, and get straight to the TL;DR Section\n\nTL;DR\nPros:- awesome sound and graphics\n- intuitive controls\n- relaxing gameplay\n- true F2P, very few premium items\n- constant improvements in the game\n\nCons (those will hopefully get fixed)- no multiplayer just yet\n- your hook often gets stuck and you have to cut the line most of the time\n- no indication of spare storage capacity directly on the HUD, it may be useful\n\nDo I recommend this game? If you are into fishing or fishing simulators and want to relax a little bit, then give this game a try right now. You will need to play about 15 to 30 minutes after you have completed the tutorial to make your mind about this game in its current state. Bear in mind that it will get updated. And I also may need to update my review if the devs introduce some major changes (which they hopefully will).\n\nP.S. If you have time and desire to do so, please give your feedback on what I need to do in order to improve my reviews. Healthy and reasonable criticism is also very much accepted. ))","August 24, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't know how to look at the fish i get in 1st person tho. And i think you guys that made this should make a aquarium game were you have a place and you can get other fish tanks like salt and fresh water and have alot of corals and fish and plants and stuff and you can walk around in your place and breed. So just make it like real if you do.","September 13, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I catch around 100 fish every summer. But the problem was that i would sit there and think of how awesome it would be to have a fishing game. And not just some bass fishing but like an all in one fishing something that you can catch a little everything. And not just use lewers. And then i saw this game played a little bit and fell in love. This is a fun game to play after getting destoyed in CS:GO  and you just need to relax.

You will have to know how to fish for real and love fishing for real.   You can fish for 8 fish families.  The graphics look good but the background music is repetative.  You have a lot of control of how you set up your fishing gear and control on using your fishing gear.  Like real fishing, the environment conditions is supposed to effect the fishing.\n\nYou get for free 1 unlimited basic licence in Missouri, the Missouri map has 2 locations.  But you have invisible walls preventing you from moving away from the location or falling into water.  Looks like you can unlock other fishing trips after grinding through trips in Missouri, you have to level up and earn ingame credits.  There are 6 other fishing trips, currently locked.\n\nIf you buy a premium pack it gives you licences, give you some credits and a xp boost, and you can buy credit bundles with real money.  You can get licenses and gear using ingame credits.  You can earn some ingame credits and gold by playing.  If you go broke, game over, so make sure you make your trips profitable.  Maybe someone could learn how to fish for real playing this game well.\n\n\nI don't like fishing, did only a little fishing when real young, so i am going by what i know watching fishing tv shows i seen.

The grind set in pretty hard after Colorado however. Even with recent XP bumps, there didn't seem to be any reason to visit the next area. North Carolina had more spots for snags, less XP, and generally less progression than Colorado. So you're faced with the prospect of grinding out three+ levels of trout instead of feeling like you're getting somewhere by moving on to the next area. I skipped the (somewhat miserable) New York area entirely after a couple of trial runs there.\n\nBut if you can ignore the grins and stick to the starter area and Colorado, you'll see what a beautiful, relaxing game it is. You can certainly kill some time and drink a few beers, maybe even kindle your interest in real life fishing. But unless there is vast improvement in the progression, don't let it become a major time sink. Just enjoy the good stuff, and hope the bad areas get better.","August 25, 2015","true","36.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Keep in mind as of this review it is still a beta.\n\nSo far, I have made it up to level 4 and it has taken a bit of time, but being a fisherman myself in real life the leveling hasn't felt unrealistic.  Going out and not catching a fish for a period time can and does happen and while I can't sit down and play this game for a very long period of time I do find it enjoyable and even relaxing to a certain extent.\n\nThe game overall I can recommend, but if you come into it expecting a super-exciting fast-paced game this is not for you. If do however enjoy fishing and want a simulator that is fairly close to the experience give this a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\n\n","August 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Entire game is actually free in this though.\n\nCan unlock everything by playing and leveling (leveling is quite slow and tutorials ingame aren't too great, but the basics are covered).\n\nLots of locations, types of fish species, tackle and lures/baits to unlock (All can be unlocked for free by gaining xp and ingame money from fishing). Very fun for just messing around and a lot more content to come.\n\nLicenses can be bought with ingame currency too this time unlike that collosal fail system that theHunter had where you could only hunt 1 species and have to pay real money for more. Would still like licenses done away with, but it does add a sense of realism. Can buy a keepnet quite early on which lets you release smaller fish to make space for bigger fish which will bring in more XP and money.\n\nTravelling to different locations and fishing for however many days you want costs a certain amount of in-game currency - which can be made back with profit by catching fish throughout the trip.

I have never played a more perfect game. To the way you cast, to the astmosphere, this game has it all. The world looks beautiful as I stand by the water casting my line, and then I get a bite! I reel it in a little, let it pull, and then pull it out of the water! I've never experienced anything like it before!\n\nThere is even a multiplayer part to the game! You can fish with all of your friends! As you all fish in the same area you can see what everyone else is catching around you! My friends and I all had a blast sitting here one rainy night, all fishing together. It was a great experience and I hope that everyone else comes and joins us too!\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough to get you to get this game, then perhaps me saying that its free will get you to come and try it out! Plus the game is super easy to get into! Even those that don't like fishing can simply walk around the beautifullly constructed world.\n\nI can't wait to see you all down by the pond!","August 21, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Bass and Catfish are possible at level 2, but you'll probably catch more Bluegills than anything.  Once you get some spoons and jigs, the real fun begins and levelling goes much faster from there.  I sat down with a six pack of beer and before I knew it a couple hours had passed and I was out of beer.\n\nI like that the game tries to teach you proper fishing techniques, which you can then apply to real world fishing.  I've learned a few things and will try them out next time I get on a boat because shore fishing in my area is pretty poor.

They want you test it out give them constructive criticism before the finished product out that all said theres still alot ahead to make it a great game but it is on the correct path for that. The players vary from good helpful to a few bad eggs for advice like any game but asking is good do your research when testing this game youtube videos of catching fish one great way for a base line of fishing at a lake.\n\nWhen this game finally is a what the staff they generally want as a finished product they won't stop they will continue make a great game for this they need support for players with constructive criticism as one means. That all said everything in the game is so lifelike fishing wise theres a few minor bugs but theres not a single game out there with them. If you want the most realistic fishing game with huge potential try Fishing Planet.  If you need help ask me tommyangelo\nEnjoy","April 16","true","181.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

I'm contiplating suicide now, I think its to late for me. When I die I want my kids to know that I love Fishing Planet way more than I love them.

The graphics have the potential to be incredible if your computer can handle it. I have a Nvidia Gtx 960 superclocked and it runs the graphics on the best settings pretty well, but obviously if you lower the graphics settings it will run at a higher framerate. It can be a little bit of a grind sometimes to get the higher level items, but it still is fun. Since it is a free game there are micro-transactions, but they are not in your face about it and you can easily play the game without them. If you like fishing you will definitly like this game. If I had to give it a rating I would give it a 8/10 since it is a free game with great graphics and good gameplay.","August 31, 2015","true","90.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

So I always wanted to somehow find a Fishing game that's just as simple and realistic as it is.\n\nSo I played this game. Let's just say in a nutshell:\n\n> Catches fish using non F11\n> Feels like worst fishing casting method ever....\n> Asks silent fishermen in the area.(You can't see them around but they are fishing invisible to you actually).\n> Random fisherman tells me to press F11.\n> F11 allows me to throw max or control where I throw the bait/lure to.\n> Was grateful as f**k because game turned to Game Of The Year Edition for Fishing.\n> Then asked where to fish other kind of fish(Since I always got nub fish)\n> Random Fisherman told me step by step on how.\n> So I followed and I got my 1st catfish by using just Bread.\n\n>After getting a 3.4lb Catfish, I (Accidentally) bragged I can't keep it, since its too big for my fish keeping tool. Random Fisherman says, 'Nevermind, still nice catch!' "Laughed Internally"\n\n> Later on, suddenly we talked about MLG Fishing while waiting for my bait to get bite. We talked about 360noaimcasting 2ez and I actually tried 360 casting like a pro and got a fish from it(took some time still).\n\n>LATER ON, We talked about DLC in a good way. Someone suggested if they can have a radio, but there's already Steam Music Player lol. I recommend an announcer DLC where if someone is fishing something big they'll go announce it like how a sports announcer does in an exaggerated way. However other people suggests even more ridiculous DLC ideas.\n\nWell.....what can I say? It's a simple, calm, fishing game, that takes some knowledge(Well after you look at some guide or yt vids that is), and patience by the shore, encompanied by some noises near the river bank, like small critters like crickets and bees, near your ear with the sound of the river flowing and mists and daylight transitions.\n\n13.5lb/10lb will fish this amount of fish again every day. Hope someday I can fish a shark or megalodon in a DLC.","August 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a pretty good game, especially for a free game.\n\n(Oh look! This game has mutliplayer now! You see Fishing Planet?

Truly free to play, realistic, and has a great community.\n\nOnce you grind to level 3 the experience really begins as you can start to fish bass which is a great start on your way to trout in Colorado. Many of the new players say it is hard to level up and get money. I would agree, until level 3 I was struggling to break even but once you read the wiki and just ask for general advice in the chat then you realize how easy it is to make money and gain xp.\n\nThe community that plays this sim is fantastic. Especially once you level up and move on from the starter state and get to the places where the true players really are. Everyone is always more than happy to give you assistance or advice if you ask and as long as you are just as willing to give out advice yourself you can easily become respected within the community. The devs are great as well, they are active on the forums and are always busting their butts to try and sort out issues and help new and seasoned players alike.\n\nSince this sim is in early access there are some bugs here and there but overall for me personally it's not too bad, only twice have I become concerned about losing my catch for the day which really isn't a big deal depending on what you are fishing. My one and only complaint is the major lack of tutorials and descriptions about what goes with what in the store. When I first started I was baffled by the amount of different things you could buy and wasted quite a bit of credits trying to figure things out, but again, read the wiki and ask in the chat and it is quickly sorted out and you are busy hauling in that fish.\n\nI would absolutely reccomend this to anyone who enjoys fishing and is willing to take the time and learn the tricks of the trade.  Just remember three things: It's still in development, read the wiki, and upgrade your gear as it becomes available.","August 17, 2015","true","54.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The fishing starting out is a lot of bluegill and crappie. The gameplay mechanics are good except sometimes lag messes you up on fish. I see a lot of complaining about load times. I have not noticed anything abnormal about load times with my system anyway. I have seen a lot about errors and such...again I have not gotten this at all so far.\n\nCurrently it is bobber fishing if you are after catfish and such however I read that bottom fishing will be added later on. In my honest opinion the price point for premium is a bit expensive for a year. Would be much more reasonable at $60 per year or something equal to what you would pay for each game release that releases on a year to year basis. Premium is not required never the less. But it will certainly take time to level up without it.\n\nMy main complaint is the size of the trophy fish. They run quite small for most species I have seen. Where I am from a 15lb channel is not out of the realm at all. Bass also seem on the low side of what I would consider a trophy. I do hope this gets rectified in the future.\n\nThe fish graphics are pretty nice as well!\n\nGame is certainly worth playing but will get better in the future. It does have some issues but nothing that can't be dealt with.","August 13, 2015","true","811.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fishing starting out is a lot of bluegill and crappie. The gameplay mechanics are good except sometimes lag messes you up on fish. I see a lot of complaining about load times. I have not noticed anything abnormal about load times with my system anyway. I have seen a lot about errors and such...again I have not gotten this at all so far.\n\nCurrently it is bobber fishing if you are after catfish and such however I read that bottom fishing will be added later on. In my honest opinion the price point for premium is a bit expensive for a year. Would be much more reasonable at $60 per year or something equal to what you would pay for each game release that releases on a year to year basis. Premium is not required never the less. But it will certainly take time to level up without it.\n\nMy main complaint is the size of the trophy fish. They run quite small for most species I have seen. Where I am from a 15lb channel is not out of the realm at all. Bass also seem on the low side of what I would consider a trophy. I do hope this gets rectified in the future.\n\nThe fish graphics are pretty nice as well!\n\nGame is certainly worth playing but will get better in the future. It does have some issues but nothing that can't be dealt with.","August 13, 2015","true","811.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is pretty relaxing, but i suggest to put more songs because it keeps on repeating the same intro whenever you open menu or inventory. If I could make a suggestion it would be implementing controller/joystick into the game.. it would be perfect if it vibrates to indicate when the fish strike the bait, and also when we reel in the fish that got baited, so it feels more real.. it takes time to level, but it is worth it.. it gives you that feeling of achievement whenever you catch a fish.. love how they have alot of choices in gears.. I just hope this game wont be a P2W game if duel comes out..\n\nI'd recommend this game to my dad cuz he love fishing LOL~","August 17, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as the graphics and gameplay I think it is really awesome! But almost everytime I go to play I encounter some kind of bug. Whether its the endless loading screen, ghost inventory, menu glitches, etc.. It is very frustrating to have to force close the game and verify local files everytime I run the game. I understand it is only a few days after release but that also what bothers me. If you are going to release a game, shouldn't it work at least 90% of the time? And the bugs arent things you can play through, they are fatal errors that force you to close and re-open the game. Anyway I am sure this game will continue to improve as the developers continue to work in the coming weeks, and so right now, I give this game 8/10. When the bugs are fixed I would easily give it 10/10.","August 16, 2015","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm an avid fisherman and haven't been out much this year because I'm a full time college student (summer classes too...). This game has scratched that itch and will continue to do so every winter when I just want to be out bass fishing.\nIt's early access, so I assume things will only improve from here on out, but it's a solid game. The graphics are awesome, fighting with a fish seems awesome (except when you yank a small fish out of the water and it flies around you...but it's a laugh at least), and the sheer number of items is impressive. I personally dislike that it's the type of game that deals with in game purchases and such, but the game is totally playable without spending a dime. Getting started until you reach level 3-4 is a bit of a grind, but after then is when the game truly becomes fun. The community is great, I get into discussions about all sorts of things and we help each other with game tips. All in all, it's a great experience and it's a relaxing break from your regular day to day.\nI definitely recommend this game to any fishing fan.","August 19, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be honest my biggest complaint is that my camera view keeps getting off center after about an hour of playing and I have to quit and restart.  The fish don't act like normal fish at times.  When you try to catch the fish they are much smarter than normal fish in that they can rapidly create slack on the line and get off the hook unnaturally fast.  It's fine for now and it's still a good game.\n\nAfter playtesting the game for a few days I have a few recommendations for the game to make it's replay ability better.  It would be more exciting if you could walk around the lake and have to find the fishing spots.  Seasons should also be introduced in order to change fishing style throughout the 4 season.  Fly fishing should be included in the game.  Also the lakes should be larger and different boats should be introduced in order to access locations unavailable by foot.  I would also spread the experience across the fish more so that players don't go for the same fish all the time.  It seems that at each lake there is only one fish that gives a good amount of experience while the rest don't give enough experience to make them worth fishing.

If u know how to fish u can play... let me explain. I fish for real, alot, so when I started playing I did what I would do if I were fishing, wanna catch blue gill, cast a float , just about anywhere preferably near weeds. How about bass, a jig by cover. And catfish, cut bait near the bottom in a hole or drop off.\n\nSo to conclude... if you like fishing and gaming. .. and fishing (simulator not arcade) games, you'll love this.","August 12, 2015","true","102.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To be honest my biggest complaint is that my camera view keeps getting off center after about an hour of playing and I have to quit and restart.  The fish don't act like normal fish at times.  When you try to catch the fish they are much smarter than normal fish in that they can rapidly create slack on the line and get off the hook unnaturally fast.  It's fine for now and it's still a good game.\n\nAfter playtesting the game for a few days I have a few recommendations for the game to make it's replay ability better.  It would be more exciting if you could walk around the lake and have to find the fishing spots.  Seasons should also be introduced in order to change fishing style throughout the 4 season.  Fly fishing should be included in the game.  Also the lakes should be larger and different boats should be introduced in order to access locations unavailable by foot.  I would also spread the experience across the fish more so that players don't go for the same fish all the time.  It seems that at each lake there is only one fish that gives a good amount of experience while the rest don't give enough experience to make them worth fishing.  I know the game isn't finished and these are only suggestions to the developers....\n\nOther than that the game is great with a lot of potential.  Definitely worth playing for a while.\n","September 11, 2015","true","65.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a very fun, addicting game to play. The only thing I do not like is that you can't move your character very much at all. This is not a pay to play game. All the stuff you buy in game, you earn from catching fish. The premium account only really helps with leveling up. Also, the game has a really great community, so if you ever need help, you can just ask other players in game and there is always people willing to help you out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/distantWarrior/recommended/380600/","distantWarrior","Ryou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/distantWarrior/","253 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOriginally, I was going to put a funny review like "♥♥♥♥ catfish" or "more like Bluegill Planet LOL", but I guess I might as well make something serious once a while, right?\n\nThe game has a memory leak thing going on, make sure to turn of anti-aliasing or else you might experience severe FPS drops (I'm talking like dropping down to 5 FPS) after about 1 hour of play.\n\nThe game is incredibly slow at first because until you hit level 3, all you can do is cast bait and wait for something to bite. And without actually knowing anything about fishing, that's going to be Bluegills. Or Pumpkinseed. Very rarely. So what do you do? You... actually figure out how to fish. Either do that by asking people in the chat (because we all love answering 10 times a day how to catch a bass or catfish), or by reading the absolutely marvelous Steam guides. You could also actually read up on how to catch this thing IRL, because this simulator is incredibly realistic in the sense that they implemented real-life fishing tactics to work ingame. That's pretty sick.\n\nOnce you hit 3, you probably want to grab yourself a Spinning Rod and, well, spin. That's a much needed change of pace I found, since instead of waiting for something you bite you reel in the lure... and then you wait for something to bite. I don't know what people expect, this is a fishing simulator. Pretty much all you do is wait for something to bite. It's incredibly engaging if you like exploring areas, figuring out cool fishing spots, and eventually collecting all the different sorts of fish that are in the game. I would like to mention, I've played for like 30 hours now and I haven't even seen half of what the game has to offer. That is, of course, in part because of the relatively slow leveling system, but also because the game actually has a substantial amount of content for something so recently released. For a free to play Early Access game, it's actually amazing of how much content this game has compared to some other games on Steam.\n\nIt should be mentioned that ANYTHING in the game can be obtained with ingame money. You do not need to spend a single cent on this game. Sure, yes, of course, it speeds things up, but not even by a significant amount. Fishing isn't "easier" by buying things. In fact, reeling in a big fish is completely skill-based, and even if you spent a hundred bucks it won't be any easier. That's because the most powerful equipment in the game is purchased by achievement coins. And, as you guessed, you get those coins by doing achievements or logging in 5 days in a row. You can only buy regular money with real money, and that's stuff you usually get plenty of ingame. Personally, the only really overpriced thing in the game in my opinion are licenses for new areas. And that's only because I want to save up for permanent licenses. Licenses to catch certain fish are cheap for a day, and probably worth investing in if you play the game often, I just really hate buying timed stuff because I feel forced to play something instead of doing it on my own.\n\nAll in all, this is an incredibly solid fishing experience, it's addicting if you like collecting stuff and not a whole lot of fun unless you like fishing. But give it a try, it's free. Maybe you're like me, and you didn't even know you have a passion for fishing.","August 18, 2015","true","49.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

I have not played too many fishing sims but I have played enough to find this one far more enjoyable.\n\nIf you are highly competitive even in your casual gaming you will probably not find this appealing at the moment.  Multiplayer exists and the community is really great -- but there are no tournaments and you're left with a leader board for each fishing location but nothing super special.\n\nAnd of course if you are super competitive you will be frustrated by the DLC and micro transactions.  When approached from the perspective of a casual game, I find the micro transactions to be distateful but much less bothersome.\n\nAs with most fishing sims, you are of course rewarded more for catching the "popular kids" of the sport fishing world (Bass, Salmon, Pike ect ect) but you are still able to progress/level with trout, catfish and panfish.  They are actually how I grabbed some decent ingame cash early on though they fade in importance over time.\n\nThe graphics are enjoyable but at the moment the software is certainly not optimized.  I regularly have minor (read: non-game breaking) graphical errors.\n\nThe sound track is peaceful and enjoyable as well.\n\nIn short, if you want to actually feel like you're really fishing with complicated sporting gear in the actual environment...you need to purchase a fishing license and go out side.\n\nBut if you're interested in casually gaming and like fishing this is not a bad option and honestly one of the best currently availabe (though that says so little).\n\n","January 8","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're holding a rod, watching the tension of the line or the bobber.  Just like real life.\n\nThe DLC is a little pricey, but you can earn and purchase all sorts of gear totally from in-game cash, if you're willing to grind a little.

The weather pattern in the different fishing spots is exactly the same each 'trip' and I think a bit more variety would be nice. I also am one of those people who uses a keyboard layout other than the standard US QWERTY, and it would be nice if I could re-bind controlls to the keys I actually have, or if there was controller support.

However, I quickly began to realise that the people who play this game are all really nice and they all seem to contribute to the fun, relaxing atmosphere of the game. In my opinion, Fishing Planet has a lot of potential, perhaps as a game perhaps aimed at an older audience, and could even attract people who are inexperienced in fishing, such as myself, by going into more detail in explanations and tutorials, etc. Overall, I'd say give it a try if you want a relaxing and peaceful experience, and if it's not your thing then just uninstall it.","February 8","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It is a little different from fishing games I remember playing in the past but it's not bad. At the start it was a bit annoying having the control map pop up while the tutorial was going. I think that it should have been less invasive and have a little bubble stating "press F1 for controls" or something like that. Also the control map has some faded lines pointing to the keys which are a bit hard to follow. I kind of feel like a noob but just a suggestion... If you catch a fish that is supposed to be a release under the license equipped maybe once you catch that restricted fish it should have a notice that fades away saying if you keep the fish you'll get fined. I messed up and kept 2 fish in New York on a basic license and it made me go negative and now I can't fish til tomorrow. I can see this game getting a little repetative over time once I have caught a majority of the fish. Otherwise it's pretty relaxing, just throw some music on in the background grab a beer (age 21+) kick back and cast out.\n\nPros:\n\nBeautiful graphics\nVariety of gear/fish/methods to catch them\nCommunication to others in server (chatting and notifications of fish caught)\n\nCons:\n\nLooking around/movement is a bit floaty\nNeeds more clarity on license restrictions real time\n\nI'll do a better review when I get more time in the game and have more knowledge about the game.","September 8, 2015","true","21.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And FREE and yes there will be bugs and it will crash and not work from time to time and the dev team may get things wrong as in making game worse before it gets better at times. As thats the idea of early release game. Not for us to slate it but to be constructive with your criticism and help the dev team to make game better. if when game is released and may even be charged for game then thats when you go this game is not for me the dev team have got it wrong for me i am not playing any more job done. But for now this is looking to being a good game and i am having fun playing now yes at times it feels a bit same as you catch fish in the same loctions time and time again. But the quetion is despite the bugs the crashes and all the other problems with game as its in DEVELOPMENT not a finished producted yet. Is it fun do i enjoy playing it well my answer is yes i played nothing much else since coming across the game a few days ago. Does it do my head in at times when it does not work as i think it should or can't catch big fish yes but thats the part i am enjoying and for a person who hates fishing in real life i dont think thats bad thing. So would i recomend the game yes a big yes because its free for one it can be a bit of a grind but not as much as real fishing in my opinion as i hate real fishing lol. Secondly it looks nice and sounds not bad few more back ground noise would be nice and change more and get rid of mosies lol. So try it if you dont like nothing lost as it has not cost you any thing. Is a full product i would say not but it is looking to be one great game at moment needs work and i feel thats what its all about :) SO STOP MOANING AND STOP PLAYING OR HELP MAKE GAME BETTER with constructive criticism not game bashing or game bashing as i have read in various posts. Also on release if game is not what you wanted for it stop playing and dont pay if it becomes a payed game.","September 7, 2015","true","53.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Due to my disability, I have not been fishing in the real world for years, so when I stumbled across this game in steam, for free, well I just had to give it a go. And I am very glad I did.\n\nIt is so relaxing to play. I love the scenery, I love the way some of the smaller fish can put up a great fight. The background sound effects are lovely. And I really enjoy the friendly banter in the on screen chat box. If you are the kind of gamer that likes to compete with others, you can play it that way and try to level up as quick as you can, and there a tons of guides to help you find the tricks and tips, I however, really enjoy the slower route, figuring things out for myself, and just enjoying the game for what it is. A marvelous way to relax and recuperate from my recent heart attack, and a smashing alternative to the find gun, load gun, kill em all type of game that I have been playing up untill now.\n\nA truly brilliant game, thank you to all the Dev's, for making this, and releasing it for free.

Alot of people are complaining about the fishing mechanics of the game and others things, it's free to play and simulation games (especially ones like these) are hard to get all the mechanics down. The game has to pay attention to so many factors to try and replicate real fishing which is very demanding. So the fact that many people think the game is broke or too easy there's a few simple things you can do\n1. Post actual problems in the forum rather than QQ because you can't fish right.\n2. Remember that the game is still in early dev so there is going to be problems, get over it.\n2. Uninstall and move on. It's not a game for everyone and it's f2p so you're not loosing anything.\n\nOverall mechanics are solid to play, different baits to use so there plenty of variety, many updates that come out everyday to improve.\n\nWill rate it 8.5-9/10 for simulators.","September 1, 2015","true","17.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I'm very pleased I got into it.\n\nI have really enjoyed every minute of this even if  I have not explored a huge amount nor have I yet tested all the options of equipment or bait. This is all ahead for me and I am in no rush.\n\nThis game is just a very relaxing time spend, it's easy enough until you get a big fish and then it'll blip your heart rate some until you get control.\n\nAs you can get into it easily without spending any real money there's no risk.\n\nThe developers have been very supportive of potential customers and provided a unlimited access lake where a number of fish can be caught.\n\nThis all leads me to still recommend this game even if there is the dreaded "buy a licence" component. Frankly, I not done this yet anyway so that experience is for another update but I don't seem to feel nearly as much of a problem in this title's case compared other titles using the same model.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:  15 April 2016\n\nThis review is an initial reaction after 3 days.\n\nI will need to come back and edit this review after I've spent more time in here.\n\nI picked up this game in early April, just as 0.3.7 update (Texas) arrived.\n\nHaving read about 5 reviews and seeing a 'mostly positive' rating on STEAM, I downloaded.\n\nInstallation was easy during which I watched a few YouTube videos. By installation complete, I knew enough to get out and go fishing.  A few hand holds greet you as you first play and they're great. Within no time, I'd been fishing. I can easily stay out of the 'realistic discussions' as I'm no real life angler but I appreciate the degree to which this title has achieved certain aspects of the real world activity.\n\nAny simulator is a compromise but if it's not fun, then it's no good. I can certainly see myself spending a while here and there going fishing between my other simulator gameplay activities.\n\nSo with 3 days under my belt, I've found the setup easy, got into fishing without problems, found it very relaxing and enjoyable and even experienced my first update which adds a huge attraction to the title.\n\nI expect I will go ahead and purchase some items from the shop as I develop my experiences.\n\nI tend to be wary of 'free to play' in a title but not against them or even spending some money on this as long as I can get value and the money I spend remains as purchased value.\n\nOne area I am slightly concerned about is the purchased license validity time. If they are in terms of 'Game time', then I will be happy. If they are real time however.... I will be quite disappointed.\n\nI am totally happy I took the time to check this title out and immediately, I would encourage anyone wondering about it, to try it out.\n\nHere is a youtube video of my early on session.   https://youtu.be/ovcQ_yb54Fg","April 15","true","12.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

You don't have to spend money on this game, it gives you premium currency everytime you level. But if you want to spend money, than you can get access to stuff faster. Personally i think you shouldn't spend money on this game, except to support the devs but if you spend money to get an edge. Why? there's next to no competition, so why spend money to level faster? Unless of course you have money to spend, in which case go wild!\n\n10 ata 10\nWould fish for catfish again","November 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very realistic and got very nice graphics. Things i would like to see in future are:\n\n1:More intense sounds; like splashing when fighting with fish.\n2:Adjustable FOV; fishing would be more interesting if you could see more and not be like zoomed in.\n3:Free travelling; travelling to these different spots in states are expensive, and you get money through fishing. Its like grinding money and then finally travelling to the next spot.\n\nOverall, i do recommend this game.","November 18, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am typically more into FPS, Fighting and MMORPG's - I gave this game a try because it was free, and boy was it a decision that I am happy I made. This game is seriously a ton of fun, I could literally spend hours playing this game. I got to learn a lot about fishing tactics, best methods, and more than I ever would have expected from a fishing simulator. The graphics are nice, the environment and ambient sounds are a masterpiece as well... the game, within a few minutes can take you away from the daily grind and helps you feel relaxed. The only drawback is, I can't really cook the fish. Aside from that, downloading, installing and playing this game is highly recommended. It is also very addictive and hours will go by because of all the fun you'll be having and not even know it. Leveling is perfect and keeps you begging for more.","August 28, 2015","true","77.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But let's check the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n\n- Not just a game, a super realistic simulation\n\n- Fully customizable equipment from rods&reels to your hat&boots\n\n- Many ways to fish, many places to fish\n\n- Again, realistic gameplay forces LICENSES (awesome!)\n\n- Good visuals\n\n- A really helpful community\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Good graphics brings lag from time to time (though I tried the game after a Starcraft II marathon that lasted over 40 hours, so gotta check it out later.)\n\n- F1 Controls Panel is too messy that I closed it right away and asked the community for most of controls\n\n- Tutorial? Is there any? I mean "Throw the bait using LMB *LMB image*" Thanks mate! Reallly helpful it was. I was about stick rod right up to my a**.\n\n-Uhm... I thought this was Multiplayer? I thought it was, Co-Operative? No? Oh... Seriously only thing that looks Multi-Player is the chat-box. Th game promises to have some tournaments but... C'mon WE WANNA THROW THE THINGY TOGETHER!!!\n\n\nOverall, this game is good, looks good, will be even better! 'cuz the game is already good, you can see it in the "pros" section up there and it's "cons" stated above are al fixable cons.\n\nHighly, seriously recommended. I don't know how to wait for my computer to relax a bit to play this game under better circumstances.\n\nAdd me, message me and blah blah blah-di blah.","August 16, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is my opinion based on years of playing fishing games and spending countless hours fishing in real life.  (Note: I've read the most recent dev blog post, and it appears that the developers are hard at work already on some of this.  Good stuff!)\n\n=== Cons ===\n\nPhysics - line slack in water doesn't correlate with how much line is released; confusing fish catches (the fish seem to 'fly' or teleport out of the water upon catching).\n\nXbox 360 controller - doesn't feel right with the controls of this game.  No game controller configuration options.\n\nControls - out of sync with fish bites; casting is a pain (no level of casting power?  simply click and hope for the best?); hooking/reeling fish is a confusing ordeal (fish on?  tension?  visual/audio feedback?  doesn't seem the game adds excitement to fish retrieval).\n\nXP/currency - too much emphasis on points and currency rather than skills; microtransactions - a nice option, but seems to be designed as a cash grab.  Please - DO make money on this - development costs money.  But don't sacrifice fun and realism by making it pay-to-win.\n\nFish AI - unrealistic expectations (i.e. 'use a 16 inch leader with a size 6 hook').  Following guidelines to increase the odds of catching a fish is good - but forcing players to stick to a formula and grind away is just not fun.\n\nMusic - need more of it.\n\nInterface - a bit confusing; example: ESC key does different things or nothing at all; GUI needs to be consistent amongst the different screens.\n\n=== Pros ===\n\nGraphics - WOW - spot on!  They are truly amazing.  3D texturing, beautiful ambience, plenty of attention to detail with the tackle/baits/etc.\n\nMusic - I've only heard a single track so far, but it's good.  That is the style that is fitting for a fishing simulation, and I'd love to hear more others like it!\n\nFish species - It's nice to see no limitation imposed; carp, bass, catfish, sunfish, etc. - they all matter.\n\nRealism - FINALLY, no forced underwater view!  No annoying announcers.  No arcade elements.  A simulation :-)\n\nTutorials - A nice touch.\n\nSupport / dev feedback / wiki - Some of the best I've seen anywhere.  Listening to your user base and keeping them 'in the loop' will help keep this game thriving for years to come.\n","November 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is the way to do a EARLY ACCESS game. I mean if you wanna try a game on "beta" stage you shouldn't really pay for it.

As an avid fisherman myself, the dynamics and such make sense. It is easy and at time, very frustrating -- just like fishing.\n\nThe developers take into account the different combination of lures, colors, sizes, and such for different areas. Thus, giving you huge amount of combination to try and catch different types of fish.\n\nAlso, if you were having a bad year of fishing (which I was), this gives you some ability to try out fishing ideas in a simulated setting.

So far I have managed to take the time and slowly, oh so slowly, bring in a 17+lb Flathead Catfish on 8 lb test.  Just a matter of playing him out, letting him run under light but constant, wearing tension, the tension keeps it moving to escape, which will, eventually, hopefully, tire it out so that you can then slowly bring it in to you.\n\nSo, I would Heartily Reccomend this game to any and all folks wo either fish or would like to learn how.\n\nSay "HI" to Cutch fer me, I visited him long ago and got my copy of DeerHunter 2K5 from him, such a good fellow, knew some of the folks my grandparents did, similar hunting and fishing areas, and he was an excellent games tester as for the reality end.!\n\nChuck Sweet as Steelwolf","November 17, 2015","true","304.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

As an avid outdoorsman and fishermen, I wanted to see what a F2P game had to offer. While it is still in early access, it is still a very fun game to play. Tons of content and more still to come. Travel America fishing for the premier freshwater fish. From pan fish to bass, predatory fish, float fishing, trout, salmon, and even the mighty sturgeon, this game is an easy and fun way  to fish if you've never been or do it all the time. As in real life, spending money on stuff that you may never use is a bad move. Before buying, ask yourself, will I need this after Missouri, or Colorado, or New York(btw don't go here after you unlock it, its a bad move, wait until you are higher level or you will be in debt and get stuck. 8.5/10.\n\n","December 21, 2015","true","51.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have been fishing in game what seems like a few hours a day and it's totally enjoyable.  Make sure you have drinks and snacks nearby.\n\nI would like to see fly fishing, saltwater fishing, and the ability to purchase and upgrade tracker type boats with trolling motors etc. and upgrades to everything as you level and gain cash and gold.\n\nGet the game today if you love to fish or even if you have never tried it but want to become a fantastic virtual fishermen.\n\nSee you in game.\n\np.s.

I am typically more into FPS, Fighting and MMORPG's - I gave this game a try because it was free, and boy was it a decision that I am happy I made. This game is seriously a ton of fun, I could literally spend hours playing this game. I got to learn a lot about fishing tactics, best methods, and more than I ever would have expected from a fishing simulator. The graphics are nice, the environment and ambient sounds are a masterpiece as well... the game, within a few minutes can take you away from the daily grind and helps you feel relaxed. The only drawback is, I can't really cook the fish. Aside from that, downloading, installing and playing this game is highly recommended. It is also very addictive and hours will go by because of all the fun you'll be having and not even know it.

That type of things that you HAVE to spend a few nights out on the boat with your friends and or club to be the best or some type of thing like that I would REALLY like to see spear fishing and most of all right now sooner then later I would love  fly fishing to be put in.

So I recommend you guys and girls to hang in there, otherwise you will be losing a lot of fun yet to come.The DLC is not game ruining in any way.

You progress by catching different fish, the bigger the better. Once you earn enough in game cash you can buy fishing licenses for different lakes.

The only problem I have with game is that it seems very sensitive as far as catching fish. If you wait till bobber goes under first time & reel in it says your hook wasn't set & if you wait just a bit longer it says timed out. This is way to sensitive & makes catching fish very hard to do especially in such a short window like seconds. I think it could be a great fishing game if they would fix it so longer length of time for bobber to be under & actually catch a fish. Hope this helps & hope the guys will lengthen time say when bobber goes down second time you have fish on line but if goes longer then time out something like that.

Graphics and presentation for the actual fisihing are outstanding. Free-roam is pretty much non-existent as the game boxes you into small locations to fish from which is a bit disappointing considering where most video games are at today. Item and gear selection is REALLY limited in the beginning and there doesn't appear to be many options as you level up but the game is in "early access" so I'm sure that will improve. What would make this game feel like the complete package is a real feel of free-roam and options to fish from; kayaks, belly boats, etc.\n\nAlso, in-app purchases are in the game's menu's for upgraded gear/experience which is a real turn-off to me. I would have no problem purchasing a game like this outright if it meant I didn't have to deal with in-app purchase schemes which always seem to give a video-game a cheap assembly line feel.","August 15, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game brought back the memories, its Clean, simple, but not to arcadish. Hands Down the best fishing game in the last century.\n\nBe warned like many Early Release games, ask for help or better yet look up help/guides.\n\nGreat game would give many thumbs and fins up!","August 15, 2015","true","43.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
