If you made this game in "Your spare time as a hobby", that means you should show it to your friends and keep it off of Steam.

This "game" is an audacity.\n\nThis isn't even "Early Access". It's not even Alpha, for that matter.\n\nYou can host online matches in one level with 3 weapons which aren't even polished.

To start, there is no form of single player, and you need to play multiplayer, but there is not  aplayer base to do this, so you have to play with your friends. The Gameplay is clunky, when you let go of the movment key you continue to move for a bit. There is not actual player models. The game is fun if you are screwing around with friends, but sucks in other aspects. I think that this game could be awesome, the concept is cool, but there just isnt enough developer interaction. I woudl liek to reccomend this game, but until it has some MAJOR chane, i will not. It is a real shame, this coudl be a great game.","February 10","false","0.3"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","40","56","0","5"

Was dissapointing to see the cards losing their value this quick even for a newly released game. Not really recommended to buy it for the cards.  It feals like a really early barebone FPS shooter.

Please ignore all of the other reviews underneath because I think if you have the balls to make a game and go and participate in a competition then you deserve more than them.\nI have not played the game for long but I have got a few things I have noticed that can be fixed, dont worry though, you will get a lot of them:\nThe characters who fight and stuff need a lot of work, the capes fly about and everything about them isnt right including the weapons which if you hold one the enemy will be holding it regardless of what they have equipped and vise versa.\nSome of the weapons could do with a better explanation of what they do and some should have buffs and de buffs.\nADD BIGGER MAPS. Moon could be so much better with a bigger map and have some little hideaways on it just there to make games more interesting\nMake a note on the multiplayer option that you have to host your own server.\nRun a few tests too see if you can spot a few more.\nMake the characters more life like in their movements.\nYou have a good principal of a game here but you just need something that will make it stand out. I know it sounsds like a lot of work but trust me, if you stick with it, it will be great!","May 2","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Even if you're looking for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like I was this won't work. It's so bare bones yet fails on anything it could fail at. Maps are huge and look ugly from the fog effect yet have no purpose and are mostly flat ground, most of the weapons are carbon copies of each other with new models, and that whole thing about adding new maps and weapons monthly is a complete lie.","May 21","false","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
