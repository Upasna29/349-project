There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you.  The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.\n\nAdmittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.\n\nFinding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.","October 24, 2014","true","7.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roarjr/recommended/102200/","roarjr","RoarJr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roarjr/","291 products in account","Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker.  I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event.  Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing.  It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.\n\nRunespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline.  Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this.  If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game.  However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.\n\nVerdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem.  Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well.  The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features.  While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into.  Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.","February 25, 2014","true","14.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc.  The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities.  Overall, this game is average to above-average.

You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.\n\nThe tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.\n\nSo what kind of game is this?  It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all.  The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game...  It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin*  Whee~!\n\nHow does that work?  Looking at the screenshots will help a bit.  As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style.  Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom.  We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five.  If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are "legal" to play.  Each "hand" will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen.  For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush.\n\nIn each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nYou can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa!  If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.)  You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you.  You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.\n\nHere's an example of how it might work:\n\nYou already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.)  You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.\n\nThis is where the strategy comes in.  Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush!  EEEK~!!\n\nHere's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings:\n\nForget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair.  Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card!  It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent.  Now you can do one of two things:  Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nAlong the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses.  When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.\n\nBe sure to SAVE before each battle!  You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.\n\nThere a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)\n\nThis game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive!  A definite thumbs-up from me!","May 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","4"

The story plays out as a fantasy adventure, your character being oblivious to his past and must do battles with numerous foes to advance, making allies and doing quests along the way.\n\nThe game play is somewhat unique, using a combination of battle and magic cards to attack your foe. One earns points by creating sets of 5 traditional cards (ace-king: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs), using rules akin to poker, ie (pairs, 3 or 4 of a kind, straights, flushes, full house etc.). Better hands are worth more attack points (eg. full house > 2 pair). Cards are laid out in columns of which the top card can be taken to make a set, including your opponent's. Meaning strategy is important in order to create the best possible hands while trying to prevent the opponent from doing the same.\n\nThe game is simple to play once you know the rules, and can be a good way to spend half an hour or so. Battles can be hard at times but with perseverance the game is not too difficult to beat, I finished it with about 9 hours of game play. I would enjoy a sequel to continue the story as it did seem unfinished at the conclusion. At a discount price the game is worth a shot, if you like card and/or poker-like games. 6.5/10","February 24, 2014","true","11.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.\n\nThe story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?\n\nOh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be.

You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.\n\nYou are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean ♥♥♥♥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.\n\nThe spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.\n\nOverall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.","May 19, 2014","false","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I think it has the potential to be enjoyable and it is fairly unique, so that alone might be worth it to you.\n\nThis game is essentially puzzle quest but with a solitaire combat system instead of matching gems.  It's not fast by any means.  Essentially you build poker hands to charge attacks, then launch the attacks at your opponent.  Essentially you spend the entire game moving stacks of cards on top of each other to make a combo of five, and the higher the combo on the damage scale, the more the attack will do.  You can also 'steal' cards from your enemies so long as they aren't stacked.\n\nThe combat is cool once or twice, but after that it becomes so repetitive.  Nearly every fight is identical, save for the select few where you need to charge and use special attacks to win.\n\nBeyond the gameplay, the music, sound effects, story and graphics are all ok.  They're mediocre, they're fine, they're acceptable.  Without a doubt they are not great and won't sell the game, but they sustain it without detracting.\n\nAll around, that describes the experience: alright, ok, passable.

I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer).

Sound odd? It is, but since I like cards and RPGs I enjoyed it. The overall gameplay, unfortunately, seemed a little too superficial for me to give it a higher recommendation; I didn't feel like I had much to do with building my character, and since the game is most definitively on-rails that was disappointing.

Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.\n\nUnfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).\n\nFrom that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.\n\nThese kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.\n\nMaybe they lost faith in this game at some point.

For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling "Raptr," but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and "story," but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a "skip" button.\n\nAgain, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.","December 21, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played Runespell and I tried to like it, I really did.  It's based around Poker/Solitaire mechanics, where you select cards from Solitaire-like stacks and then stack them on to other cards, and if you complete a Poker hand you get to deal damage.  But this game has a fairly punishing difficulty for a game which revolves a lot around random chance, but even worse, the differences between e.g. a straight and a flush and three of a kind are fairly minimal, whereas the Straight Flush and Royal Straight Flush are absolutely crushing if you get them.  This can result in a fight being repeated over and over, trying to get the SF/RSF.  This means it doesn't feel like you "won" even when you do.\n\nNevermind that the Runespell mechanics depend on dealing or receiving damage to charge up your Rage... and then you have to not be hit with Fear, which takes away your hard-won Rage.  And it takes precious actions to use Runespells, actions that could be spent sorting cards into hands and attacking, when the Runespells often cost a lot and are not all that advantageous.\n\nIf you are wondering if it has a story... uh.  It doesn't, really.  You're yet another boring "mysterious wanderer" who remembers nothing and has no characterization except being Generic Reluctant Hero #8894691, and some special powers because you are also the Chosen One.  The other characters are relatively flat and enjoy very little characterization, and what they do get is fairly ham-handed... most characters only have about a dozen lines at best, going up to two or three dozen if they're a major villain or an early ally.  And no, it's not a huge cast, either.\n\nIf you do play it, buy the Glory I runespell (only costs 10 Rage) at the first opportunity and use it before attacking, every time, preferably with multiple hands built up to attack from.  It's one of the very few Runespells worth your time.  Don't waste too much time on "guard" runespells, as the AI is intelligent enough to avoid attacking while those are up.\n\nOr, better, don't waste your money?","October 14, 2015","false","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Not much more complicated than that. A somewhat slick idea unforunately burns out quickly, leaving nothing but an oily, tarry slog. The 'runespells' add little to the game, the mechanics never change, and everything except the core poker hands is pretty much irrelevant (you'll use the same spells over and over again, except when you have to use specific ones to win a fight).\n\nKind of a pity... the production values are otherwise very high, the story has some potential for intrigue (although it never develops), and... well, there's a game in here somewhere, it just hasn't been fleshed out. You're looking at the emaciated skeleton of a game with a few pieces of rotting silk dangling from its hollow shell of bones. That's it.\n\nPerhaps the sequel, if one comes, will be worth sinking time into. For now, stick to Puzzle Quest or better yet, Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign if you don't mind F2P. Even better, play the superlative 10,000,000.

Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.","December 1, 2011","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puppychow/recommended/102200/","puppychow","puppychow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puppychow/","1093 products in account","Runespell: Overture is poker on steroids.  I find myself blowing five hours in one sitting playing this game.  The game is based on poker, but spiced with a dash of magic the gathering like elements.  You play a nameless stranger whom others refer to as a "changeling," and the very first battle is a seamless tutorial on playing this game.  Basically, your goal is to reach a castle called "skullgrim" and discover the truth about yourself. Along the way, you will encounter allies and enemies, and pick up cards ("runespells") that you will need to get through the battles.\n\nThe first thing that struck me when I launched the software is the beautiful graphics and animation for the game.  The illustrations for people and characters are excellent, and the animations are fluid.  The game mechanics are easy to pick up, but the mental challenge rises noticeably as you move on to battle increasingly difficult enemies.\n\nThe game is based on poker, and requires five card combinations in order to deal damage.  The games are 1 on 1 between your Changeling and the opponent, and the object of the game is to reduce the opponent's health to zero.  However, Runespell offers two twists to this classic game.  First you are permitted to take cards from your opponent's side of the table during your turn, when you have three action points or make three moves.  And the opponent can do likewise during his turn.  The cards are all laid out on the table, and thus the game incorporates a metagame element, where you have to be aware of your opponent's hand at all times.  The card stealing could be utilized to strengthen your own hand, or block your opponent from making a combination.\n\nThe second twist in Runespell is the use of Runespell cards, which could deal direct damage to your opponent, and add a protection to your character.  The game allows the use of these cards through accumulation of "Rage" points, which you receive when you either deal damage or receive it.  The rage points are also utilized to call allies for assistance.  However, the game limits the abuse of runespells by adding restrictions.  First, you need to unlock them either by obtaining them from defeated enemies, chests, or purchasing from a merchant.  Second, the quantity is limited; in other words you have a limited supply of them for the ENTIRE GAME.  The quantity restriction does not apply to non-player character allies, though.  Early in the game, your opponents will have little in the way of runespells.  But as the game progresses, the opponents will be formidible precisely because of these abilities.  So it becomes crucial for you to prepare counters to these attacks before you engage these enemies.  However, there is no penalty for dying in this game, and you could even flee at any time if the battle goes poorly.\n\nFor players who are not familiar with poker, the game has an icon for "poker help" on the lower right corner of the screen.  This pulls up a helpful guide on the combinations available, plus the amount of damage that each combination metes out.  This guide is helpful even for experienced poker players, as you decide which combo to aim for or just attack to clear out the table for new cards.\n\nRunespell: Overture may be repetitive, but the game is challenging and poker fans will definitely find this game delightful and fun to play.","April 20, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage.\nThis system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -> do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use.\nAs for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the "Overture" in the title.\nThe art style is quite good though.\nIn all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.","July 23, 2012","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.\n\nIt's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far.

Good graphics, bad sound, decent gameplay idea.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nGame appears behaving like a typical mobile title, with big icons, colourful sprites, single click interface.\nThis is rather small title, so not much can be expected - but it does not disapoint anywhere.\n\nSound: 5/10\nAbsolutelly atrocious music, unfit for a title, where you need to pause for a while and think about your choices.\nSound effects are average to say at best, nothing that will make a lasting impact or increase immersion. Could be worse.\n\nStoryline: 7/10\nThere is a story line, suprisingly, quite decent one. There seem to be no nonsense in story arcs, characters do all fit the setting.\nUnfortunatelly dialogues are absolutelly atrocious. You have a medieval world full of legends with dialogues using words from modern teenagers dictionary.\nUnpolished dialogue lines are possibly the greatest issue I had while playing that game (after I turned off the music).\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThere are issues with a screen display and game settings not being saved correctly.\nThis is quite visible, because the game is best played in 30m to 1h bursts rater than as single continuous experience.\nAnd the experience is sometimes uneven.\n\nThis game features poker-like mechanism of matching cards in 5 sets of poker type hands to perform 'attacks' that damage health of your opponens. This is as fun as it sounds, but wait, there is more!\nYou can steal cards from your opponent hand, you have runecards (effectively magic, limited use), companion cards (unlimited use), passive cards that increase your stats.\nThis extra layer of cards is put separate from your regular playing cards that you match during a duel.\n\nThis is as cool as it sounds, however the single duel can take a long time and its outcome is quite often random - as the card you get are randomized - which means that in 30m of gameplay you will have 3 to 5 duels (five being lucky) and some story line.\nPast that it is really repetitive and that is why playing this game in short sessions is recommended.\n\nSolid 7/10, recommend buy if a fan of a genre, wait for sale if not.","March 20","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
