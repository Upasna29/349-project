They totally rebuilt the original metro 2033 and vastly improved everything. The game is much more optimised and runs smoother, so if your PC could run the original you'll be able to run this without any problems despite the vastly improved graphics. The game looks and feels better, 4A games have taken full advantage of the new metro last light engine to make metro 2033 look like a 2014 release, adding improved lighting and weather effects. And also rebuilding the game technically by putting in the metro last light combat system, weapon customisation, sound effects and AI, as well as adding immersive features like wiping your gas mask to get rid of dirt or blood. the developers have also added new content such as extra levels, weapons and secret areas. One thing thet bothered me about the original is that they reused alot of the same character models, even on the main characters, this is now fixed in the redux version. character models now look more individual and unique and you are unlikely to run into the same looking character twice. overall I would recommend the upgrade. this totally feels like a new game.","August 28, 2014","true","7.8"," 531 of 557 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","531","557","0","10"

You bet your ♥♥♥ it is!  Practically every NPC in the game, whether important or incidental, seems to have a distinct personality and back-story.  The story of the protagonist, Artyom, is just one (albeit very important) story that takes place in the world of Metro, which wasn't built to accommodate him.  That said, I don't want to belabor the point of how "cinematic" or "gritty and realistic" Metro 2033 Redux is because the more skeptical readers might start to think it doesn't have any excellent qualities aside from that.\n\nFor most of its duration, Metro's play style lives in a gray area between action and stealth without a rigid or discrete boundary between the two.  For safety's sake it's usually best to play things quietly, and unlike in most FPS with stealth elements, being quiet isn't a matter of finding a giant sniper rifle and affixing a silencer to it.  Enemies will notice when the guy you stabbed during his toilet break doesn't come back to his post, let alone when you perforate the skull of someone standing ten feet away from them.  When you do go loud, enemies try to outflank you, flush you out with grenades and even get suspicious if/when you stop shooting back at them.  Non-human enemies even have distinct weaknesses, and methods of attacking that vary from species to species.\n\nThe game has a morality system as well, but it doesn't keep "points" and is so unobtrusive relative to that of most other games that some players might actually not realize that it's there if they don't look carefully.  Being good isn't merely a matter of choosing who to shoot, but requires the player to empathize with characters (sometimes even in spite of the uniform they happen to be wearing!).  Contrariwise, being evil can be as simple as being callous or selfish and doesn't require the player to be cartoonishly bad to gain "naughty points".\n\nSimultaneously grim and poignant, Metro presents one of the best stories I've seen, in games or elsewhere.  It's like Cormac McCarthy's The Road with guns (see what I did there?).  But seriously, Metro 2033 Redux is probably the best game I've played in any genre, and has a myriad of other positive things I could say about it, but won't for the sake of brevity.  Buy it!  Even if you have to spend your last round of military-grade 5.45 caliber ammunition!\n","February 10, 2015","true","29.5"," 393 of 408 people (96%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","96","393","408","38","13"

However, I personally purchased Metro 2033 Redux for some easy achievements and a what once was an extremely rare badge. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy what I experienced, but I feel there's a lot to praise and criticize 4A Games on with this product.\n\nLet's start off with the major additions to Metro 2033 Redux mentioned in trailers, shall we?\n● The ability to wipe your mask. Just as in Metro: Last Light, you can now wipe your mask as many times as you like! Don't forget to wipe it 20 times when you first start the game for an easy achievement!\n\n● Plenty of new locations to discover in each chapter. These locations consist of military grade ammunition, dirary pages, and keys to safes that contain a considerable amount of resources.\n\n● Arytom's Diary pages to find and collect. You're probably thinking "Oh great, more things to collect!" but if you're anything like me, you like to learn everything you can about the products you purchase.\n\n● Enhanced weather, lighting and ecosystem. This time around Metro 2033 Redux is much brighter, has creatures as in Metro: Last Light and throughout the game has changes in weather. The creatures consist of spiders, baby shrimp and what I believe to be mutated birds.\n\nFeatures of Metro 2033 Redux worth praising:\n● The ability to approach a combat situation in multiple ways. Sneaking, knock out kills, use of silencers, and using the darkness to sneak up on enemies. It may seem silly and common knowledge but many games in the current gaming industry fail to deliver anything more than just a watered down run and gun experience.\n\n● The A.I. combat subroutines are irritating yet innovative. If you're approaching a combat situation guns blazing be prepard for some jumpy, trigger happy enemies.\n\n● The kills saving system. In the original Metro 2033 kills were only saved in a consecutive playthrough. This time around, you can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills for revolvers, shotguns, assault rifles, pneumatic weapons, etc.\n\n● No unsynced voice and facial animations. Although a little wonky, the facial animations and voice are never unsynced from start to finish. That's certainly saying something considering the majority of the games created today have the issue with unsynced facial animations.\n\n● No 'in-game' store. The majority of developers feel the need to put a direct link to their game's downloadable content within the game itself. This angers some consumers while ruining the immersion they're trying to create.\n\nAspects of Metro 2033 Redux worth criticizing:\n● The so called "seamless" transition between chapters always isn't as smooth as they've lead you to believe. As I played through 2033 Redux I recall 4A Games tying at least 3 chapters together. In the chapter Driving to Sparta the screen goes black at one point and you're teleported to the above ground ranger base.\n\n● The retexturing of the majority of NPCs within the game. While they may have retextured many of the non-player characters within the game, that certianly does not mean they did it for the better. In some cases, the animations look signifigantly worse than the original Metro 2033. Personally, I would rather have a higher resolution, more detailed NPC than a completely different version of one.\n\n● Non-existant NPC eye tracking. I never realized how important eye tracking was before I played the Metro series. All of the NPCs in Metro 2033 Redux feel as if they're staring off into space, unaware of their surroundings or the player.\n\n● Copy and paste menus and user interface. The menu and user interface of Metro 2033 Redux is the exact menu and user interface that Metro: Last Light used back in 2013.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and would absolutely recommend it if the price is right.","October 19, 2014","true","36.2"," 428 of 472 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","428","472","14","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/286690/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Veterans of the original version of Metro 2033 will notice a change in how the game starts. Before you pick your difficulty, you pick the way you want to play the game. Will you pick Survival, which will require players to conserve ammo, utilize stealth, and pick and choose when to fight or flee? Or will you pick Spartan, which is more akin to the action style of Metro: Last Light? The ability to pick between Survival and Spartan is included in both of the Metro: Redux titles, and each play out very differently. Not wanting to risk compromising the dark thrill of the first time I played Metro 2033, I opted for Survival and though I was also tempted to go with the hardest difficulty available I passed it up for the normal difficulty instead.\n\nSo here I was, once more taking that first climb into the outside world. Or rather, first from the gameplay perspective. You see, Metro 2033 actually begins at a climactic moment in the story and then in a flash the main character Artyom retells the story, and as such you relive it from his perspective. That first scene really helps set the stage and the gut wrenching feeling of the troubles that wait ahead. The story remains as superb today as it was in 2010 as it successfully combines the horrors of war with the supernatural and paranormal sprinkled in just enough to add another layer of tension. However with Metro: Last Light showing us what the canon ending is, returning players may feel inclined not to make same the choices for what - at the time - seemed like the "good" ending.\n\nThe first thing I noticed other than the graphical enhancements, were the controls. I'm not sure if it is all in my head or if the controls are honestly much more polished than they once were, but I went from a game where I died more often to accidental falls or overextended movements to something that controlled as crisp and precise as other shooters. Firing from the hip was actually a viable option this time around, whereas in the past you'd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn without aiming down your sights.\n\nAnother thing substantially improved is the friendly AI. I cannot express how many times in the original I died because of failures of the AI. In games like Call of Duty, the AI is intentionally made useless so that the player can feel like a hero, but that same thought process doesn't transfer over well if it is one of several parts where you have to fight tooth and nail for survival. In the original game, you'd be lucky if your comrades could even kill a single enemy. Now, they still let you do most of the work but they are actually helpful in situations that would otherwise be frustrating to the point of pulling your hair out.\n\nHopping back and forth between the games to compare the graphics across all settings, the game looks better across the board. Of course this means that if your current PC struggled with the original version of Metro 2033 you're going to have to sit this one out. Character models and environment textures have been majorly improved, offering an intense, almost real display of a downtrodden society that dwells beneath the surface. In the above-ground segments, however, the appearances of humans takes a slight hit. The beautiful display of life in the tunnels of the Moscow metro was already amazing just a few years ago, but now that beauty has increased tenfold.\n\nWhile the visuals have been majorly updated and the gameplay itself feels more polished, it seems as if all of the original dialogue audio was left the same. Not that this is a bad thing mind you, but I have a pet peeve when I encounter enemies in the game that are supposed to be of an entirely different nationality using Russian accents as though it's just business as usual. Other than that, the voice work was great then and it's mostly a good decision to have kept it as is.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux has taken the original title and increased the quality to such heights that it was like playing a completely different game. Amazing graphics, refined and tweaked gameplay... it all makes for a much smoother experience. There are no sacrifices of the good of the original but it does successfully eliminate the bad - this is how remakes should be. Whether you have played the original or not, this is a game for anyone seeking atmosphere, story, and FPS gameplay blended into something amazing. Do not miss this experience.","August 1, 2015","true","172.0"," 201 of 212 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","201","212","12","2"

Should you be interested in what Metro 2033 is about feel free to read my review on the vanilla game's store page.\n\nInitially, I thought this Redux edition was only a graphical enhancement to the game released back in 2010. Make no mistake: the creators have done a superb job! Redux sports better lighting effects, more detailed textures and, to be honest, we have so many bits and pieces here that it is simply better to use YouTube and look for some comparison videos.\n\nBut is this good for us? Well, yes! Remember when Last Light came out? It offered better graphics so much so that we can say it was as Metro 2033 was originally intended to be. So, the developers picked this upgraded, more refined engine and remade all the levels of Metro 2033. We have the ultimate Metro 2033 experience now!\n\nAnd the upgrades do not stop there: some new elements introduced in Last Light were also borrowed. For instance, melee was not possible but finally, taking out enemies silently is possible not just from the distance. Also, diary pages are now hidden throughout this game. Since you explored everything for the extra ammo now you can find these and read more about Artyom's thoughts and emotions.\n\nSome sections were expanded upon and there are new sections such as the hall in Polis where you can stop by and marvel at the establishment along with the bartender who you can drink with. Beside the diary pages there are many safes hidden, as well. Keys to them appear on dead bodies or simply on shelves and while they glow in red due to the cobwebs sometimes it is difficult to spot them. Oh, cobwebs! We now have these and setting them on fire with the lighter is as fun as it was in Last Light!\n\nRedux is the definitive version of Metro 2033. A version that expresses that this is how it should have been all along back in 2010. You can dismiss the idea if you want due to the fact that money is - once again - asked for it. However, if you are a true fan of Metro and you liked its sequel I'm sure it will be an immediate purchase for you. :)","April 24, 2015","true","10.4"," 177 of 189 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","177","189","12","0"

But not Outlast scary, it´s sort of less horror than jump-scares and simply the sounds and visuals. Especially the sounds. They´re mostly the same all the time, but sh*t they are scary, every time.\n*It has (fairly) good shooter mechanics. The weapons shoot realistically and the damage models are solid. What makes it interesting is that there are no specific damage points. You don´t know how much damage a weapon does, you just have to try it out. Makes the weapons choice just that much harder, and trust me weapons choice does matter in this game, depending on if you want to have a fun and entirely possible expirience or a difficult and far-less fun experience.\n*It has puzzles. Well, not many and they aren´t really that difficult, but it make the game more challenging and makes this not just an ego-shooter, but also sort of a thinking game.\n*The story is amazing. It is filled with plot-twists, creative levels and, most importantly, russian.\n\nThere are of course a fair share of bugs, or things the game does not tell you which makes it a lot harder. I experienced this myself. the game does not tell you that if you press (M) to hide your weapon Librarians (Monsters later in the game) will not attack you. This doesn´t spoil much as you can of course try to kill them, but it´s extremely difficult and takes up too much ammo. I wasted hours on that level and had to rely on outside help, even with normal mode on. I also had some other places where I required outside help, where the game was not explicit enough, but the main thing is that you acctually have to listen to dialogue, otherwise you are clueless.\n\nOverall, I´d say that Metro 2033 is definitely a good buy, especially if it´s on sale as it is now, and it appeals to many genres. If you like FPS, puzzle and horror games, this is definitely the game for you. And let me also add that the fact that I even bothered to write this review, and make it so positive, just goes to show that this game is definitey worth a buy, just like its sequel, Metro: Last Light, which I am yet to play but will soon review too, if it impresses me as much as this game does.","June 12, 2015","true","18.0"," 164 of 182 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","164","182","14","0"

Can't say I do for the Redux of it though.\n\nThere are some really good things that the Redux has done\nsuch as:\n-Adding the ability to knock out enemies instead of murdering them\n-Fixed bugs that led to me teleporting out of the map\n-I can no longer climb up walls like spiderman\n-Redone maps giving more areas to explore\n-Slightly less clunky movement\n-Allows you to pick either Spartan mode(shooty shooty bang bang)\nor Survival (Less supplies and encourages careful gameplay)\n\nBut oh here are some of the things I dislike:\n-New voice actor (not big a deal but I miss the old one)\n-REALLY bright lights, they're blinding me\n-Unreliable stealth (Easier but way more obnoxious)\n-Removed the ability to manually equip throwing knives, grenades,\nand your stabbing knife\n-Hit detection can really suck\n\nNow let me share some of my thoughts\n\n1.Removed the ability to manually equip items\n\nOkay so this to me is only annoying on a personal level.\nIn the original you had to manually equip them meaning\nit was much more reliable and went through a LOT faster.\n"Wait but doesn't having it assigned to a single button\nmake it more convenient?" Well, it should, but the problem here\nis that you have to select which one you want to throw from\na wheel, which can lead to you sometimes throwing a grenade\nat an enemy when you wanted a knife. But that's just me being\ndumb, the real kicker is that they take longer to actually deploy.\nI remember facing hordes of nosalises on the original Metro\njust by using throwing knives on Ranger Hardcore with no problems.\nFor here though, the delay on top of the disgusting hit detection\nmakes it absolute hell for me to do. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT\n\n2.Unreliable Stealth.\nOkay so what do I mean by this? For the Redux it uses the stealth\nmechanic Last Light has which essentially turns enemies blind as\nlong as you're in the dark. You'll have a light on your watch to\nindicate whether or not you're visible. So how is that unreliable then?\nWell, the lighting is actually to blame on this one.\nIt can be really hard to determine sometimes what counts as\nthe darkness. At times when you are clearly in a lighted area\nthe light doesn't glow and you remain peachy, but the exact opposite\ncan also happen where you're in complete darkness but somehow\nthe light is on and you are visible. The original Metro's stealth was\nway better and you also had the option of buying a stealth suit\nor a heavy suit sometime in the game.\n\n3. Added ability to knock out opponents.\nTHIS IS AMAZING. In the original Metro no matter how hard I tried\nto be good I always got the Ranger ending because of how many people\nI killed by punching them. WELL NO LONGER! In the Redux punching\npeople will instead cause a proper knockout leading to no deaths and\na happier tomorrow.\n\nSo that's about it for my take on it. Should you buy it?\nWell, all of my hatred for this, it was more because I've experienced\nthe original and have had a much better time playing it.\nThe Redux is still a solid game though and if this is your first time playing\nMetro games, go for it.\n\nAll the things I got bothered with shouldn't be a problem for you\nand you might have an easier time getting used to them than me.\nPick it up on a sale or something and I guarantee you'll have an\nenjoyable time playing Metro 2033","May 5","true","9.1"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","48","50","2","3"

It’s just awesome in every way.  If you have played the original and loved it before, then you are going to love this Redux edition even more.  I decided to jump straight in and play Hardcore Survival Mode, and boy did I enjoy it.  The story is really good and gameplay is great.  In survival mode it is every bullet and gas mask counts.   Because of this you tend to explore that little more for loot and find some wicked little areas with goodies and graphically good looking atmospheric environments.  The sound just makes it all the more real feel.\n\nBest played in the dark with no lights on, and a nice ice cold beer to the side of you! :-)\n\nSince finishing it I just want to crack on and play it again before delving into Last Light Redux.

The Redux looks amazing and plays basically exactly like Last Light, which was one of my all time favorite shooter/survival horror games ever. Everything is pretty seamless, and while it still has stout requirements to play on Ultra settings, you can definitely play on High without any real issues with a middling CPU as long as your GCU is good.\n\nAnyway, the story was engaging, the pacing was spectacular, and the tension....OMG the tension. Truly top notch. I loved this game from beginning to ending. I easily recommend playing this.

I don't have the original on steam, just on console. It most likely looks much better on pc.\n\nThe Redux isn't just another "HD Retexture" of  2033; it is a complete rebuild of it on the Metro:LL engine. The enhancements made are obvious when you first boot up the game, but I'll do my best to break it down.\n\nGraphics:\n\nCompared to the orignal's graphics, this is a no contest. The skyboxes are better, the lighting is better, and the textures are better. I think there were a few textures that looked a bit low resolution, but it wasn't a bother. Overall, they more than hold their own against other recent games. 8.5/10\n\nSound:\n\nThe sounds in Metro Redux are excellent. Everything from ambient noise to the combat sounds were spot on. The ambient noise constantly kept me on edge, and did a great job in adding to the immersion. Personally, I think this is the strongest aspect of the game. 10/10\n\nStory:\n\nTo avoid giving away spoilers, I'm going to keep this brief. It doesn't exactly follow the book, but it is still good, and believable in the context of the game. 8.5/10\n\nAI:\n\nProbably the worst part of the game. The AI is pretty bad, especially the friendly AI. It will not see enemies even when they are right in front of it, The enemy AI is also disappointing. It seems to ignore obvious signs of the player's presence, and has poor detection capabilities. Once combat starts, it still appears to have trouble finding good ways to engage the player. It blindly runs out of cover, straight into your line of fire, or ends up getting stuck in a neat single-file line as it approaches from a distance. However, it does have its moments, and can put up a serious challenge, especially at higher difficulties. 6.5/10\n\nOverall, this game is solid, and well worth the money.

It was well received by critics, and a sequel was released a few years later. Metro Last Light brought an improved engine, as well as many optimisations. The goal of Metro Redux is to graphically improve Metro 2033 while giving the gameplay enhancements provided by 2033's sequel. I say that Redux does it's job very well.\n\nEverything has been changed in Redux; 4A has rebuilt 2033 from the ground up in the newest version of the 4A engine, and it shows. The intro videos and main menu screens have been redone, and the graphics options are the same as Last Light. It is also worth noting that the new engine brings the optimisations that Last Light had, so Metro Redux will run well and still look beautiful on old-ish or mid-tier rigs (I can run almost all settings on max, including PhysX, on 1 GTX 770).\n\nWhen starting the game for the first time, you are given the option to choose your play style. Spartan gives you the action filled style that Last Light has, while still maintaining the basic survival horror feel. Survival stays true to 2033 in that ammo is limited, and stealth and ammo conservation are vital. Both modes can also be combined with Ranger, which limits the HUD - this makes the player more observant, while increasing difficulty and immersion. Note that there is no "Easy" mode, at least from what I have seen. I chose to play on Spartan Normal (action-feel, while keeping the HUD). All modes include the more forgiving stealth gameplay from Last Light, so stealth is a bit easier and more realistic.\n\nThe story remains the same, but there are improvements over the original, besides the graphics. Notes are in the world, which expand the story further. I found myself exploring areas looking for notes. The music has been improved, although it is a bit loud for my taste (this can probably be changed in a menu). The sound design is good, but I feel it could have been improved. YMMV, however.\n\nTo close, I wholeheartedly recommend Metro 2033 Redux to people who enjoy FPS games with tight controls and excellent mechanics. Although there are minor issues (some bad sound design, lack of an Easy mode), the graphics, optimisations, and added gameplay make this an easy recommendation over the original. If you are new to the Metro games, be sure to check out Last Light Redux.","August 25, 2014","true","1.2"," 83 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","83","110","0","2"

Wells\nThere isn't much I can say to express my feeling after I achieve the good ending. I rarely spent more than 30 hours for a single-player game. But when I do that, not only does it mean that I fully enjoy this game by its gameplay style, but also I do get attracted by some factors like plots, environment design or atmosphere etc.\nMetro 2033 is a game talking about what happened after nuclear war between USA and Russia. Unlike fallout series, the game focuses on telling a straight-forward story about how main character Artyom leaves home and tries to seek for help from the center of Metro and the judgments upon him or response to him from different sides while standing as innocent individual. Listening to conversation between different people is encouraged and, sometimes, will reward you some moral points. The information from those conversations would make you, a beginner like Artyom who has no idea about outer world and other people, begin to get a full picture about what’s happening around from different aspects.\nAs a game developing plot after nuclear war, Metro 2033 does a great job create atmosphere by having different kinds of detailed environments built in each chapter, not only making you fully feel the destruction caused by the war but also preventing you from feeling repetitive as you goes through each chapter. Nothing ever beats the realistic feeling of wearing a gas mask, checking the timer from time to time and crawling your way out of stinky sewers or shifted streets, worrying about whether demons or Nazis would find you at the last moment.\nThis game also has military-grade ammo as its currency. You collect them by searching every corner and use them while staying at a station with merchants. It’s not really that useful most of the time but it does provide few options to improve your weapon or switch to others.\nThe difficulty is something I want to talk about. I love ranger hardcore mode so bad because it really brings a realistic feeling of survival with HUDS being removed under this difficulty. However, since it’s the hardest difficulty with survival mode, I actually feel it’s not that challenging at all especially considering that you can sneak through some chapters without shooting a bullet.(by saying that, I actually shot my way through the whole game when I did my first try under Sparta ranger hardcore and I ran out of ammo few times in different chapters.) This isn’t a complaint or showoff, but my first try which went really smooth without any stealth just made me feel like I’m not playing the hardest difficulty but the suitable difficulty for this game.\nOverall, Metro 2033 is really a good game to try if you’re looking for a solid single-player game with good atmosphere and realistic gameplay experience. The plot is developed well and as Artyom, you will love this short journey with those unforgettable friends who helped you through.\nAnd my friend, always remember this quote.\n“You reap what you sow, Artyom. Force answers force, war breeds war, and death only brings death. To break this vicious circle one must do more than just act without any thought or doubt”\n-Khan (Metro 2033)","June 25, 2015","true","49.2"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","1"

The real changes can be seen with updated models for characters and weapons, and a few gameplay features that were added in Last Light. Some of these features include but are not limited to a nicer HUD and more effective nightvision.\n\nThe two added difficulty modes (Survivor and Spartan) are also worth mentioning because they provide more re-playability over the original 4. In fact I recommend just playing the game twice on these two modes because they are vastly different.\n\nNot really worth it unless you're a die hard fan of the series but still a noticeable enhancement over the original.

(Reccomended playing this in Russian of course if u understand it)\n\nStory:\n(SPOILERS)\n\n+ For me story is good, nuclear war, finding D6, senind message to certain charecters. Its not that perfect but its playable and u get deep into it really fast. Loved how u can save the dark ones from getting visions, u can activate alternete "good ending" by interacting with certain things in game (u'l find loads of videos in youtube)\n\nThats all i can say about this game, as i said its my favorite game off all times.\nIt Had a lot of pluses, and only 2 minuses.\nSo i easily reccomend this game to player's who love survival story driven games.\n\n"H.G.

With the advent of the redux re-release and its promises of improved  visual, performance and gameplay fidelity and a price (during sale time) that was simply too good to pass up I ended up double dipping on the series (something I normally never do) even though I already owned both Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light including all the formers DLC.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386854688\nFrom what I remember about that first hour and a half of playing Metro 2033 back in 2010 (apart from the fact that it looked absolutely gorgeous on the PC) was that it played like utter ♥♥♥♥♥. Performance was all over the place and I found the game incredibly frustrating and difficult.  While I realize the whole point of the game was to engage as little as possible with the radioactive beasties terrorizing the subways of post-apocalyptic Moscow it was at times nigh impossible not to catch their attention as you tried to sneak about. With ammo as scarce as a unicorns fart and guns that barely hit their targets even when a few feet away I came away more than a little frustrated at what was clearly a broken system. The promise that all of this had been fixed sounded too good to be true since I knew that outside of the actual broken gameplay lay a strong narrative that many praised.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386852327\nMetro 2033, for those not familiar with the game, places you in the shoes of a young man named Artyom who must journey to a missile silo referred to as D6 after learning that a mysterious group of creatures are attacking his home station. One of the first things you will first notice after booting the game up is that you now have two styles with which you can approach the original game. You can still approach the game as an all out first person survival horror adventure with limited ammo that relies more on moving covertly about in the shadows without being detected or you can apply the new ranger mode (carried over from Metro Last Light) which is more of a guns blazing experience shifting the focus to a more action orientated style of play. Whichever style you choose, and if you playing the game for the very first time, you are in for one crackerjack of an atmospheric ride. Metro 2033 Redux oozes atmosphere like no other game in recent memory and with the improved graphical and performance fidelity the game now runs like a hot knife through butter.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385420559\nWhile the game is often gorgeous to look at, especially when you surface above ground and take in the vistas of a shattered and broken modern day Moscow, where it really comes alive is in the deep, dark and dank subway tunnels that see Artyom and his compatriots scurrying about like rats as they try to survive an unimaginable apocalyptic horror.  I chose to follow the original survival horror route and I found the game to be infinitely easier than the 2010 original although no less terrifying. Various gameplay tweaks made to the redux version have resulted in a smoother and more playable experience that only enhances the original.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux oozes so much atmosphere that you can almost feel it dripping out of your monitor as you play the game and with an incredibly strong and engaging narrative driving this dreary tale forward (the game is based upon a popular Russian novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky) anyone into a solid first person shooter or survival horror with an emphasis on storytelling would be silly to pass this one up. As remakes go this is one remake done right and I highly, highly recommended you give it a go.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading the following review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 126 of 198 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","126","198","9","14"

However anyone who’s played the original will be disappointed in this Redux.  The Redux incorporates all the bad parts of Last Light and turns this into a more linear shooter game that the original.\n\nFirst of all, as pointed out by others, the lighting system is different.  The original colouring was mostly in brown tones and bathed in a soft yellow light which is what one would expect in tunnels where the artificial light sources are mainly incandescent and gas lights which tend to produce a strong yellow caste.  This yellow caste created a sombre mood and helped to provide a more intimate relationship between Artyom and his environment. Redux uses Last Light’s colouring scheme which creates an unnatural “blue” light as if the tunnels were bathed, not in incandescent lights, but harsh LED lights.  This blue caste looks unnatural and unconvincing and makes everything appear slightly brighter and therefore lessens the mood established in the original.  Also, similar to Last Light, is an over sharpening of all detail which tends to “delineate” everything making objects seem less natural.\n\nThe gameplay was too similar to Last Light’s gameplay, and to me, Last Light played more like Call of Duty game than a Metro 2033 game.  If anybody thought that the original Metro 2033 was too linear then the Redux is even worse.  You will notice this most when you are topside on the surface.  The Winged Demons play a much bigger role in the Redux and are constantly swooping overhead.  They are used to keep you on very short leash meaning you have to get from point A to point B quickly and I found that I couldn’t really explore the surface as much as I wanted to because of them.  It seemed to me that there was less exploring and stealth encouraged in this game and more fighting like Last Light (I played in Survival mode which was supposed to play like the original Metro 2033 so that was a surprise).\n\nThe character models are redone and they seem to have more of the plastic, mannequin look that the characters had in Last Light.  The Khan character is the Last Light version (the goofy Pirates of the Caribbean wannabe) not the original designed character.  Unfortunate, the superb, original voice for Artyom has been replaced with the same crappy, read directly from the script, Last Light version.  The Nosalises are the same hairy ones from Last Light and they always looked goofy to me.  Also making an appearance in the Redux are the sonic emitting Winged Nosalis from Last Light.\n\nOn the plus side the Redux is not entirely a scene for scene remake, there are minor differences and you will be exploring a few expanded areas.  Many of the original areas are slightly redone (landscape slightly different and rooms and buildings slight different) usually incorporating more detail or a redesign from the original.  So even if you recall the original quite well there will be some variation here and there.\n\nIs the Redux worth the purchase? Because I owned the original I was able to pre-order the Redux at half price, so it was worth it.   If you never played the original the Redux is worth the full price.  There’s a lot of gameplay for your money and the graphics are top notch.  Besides nobody creates apocalyptic games like the Ukrainians (i.e. Metro 2033, Last Light and the S.T.A.K.L.E.R. series).\n\n***Update***\nI have just replayed the Redux months later and my opinion hasn't changed.  I will say that if you’re a Call of Duty fan or even Resident Evil fan (there's a big gloopy, slimy, bubbly monstrous thing near the end of the game that's right up the alley of Resident Evil so those fans should feel at home at that part) and like blasting things then the Redux is for you.  Also, for you Call of Duty and Resident Evil fans your AI partners that often accompany you on your travels actually fight alongside with you.  As a matter of fact I've sat back and let the AI do a lot of the shooting and killing of the creatures.  So you actually get useful companions.","October 7, 2014","false","41.6"," 100 of 159 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","100","159","3","5"

My Unhappy Thoughts On This Remake.Genre: First Person Linear Shooter with Horror and Stealth Mechanics.\nDeveloped and Published by: 4A Games & Deep Silver\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nRedux Bundle purchased by myselfI figured with the Redux version that 4A games would bring us the game that they wanted to originally put out along with all of the enhancements, lessons learned over the years and new features their engine could bring to the table. Boy, this was not what I was expecting...\n\nBugs\nIt’s surprising how many bugs still made it through to release. I encountered my fair share and also read about the others encountered on the forums. For example, in the original Metro 2033, the “Trolley Combat” level had a game-breaking bug where the scripted sequence could get completely broken. This required you to restart the level as you couldn’t progress forward anymore. Now, take the Redux version in the same level. There is a bug where if you entered the previous scripted sequence before the level with your night vision goggles on, the game will force them on before you enter the cart, making it nigh-impossible to kill enemies. Only solution to fixing this? Restarting the entire previous level all over and making certain to not put the night vision goggles on before the scripted sequence that causes the bug. I am baffled how these bugs (among others,  as the same script-breaking bug apparently exists in Trolley Combat. Nice.) made it to release. Especially when it involves the same level that was reported to be very buggy the first go around.\n\nGraphics & UI Talk\nSure, I’ll give them some credit. The graphical atmosphere is improved with more special effects and post-apocalyptic textures compared to the original. That’s pretty easy to see from the original with entire rooms made to look more decrepit and affected by the nuclear fallout. Texture texture quality is also significantly better than before. Facial animations don’t look so odd and dated either, though at times the characters look...look like they were transplanted poorly into new bodies. The Physics engine is also better and far less sensitive compared to its predecessor. UI also looks more modern and up-to-date though it gives less information than the previous game did. Not sure how they managed to pull that off.\n\nI do disagree with their assertion that the lighting system, AI and weapon handling is better. Mutants feel far more bullet-spongy (even at Ranger difficulty levels) and there’s been some reports that hit-boxes aren’t as good as they used to be. I noticed how headshots at point blank range with a shotgun wouldn't kill the easier mutants. How it handles secondary weapons is a 180 in the wrong direction. Instead of your grenades, knives and other related weapons being easily accessible from keys 6-9, they stow them all away in a single key that is changed by holding tab and moving your mouse in the direction of the weapon you want to use. What. The. Heck. Doing this during combat is overly difficult. This is a consolitis change and I absolutely hate it. Additionally, the AI seems extremely random and unfocused in its thinking. I’ll have some attempts at the level where the AI will completely ignore me and go for the other NPCs around me. Other attempts will result in the entire horde of mutants zerging and overwhelming me. It feels extremely schizophrenic and if this is truly Last Light’s AI engine, I’m not looking forward to playing the sequel.\n\nStealth System Overlook\nThe stealth system is probably the worst change of the bunch. Instead of having a nuanced three-level stealth system, that at least gives you a chance to recover from almost being seen, it throws it all out for a binary in-stealth and no-stealth system. One little touch of light on you and you will be immediately spotted by the AI. Due to this, it seems like they had to dumb down the AI so that even if a human guard is five inches from your face, they won’t see you so long as you’re in the dark. It’s hilarious and sad at the same time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis remake/redux is an avoid. If you want to experience the best of Metro 2033, the original is the better way to go. The graphics are better, sure, I can agree to that and the optimization is much better than the original. I can definitely agree with that assertion. But the downgraded stealth system, same amount (if not possibly more?) of bugs, less enjoyable combat and quirkyness caused by the port to the new engine doesn’t make it worth it. There are a other changes that I didn't talk about that don't fit well or bring the game down. I was willing to overlook some of these problems until I ran into the game crashing bugs. At which point, I figured I was better off investing my time into finishing the original rather than dealing with this port that could have used a few more rounds of QA and playtesting.\n\nRead this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nA Paladin's Steam Review: Metro 2033 Original Edition\nA Paladin's Review of Metro: Last Light Redux[wp.me]\nExcerpts of Metro Last Light Redux Review","October 9, 2014","false","7.4"," 212 of 361 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","212","361","3","24"

The campaign is around 7-12h long depending on the difficulty you choose.\nThere's no multiplayer, co-op or "survival" (1 room with waves of enemies) mode to play.\nThe only thing this game offers you is a very linear and quite short singleplayer campaign.\n\nSo why am i recommending this?\nIt's the most fun i've had in a singleplayer FPS in years!

An open world/sandbox metro wouldn't make much sense, right?\nBeing linear helps you to get immersed with the world and creates this claustrophobic feeling you're supposed to have. Being stuck in a long, tight, dark tunnel. Hard to see anything and the graphics and eery* music just helps to get into the mood.\nHave to give credit where credit is due. The ammount of detail in this game...Amazing! I couldn't stop taking screenshots!\n\nThe only downsight is the voice acting.

There are barely any bugs or glitches (only one in my first playthrough). You can get immersed real easy, especially in the ranger modes. The game gives you a choice of either stealth, full on attack, or both, which are very satisfying if done successfully. The weapon customization is easy and intriguing, with the modifications suiting one's preferred playstyle. The linear story is still the grand satire of the original with a lot of replayability. My only complaint is that some of my favorite lines from the orignal were changed very slightly and lost the humorous affect.\n\nWhile some may think it is the same game as the original but with better graphics, they would be wrong. The game is not entirely different, but there are new experiences, new or changed spoken lines, etc.. Some lines that I have memorized from replaying the orignal so much have changed. The voice and model of the male child changed too, along with the models of Khan, Ulman, and Miller to the Last Light models. There are many more that I have noticed but do not want to spoil or did not notice at all.\n\nThe story is exactly the same as the original game, but some chapters are a little longer or have no seperate loading screens like some did in the original. The installation of the journal entries into the game adds a whole lot of lore and satire into the game. Also, some mutants from Last Light are added in, such as the spiders.\n\nA seasoned Metro fan and players new to the series who are into the FPS genre will appriciate this game, especially ones who like a good politcial satire and are into philosophy in general.","May 1","true","29.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/286690/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Let me start off this review with a warning. The game has crashed on me over 20 times during my play-through, changing everything to the lowest settings changed nothing and some even unluckier people cant get the game to start. Buyer beware.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux is a remade version of Metro 2033 that features Last Light's new engine and it's mechanics like wiping blood off of your helmet and it's stealth system. I have played very little of the original Metro 2033 so I can not compare the two aside from the graphics being much improved. It is based off a novel also called Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky. The game really benefits from the good story and perfectly captures how desperate the situation is for the human race.\n\nThe game immediately starts you off in a huge battle before you get a chance to learn the control scheme and this battle will kill you if you don't attempt to defend yourself. After this sequence you are teleported back in time to Metro station where you grew up making that whole intro feel like an unnecessary way to grab your attention. This is where the game really kicks off showing the harsh conditions of a crudely made shanty town in the metro which is constantly attacked by mutants. Future events lead you out of your home and into the doomed world that the aftermath of a nuclear explosion created.\n\nThe controls are nice and fluid. There are alt firing modes so be careful since you can not aim with a shotgun and may end up firing all your valuable shells you have loaded by accident. Your sub weapons like knives for silent take downs and grenades are tied to a single button which really bugged me since the number keys are mostly all free. Other than that they work very well and will likely be your fault when you get mauled or shot.\n\nThe gameplay is standard FPS with a strange combination of recharging health and medkits. When you take too mush damage it will take a ton of time to get better if you don't use a medkit but for minor wounds recharges rapidly. Guns have a nice feel to them and control like you'd expect them to. The stealth is rather fun, as long as you are in the dark you should be hidden from sight and can pick off enemies if you have a silencer or with throwing knives, you can even avoid them completely if you are skilled enough. You have night vision goggles, incendiary grenades to block access toward a location and more weapons are found very late in game to keep things varied.\n\nThe sounds are excellent for the most part. They really add a lot to the atmosphere with random banter between soldiers, bandits or simple stalkers that make them feel like unfortunate human beings instead of pointlessly evil clones. The creaking of the deteriorated buildings, the growls and screeches of the mutants and the sound of you breathing  really absorb you into the experience.  Unfortunately the fake Russian accents are pretty bad but even worse are the actors for the children. They are awful to the point of turning a really emotional scene into a joke. Another negative with the voice department is that we have a silent protagonist which actually talks during the loading screens to recap the situation. It baffles me as to why they decided that was a good idea as when your hardened comrades worry about you or express how they are afraid you stay silent and it feels very unnatural how they respond after that as if you said something.\n\nAs far as I can tell they absolutely nailed everything in the graphics department. The creatures look and move very fiercely and do look like something you'd find underground. The people look pretty realistic with scars, worn out clothes and battered equipment. Even has some nicely textured animals like pigs, spider and rats. The first time you head above ground you expect it to look horrifying but instead find it to look dead, abandoned, the air above ground to be toxic and requires you to wear a gas mask which leads you to feel a tinge of sadness at what was lost. The new currency of the Metro is machine gun ammunition, the revenants of the Russian army still fighting the Nazis in a now pointless war, the bandits stealing from and murdering the weak, and the regular people desperately searching for ammo to have a chance of defending themselves. The world really feels doomed and plunging even further now that even the air to breathe is a luxury.\n\nIt is an amazing game but unfortunately has some serious technical issues for me. Frame rate goes from over 100 to mid 40's seemingly at random. Plenty of crashes and microstutter even on the lowest of settings and PhysX turned off. It makes for unnecessary tension of quickly reaching the next checkpoint and not being able to enjoy the view and fight scenes without the threat of it crashing at any moment. But even through all that I finished the game and am eager to play it's sequel. I give it a recommendation but keep in mind of the problems you may or may not have before purchasing.\n\nGTX 780 (stock)\nI-7 3930k\n4X4GB Patriot Viper ram","October 29, 2014","true","11.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

Regardless of how much brighter the underworld is then the original the Librarian sequence is and I swear to god just as scary if not scarier then the original. I have a pretty sweet asus sound card for my Sennheiser HD 598 head phones. The sounds in this game are so creapy at times that I had to take my headphones off and switch over to my speakers. This was due to i was jumping and turning around way to often like a ♥♥♥♥♥. The audio bump from Metro 2033 to Redux is amazing although it does take a decent open ear headset with a soundcard to truely enjoy. My daughter walking on sqeaky floorboards above me was often mistaken for in game sound thats how unbeleivably clear it is. Most scenes are startling however this game does throw you into a ton of run for your life moments especially in the harder difficulties on Survival mode. Survival mode really does make you think hard about your weapon setups which to me adds a whole new level of tension. Out of ammo = run and hope u can get to the next objective which happened to me frequently LOL.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardkard/recommended/286690/","sardkard","Whiskeybits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardkard/","159 products in account","Metro 2033 was an ugly game, full of bugs and game breaking glitches, but that added to its low budget charm. It was tense, gritty and immersive and had a whole lot of character. Redux makes the game beautiful, fixes those bugs and I haven't ran into a single game breaking glitch.\n\nAs someone who's beaten the original 2033 multiple times, I can say Redux is worth a shot if it's on sale. It's the same as the first game at its core but it does have numerous changes. The best changes being that the textures don't look so muddy and awful, the character models are much better and there are more than five of them this time around. Extra weapons and attachments which were in Last Light have also been added to the game, along with more songs for the soundtrack. The biggest flaw Redux has which the original does not is the stealth however. 2033 was incredibly broken when it came to stealth, enemies could spot you on the other side of a corridor if you so much as stepped an inch out of the shadows; they'd sometimes detect you when you haven't even done anything and immediately everyone within a 10 mile radius would be pumping lead into you. It was unforgiving, frustrating but it made beating every stealth section even better. To Redux's credit it tries to fix this by copying the stealth of Last Light, which has the opposite problem in that it's far too easy. You can walk right up to enemies, even bump into them, and they won't notice you until you fire, walk infront of them or are in the radius of a light source. There isn't a whole lot of challenge to being stealthy with one or two exceptions.\n\nThe difficulty is still high in every other aspect however. Gunfights on Ranger mode may as well have a leaderboard to see who can last the longest when not behind cover because it's essentially instakill. Like in the original 2033, this works wonderfully for encounters with human enemies but the game becomes unbareable when you're fighting 7 or 8 Nosalises at once, or having to deal with a bunch of Watchers where they essentially teleport to you and swipe attack. This was most noticeable in Hole Station when fighting Lurkers who have a graphical glitch where they merge into uneven floors, making it impossible to time a counter to their jump attacks. Not ashamed to admit I couldn't deal with it and dropped to a lower difficulty for the sake of my sanity.\n\nThe best part of the game remains entirely intact however. It's one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. The Great Library is an incredibly tense and horrifying setting, if a game was made based entirely on the Depository level then it would easily rival the likes of Alien: Isolation. Librarians are one of the most terrifying enemies to deal with, and in Redux they are completely revamped aesthetically and it adds to their impact so much that it makes going back to Hole station on Ranger mode not seem so bad. The story stays quite true to the book also, of course you couldn't adapt the book entirely but it does a great job.","September 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/recommended/286690/","moonshinefox","[TLEG]Mana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/","198 products in account","In my honest opinion. Redux offers some texture upgrades and some better character and mutant models. Personally, I've grown fond of the more creepy design of the mutants from the original game and therefor am not a fan of the new models, but arguably they look better.\n\nHowever, the lightning model in this remake is absolutely sheit compared to the original. In this game it's completely binary. Either you are lit or you are not. There is nothing inbetween. This produces a jarring "pop in" when you get near enough to a light source and suddenly you light up. In addition, this applies to the lightning effects overall. They are very sharply defined and flashlights look MUCH worse in this game compared to the original. There are no more projected lights. Lights are instead bitmapped and produced by shaders, causing a much worse picture overall. Lightning is also nowhere near as smooth as the original, causing the world to look sterile and artificial, rather than gloomy and atmospheric.\n\nStealth takedowns and stealth knockouts make an entry as well as quick-keys for throwables and melee attacks. That's a big plus. You can wipe your gasmask from dust, snow and blood which is neat. However, the drawbacks FAR outweigh the positives.\n\nAI for humans is all but brain dead. They have no accuracy whatsoever so the only time you are really going to die (even on Ranger Hardcore) is when you screw up badly and get stormed or get caught out without cover. Stealth mechanics are so hideously simplified that the AI will not see you even if you stand right in front of their face, but not lit. They do not react to sounds around them unless it's extremely close, making stealth a child's play. In addition, the binary lightning engine makes stealth a frustrating experience as you might suddenly just POP out of stealth because you happened to cross that silly border too close to a light source.\n\nIn 2033 original you can instead see on your arms, weapon and overall on the world how light it is, and the lightning system has multiple layers and is gradual rather than binary.\n\nIn closing the mutant AI is frustratingly gamey in Redux. Even though you have 3-4 NPCs around you that are far nearer to the mutants than you are, most mutants will just ignore them and beeline towards you, making most mutant battles a silly backpedaling-while-firing fight rather than a tactical fight with the help of NPCs. Mutants are also much more bullet sponges than they were in the original, causing even Ranger Hardcore to feel more gamey, which is not a good thing.\n\nIn addition the hit detection is changed in Redux. It's much more simplified compared to the original. In Redux, a thrown knife is an instant kill no matter where you hit your enemy (humans that is. Mutants are far more resilient). Provided you actually hit to begin with. The hit detection is remarkably glitchy and I've had more than one arrow, dagger, whatever pass straight through an enemy. Gone is the very detailed hit detection of the original where you really had to aim for exposed skin to make a clean kill with the knife or pneumatic weapons. If your knife hit a piece of armor, a pouch or even an arm or a leg, the enemy would be alerted to your presence and not just stiff up and die.\n\nIn short, do I recommend this? Sadly I do not. In the beginning I could ignore all the texture bugs, the animation bugs, the excessive clipping and the awful voice acting. But as the game progressed in came horrible AI, severely dumbed down stealth and lightning mechanics and a huge downgrade how hit detection is made. I implore you not to fall for the "shiny" and get this. Instead, buy the original and experience Metro 2033 as it was MEANT to be. This is just another terrible consolitis game.","September 17, 2014","false","17.8"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","0"

A really good adaptation at that too. One of the reasons "non-russians" LIKE "russians", is this portrayal of their character we are given. A masterful translation from book to game. Totally enjoyable.\n\nThe game is a first person shooter, where you must follow the storyline strictly. It is not an open sandbox. It plays something like a Call of Duty game where you play completing the story. It's linear and your choices are limited to what the chapter has prepared for you. There is no going back, no "safe houses". The idea of mutants is introduced, the "WAY OUT" Demons, makes a person think what nuclear bang spawned these beings? Entertaining even so. I enjoyed the AK-47, the awesome automatic shotguns, BUT shooting huge beasts with AIR-RIFLES, made me stop and think??!!\n\nComparing Metro 2033 with Metro 2033 Redux;\n-I felt to a large measure that there was a freedom HERE I didn't experience in Metro 2033,\nis it ME maturing as a gamer, improving my playing skills? Is the "ENGINE" better? I look at achievements I achieved, the same amount as the original!! My impression was GOOD, I enjoyed re-playing REDUX I conclude!\n-Metro 2033 was a sight to behold, there is no reason a re-mastered edition shouldn't satisfy. Those insisting one\nis better than the other may overshadow the storyline which enjoys priority. In retrospect, I am NOW inspired to re-play\nthe ORIGINAL to gob-smack the Redux disciples that won't hear any other thing but "REDUX". Let us not forget,\nthe original is the 'cause we came to love the Metro series.\n-Yes the original still has bugs, there is the sliding and strafing experienced; saddens me that it hasn't been updated. The dev's have nothing better to do than to create a WHOLE new game (the REDUX) for us to buy, other than patching (harboring feelings of owning a dejected game) the original and updating it. It's not perfect.\n-The effect of re-enforcing the storyline happened now on this playthrough; "OH", I thought as I replayed, confirming what I thought previously. Making many mental notes as I played.\n\nMetro:Last Light [our sequel]\n-I am curious as to what Metro:Last Light Redux will offer as they say that Metro 2033 was rebuilt on the engine used for the original Last Light. How can it be improved?\n-I have completed Metro:Last Light, before, I am looking forward to completing Redux Last Light at this point.\n\nI did ENJOY this game momentously and foresee many more playthroughs but to say I felt I owed it this review justified my appreciation of Metro 2033 Redux.\n\nThank you for an excellent game\n\nGame on","January 6, 2015","true","16.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

With ammunition, grenades, medical items, and gasmask filters coming in a somewhat limited supply. The currency of the game is a certain type of bullets, "Military Grade Rounds", that are more powerful than the "Makeshift Counterparts" but using these is basically "shooting money" so the player should be wary when using them.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Metro 2033 Redux, has a fantastic stealth and detection system combining both sound and vision. The player can turn off, or shoot out, lights and can crouch for added stealth.\n\nFrom the famous AK-47 to throwing knives, Metro offers a wide assortment of weapons and hefty\ncustomization. It lets the player choose what best suits their needs from supressors and weapon stocks to laser sights and scopes. There are several different weapon types to choose from aswell, including assault rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and many more.\n\nWhen playing the game and walking around in the tunnels you get this empty feeling, and that really improves the gameplay. But one thing, that I thought was outstanding, was that when you for the first time exit the tunnels and lay eyes upon Moscow, this massive, desolate city. It's a breathtaking view.\n\nThe games story is absolutely fantastic and it sucks you right in.

I haven't even been able to finish it since it crashes at the very last second.\n\n-deep breath-\n\nOkay. Enough nit-picking the bad. Redux is more or less the updated Metro 2033 with all the newer models from Metro: Last Light and it's nice. It's nice to play through Metro 2033 with the same system as Last Light and not have the character voices differ crazily from each other as they used to be.\n\nCertain bits have been changed from the original for better flow between levels and I applaud that. Even as a Metro veteran, I feel more as a newcomer again which is nice since a reboot of the game would just be bland and boring in it's simplicity.\n\nHOWEVER. Until the bugs and certain glitches are fixed (and please give back the fur to the Librarians. Currently they just remind me of wingless demons), I probably would rather direct people to the normal Metro: 2033 as there's less bugs and crashes and more meaningful story.\n\nI also miss the sneaking suit and the armoured suit. They were the highlight of the entire game for me. :(","August 31, 2014","true","10.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The game takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, which looks great. The deepest, darkest areas in the game look good and are spooky. The Metro stations are believable and immersive, and the war going on between the N@zi and Communist parties is quite captivating and exciting. I also really enjoyed the dialogue in the game. Up above, in the streets of Moscow, ruin lies in the streets and the snow and buildings (both near and far) look great. The people who live in the Metro are likable and you will find yourself appreciating their presence. The gunplay is perfect, the guns can be upgraded, and there are weapons to suit everyone's needs (stealthy, close-up, distance). The enemies you will encounter are believable and diverse, although often only one type of enemy is dealt with in each area.\nThere are a couple of problems I would like to point out:\nSome of the areas are frustrating, to say the least. At one point I completely ran out of ammo and had to run around while a NPC fought the Dark Ones in order to dodge and survive.\nDo not try to kill the librarians- kill one to get the achievement, and sneak around the others. They are too strong.\nThe D6 area is a pain and made me almost want to quit. This is because I ran out of air filters at the beginning and had to rush around the D6 in darkness trying to find new ones. I spent many minutes trying to succeed and almost thought it was impossible to move on in the game.\nThe Tower has some QTE moments that I was not even aware of at first. Make sure to press E when you climb the ladder.\nBack to the good:\nThe game is like all other good games; it is an experience, not at all just a way to pass time. I recommend Ranger mode because I often do not like HUD and it is grittier. Also, this game looks great on all graphics settings. In all, this game is a little world that lives and breathes, is interesting, and provides hours of entertainment. It is a time you will always want to remember.\n\n","December 25, 2014","true","12.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Unfortunately the game's mechanics just don't live up to the enviornment.\nThe AI is horrendous, I had enemies just run in circles looking for me but because I was crouched 5 feet in front of them I was magically invisible. Had little enemies pretty much glitch out, they're programmed to run up hit you and then they have a visual of them flipping off you and running away into a hole. Get to far away from a hole and the animation just freaks the ♥♥♥♥ out, I had an enemy just chain back flip of my face (think the bird from the Forrest). Had other problems with mutant AI. You're supposed to just look straight at librarians to make them back off, nope had a few times where they'd just walk up to you, stand then, they're about to deagro and suddenly the AI loses its mind and they'll just slap you down even if you're staring straight at them.\n\nAlso talking about really bad AI, some enemies are pretty much set to target you and you only. They'll flat out just clip through other NPCs and just soak up bullets because they're meant to be killed by you and only you.\n\nThe audio mixing also tends to freak out. Areas where multiple NPCs are talking just makes the audio a mess. I had an important NPC talk to me just to have his dialogue drowned out by the unimportant chatter from the surrounding fluff npcs. Had some characters have their next set of dialogue start before they finished their current dialogue. Had an instance where the NPC I was following didn't have his dialogue trigger so I stood there fighting wave after wave of enemies for a good 15 minutes until I ran out of health and ammo, just to find out that I had to go do something while he fought the enemies.\n\nThe game also does an obscenely bad job of telling you how the mechanics work, unless I missed it, it pretty much doesn't tell you how anything works at all.\n\nAmazing visuals, really interesting story and world surrounding it, but I honestly can't recommend it. For what basically is a remastered version I don't get how these problems are so prevalent.\nIt's definitely one of those games I wish I could give it a "mixed" rating instead of a yes or no.","December 23, 2014","false","9.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Due to the "Spartan Mode" less survival horror like than the original Metro 2033.\nThe game is far more polished up than the original and in fact the most polished "Eastern game" I ever  played. The setting in the Moscow Metro grants a valid excuse for linearity and tight level design, which by itself is not a bad thing, since linear games have benefits open world games lack and vice versa.\n\nPositive:\n- Lots of love to detail, though on a smaller scale than in Bioshock or Batman Arkham City.\n- Amazing light effects.\n- Very atmospheric.\n- Easy and understandable  menu and key bindings.\n- Ran bug free on my system!\n\nNegative:\nSeems the developers shared my view, since many of the shortcomings of Metro 2033 have disappeared in Metro Last Light:\n-  Undistinguishable mutant enemies which look and behave too much alike.\n- Mediocre story and flat dialogues. Whether it is owed to the vodka or the radiation, the children in the Metro for example look like 6-10yo, but talk like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3yo's.\n- The love to detail does not count for the human character models. Also there are very few of them: 2 female only and apart from that, many NPC's use the same face model, which is kinda confusing when Hunter looks like Bourbon and so on. Especially the children are awful.\n- Horribly one-dimensional characters story-wise.\n- too much in-game promotion of the Metro book.\n- health system turns to fast from "red to dead".\n- spread between buy and sell price at the gun and ammo merchants is a rip-off and worse than the current ruble one.\n- Generally, the economic and gun upgrade system needs some fine tuning.\n\nNeutral:\n- no classical boss fights in the game.\n- I am missing the kind of lonely moments and tunnel walks, I had experienced for example in HL1. Too many companions for too little Metro kilometers.\n\nMost of these above mentioned got improved on Metro LL. Metro 2033 however is less of a classical FPS like the aforementioned, but more of a survival horror game in the sense that you got creepy moments and hordes of mutant enemies attacking you at fast pace. I'd say 60-70 percent mutant versus human enemies. Hence, the Metro series got the biggest selection of shotguns I have ever seen in any FPS, but Metro 2033 has not a single native sniper rifle, which sayz much about the gameplay.\nI played both games one after the other and together they would make a great long game and are really part one and two of the same story.","January 21, 2015","true","57.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Survival is the original setting with scarce ammunition rewarding stealth and exploration, whereas the spartan mode is more like Metro "Last Light" with faster paced/arcadish combat. I definately did not feel that the latter ruined the survival aspect of the game, so hats of to the dev team for balancing things out pretty much perfectly.\n\nBut yes, the Redux does look vastly better than the original, improving the already dense post-apocalyptic theme with visuals that are so much more immersive. Especially the lighting impresses, and it all runs so much smoother than with the old engine.\n\nAll is not golden though, as the animation sequences on the fast moving mosters are SO poorly linked, that it completely ruins the immersion at times. Being shoulder to shoulder with your comrades firing AK-47's into an approaching horde of monsters looks horrible. The instant a monster is hit, it commences an animation frame way too far from the previous running animation. Adding to injury, the bounding boxes of the creatures aren't properly respected in the collision handling, so it all looks incredibly messy at times, with monsters clipping though eachother while doing the electric boogie animation blend.\n\nWell, that had to be said, but the game is still one of the best atmospheric single player FPS games I've played. For a proper AAA game it's dirt cheap in this Redux version.\n\nA proper must have for fans of the genre.\n\n91%","October 1, 2015","true","18.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/recommended/286690/","DivRoK","DivRoK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/","433 products in account","Veterans of the original version of Metro 2033 will notice a change in how the game starts. Before you pick your difficulty, you pick the way you want to play the game. Will you pick Survival, which will require players to conserve ammo, utilize stealth, and pick and choose when to fight or flee? Or will you pick Spartan, which is more akin to the action style of Metro: Last Light? The ability to pick between Survival and Spartan is included in both of the Metro: Redux titles, and each play out very differently. Not wanting to risk compromising the dark thrill of the first time I played Metro 2033, I opted for Survival and though I was also tempted to go with the hardest difficulty available I passed it up for the normal difficulty instead.\n\nSo here I was, once more taking that first climb into the outside world. Or rather, first from the gameplay perspective. You see, Metro 2033 actually begins at a climactic moment in the story and then in a flash the main character Artyom retells the story, and as such you relive it from his perspective. That first scene really helps set the stage and the gut wrenching feeling of the troubles that wait ahead. The story remains as superb today as it was in 2010 as it successfully combines the horrors of war with the supernatural and paranormal sprinkled in just enough to add another layer of tension. However with Metro: Last Light showing us what the canon ending is, returning players may feel inclined not to make same the choices for what - at the time - seemed like the "good" ending.\n\nThe first thing I noticed other than the graphical enhancements, were the controls. I'm not sure if it is all in my head or if the controls are honestly much more polished than they once were, but I went from a game where I died more often to accidental falls or overextended movements to something that controlled as crisp and precise as other shooters. Firing from the hip was actually a viable option this time around, whereas in the past you'd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn without aiming down your sights.\n\nAnother thing substantially improved is the friendly AI. I cannot express how many times in the original I died because of failures of the AI. In games like Call of Duty, the AI is intentionally made useless so that the player can feel like a hero, but that same thought process doesn't transfer over well if it is one of several parts where you have to fight tooth and nail for survival. In the original game, you'd be lucky if your comrades could even kill a single enemy. Now, they still let you do most of the work but they are actually helpful in situations that would otherwise be frustrating to the point of pulling your hair out.\n\nHopping back and forth between the games to compare the graphics across all settings, the game looks better across the board. Of course this means that if your current PC struggled with the original version of Metro 2033 you're going to have to sit this one out. Character models and environment textures have been majorly improved, offering an intense, almost real display of a downtrodden society that dwells beneath the surface. In the above-ground segments, however, the appearances of humans takes a slight hit. The beautiful display of life in the tunnels of the Moscow metro was already amazing just a few years ago, but now that beauty has increased tenfold.\n\nWhile the visuals have been majorly updated and the gameplay itself feels more polished, it seems as if all of the original dialogue audio was left the same. Not that this is a bad thing mind you, but I have a pet peeve when I encounter enemies in the game that are supposed to be of an entirely different nationality using Russian accents as though it's just business as usual. Other than that, the voice work was great then and it's mostly a good decision to have kept it as is.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux has taken the original title and increased the quality to such heights that it was like playing a completely different game. Amazing graphics, refined and tweaked gameplay... it all makes for a much smoother experience. There are no sacrifices of the good of the original but it does successfully eliminate the bad - this is how remakes should be. Whether you have played the original or not, this is a game for anyone seeking atmosphere, story, and FPS gameplay blended into something amazing. Do not miss this experience.","March 9","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

Inhabiting the post-apocalyptic world of Russia, Moskow, you mostly dwell underneath the earth, into the metro system. The only hospitable place for humans to live. From time to time you will wander above the ground, into the ruins of the destroyer Moskow in a superb showcase of graphics, an upgraded skybox(from 2033), global illumination and levels being a continuos flow, where 2033 was broken into cinematic segments. Artyom's home station, VDNKh, is being threatened by the mythical creatures called "The Dark Ones" and so, he is sent on a mission by Hunter, to warn Polis about the imminent threat. Artyom's journey will get him through a variety of segments, which include gunfights, stealth segments, paranormal and horror-esque parts. You will also see how humanity has adapted after it was almost wiped out off the face of the earth. And how humans react to this hostile place, how political ideologies, survival and living on the edge of humanity affects this world.\n\nThis is where this game shined, and will shine on. Metro is such an amazing rollercoaster ride, I used this metaphore because it is not an open world experience, and in my opinion, it doesn't have to be. This game is from an Eastern Europe based studio, in an ex-communist country. These guys know best how things looked back in the cold war, and it draws heavy inspiration from that. This is what makes it believeable and tangible. Levels are packed with amazing shadow/light effects, spider webs, great props, detailed interior and exterior design. The levels feel so refined like no other game before it, honestly. I spent so much time just glaring at object scatered around me, this made the "non-violent" sections of the game such a breath of fresh air, and a bit relaxing to be honest. I legitimately enjoyed catching other human npc's interact in the game, in a manner that is  human, in the real way, they feel really fleshed out. You can feel the dread and sorrow of some, while others seem like they're built for such an opressive society. The desperation and hopelessness drips in this game. This is a serious subject and it is treated as such. You are not an unstoppable killing machine with unlimited ammo and bad-♥♥♥ one liners. You are a survivor, I cannot stress this enough, please, do yourself a favor and play this game on Ranger Hardcore for the ultimate experience. In the end, the game isn't just a game you play for fun, it has so much emotional value and so many interesting design choices, I can't imagine a better way to deal with such a subject matter.\n\nSome of the more notable changes of 2033 Redux from the original are as follow:\nAll-new lighting engine.\nLower end PCs perform better.\nCinematics have been redone and are now presented in first-person perspective.\nFeatures day and night cycles.\nMore detail to levels and will boast greater visual fidelity.\nSome levels have been expanded such as: the Dead City section is now a single level.\nBorrows a few gameplay elements for Metro: Last Light, such as adding the option to wipe your mask clean as well as combat improvements - like stealth takedowns and weapon customization\nAll character's models will be changed to the Last Light version.\nMetro 2033 Redux will gain all weapons from Last Light and its DLCs.The list goes on and on, I could babble for weeks why I love this franchise and why these devs are some of the most ambitious people to come recently into the market with something so fresh and so amazing. I will leave you with this, for 20 bucks as a starting price, and 50% off if you own the original 2033, this is such a great deal, I'm sorry, this is like the only "next-gen" remastered game I trully approve of. It is a must buy for pc shooter fans, for metro fans, for everyone. Everyone will find some delight in this game. Personal rating of 10/10.","August 28, 2014","true","13.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","2"

Firstly, for anyone who doesn't like pathetic cashgrab, I'll assure you this remaster is packed with actual content. While the original experience is still worth it (and different), this is a much more polished product.\n\nIn short, the game is excellent both mechanically and visually. It plays smoothly with minimal interface. There's plenty of choice as far as actual strategy is concerned. Many weapons to choose from and different paths to objectives. The immersion is so complete, I actually felt safer in rat infested tunnels than on the surface. While the game is actually quite linear on a larger scale, you don't feel that one bit.The atmosphere is heavy, "safe zones" are few, overcrowded and tiny. You'll find yourself pushing forward, either because staying where you are isn't an option or because you actually want to make a difference.\n\nFor the downsides; not many. I feel "ressources managements" is a bit underplayed even on higher difficulty. When I end up without bullets or medpacks, it's because I actively squandered them like an idiot. I don't need to think about each bullet like I wish I needed to. Also the highest level of difficuly as no UI at all, and this feels a bit too much. I understand Artyom doesn't have magic bullet vision, but I'm pretty sure he can feel the difference between throwing flame grenades and knives. I wouldve liked a less extensive IU (don't show remaining bombs for example).","September 2, 2014","true","14.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Would you recommend Metro Redux? No. Why? Because it doesn't offer anything worth 20 bucks compared to the original.\n\nRedux in my opinion is a quick developed "copy-pasted" game released with "next-gen" consoles in mind. 95% of the content is ripped off the original game or Last Light. Textures, animations, voices, you name it. Plus they didn't implement and fix things a lot of players have been asking since 2033 was released like better textures or FOV slider (Can be modified editing game files but is a detail which proves that devs don't care so much about the community). Even stealth is way worse than the original, hell they didn't implement something so simple like interact with the bulbs just like in LL.\n\n"But, but redux looks WAY better!".....no it doesn't. It looks only brighter and cool because they implemented Last Light physx and got rid of the grey tones, nothing else. An example about lighting, the first image that comes to my mind are the "supposed to be" lights from the outside coming through the cracks on the wall inside the tunnels.They don't look natural, they just look like a huge focus light badly placed to simulate natural lighting and the original game didn't have that problem in fact it looked spectacular.\n\nI do have to admit some parts look slightly better, the rest same/worse than vanilla. And when some parts look same/worse than the original in a "remake", that means is not a remake at all. This game needed further development, it is clearly a cheap remake made in a hurry just for the next-gen consoles. And let's not talk about Last Light redux... that's clearly a huge mistake made for quick cash.\n\nConclusion, if you are new in the series and don't know where to start, i would recommend the original. If you are tired of replaying the original but you love it so much, wait till this version is 5 bucks. Specially since this version has a lot of bugs and needs a patch ASAP.

The game is based on a Russian short novel, which I have not yet read, but the quality of its content is evident in this adaptation. One of Metro's greatest draws is the atmosphere. (Protip: Play using Russian spoken language with English text.) This is one of those games that can be held up as an example that video games are an art, just like movies, books, or music.\n\nGameplay itself is fairly no-frills FPS. No traces of RPG elements here to foster Completionism. As such, replayability factor for this game is analogous to re-readability for a book: It will be entirely determined by how well you personally liked it and wish to experience it again. This game is also similar to a book in that the narrative doesn't really change in any way from playthrough to playthough. The game is almost entirely linear. The only split comes at the very end when you can choose between two different endings. (Only one of which is canon.)\n\nReview of Redux version\nBesides the graphical improvements the biggest changes would be the altered diary text and slightly altered missions. Honestly, as a whole I have to say that I like the original better. The new diary text is peppered with spelling errors and I can't even say the content of the writing is really an improvement over the original.\n\nOn the plus side, the gameplay mechanics have been updated to Last Light levels so that you can now knock out and silently melee kill human enemies whereas in the original the melee attack was always noisy.","May 18","true","26.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play as Artyom, and you'll\ntraverse the metro and the surface to erradicate the Dark Ones.\n\n---REVIEW---\n\nThis is a remastered version of Metro: 2033, a game which,\nI personally, never could finish. Not due to a weak computer,\nbut rather due to a difference in taste.\n\nMy personal opinion about the original game was that the\ngraphics wasn't actually that good, they over-used blur\nand DoF effects, the character models were horrible,\ncut-scenes were clumsy and at times just felt like\nthey didn't fit in, the gameplay was also boring, firing\nweapons had no feel to it, it felt like softguns.\n\nI've always been kinda sad about the fact that I never\nfinished Metro: 2033, because I loved the sequel\nMetro: Last Light. So has the Redux version managed\nto satisfy me and other gamers who shared my opinion\nabout the original game?\n\nFor me personally, yes, yes it has. the Redux version\nhas been given a huge overhaul.\nGiving us the original game and story only with the\nsuperior and refined gameplay of Last Light.\n\nThe weapons feel real, they give a punch when firing\nthem, it's both satisfying and fun, the stealth mechanics\nfrom Last Light has also entered this redux version, making\nstealth play satisfying and exiting, giving you several\nways of doing and completing different sections of the game.\n\nMany fans of the original 2033 had some complaints about\nLast Light being too easy, and not survival enough. The Redux\nversion now gives you the option weither or not you want\nthe Run-In-With-Guns-Blazing gamestyle of Last Light\nor the more harsh survival gamestyle of the original.\n\nI played it on Survival, with Ranger difficulty, and I was\nvery satisfied. The resources were hard to find, you'd always\nbe low on ammo, and running around on the surface, shooting\nat mutants rushing towards you while you're all aware of your\nlow ammo situation, while only having 2 minutes left\nof air-filters, was both hard and hectic, but very enjoyable.\n\nThere were a couple of scenes in this game that pulled\ndown the fun some moments, sections where you're\nin a rail-wagon/car/vehicle, and you'll need to gun\ndown several enemies, many, enemies, and if you\nplay on Ranger, you'll probably die a couple of times.\nThese sections felt unfair and boring, they've could\nleft these parts out of the game.\n\nThe game has also gotten rid of the clumsy cut-scenes\nand gone with the First Person Perspective cut-scenes\nseen in Last Light, which I like, I felt as it was more immersive\nthis way.\n\nThe graphics are stunning as usual, from the dark metro tunnels,\nto the spectacular surface, this game is a eye-candy at every\ncorner.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics, there's a huge difference in\nopinion weither the Redux version actually packs better\ngraphics compared to the original 2033. While playing\nthe redux version, I also fired up the original, and played\nit along-side with Redux, so I could compare it by myself.\n\nMy conclusion is, it's a matter of taste.\nI could not see a huge difference. The original has a darker\natmosphere, the Redux version is brigher.\nMy personal opinion is that the Redux version overall\nfeels more refined and polished. They removed the\nexaggerated  use of DoF and blur effects, and made\nthe game brigher, and given an upgrade on the\ncharacter models. I really like the graphics,\nthey've found a nice balance with the effects,\nand I love the lighting in this game.\n\nI think this game looks prettier than the original,\nbut as I've said, it's more a matter of taste, rather\nthan technical programming, since they both\nin the end, look pretty similar.\n\nThe story is exciting and interesting, nothing,\nspectacular that you'll remember in the future,\nbut it's enough to keep you interested, and completing it.\n\n---CONCLUTION---\n\nThe graphics is a matter of taste, my personal opinion\nis that I like the brighter setting of the game, the lighting,\nthe fine balance with DoF and blur, and the overall\ngraphics. Seems in my eyes, more polished and refined\ncompared to the original.\n\nThe gameplay is a huge improvement over the original,\nit's fun, action packed and exciting.\nThe fact that they've given you the option of playing\nthe more Survival oriented gamestyle from the original\nand the more easy-going guns-blazing gamestyle from\nLast Light is a huge bonus, as now you can choose the\nstyle you like the most, weither it's the original or the\none from Last Light, you'll get the gamestyle you\nliked the most.\n\nThis Redux version is definitely, worth your 19€.\nIt gives you a lot of value for your money, in form\nof replayability and the two different gamestyles.\nIt took me roughly 12 hours to complete.\n\nIf you're like me, and just could not play through\nthe original, but loved Last Light, this is the game\nthat'll give you the chance of experiencing the original,\nin the style of Last Light.\n\n---SCORE---\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nAudio: 9.0/10\nGameplay: 9.0/10\nStory: 7.0/10\nValue: 8.5/10\n\nScore: 8.6/10","September 9, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So many times did this game give me chills, good scares, goosebumps, and even make me tear up from time to time that I couldn't even begin to recount them all. This is game that really changes your outlook on things if you understand all that is happening.\n\nPlay this game with Russian voiceovers and English subtitles for the full effect of a post apocalyptic Russian Metro, on the Ranger Easy or Hardcore difficultes, while wearing headphones, and playing in the dark. Find the notes hidden in the game to get entries in Artyom (the protagonists') diary to get his thoughts and extra background info on the universe of Metro and to fully understand the world at large here. Scavenge and scrounge through the dark subterranean tunnels and on the murky, nuclear winter grounds of the Surface, and cherish every bullet you find. You'll feel like a survivor in the apocalypse, you'll feel like a Ranger, and you'll also uncover a story filled with mystery and intrigue, with heartfelt and some pretty effective moral dillemas along the way. Some subtle things and decisions can mean the difference between destroying an enemy or annihilating a people who only wish to come in peace.\n\nThe only negatives I associate with this game are nitpicks, and even then it's only really one which is the sometimes incorrect grammar and spelling both in subtitles and notes. The only other complaint is that your decisions don't hold any weight in the sequel, but that's more of an issue with Last Light than anything. Overall this is an amazing game, and well deserving of a 10/10 from me.

Gunplay has been tightened up a bit and the visuals, particularly on the surface, are improved. However most of the issues that made 2033 significantly less enjoyable than Last Light are still present. The pacing is problematic, mostly due to the lack of enemy variety. Fighting the regular mutants isn't fun, especially in sections where they endlessly respawn (while ammo does not). Stealth areas are still overly linear and the enemy AI is just as buggy as in Last Light. A lack of ammo for the many shootouts against swarms of mutants make these already tedious moments needlessly difficult. A heavier redesign of this game might have made it worth playing again but as it stands the problems of the original are still here.\n\nThe atmosphere remains stellar and the game looks fantastic, but these qualities were already present in the base game. If you haven't played the Metro series this is the version to get, but if you already own 2033 on the PC, I wouldn't bother purchsing the redux.","January 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","22","41","0","2"

The game is incredibly atmospheric and the game does this so well that you literally feel like you are in the game's universe. Although I haven't finished the entire campaign yet, I can already say that the moments between firefights and new areas when you walk around in the Metro are perhaps the game's charm. You really lose yourself eavesdropping on other peoples conversations while it be in a market or a bar. The Redux edition greatly enhanced the game as the graphics and vibe of the game is truly astonishing.\nThere are a lot of tense moments in this game when you are fighting the beasts because ammo is scarce and most areas are dim and hard to see. The only game I can compare this experience to is with Dead Space. Metro can be a little eerie sometimes and the vibe is so dark that its a lot to take in. If you've never played a game like this before and you like FPS's and a good story, then try out Metro, you won't regret it.","December 14, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

THIS IS A MUST PLAY! The Creepy, immersive, haunting and unsettling atmosphere is what really makes Metro shine. You take control of Artyom, a young ranger that is given a quest to go through the horrors of the Moscow metro system to Polis to warn the people of a danger that could mean the extintion of the remaining human race.\nThe game does an amazing job at setting the tone, feel and atmosphere of nuclear post-apocalyptic Russia and fully immersing the player in it enviorments backed up with some of the best visuals to date, powered by the 4A engine. Metro 2033 is best played on hardcore ranger mode (hardest difficulty) in the dark with a good pair of headphones to get the full experience.\nHaving played the original Metro 2033, the Redux is a serious upgrade to enhance the Metro expeirence with a few minor hiccups which I hope with be fixed with updates and later installments. Metro 2033 Redux is the same game as the original but remade in Last Lights engine. Most notable changes are the controls and how you as the player take control of Artyom. The controls in the original were clunky and somewhat frustrating but now are fluid and responisive. Another notable change are the visuals which are a mix of highs and lows (mostly highs). The graphical videlity of the enviorments and character models are some of the best I have ever seen in a video game, though compared to the original, some enviroments look too clean to be in a post-apocalytic setting and can be a little distracting at times.\nMetro also does a great job of making the player feel vunerable not just from the mutant enemies and fascist regimes, but also from the enviroment itsef, almost making you feel handicapped at times. And also giving you some legitimate scares through out the game, or at the very least getting under your skin and creeping you out.\nThe Russian voice acting is some of the best and REALLY makes you feel that you are in post-apocalyptic Russia, how ever the english voice acting isn't nearly as good but still holds up to its own.\nA must play any kind of gamer, especially for those who likes horror, post-apocalyptic or first person shooters. 9.6/10\n","October 27, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm just gonna give some quick pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Great atmosphere. The Metro world is a very believable place full of life and it's crafted nicely.\n- Graphics. Yeah, graphics isn't everything, but it's a very pretty game if you got the computer for it. The lighting is great which stands out even more considering you spend the most of your time in dark tunnels.\n- Immersive. Few things brings you out of the experience - the flashlight needs to be charged and you use the compass to navigate in case you get lost.\n\nCons:\n- Voice acting. Sure, some of them are good, but far from everyone. I recommend testing the russian voices for better voice performance and even more immersion.\n- Protagonist. Artyom is not a likable guy. He has zero personality. Maybe it's because he talks during missions in a monlouge but he never speak to other characters. It makes little to no sense.\n- Story. The story is limping and it's a bit hard to care about what happens. The overall threat just isn't there.","September 21, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The original Metro 2033 suffered from a broken stealth system where if you were spotted by a single enemy, the whole level would know where to find you and come to attack. It made the game frustrating to play and more difficult than it needed to be. The sequel, Last Light, fixed the stealth at the nehest at making it a lot easier to beat but in my opinion infinitely more fun to play. Metro 2033 Redux takes the original game and slaps it into the Last Light engine with massively imporved art direction and the fun stealth mechanics. It may be my imagination but the rquirements for the alternate ending seem to have been relaxed too.

While the original 2033 was great, this remake fixes nearly all of the problems it had, making it just as good as Last Light, and keeping each game with a unique experience - they are not just carbon copies of each other. The game allows you to play "spartan mode" - in the more stealth shooter style of Last Light, or "survival mode" - in the more survival horror style of the 2033. The game looks absolutely beautiful as expected, though you will need a somewhat higher end system to see this game at its full potential.

However just a plain sight of your surrondings (dead explorers, skeletons, lots of blood, monster coprses, spiders, ghost, mutants, demons, nazis, soviets etc.)  and the fact that the story might become a possible future reality (not sure about the monsters of course) made it a prettyary game.\n\nThe game has 2 possible ways to play, first is survivor, the second is spartan. In survivor mode you depend on stealth and troughout exploration for ammo and other supplies because there aren't too many. The spartan modes provides a lot of ammo and a more classical FPS-shooter experience. Besides that there are 4 difficulty levels (normal, hardcore, ranger, ranger hardcore), so everyone should find a suitable one. I recommend ranger mode, because it gives a new, even more horrifying experience (no HUD, no hints, more damage for both sides, even less ammo), but only on second playthrough. As far as shooters go, you can choose from a wide vareity of weapons, and and all of them can be customized somehow (no visual upgrades only in effectiveness). You can carry 3 of them at the same time so you can be prepared for every occasion. Also you can have 3 types of grenades, throwing knives and a classical melee one.\nFor the assault rifles you can choose from 2 types of weapons, standard and military grade. However the latter should be used very mindfully, because it also serves as money, you can buy new weapons, upgrades from it, but also could save you in difficult situations.\n\nThe AI is not the best. The human enemies sometimes forget to get in cover, have trouble seeing you upclose when youre in the dark, and don't try to flank you which makes your job easier. The monsters very often will  treat you like the chosen one, and they only try to attack you even when you're a part of a big group, which caused me a lot of deaths, and also my teammates wasn't so eager to defend me.\n\nThe sound and the music fits well into the atmosphere, however the voiceacting is terrible. The characters have a frustrating, unnatural, farfetched russian accent in the english version which kinda murders the whole setup. Fortunately the game comes with a russian voiceover, which made the game more realistic, and a lot better. Although the russian voiceacting (with english subtitles!!) doesn't sound very good either. I don't speak russian, but still i had a much better experience like that.\n\nArtyom, the hero.\nWell unfortunately they made Artyom a silent hero, he never speaks in game, you can only hear his thoughts at loading screens, or read them via collectibles. This silence makes a lot of cutscene stupid, and unenjoyable. In my opinon the developers could've make  him a talkin character, because,they had every information about him from  the books, he had a fix personality. At least they put 51 collectable diary pages in the game (this is new in Redux version) which shines more light about Artyom and story. The story is great in general, but if you haven't read the book, you might not understand everything. That, the poster and the book copies in the game suggets you to buy it. This is a little forced advertisment, but it's only natural in a book based game, and well both of the books are great, so i suggest you to do the same.\n\nThe game is fairly long, and can be played over and over again, since it provides the mentioned two game modes, has a lot of achivements, and in the Redux version they made some more new areas that could be explored and some safes that could be opened if you find the proper keys, and of course the diary pages, they all worth to collect and read.\n\nIt's important to note that the game is not a sandbox, it leads you through in a big tunnel, but the great atmosphere, the events, and the action makes you almost forget that. However, i think they should've made the visitable stations bigger and  more exploreable, because they feel packed and unlife-like (given the current situation).\n\nThe graphics became great, and more creepy than before, the developers seems to fixed all the game breaking and frustrating bugs. Most of the achievements are easy to complete based on killing different types and number of enemies with different guns or methods, but there are some challenging ones also, even mission based. They can be completed to 100% in 2 playthroughs and some additional chapter selectin, but to achieve that you have to be extremly mindful for everything becasue of the "Enlightned" achievement, which is based on finding and triggering every flashbacks of Artyom's past, and additionaly making generous decisions all game long.\n\nAll in all it's a great game and recommended for everyone who is intrested in some horror based fps action with great story. Still enjoyable for those who haven't read the books.  The redux version also provides a lot of new experience for players who only played the original game.","February 21","true","34.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the case of Metro 2033, it's on the Metro underground, Russia's underground train system.\n\nThe story pulls all the character that appear with legit reason, and not because of a half-♥♥♥♥♥ or vague story that we must search behind the scene of the game.\nI've never read the Metro 2033 novel, but I think this adaptation game is worthy on it's own in the Metro franchise.\nThe story open nicely  in medias res , well not technically in the middle of action, because the intro is a part of the ending mission/story. Later on, the protagonist played out the first introduction of their home, then it's attacked by mutant which is unknown to attack human settlement. The protagonist are told that something or somebody made the mutant act weird, and must find help in other Metro settlement if the protagonist don't want his home to run over by mutant. Along the way, the protag will meet other people that'll help his journey and find out that his early objective might bring the wrong result.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a generic shooter. You pick weapon, load the ammo, and shoot at the enemy. What makes it unique is as the game is set in the apocalyptic world, ammo is scarce. There are 2 type of bullet, the pre-war ammo grade which is used by the Metro populace as currency, deals more damage but scarcer to look. And the Metro built in ammo, which can be acquired easily but deals lower damage. Although it's only for weapon that shoot military ammo, some weapon use other type of ammo, such as bow and bolt arrow, steel ball bearing launched with pneumatic weapon, shotgun shell, and the ancient flamethrower.\nThe game feature a gameplay without HUD, meaning player must derive their avatar condition by seeing their equipment. A cracked gas mask needs replacement, gas filter that must be used when in radiated area can deplete and when 1 filter time's is up, the player breathing will be harder. The player can also 'look up' their gun to see how much bullet is left, visually.\n\nThe story can end up in 2 way, which is differentiated by how the player act during their journey. A karma system exist where if they help the people, being generous or avoid killing (the game gave more way than one in completing certain level) will give good moral point, whereas stealing, ignoring plea and outright slaughtering everyone will generate bad moral point. This leads to the good or bad ending in the end of the story.\n\nAll in all, Metro 2033 is a solid experience set in apocalyptic world where the remain of human population must fight for survival, both the mutated creature and human themselves pose the same threat. It gives off the right feeling when the world are truly ravaged by nuclear war, the underground Metro is dark and supressing while the surface is a beautiful winter coated in radiaton fallout.","November 28, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally really love the storyline that it comes with. The game looks outright stunning  on a reasonably powerful computer and is optimized very well regardless of the nvidia or amd gpus. I played a bit of the original metro and that was nice but this smashes the ball way out of the park in terms of quality. Some people say that it is too linear which i think is a lie because there are a number of places  that you can easily get lost in within this game. The russian side of the story is very nice also and adds a bit of spice to the normal voice actors that you would hear in a game. I like to think that this is the russian side of fallout. Its extremely enjoyable.","October 28, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All you have to do is look at Last Light and look unto this. For all intensive purposes they are now one in the same when it comes to the excellent mechanics and visuals, sparing the difference in story and the more linear design of 2033.\n\nGameplay\nUsually games stem tedium by dousing reality with a lack of recoil and plentiful boxes of ammunition everywhere. Yet, the developers of this game invented a sort of realism that doesn't burden the player but is very relevant to their function. As over time, you'll have to recharge the battery of your flashlight or NVGs you find some way along into the game.\n\nOn you at a bare minimum is a journal and a lighter, minimizing the use of immersion breaking UI popping-up. Plus, who wouldn't want to set a bunch of those pesky mutant spider webs on fire with a handy lighter; no, you don't have to go hunting for whale oil to fuel it. Stealth is usually easy so you may find that a tad disappointing in contrast to the challenging combat, assuming you're playing on ranger mode--as you should be!\n\nVisuals\nThis remastered version of 2033 lacks nothing in the visual department. It truly looks as awe-inspiring as Last Light. You'd be hard pressed to find a game out now that looks better than either of these beauties.\n\nStory\nAs an introductory game to a series, it provides more player-centric interest than its sequel which shoves you deep through both Nazi and Communist territory. Personally, I preferred the narrow scope of the story and its supernatural elements along with the presentation of beasts like Librarians or the aptly named Demons.\n\nWhen it comes to the emotional moments, they're well and sparingly placed something but I'll not spoil anything here. You can also play the morality system, by not killing everyone in sight and of course in being merciful when perhaps coming accross a nest of some sort. This includes people you fight and have to get past, not just static 'kill or let live' parts of the story. Those mean very little, in the grand scheme of what you'll run into and do.\n\nAudio\nAs an introductory game to a series, it provides more player-centric interest than its sequel which shoves you deep through both Nazi and Communist territory.

It may sound belittling, though quite the contrary, I almost think of it as a very elongated and enjoyable concept more than just another game. Between the minor things mentioned: recharging lights, changing the filters on your gas mask, and even just wiping-off whatever's gotten splattered on your gas mask. Along with environments unrivaled along with how tense combat is and the supernatural element involved in a variety of ways. It all accumulates to something I can call nothing less than an experience. Easily, this is my favorite shooter and its the only series I consider genuinely worth playing on the hardest difficulty: Ranger Mode.","December 12, 2014","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So to me, this was Metro 2033: Revisited. That having been said, several new weapons that are fun enough to use were added in, exploration and rewarding exploration is more of a focal point and it brought some other quality of life changes from Last Light. Also the other minute aspects of the game are less obtuse as they were in it's predecessor (the gas mask filters, the dynamo for your flashlight and goggles).\n\nThe only major complaint I have is I don't like the checkpoint system. In a FPS like this, I would much rather they have gone with a simple quicksave and quickload system.\n\nI enjoyed it well enough, but it isn't very detached or radically different than the original.

Metro 2033 is about a man named Artyom and his struggle to survive in the Russian underground, 20 years after a nuclear holocaust that made the Earth's surface unbelievably toxic. Armed with your trusty Revolver (and hopefully some other gun), you are sent deep into enemy territory to try and piece together what remains of humanity, and to rid the world of the mutant invaders that now stand upon it. You're not just fighting mutants, however- you also fight the Nazi Fourth Reich (did someone say Wolfenstein?), as well as bandits. The Redux version HUGELY optimizes the game, and makes it playable for people with *most* GPUs. Also improved is the gunplay, as well as the graphics and the weapon system. Speaking of weapons, the guns provided in this game are very cool, from guns that are literally made out of recycled parts, like the Bigun and the Blyat, to modern and future military tech, such as the AK-2012 and the Azbetz. For maximum enjoyment, I would play the game on Survival mode on Ranger Hardcore difficulty, in order to fully experience the *survival* aspect of the game (and the horror aspect of the game, obviously).","January 23, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Metro 2033 redux follows the story of humanity's survival, in 2033 through the eyes of an overnight turned hero, but brilliant individual Artyom. After his home station is attacked by "dark ones", mutants unknown and misunderstood by the remnants of humanity, he sets out on a quest to save his station from the coming doom, initially told to do so after an elite Spetsnaz remnant named "The Rangers", one of whom, the best of the order Hunter sets out to fight this threat does not return, Artyom is abruptly spruced into action. An overwhelmingly graphic, tinge and cringe worthy and at times I, a man of the military discipline cried. It touched my very soul and what it means to be human, why we exist the way we do, and why we are our own worst enemy, not the mutants, not the world, not our weapons, but OURSELVES, we destroyed everything we built, in the name of greed, righteousness and the victor. Amazingly done levels, with action sequences, spooky lone adventures and the ultimate feeling of success, however not in the light you always see it so.\n\n9.5/10\n\nRedux edition adds Last Light mechanics\nAdditional graphics options that are optimized for PC\nAdditional playthrough modes, Spartan, Ranger and Survival etc\nTuned and additional weapons and game trinkets such as safe lockboxes and caches.\n\nWould buy for full cost, and even more so on discount sales.

Otherwise, the gameplay differences were so subtle that other than reading guides that outlined them, I wouldn't have been able to notice.\n\nThe graphics overhaul is great, however, and if you haven't played the game and enjoy slower paced shooters with lots of sneaking around and harsh ammo conservation, you must play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/recommended/286690/","fathottopicdiva","bobert awful (F+)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/","690 products in account","Metro 2033 is one of these wonderful creepy shoddy video games from Eastern Europe. It captures some of the ghost town existentialism that STALKER made popular, but it had quite a few problems. The stealth system, for example, was crap on toast. It didn't run very well. The way the game felt and moved had a few problems, it felt a bit like running a lap underwater. Despite all this, it had ambience and character and terror crawling out of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pore of its being!\n\nSo I'm happy to say Metro 2033 Redux is mostly an improvement. Well, mostly.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to lodge a complaint: The development team ignored processing instructions for older AMD and Intel CPUs, and I would like to say that is not cool at all. I've had a AMD Phenom II quad-core processor for some time now, and while it isn't the amazing powerhouse that is whatever's at the top of Tom's Hardware's CPU charts, it can still kick ♥♥♥ and take names. Developing for the PC to work with a wide, wide range of specs and hardware configurations is a pain in the ♥♥♥, but that's still no excuse for leaving older PCs out in the cold like that!!! Thankfully, those instructions were patched in and I finally got to play the game two days later after launch.\n\nSecond complaint: I had to replace one of the intro movies in the game directory with a blank file because it was crashing my game when I was actually able to get it running. I had to do this to a game released in 2014 to get it to run.\n\nAfter those two I finally got to play it. It looked very good. It feels very nice to play - character reponses are fluid and there isn't a bunch of slowdown I experienced from the last game. FOV's stuck at something below 90, so take what you will from that.\n\nIt implements a lot of the improvements made by the sequel to this game (Metro: Last Light) and implements them into this game, which means stealth works and I was able to run it at nearly max settings! A new feature allows you to play it as a survival horror kind of shooter (the proper Metro 2033 experience) or as a straight-up on rails shooter (the equivalent of having chocolate-flavored vodka instead of drinking it straight up LIKE A REAL METRO DWELLER DOES), so there's that.\n\nIf you're playing this for the first time, don't skimp and get the original Metro 2033. The Redux version is a far more refined experience. You could argue that going for the remake loses some of the original shoddiness, and in that case, do whatever you like. But if you're dipping your toe into this strange flavor of Eastern Europe first person shooters for the first time, get the Redux.","September 3, 2014","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillpill1/recommended/286690/","chillpill1","Chill Pill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillpill1/","338 products in account","This review is for the Redux version, but it basically applies to regular Metro: 2033 as well.\n\nThe Game: Metro 2033 Redux, which is the precise game this is for, is like the original with all the DLC thrown in, plus some features from Metro: Last Light (like wiping the ♥♥♥♥♥ off your mask). All in all it is an excellent game and I've grown fond of it - probably because it's similar (sort-of) to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, and indeed some of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S. dev's did join 4A when making it. The game is NOT a free-roam game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was, it is linear - but it does allow some off-route exploration and such, like finding safes to open, which in turn require finding the key to that safe, which usually have money (military-grade bullets) in them. Ammo is semi-limited, less so if you just go out and kill everone. If you decide to take a Stealth route - there is less ammo, but you also shoot less people thus, it's not a big issue really.\n\nThe monsters in this game are what kinda ♥♥♥♥ me off. It's not that I hate them, of course I do but not because they're in the game, but because sometimes you have zero ammo and ♥♥♥♥ is still coming for you! I've never been able to take the stealth-route around the monsters, which is why I kill everyone for their ammo - of course maybe I'm playing wrong when I try to sneak around monsters? I don't know.\n\nAnyways, as the title implies, most of the game takes place in the Russian Metro tunnels, however you do go to the surface sometimes. The game does take place after a nuclear-apocalypse so people living in Metro tunnels does make sense, of course. I probably should of mentioned this first - but I write my reviews as I go, so meh.\n\nSome of the other cool features I DO like about this game are things such as your Gas Mask, you need it in some areas because they're irradiated. Your watch tells the actual time that your PC is set to, except when wearing these Gas Masks, in which case it counts down until you need to switch mask filters, which I found pretty cool. Filters, at least when I played - which was NOT in any hardcore mode, were plentiful, however that may only be different when playing in Ranger or Hardcore modes. Other than that you shoot stuff, blows stuff up, and all-in-all try to help one faction while fighting others plus the monsters/mutants or whatever they may be.\n\nThe difference between the Redux versions and the regular versions of Metro, is that they run on a new higher-end, fancier-looking game engine. In addition they have some extra in-game features as well as all the DLC and such standard. If you own both regular Metro games, the Redux Version is something like 50% off the regular price.\n\nWould I recommend buying the Metro Redux games if you already own the originals? Well if you want prettier graphics, all the DLC, and extra in-game features (like Metro 2033 shares features from Last Light and such) then, yes I would. If you could care less because they're essentially the same game and you still don't wanna spend $25 or $20 bucks, then no I wouldn't. However I do recommend them in-general regardless.\n\nScore: An awesome game, now made more pretty - 4/5\n\n\n\n[Edits made to fix grammatical errors.]","January 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Armed with your trusty Revolver (and hopefully some other gun), you are sent deep into enemy territory to try and piece together what remains of humanity, and to rid the world of the mutant invaders that now stand upon it. You're not just fighting mutants, however- you also fight the Nazi Fourth Reich (did someone say Wolfenstein?), as well as bandits. The Redux version HUGELY optimizes the game, and makes it playable for people with *most* GPUs. Also improved is the gunplay, as well as the graphics and the weapon system. Speaking of weapons, the guns provided in this game are very cool, from guns that are literally made out of recycled parts, like the Bigun and the Blyat, to modern and future military tech, such as the AK-2012 and the Azbetz. For maximum enjoyment, I would play the game on Survival mode on Ranger Hardcore difficulty, in order to fully experience the *survival* aspect of the game (and the horror aspect of the game, obviously).","January 23, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

A good single player experience to get lost in for a little while, if you can find it for $10-$15 I would say jump on it. I got it on sale bundled with Last Light for like $7 a piece.\n\nIts gun play isn't bad compared to even more modern games. But we are getting to be a bit spoiled there.\nThe graphics are pretty good, it runs decent enough, but prolly not for low-end rigs.\n\nThe story is pretty good. The weapons are decent enough, though I feel could have had a better selection. The enemies are kinda cool, the monsters are alright.\n\nThe thing that really shines in this game is the atmosphere. The use of setting, music, mood. They did a good job in that department. I really liked traversing in this game. It doesn't hold your hand to tell you where to go all the time, and there is a decent amount of hidden goodies all over the place.  I find it refreshing that it doesn't have some neon blinking arrow pointing at the objective or where you need to go all the time. (or some alternative of that most games now-a-days have in abundance)\n\nThere isn't a ton of repetition in level design, but you can see it every now and then. I think there are moral moments in the game that you choose to do something, or not, but I am not sure what it really effects. Unless the game has multiple endings. Which I am not sure if it does.\n\nThe music is pretty good to. I have had my girlfriend, and my best friend both tell me that they like hearing the music coming out of my room when I play this game. The game does some things just right. Kinda like "Singularity" did. It isn't the best, but its atleast worth giving a shot.\n\nI played it on hard difficulty, and that is what I would recommend as well. It's pretty challenging, but not ridiculous. Ammo can become scarce if you don't search for it, and conserve. I was running into Air issues for my gasmask (I like to explore) but I made it through the game relatively well considering.\n\nOne thing that I think this game could use that it had no shred of is boss fights. A game like this could have 3, maybe 4 mini bosses, and 1 final boss. No such thing in this game.\n\nI would recommend having some what of a decent rig if you decide to play it. The length isn't all that long, but it isn't all that short either, its a decent middle length, it could of went longer if it included the boss fights that I mentioned above.\n\nI will be playing the second game Last Light. I hear it was good too.\n\nSome complaints on the game is It is sometimes hard to make out what the other characters in the game are saying. Mainly when you, and they are wearing gas masks, plus the accents. Which I have to point out that you can clearly hear that the accents for some of the people in the game were horrible to the point of being kinda funny. Namely the Nazi/germans. That was funny.\nAnother complaint is the nightvision goggles in the game aren't calibrated enough, most of the dark places have a few lights in them that make the NVGs almost useless. (they could have adjusted the filters better on it so it doesn't flare as bad constantly) The Night Vision Scope (IR scope as they call it) doesn't suffer from this issue.\nIt also crashes kinda easily. There a few areas where picking up a set of Air tanks for gas masks, and medipack off of a table in the later half of the game crashed the game for me every time I tried it.","May 14, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's one of my favorite FPS stories ever. If you've played the original and loved it, you owe it to yourself to play the Redux version. If you haven't played the original, what the hell is wrong with you? Go play it...now...I'll wait on you..........see, wasn't that worth it?\n\nIf you love FPS games with a story, this game is for you. It has a nice mix between action/horror/stealth and you can play many levels in various ways to better fit your play style. Wanna run and gun? You can. Wanna sneak your way through? You can do that in some levels too. Wanna streak through naked? Well, no, you can't do that, but seriously, the ability to play through several levels however you want is a welcome change, even if you can't stealth your way through the entire game (that or my stealthiness sucks).\n\nPros\nGreat graphics (improved on the already beautiful original).\nGreat gameplay (again improved).\nGreat story.\nThe ability to upgrade weapons.\nSome voices seem to have been redone...most are improvements, some...not so much.\nThe ability to knock out guards.\nThe dedicated melee button instead of having to select your knife, which was tedious in the middle of a fight.\nDid I mention they made an already gorgeous game even more so?\nA shining example of how you do a remake.\nCons\nA few of the voices I've noticed have been redone...specifically, the voices of children seem...umm, not so childlike compared to the original.\nA few bugs I ran into that required several reloads. All were crashes to desktop and all were eventually playable without anything more than restarting several times.\nManning the turrets with a controller during the on-rails section is a bit convoluted. Instead of using one stick to aim, you must use one stick to aim left/right, the other stick aims up/down. It felt nowhere near intuitive to me and should've been mapped to one stick.\nHaving to sit through the opening legal screens each time you start a game.\nSeriously, WTF?\nHow come once I break stealth, I can't hide again very easy? Seems that once I'm spotted, I have a large neon "shoot me" sign flashing over my head.\nNot to beat a dead horse, but seriously, what kind of hormone treatment do the kids get? They sound like they're on some HGH or such.\nWhere the hell does Artyom put that guidance system? I mean, obviously his pockets are full since you have limited ammo you can carry...so I'm scared to know the answer to how this thing is carried about...","September 27, 2014","true","35.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/w0bbl3r/recommended/286690/","w0bbl3r","wobbler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/w0bbl3r/","862 products in account","So I have to say that the release of this was a mess. Missing lighting that arrived in a patch on day 1, 1.7GB or so in size, that added terrible over-done lens flare that makes every light source look like a small sun in some places.\nI couldn't even run the game for the first day, because it just returned to desktop after the intro movie. A LOT of people had this issue.\nIt was fixed quickly, but it's still not acceptable.\nHowever saying all this, it IS metro. The new difficulty mode, survival, works great alongside ranger hardcore to make a real challenging game. Even though I already knew the game inside out, I have died a few times already, and failed stealth at least twice before I am even halfway through.\nI expected it to be last light levels of difficulty. Which is to say, NO difficulty even on ranger hardcore.\nThis isn't the case. It is still a good challenge.\nThe only problem brought forth by the last light mechanics integration is that you never come close to running out of ammo or filters, which is a shame since metro is supposed to be about resource management, and scavenging for every bullet and every second of filter time should matter to you. Missed opportunity there, I think.\nThey have however added some nice new areas for people to find. I have found about 3 or 4 of them, and a couple of them are very memorable, such as a watchmen mother protecting her babies in a nest.\nAt the end of the day, this IS metro 2033. It's changed in some subtle ways, but it is still the greatest game ever made in my opinion.\nI still prefer the original. It felt darker and more dangerous to me, even after multiple playthroughs I am on edge in certain levels.\nThis has more of that tension than I expected though, enough new stuff to keep it feeling fresh.\nI have to mark it down for the lack of effort put in on the graphics, because in some ways the original looks a lot better, such as floor textures in many areas here are very low res, and some items on table tops, like papers and such, just look like part of the table texture.\nI also have to mark it down for the poor execution on release. Terrible way to release a game. Maybe it should have been kept back a couple of weeks or so, and then it would have been the game that the franchise and its fans deserve.\nBut all in all I love it. I can't deny that at all.\nIt's still easier than the original, but it's much more challenging than last light was, and when I finish this and move on to the last light redux I hope to find that the survival difficulty setting in that makes it a better game. Because with better difficulty and challenge, last light would have been the better game of the two.\nIf you are thinking of buyin this, or both of the redux versions, I would hold off if you already own them. Wait for a sale. I got them for around £8 for both. That was half price on top of the 50% pre-order discount for owners of the originals. So they should have cost me £16, I got them for half that, which was a great price.\nIf you can get both for around £15, then that's not too bad. If you can get both for £10, that's excellent value for such great gaming.\nIf you don't own the originals, I still recommend metro 2033 original release, as it is still a better game, but not by too much. Since you can get it for like £3 now, I would get that, and maybe get the redux later if you feel you enjoyed the original enough.\nLast light is a better value buy for people who don't own the original though. For the extra difficulty, and the fact that it contains all DLC (which was underwhelming and overpriced for the most part), getting that for around £15 is very good value if you don't already have it.\nI have to give this a thumbs up in the end, purely because they spruced it up some, changed it enough for people who already played it, and kept the challenge (mostly) of the original. It's metro, so it has to be thumbs up, regardless.\nBut thumbs down for the full price, it's just not worth that when you can get the original for £3.\nBut judging the game itself, thumbs up all the way.","August 31, 2014","true","15.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Mutant creatures have overtaken the surface while humans are forced to live in underground tunnels like rats. The outside is so contaminated with toxic materials and radiation that you have to wear a gasmask (permanently) and periodically change its filter so you don't die asphyxiated.\n\nThe survival factor is quite present: ammo is scarce, and you have to scavenge every single corpse you find if you want to stand a chance against the cold, heartless and brutal environment. Metro 2033 also shows the true side of human nature: even after the apocalypse, you've still got bandits, commies and nazis grouping up and trying to kill each other. It's truly the survival of the fittest.\n\nYou'll stumble upon some nice game mechanics like the dynamic use of lighting to your advantage. Depending on the situation you'll either use the lamp in your helmet or NVG - lights are destructible as well, so if you're afraid of giant lamps giving away your location, you can shoot them from long-range to make stealthing easier. Weapons are customizable, but said customization has a clear limit, so don't get too carried away.\n\nWeapons are varied but their use is very restricted, which annoys me. Basic weapons like the revolver, SMG, AK and shotgun are usable pretty quickly, but special ones like the pneumatic rifle, the railgun and many more are only usable until you reach a certain point in the game (hint: after you complete more than half of the story).\n\nAs you can see, my complaints are mostly about small stuff; the game is VERY enjoyable (if you like tense, spooky atmospheres), and even though it's pretty short, there's some replayability in it, especially if you're an achievement hunter.\n\nNoteworthyMake sure to read the PC Gaming Wiki article for this game to know how to skip the startup sequence and increase the FOV, among other things. You shouldn't have to, but at least you can fix it.","October 17, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghanburighan/recommended/286690/","Ghanburighan","Ghanburighan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghanburighan/","80 products in account","This is a gorgeous game but the game mechanics have not been thought through, making the experience dissatisfying.\n\nFirst a disclaimer, I don't think this is a terrible game, and many people might enjoy it for the atmosphere and action but I played it in "survival mode", which is supposed to be one strand of the game, and it just does not work. I come from playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat (more specifically, the Misery mod), which heavily focuses on survival, and grueling gameplay, and I judged Metro based on its self-declared survival mode, comparing it in my mind to Misery.\n\nSome good aspects, the game looks beautiful, and the atmosphere is generally believable and unique. Unfortunately, the game doesn't feel like you're in Moscow metro, just a generic metro, but the way the monsters work, the lights (or lack thereof) and characters all feel alive and interesting. The game is also dark and brooding in a way that increases immersion in this post-apocalytic world.\n\nWhen we get to the gameplay, there's one primary keyword: "linear". Unlike most survival games, this is a linear FPS. You're almost always on rails, going from one room to another in a  predestined manner, and you must fight or avoid the enemies that spawn according to the script of the game.\n\nI played hardcore ranger (which is supposed to limit your ammo and supplies, and make all characters die easier) and found that the some of the game design makes it not so much challenging but silly. Let's list them.\n\nYou can carry only 2 guns, but ammo is gun-specific and it's capped (if you have 54 shells, you can't pick up the 55th). So you can only pick up ammo when you have used up some of it, and cannot prepare for grueling fights in the future. There are "hidden" supply stashes along the way, so you can get some ammo. But what this amounts to is that you are forced to look for every stash to get the ammo for your 2 specific guns if you've used them at all. For a new player, this means that any engagement is something you should try to avoid, as you don't know all the stashes, or you're forced to have a wiki open all the time so you have some ammo to use for your guns (you might have hundreds of rounds for your other weapons, but as there's almost no way change weapons. Sure they might drop, but most levels seem to drop a type of weapon, so you can't switch to one that you have ammo for).\n\nYou also cannot avoid most fights because the game is scripted to force enemy waves down your throat if you go to specific locations. This leads to you triggering an enemy attack (usually by stepping somewhere, or touching something) and then you running around like mad because you don't have a single bullet that goes into your gun. (the one shot kills everything throwing knives are an OK solution, though, as you can pick them up again).\n\nAs monsters don't give you any loot, you'd be wasting valuable ammo. So this leads to you having to look for exploits. Fortuntely there are many. Generally there are places where you can stand where the enemy just ignores you on their scripted path. Here's a few.\n\nAt the end of the dead city level, you can stand in front of the truck and have enemies literally run through you to fight your ally. The ones that come from different directions also generally ignore you, so you can shotgun them down at your own leisure while the enemies claw the apparently invulnerable ally.\n\nWhen defending Cursed station, you can go behind a nook on the right and stand there whle the allies gun everything down. Then go forward or the train tracks and have enemies walk straight past you (stealth, honest) and then stand behind the rubble by the stairs waiting for a wave to run right past you.\n\nWhen an exploit isn't available, you can generally run around in circles as the enemies (at least melee ones) don't seem to be able to hit you like this. If you do get hit by accident, just stab yourself with the seemingly abundant medical supplies and keep running until your allies finish the enemies.\n\nDoes that sound like fun? I don't think so.\n\nThe problem is that a survival game requires a few features: choice from the player, an economy, and autonomous enemies.\n\nIf you don't have choice as to where you go, when, and who you fight there, your only choice is to max stashes and fight as few enemies as possible. You also cannot really prepare for your journey besides stocking up on certain bullets (in exchange for others) or switching a weapon before you get there (on your first playthrough, this is especially frustrating as there seems to a correct weapon type for most levels, but you don't know this in beforehand). In most survival games, you can choose to do something different if your equipment isn't adequate.\n\nIf there's no economy, you cannot farm for supplies if you're out. So if you run out of bullets, you're screwed unless you find an exploit. With the checkpoint system, this becomes especially silly because you cannot go back to a point where you hadn't yet screwed yourself.\n\nIf the enemies are fully scrpted, there's no real point in stealth. Every single time you open a specific door, you will be attacked. So why bother learning about enemies or their behaviour. Just learn the script triggers by heart.\n\nAnother issue that requires attention is the terrible checkpoint system. As mentioned above, there are no saves in the game. You cannot choose yourself when you save, nor go back to any save besides the last checkpoint. But the placement of these checkpoints are terrible. The worst one I encountered was by the frontlines. There's a checkpoint after killing a few reds by the prisoner. After that I had to kill the rest of the red base (10+ enemies), go down stairs into a gassed area for supplies, do some jumping puzzles, avoid traps, sneak into the reich base and face all the enemies there. Does that feel sensible? If you get hit by a  stray bullet at the end of the reich base, you have to do all of that again. All of that. There's no way anyone has the patience to do that.\n\nNow, if the game told you about the save system, you could avoid going to that checkpoint  before you kill the reds and do the stash at the end of stairs, but there's no indication, and it's quite natural to check that point for enemies before proceeding higher. And even if you get the optimal checkpoint timing, you still have the darn pipes and traps before you get to the reich base. Why is that? It's like the checkpoints were placed as an afterthought and they missed some.\n\nA few words on stealth, there are two kinds of stealth here: the kind that feels like an exploit that you use against monsters and the kind which you're actively encouraged to not use. Monsters sometimes walk straight past you, and as you don't want to fight them, you're highly encouraged to do find these spots. But you can't really predict where this is as the monsters don't have a rational movement patterns, instead they walk along a scripted string.\n\nThe other kind is when facing human enemies. Gun fights versus humans are the best part of this game, the guns work great, the enemies have some dodges and aren't absolutely terrible shots either, making those fights challenging and fun. On top of that, human enemies always drop ammo and other goodies, making these fights a net win if you're any good with your gun. So why would you ever want to stealth your way throught those sections? Killing every single human is definitely optimal. Just watch out, though, sometimes enemies are scripted not to be killable by knives, so the weapon clips straight through them. Better just shoot them.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a survival game, don't buy this game. It just doesn't work. It's frustrating and silly. If I could, I'd replay the human vs human gun fights, though, as these were a lot of fun. But unfortunately you cannot load checkpoints, so you have to play through hours of silliness to get to them.","November 30, 2015","false","6.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I've finished Metro 2033: Redux. All I can say is the experience was a great, if not slightly bumpy one. I'll start with what this game does right.\nWonderful, immersive atomosphere. While the game can be classified as 'horror', it's different than any horror game I've played. Sure there are a few jump scares. But the oppressive world is far more terrifying than the lumbering librarian or any of the other mutants. Being on the surface while the time on your filter ticks away, literally counting down until you eventually choke on the noxious air, or seeing that your in a tunnel surrounded by mutant spiders that are only sensitive to light - then realizing that your battery is almost dead, or knowing that a pack of ravenous wolf like creatures are about to swarm and you're low on ammo, is a far more engaging and terrifying experience. You have to learn to conserve here, especially on the higher difficulties.\nGreat story, with lots of moral ambiguity and some still unresolved questions that will tie into the sequel, Metro: Last Light. I normally don't play FPS games, but this has one of the best story arcs (that directly continues in the sequel), that I've played.\nStealth system is great. I know that it was drastically changed in the redux version of this game to be more like Last Light, and while I haven't played the original non-redux version of 2033, I think the majority will think the change was necessary. A lot of changes have been made in the redux version, from graphic improvements to optimization and stealth changes.\nPersonally, I like the weapon system. There aren't a huge number of guns but you can fit one to your play style.\nDefinitely has high replayabilty, so don't be too mad if you finish the game in 13 hours or less like I did. You can choose between stealthy approaches (necessary on higher difficulties) and the all-out gunning everyone down approach. Or you can choose not to kill anyone at all during the whole game. Your choices (in and out of combat) affect which of the two endings you receive. My first playthrough I played on normal, but I am looking forward to try the higher difficulties next time around. They offer a greater challenge with scarcer resources.\nNow, time to be a negative nancy.\nLittered with bugs. I've had framerate issues, some CTDs, and an instance in the Depot level (known infamously as the sky bug) which rendered that level unplayable and had to download someone else's save file to progress. That meant loosing all my gear and receiving someone else's. I may have had worse issues if I had not fixed a CTD problem in Last Light. I'd recommend deleting the intro video ogv files and replacing them file a blank text file (legal.ogv). I also disabled advanced physx and forced my cpu to run physx instead of my nvidia gpu. Most of the bugs you encounter will have a solution on the web, just it may be an aggravating and time consuming journey to fix them. Make sure you're computer can handle the game before you buy.\nSome poor level design. The Trolley Combat level being the worst. Controls feel very sticky and that's a bad thing in a rail shooter section where you can die extremely quickly. It must've taken me 7 tries to get through it.\nVery linear. Besides the choices that add to replayablity that I mentioned previously, the levels themselves often feel like being pushed down a corridor with little to no exploration. Opening a box in an adjacent room does not count as detailed exploration. Personally, I think the game really would have benefitted from larger maps, not even necessarily a whole open world. Also, some crafting would have been nice.\nCharacters aren't that meaningful, at least in my opinion besides Khan maybe and Artyom. I think this is probably because I didn't read the Metro 2033 book that inspired the game series.\nWhy does Artyom only speak in the loading screens and not the rest of the game??? It's kind of awkward.\n\nOverall, despite the game's flaws (the bugs being the worst), it's a unique experience that I highly recommend. This Redux version has made significant improvements to the original and when played back to back with the sequel, the game offers a cohesive narrative with satisfying combat and stealth. Prepare for some frustrations, but also prepare for a lot of fun in the Metro.","January 14, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will run out of ammo quick trying to kill the most basic of enemies. I actually enjoyed fighting the human enemies more in this game. My other complaint would be the lack of hints or clues or some sort of instruction as what to do or where to go next. Some replays will be necessary to get to the next goal as you may die the first 5 times you attempt to do so.\n\nHowever if you like the feel of a Resident Evil survival type game mixed with a STALKER type atmosphere, you should give this game a try.","December 27, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/recommended/286690/","fubarhouse","FubarHouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/","189 products in account","The Metro games are an incredible addition to an overpopulated and excessively popular genre in which the series nails all odds of the genre's cliches. The Metro franchise initiates in a post-apocolyptic Russia - more specifically Moscow. After being given his first mission to leave his station, young Artyum must face the odds of survival and travel to Polis to meet up with Colonel Miller to seek help for his cause. This involves meeting stranded individuals fighting for their own survival, and passing through stations of which are doomed due to the lack of resources or positioning of their base.\n\nThe metro series is based off the active book series, and it really is one of the most immersive first person shooters of this time. I may have a fondness of the genre, but I have watched as this beloved genre has been butchered and disrespected since the original first person shooters were made. This game pays a great deal of respect to the genre, the story and to the PC market in general.\n\nThe game caters to any play style, be it stealth, assault, survival or modular. This game is completely completable with spending none of the currency on offer for bullets or weapons. As you progress through the game you'll get better and better weapons but if you need to buy weapons or ammunition you're probably playing it wrong.\n\nIt's rich, detailed, scary and beautiful in all respects. It's said that the Russians tell the best repressive stories and this is one shining example of that talent. You'll get to experience the best and the worst in human kind, and every time you play these games you will experience something new - big or little. I've finished this game countless times, in fact I can finish it really quick now, but I will always find something new.\n\nThis version of the game was released in order to modernise the game from the original, and to update all the technology behind it. The engine and it's components have evolved from the original, and this arguably comes at a price. I find the modernisation is a good thing in general as there's a consistency among the series now, but some of you may wish to experience the original of which I'm yet to review. The original is much darker, the AI is much better if not too good and takes some adjusting, and I got to confess, I do prefer the textures of the Librarians over the Redux version.\n\nIf you enjoy first person shooters, if you enjoy zombies, monsters and scary games, if you love beautiful graphics and a challenge, this is a must own. I've bought the whole series at full price and I've definitely got my moneys worth from it. I have finished each version of the game countless times, and I will finish them all again countless times. In fact the last run of which I've just completed, I completed with more than 1700 military grade points.","February 22, 2015","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(previously a NVIDIA user) I'm now an AMD user\nI'm a fan of shooting games and action. and of course I love stealth too. This game balances it all perfectly\nalthough sometimes the A.I. is just plain hilarious sometimes where you're literally next to a guy and he wont notice you\nfor the monster well just lead them to a corner load up your shotgun then bam they're dead (does not apply to demons, librarians, etc) All in all I was in it for the story my computer could run it flawlessly except for tessalation(Normal) and SSAA I didnt like SSAA since it made it look all fuzzy (0.5x)\nThe game is pretty moody in my opinion in both gameplay and well stability.\nI had a bunch of fixes to fix the repeated crashing and then finally found that letting the intro play was the fix for it I dont know why but it doesnt crash anymore. But then again the moodiness of its stability comes in and it's like nop ur not playing this I dont wan to play im goin to crash now k bye *crashes*\nall in all good.

I'm just after "Defend/Child".\n\nShort bullets :\nREALISM :\n- Gas/Nightvison goggles will be damaged (comprimised vison) if you wear them in combat\n- No automatic ammo pickups or reloads\n- You actually might need your flashlight in this, unlike other shooters\nGAMEPLAY (Good):\n- Definatly not your traditional "Run-N-Gun" game but far from boring. Two playable modes which can switch the game from it's classic "Scavenege for bullets" and stealth preffered feel, or make it more forgiving on ammo count with "Spartan" mode.\n- Heavy scavenging aspect, good if you're into looting every enemy you kill and searching for ammo ect.\n- Many different ways to stealth through enemy blockades, or just attempt to gun every enemy down if you have enough bullets\nBAD :\n- Weak human A.I , Monsters are ok but they generally just swarm you anyways\n- Not so good level progession when it requires you to perform a specific action but you receive no instruction or hint from the game on what to do (Read below)\n- Forced Night Vision Goggles mode (bug? Read below)\n\nUpon entering that game, I noticed it was FAR different from any other shooter I've played. It does have some focus on realism. Putting on a Gas mask to avoid radiation, a game where you actually need your flashlight, No automatic reload, wiping blood off of said gas mask, no automatic ammo pickups, ect. It has a pretty high scavenging and looting feel to it, if you like searching every body, and looting safes you'll like the scavenging aspect to this. The graphics are super intense I was suprised to find out that I actually couldn't run it at "Very High" setting because it was too much for my graphics card, but It looks amazing in that mode if you have strong enough specs.\n\nThis is definatly not a run-n-gun game, but fear not, it's far from boring. You CAN run-n-gun if you choose to play in the new "Spartan" mode, which makes ammo pretty common. But from what I hear in the normal mode ammo is more scarce and stealth is preffered. Speaking of the stealth system, it's pretty nice. Stay in the shadows, don't walk on any broken glass and avoid tripwire traps ect. You can stealthily take out enemies, or blow out the candles and sneak past them. However there is a downfall, the A.I are increadibly horrible at detecting you while you're not shooting at them. I crouched behind one Nazi gaurd and attempted to knock him out only to realize too late that he had full body armor on and I wouldn't be able to. He turned around with his flash light right in my face and shouted "Who goes there?!" I froze, I was practically kissing him but he didn't "notice" me. After a tense staring contest he soon mumbled somthing about seeing shadows and casually pushed me (no really, the game phsyically pushed me out of his way) and continued to walk past me. Now yes, this was in "Spartan/Normal" mode (Easy) but I mean come on, he should have detected me.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is how the game just completetly leaves you to figure almost everything out on your own. I (like many others) had NO IDEA what to do when first following Khan and arriving in the train car full of impassable cobwebs. He just stood there and didn't tell me what to do. I thought that the game bugged and failed to load a script and rebooted it several times until finally watching a walkthrough on Youtube and finding out that you had to press M and take out your lighter and burn the cobwebs. The reason this is confusing is because you walk through TONS of other cobwebs throughout the game without needing to burn them, then suddently arrive at some that you MUST burn to pass but receiving no instruction or hint to do so. Litterally, Khan doesn't say ANYTHING when you get to this part. He just stands there and stares through the webs.\n\nFinally, I don't even know if this is a bug or not but, there are times when after you collect the night vision goggles you'll be FORCED to wear them durring some parts of the game. And no, not parts where they're usefull, infact quite the opposite. This is the whole reason I decided to write this review. This is absolutly rediculous. At some specific parts of the game, your character will put his NVG's on and you won't be able to take them off. I first encounted this durring the "Trolly Fight" level in which you use an turret on a moving rail car and shoot at enemies. The NVGs got forced on me and  I couldn't take them off for the whole level. Since the level isn't particually dark it was EXTREAMLY hard to aim at enemies because all I could see was big white blobs everywhere (fires, enemy flashlights, explosions, ect.) The NVGs are definatly NOT NEEDED in this level but the game forces you to wear them. I don't know if this is a bug or not, but I later encountered this when entering a "town/outpost". It once again forces me to wear the NVGs in a well lit environment making it hard to navigate. shop, ect.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy the game for providing me with a different kind of shooter experiance sperate from Call of Duty styled shooters. ....But that NVG thing is really starting to get on my nerves!\n\nI reccomend this game ONLY to people who do research and find out that this is not a Call of Duty type shooter. If you buy this game and expect Call of Duty action, prepare to be dissapointed. If you're looking for a shooter that isn't all about multiplayer and is a focused single player shooter with scavenging and atmosphere, try this out.","March 7, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It truly delivers a great atmospheric environment with splendid-looking detail. I really enjoyed the feeling of being in an apocalyptic story with very a scarce ammo count. It really makes you think about which is the best strategy to use in different situations. Wheather to fire away precious ammo or take the stealth approach to eliminate your enemies. The experience was truly immersive. With all that said, you will require a very high-end PC to run this game to it's potential. Unfortunately, the game is plagued with stuttering, especially for SLI or CrossFire users. I recommend that the game should be played with a single graphic card. The game would also crash at random. It seems that the original Metro 2033 runs much smoother in terms of performance but is nothing when compared to overall design and detail of the Redux version. Despite all that, I still recommend this game. A game for folks who enjoy shooters in a very apocalyptic world.","April 6, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said you don't need to read them to get into the game, but it doesn't hurt to be further educated on the subject matter.\n\nThe game is a survival horror in every true sense of the word. You live underground in Moscow, where the city has been destroyed by nuclear warfare and the surface can only be bared with the proper equipment. Mutants roam the lands and Metro tunnels 24/7 and you must stay alert if you want to survive. However the mutants aren't the only threat in this game. There are more than one civilization of humans; factions, if you will. You will have encounters with them as well.\n\nEvery. Bullet. Counts.\n\nYou will scavenge high and low for every bullet, every health pack, every grenade...\nEach one found is a little hope instilled in your soul.\nNot only are bullets for use in the obvious way; shooting. They are also your currency - making you decide - Do I save it to shoot or do I use it to buy supplies?\nEvery decision is crucial.\n\nRedux is the definitive version, adding two distinct playstyles: Survival & Spartan.\n\nSurvival is the way it is meant to be played - low ammo, high damage and smarter AI.\nSpartan is more in the spirit of Last Light, giving you more ammo and supply pickups.\n\nRanger Hardcore mode erases all HUD, hints and interaction buttons from the game.\n\nI highly, highly recommend playing the campaign on Survival: Ranger Hardcore.\n\n12/10","December 17, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This one happens to be my favorite game of all time, so this review may be a bit biased.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, there is a mix of stealth and shooting sections and one never overpowers the other. Stealth is vastly improved over Metro 2033, using the PathEngine and adding stealth kills/knockouts with an animation. The graphics are gorgeous. The Dead City's derelict beauty, the underground Metros feel more cozy and humanic, monsters more terrifying. The swap from 2033's 4A engine to Last Light's modded 4A engine was nothing but beneficial and the game looks superb. This game is optimized so damn well. It ran on my horrid laptop at 45 fps 75% of the time except when I was on the surface. The game looks great and performs even better. The sound design is pristine, HUGE immersion factor. The story is the best in a FPS I've ever played; to sum it up for you:\n\n"You are Artyom, a man who lives in Exhibition, but when Dark Ones threaten your home, you must go on a perilous journey to the heart of the Metro to warn the rest of the Metro of the apparent danger."\n\nBut like every good game, there are some flaws here they are:\n- Artyom's sleeves will randomly change during cutscenes, I never realized this until my 4th playthrough so it's not very distracting and it never randomly happens.\n- The game sells itself as a horror game but I've never really felt scared.\n- The moral point system doesn't really matter since Last Light begins off the bad ending.\n- The stealth system works for the most part but the way it is built will allow you to crouch right next to an enemy undetected as long as you're in a shadow. (Your watch's light sensor)\n\nThis game is one of the greatest I've ever played or will play, I have no doubts it will ever leave my top 10, and with this my final verdict is a:\n\n9/10: Fantastic mechanics but little nitpicks like sleeve changing can really bring you out of the immersion sometimes.","June 14, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been improved in a multitude of ways, and today I shall be analyzing them for you.\n\nFirstly, per style for my reviews, graphics. It's not spectacular, but a vast improvement over the original. It seems much more realistic now as opposed to its ancestor.\nWould like to instate that hostile characters are repetitive though.\n\nNow gameplay. Although it might come off as your standard FPS, alongside the CODs and Battlefields in the world, I can full-heartedly state that this is a stigma. Metro 2033 is a survival shooter, and despite it having similar attributes to typical fps, it's not. By that, you murder monsters, and scavenge bodies for loot, and currency. Currency being Military-Grade bullets, of course.\n\nThere's the attribute of its music, eerie and hollow which bursts my heart at various times. You're always butt-halfway on the seat, 'cause you're ready for the oncoming horde of jumpscares by the Darkness.\n\nWhen with companions, they are now able to assist by shooting the creatures, as opposed to not doing damage whatsoever. Furthermore, you need to be cautious with your ammunition. No firing aimlessly, tap like CS:GO.\n\nAnd yes, it's terrifying as hell. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game spooked me.\n\nWith that, a MUST-PLAY.","March 26","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is set in the post apocalyptic metro of Moscow in the year 2033 and you are Artyom who must make his way through the militant, mutated, and paranormal dangers of the dark metro and your mission is to save your home station from a new mutant threat coming from the the surface.\n\nReview: The story of this game is the best i've played, you can really feel the story, after you have completed the story you want more and you want to know more about the Metro, The game has some bugs and glitches but hey that doesn't make it a bad game every game has bugs and glitches. The gun play is really well done and satisfying you can customize your weapon to stealth, long range and close range. The enemies is very good done it changes from human to mutants and every enemy behaves differently, in the most missions you can choose from stealth to kill em all, The mission are well thought through. The graphics in this game are gorgeous.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone who likes story games. This game is a must pick up even if it's not on sale.\nI give this game a 9/10 because the story is kinda short if the story was longer i would have gave it a 10/10, Buy it!","January 17","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you havent expirenced the series yet DO. NOW. GET TO IT.\n\nSo before I begin, I want to say that this series is my favorite, and for many reason ( which you get to hear ), so I may be a bit biased. Also, almost everything I say here can also be atributed to the original. So, as previously stated, I love this series, and when I heard about the redux, I was scared, as I didn't want it to be shamed by what is basically a next gen console port by things like new voice actors, or possibly streamlining for "wider appearl". I also feared that Ranger Mode would be cut off and sold seperately, as w/ the original Last Light. Thankfully, since THQ desolved into the ether, neither of those things are there. Instead, we have good 'ol Metro:2033 but with better graphics, and other devolpers need to realize that this is how you do it.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe original's gameplay (i.e. gunplay/stealth) was just fine and it hasnt changed a bit. This may sound like a criticism, but its not. While some games try to innovate and fail and some try to innovate at the behest of everything else, Metro games try to instead set the bar by good atmosphere, world building and of course, good gameplay by using what works and results in a bar that is only raised in my book by Half Life. The guns feel good, and especially in Ranger Mode, the games hardcore playthrough mode that remove almost all hud elements ( you have to count the bullets left in your magazine by looking at it) and increases damage to enemies and the player (it also makes resources more scarce, but we'll talk about that later). If you prefere a stealthy approach, you are in luck. While the levels where stealth is encouraged are extactly Thief 2 big, the are nicely sized and have multiple access points and little secrets to discover. Also, it takes the idea of Thief's Light Gem (a little gem at the bottom of the screen that displays how visible you are) and incorporates it into a watch that you can see when holding your weapon out. Overall, I liked the gameplay, my only annoyance that a lot of guns were REALLY quiet. The Duplet, an icon of the series, (a double barrel shotgun made out of pipes) is no louder that an slightly miffed cat coughing. But worth it and im sure the modding community can fix that issue.\n\nEnviroment/World: 10/10\nThe Metro Series has the advantage of being based off of a book, and even more of one by being by a Russian author. (I'm not being biased against all but Russians, but the Russian side of a nuclear apacolyplse is rarely touched otherwise, especially in games.) Books have much better world and story that most games The idea of the Moscow civilians in the underground metro being the sole survivors is just genius to me, and lavely to play in. When you aren't sneaking through the underground section, you are on the surface, sneaking by or just fighting off mosters and enemy factions and that is really quite fun as well. Since most of the game is in dark, claustrophobic enviroments, it is very welcome to walk around the surface. When you are on the surface, you need a gas mask to survive. You also need filters, which you find in the world. These filters have an alloted amount of time before they run out, the more you have, the more time you have. This I find an espicially nice touch, adding to the Survival-horrow aspect. The enviroments however, at least compared to its successor, are quite linear. On the surface, you have wide open spaces, but a rather set path to travel them. In Last Light, you have wide open spaces that were, wide open. This made you want more filters, so you could explore more, and get better weapons/ammo or other gear. A similar problem is underground. While Last Light had more exploration in its tunnels, 2033 has a bit less so, but it isnt really noticeable. Also, in the metro stations that serve as towns, often you are immediatley rushed through, with little time to breath. In Last Light, these are calm areas, with little things on the side to do, be it help a child find his teddy bear, or watch an old man tell children about birds and green trees. However, all these are made up for by the facts that A)The sequel didn't exist yet, so it really should not be compared to it, and B) The setting is so unique and instantly interesting that it completely makes up for it.\n\nStory/Characters:\nAs I said earlier the fact that this is based off of a book gives it an advantage story wise. The entire draw of books are stories, not filling Nazies and Communists with bullets and then stomping off to the surface for a quick irradiated run through the wastes. And it really shines through to the game.\nSummary:\nYou play Artyom, a child who grew up shortly after the war ended in the Metro station known as Exhibition. When your station is threated by the Dark Ones, irradiated mutations that seem to be superhuman, you begin your odyssy to Polis (another station) to take the message of your missing friend and save your station.\n\nOk, that sounds cheesy, especially with the inclusion of communist and Nazi factions, but it is made up by the character of Artyom himself. In gameplay, he never speaks, but on loading screens, he writes in his diary, and reads it aloud, so you hear his voice, which is nice, since silent protagonists annoy me, and ones who voice opinions i disagree or annoy me with their character (see Booker DeWitt) I dislike even more. Also, if you find paper throughout the level, Artyom writes notes in his journal which shed more light on the situation and also don't do the Mass Effect thing of huge exposion dumps via the Codex.\nSome thing that annoys me, once again taking cues for Thief (not that its a bad thing, I love the first two of those) is that no matter how much Artyom tries not to care, he still gets embroiled with the factions.\nI didn't do a X/10 rating for this section because I don't know what to thing of it. The mark of a good story is that you think about it afterwards and on my first runthrough of the original, the story really did stick with me, especially the ending MINOR SPOILER  leaving Artyome morally ambiguous and almost regretful, but still glad he did what he did  END MINOR SPOILER. The ending was also good as it rounded out the story with no sequel hook, but still was open enough to have one. However, they're was a lot of little things that dragged it down, especially the beginning. It begins en midias res with you fighting monsters close to the end of the game. Then it jumps back 8 days to when you are in your metro station, meeting w/ the guy who goes missing. Then, finally he goes missing and your journey begins. This made it feel drawn out, and results in lowered expectations. But i guess I liked it\n\nNice little touches:\nYou can wipe your gas mask to wipe blood and grime off it\nYou have a lighter which clears away cobwebs\nYou have a notepad that displays objectives and it has a compass that points the way if you are lost\nAll of the above remove the need for a hud (more immersive)\nFlashlight needs charging\nMilitary grade rounds are the currency, so shoot'em or spend'em\nFeels like an odyssy as the camera almost is never outside the players perspective and the story is continuous\nGood weapon and character design\n\nAnnoyances:\nWhen picked up by Demons (really big mutated bats) and then dropped, the animation is buggy (might be fixed later on)\nSometimes switches to military grade rounds without saying so\nDepending on the order which you collect paper, Artyoms notes are sort of out of order\nNOT SURVIAL HORROR- NOT SCARY\nSpartan mode has resources up the wazoo\nAssorted minor bugs\n\nOverall: 9/10, Don't bother if you already have Metro:2033, unless you NEED graphic updates. If you havent expirenced the series yet DO. NOW. GET TO IT.\nOh also play at night","August 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even Fallout 4 failed to deliver in this respect, but this game actually gives me nostalgia for the good old days while looking just as good if not better than most games to date. I feel like 2033 is better than last light in a sense of that last light kind of just feels like it was tacked on to get the most money out of the product, and that's what's killing games today. However, it still gives the feel of caring that 2033 gives.

The first Metro game is, in this regard, the superior to the second due to the fact that it more closely follows the plot of the original books. You are Artyom. Your station (the equivalent of a city-state in the post-apocalyptic world of Moscow) is in danger of attack from mysterious and deadly creatures known only as "The Dark Ones." The rest of the game chronicles Artyom's journey through the Metro to save his home station. Along the way, he meets several companions who help him (or hinder him) along his journey, but all of them have a vital role to play in how the story unfolds. I, personally, found myself growing quite fond of some of them, though the game never really keeps you with one long enough to develop their character fully (with a few exceptions). The best way to experience Metro's story is really to play the game yourself. Seriously. Don't hurt your experience by watching the game on Youtube. You'll regret it in the end.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay-wise, you probably couldn't ask for a more well-rounded game. Immediately as you start, you are given the option between Spartan Mode (run-and-gun, shooter-based gameplay) and Survival Mode (stealthy, survival-horror gameplay with sparse ammunition and filters). If you're a fan of the first person genre at all, it's very likely that you will find a mode that fits your playstyle; however, the game really does shine more in Surivival Mode, which more closely mirrors the hardcore aspect of the original Metro. Combined with Ranger Hardcore, Survival Mode really makes for a challenging (but rewarding and immersive) experience, though I would not recommend hardcore on your first playthrough due to the completely diabled HUD. I should also note that there are portions of the game where an added checkpoint would alleviate a good deal of frustration (tag this as a negative if you'd like), but the few times that I truly became frustrated were still few and far between.  Note: I know that I'm really just addressing the overall aspects of gameplay - the rest is truly much more enjoyable to discover for yourself. This game doesn't hold your hand.\n\nGraphics\n\nMetro 2033 Redux is simply a technological masterpiece. Every character, every spark, every speck of dust is rendered in incredible detail, making for a truly atmospheric and immersive experience. The dark, moodiness of the Metro is contrasted remarkably well with the brighter (though still grim) color palette of Moscow's radiated surface. When it comes to performance, Metro holds up remarkably well considering that its game engine was built from the ground up by the developers. I have a rapidly aging desktop PC, and Metro still had a consistent 55-60 FPS on high settings (bumping it up once to ultra made it lag terribly in larger, particle-dense areas). Even on a lower setting, you will not be disappointed by Metro's appearance.\n\nSound\n\nIt is this category which I would succinctly summarize as the best and worst part of Metro 2033. First, it is the best part of the game because it adds just one more layer to the already fantastic atmosphere. Clanking metal (my Dead Space PTSD started up again), distant howls of mutant creatures, rolling thunder, screeching winds: all of these make for an experience worth cranking up the volume for. You want to know what doesn't? The voice acting. Frankly, it's horrible. Seemingly exaggerated Russian accents (the children are especially bad when it comes to quality and variety) really break the immersion in the various Metro stations. Though it may not be as noticable on your first playthrough (unless you have a good ear), many of the generic, expendable characters and ordinary citizens are voiced by the same actors. I'm aware that many of the English voices were done by the Russian voice actors working over-time, but they seriously could have done better than this.  Note: The voice acting is not a purchase-breaking issue, but I found it to be rather immersion-breaking in such an otherwise atmospheric game.\n\nConclusion\n\nMetro 2033 is easily one of the best First Person games of the past several years. It's immersion and atmosphere is virtually unparalleled, and it ranks as one of the most challenging games in the genre. As many of you have probably noticed, I referred to the game as an "experience" multiple times in my review. This was deliberate. Metro 2033 isn't your average shooter. It's a story. It will make you ponder life, death, and sacrifice. It's a world. It will make you feel you're visiting a dead planet far, far away. It's a way of life. It will make you more deeply appreciate the common luxuries of warm beds to sleep in and clean air to breath.\n\nThis is Metro 2033. Fear the Future.\nSummary:\nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 7/10\nOverall: 9/10 (Essential Purchase)","December 2, 2015","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But its a fix story. So u cant influence it at all. For me, it was a nice alternative to the rest of the nowaday games. Its a bit more relaxing and u are sure that u dont miss anything.\n\n- compact gameplay. Like there are not to many controlls u have to learn.\n\n- enjoyable difficulties. We have something for the hobby player but also for the hardliners. I personally like it a bit more difficult and I got what i wanted.\n\n- its not horror horror. If u expect a game where u have to close your eyes ever few steps u are wrong with this one!!\n\n- The story at all is a bit short. I think it has like 12 playing hours. But im not sure at this!\n\nSo i recommend this game and for 20 bucks its totally worth it\n\n\nAlso ich habe das Game gerade durch.\n\nIch kann sagen:\n\n- Stimmige Grafik und transportierte Atmospähre.\n\n- Gute Story. Diese ist geführt. Also keine multiple choice oder Einflussnahme auf die Story. Fand ich persönlich mal wieder ganz angenehem.\n\n- Gutes gameplay. Kompakte Steuerung. Nicht zu viele Knöpfe.\n\n- Gute Schwierigkeitsgrade. Also von Hobbyspieler und Hardliner ist hier alles mit dabei. Finde ich persönlich auch sehr gut. Ich mag es eher schwer. Und bin hier auch auf meine Kosten gekommen.\n\n- Toller Sound auch. Passt zur Atmospähre\n\n- Keine Horror Horror. Also wem sich die Fußnägel hochstellen sollen, der ist hier falsch.\n\n- Die Story ist etwas kurz. Also kein Endless game ala Skyrim o.ä\n\nMeine Empfehlung für jeden der abends entspannen möchte und durch eine neue dichte Geschichte geführt werden will. 20€ sind absolut angemessen.","December 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hadn't played that game because it's not really my type of thing, so I was hesitant about Metro. It turns out, though, that Metro is really more like Bioshock than STALKER, which suits me just fine. The English translation is sometimes pretty bad, I encountered a few bugs (the worst of which was getting stuck in a wall and having to reload a checkpoint), and the way the story is conveyed can be pretty ham-handed. That being said, the developers do a great job of world building. Between the art design and overheard conversations, the environment does most of the storytelling, and it does it quite well. It's always refreshing to play a game made by a non-American developer, especially when, like Metro, their game presents their culture instead of just trying to mimic American culture.\n\nAs for the mechanics of the game, there are some interesting weapons, the most original of which are the pneumatic weapons that require you to pump them occasionally to keep the air pressure topped off. There are also a couple of unique enemies, the best of which is the Librarian, a monster who won't attack you as long as you look him in the eye. And then there's the gas mask mechanic, which requires you to wear a gas mask when you are outside the Metro tunnels. The masks require filters, which need to be replaced after five minutes, so going outside the tunnels creates a nice tension. The action is tight and exciting, and there are a number of different difficulties to suit your preferred playstyle. I wasn't particularly satisfied with the way the story wraps up, but I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and look forward to playing the sequel, Metro: Last Light.","October 12, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it a few days ago and completed it in about 6 hours. I liked it a lot because it was like STALKER in regards to theme, setting, atmosphere but NOT in gameplay.  Metro 2033 and STALKER are like brothers but the kind where each is different enough.\n\nWhat I liked:\n+ great atmosphere, great setting\n+ decent story and mythos, made me want to read the books\n+ you get to customise your guns nicely\n+ you are able to customise your entire game (style of play, dififculty, etc)\n+ music is very nice; STALKER is better but still good\n+ no tedious boss battles\n+ gameplay varies; you aren't always doing the same thing or fighting the same enemies\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- at a few points in certain maps I got seriously lost and died as a result\n- very linear, no freedom to go back to previous points even just to explore\n- the ending was a bit open ended (obviously though the game has a sequel and another book)\n- weapons didn't feel very unique or powerful and also since you can only customise in a few points in game you're stuck with your loadout\n- not a lot of replayability; I will play again definitely but only after some time.\n\nSo again I compare it strongly to STALKER. Maybe that's unfair given that STALKER is more sandbox but still I say if you liked STALKER then Metro 2033 Redux is a logical next step.\n\nPS !!! PS !!! PS!!!\nI had problems with the original Metro 2033. It wouldn't launch at all.

In that regard it succeeds with flying colours, and despite a few moments where i had to watch playthroughs to understand what the game's script was waiting for me to do (these moments were rare but annoying enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth), you will more than likely easily immerse yourself in russia's underground tunnels.\n\nExploration is fairly limited however; Most environments consist of corridors with extra rooms full of loot that you can find by looking around a bit, and the areas that are a bit more open are often ones that you can easily get lost into if you don't know exactly where you're going (the game sometimes feels like it's letting you find the tiniest crack in a wall that you can pass through). I'm all in for immersive gameplay but having an option to turn on objective markers would've avoided me some google searches mid-game, and trust me those break the atmosphere way more than a little arrow on the screen ever would.\n\nMetro 2033 also has its fair share of combat, which is satisfying (cool even if limited gun customization options)  but ultimately forgettable. What gives it the tiniest bit of originality, apart from customizing your guns, are the designs of the weapons themselves, which feels very fitting in a post apocalyptic world. I also appreciate the fact that enemies are diverse: mutants, humans or even weird insect-ish abominations, there's not that many different enemy types but they all feel unique and need to be approached in a different way.\n\nIt took me around 8 hours to finish the campaign on the normal difficulty. But you can definitely get a few extra hours out of the game by searching for collectibles, get achievements or beat the game on the hardest difficulty.\n\nOverall i recommend this game, it's a very fun and interesting journey despite its few shortcomings.\n\n(If you liked the game's universe, read the books ! You won't regret it and you'll be encouraging english translation for some spin-offs that never got the attention they deserved; i'm looking at you, Andrey Dyakov's "Towards the light" )\n\n","September 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 'Redux' edition really revived the graphics, which makes the game look so beautiful and sexy.\n\nThe game itself follows the book quite well, as I played the game before actually reading the book. The storyline to me seems strangely believeable, and has many good levels in which you play (personal favourite is the D6 level).\n\nUnfortunately I have had great difficulty trying to get the good ending, and at the time of writing this review I have not yet unlocked the good ending, despite getting about 90% of the possible good morale points.\n\nHowever, the negative ending in itself is absolutely awesome, seeing as how all your efforts in the game aren't U-turned by picking the good ending.\n\nThere are also many different play styles that you can pick when playing Metro 2033, which affect your approach to certain levels. For instance, in the level Frontline you can either go stealthy and silently kill those necessary, go in all guns blazing, or use sneaky passages and miss out everyone.\n\nThe difficulty options give you a good idea about which one gives you the best experience. There are only two play 'styles' - Survival and Spartan (Spartan being the easier option with more ammunition lying around.) This gives a true feeling of the strapped life of the metro, and in certain areas really makes you wish you has ammo left to use.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. The graphics are fantastic, the storyline is compelling, and the characters are composed well to work with the atmosphere of the ever-evolving Metro.","August 17, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

Really great game, not perfect its flawed but I think its part of its charm in a way.\n\nThe most impressive part of the game is the atmosphere and I think this is what people talk about the most when they talk about these games. The story is you have to get somewere to warn them of an impending threat. You move mostly through the metro from station to station and also above ground to get to were you need to be, there are other impressive sites too. This is what I love I mean the enviroments are really well crafted. You can literally smell the smoke and taste the vodka and walking through post apocalyptic Moscow with Mutants chasing you and demon things flying above trying to kill you ye pretty cool.\n\nThere are incredibly memorable moments of running out of ammo, hiding in corners with only throwing darts surrounding yourself with fire bombs so the creatures cant get you from behind and scrapping through just getting a new gas mask before you suffocate. There are also frustrating moments of dieing continously before you can find the right way out but its all worth it.\n\nIts a fun ride other people will talk about the mechanics of the game etc I enjoyed it.

Post-apocalyptic Moscow. People living in tunnels liek rats. And that's what influences entire game. Combats in the darkness with nazis and fearless creatures, that you can hardly (or sometimes never) kill are really what makes this game what it is.\n\nThe story itself is also pretty amazing. Artyom is my hero ;) He makes it from community named Polis in the tunnels, where he was only guy, who knows how to hold gun. to the savior of the world (or entire Moscow at least let's say). There are couple unexpected moments, which always make stories like this interesting.\n\nOn the other hand, the combat itself is kind of average. You have flashlight (nothing new) and you can upgrade you weapons (nothing new). Well to be fair some upgrades are really cool. And i almost forgot, you have grenades and knifes. These knifes can kill silently, which is super fun and useful sometimes. What makes the combat really interesting is the environment again. Creatures varies, you have guns to choose from. Pretty fun is that rifle loaded by arrows.\n\nAll and all I'am fan of these post-apo dark games so 85/100.","July 11, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Based on a book of the same name (which you will see at least a dozen times in a single playthrough) it feels very well fleshed out in comparison to other post-apocalyptic games that simply seem to copy all the muted colors and dismal lighting without really capturing the atmosphere of a broken sad world void of hope.\n\nYou play the silent protagonist Artyom. The voice acting, atmosphere, graphics, movement and mechanics of the game are all very well done. Your choices affect which ending you may have and they are very subtle which is nice. Irradiated zones abound so a gas mask is required and it is one of the mechanics in the game that I initially thought was neat but then later on grew to love. Imagine  a bunch of monsters are running towards you and a companion and you need to reload your weapon, while reloading you take damage so you also need to apply a med kit while struggling to avoid blows THEN once you are finally good to shoot the creatures in the face with say a modded out shotgun with laser sights, four barrels and a reload reducing stock the alarm to indicate you need to put a new filter on your gas mask (which by this time the visor is probably covered in blood) sounds and you are wise to switch it out immediately. All of this adds to a sense of chaotic and tense combat which I found way more fun than your typical shooter.\n\nThe monsters in Metro are probably the biggest letdown followed closely by sound effects for the weapons and the occasional frame rate drops. The monsters are variations of different sized mutants ranging from dog to ape sizes and are largely forgettable and annoying to kill due to high and unpredictable movement speed. the late game offers a bit of monster variation but its too little too late. Sound effects for the guns make them sound very weak which combined with the aforementioned monsters makes combat annoying at times. Lastly a couple spots in the game involving water or lots of particles effects, especially in the late game induces horrendous frame drop issues.\n\nThe good far outweighs the bad here. If you enjoy FPS's as well as story rich fleshed out worlds do not hesitate to buy (with money not ammo) this game.","November 22, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That just goes to show how immersive this game is. On my first playthrough I (somewhat regrettably) chose Survival mode and was left dumbfounded on how this game works. I didn't even know you needed to charge your flashlight until Chapter 3. Playing for the first time with little to no HUDs is hard, frustrating at the beginning, but feels totally immersive and worth it. I had to conserva ammo and medical kits like they were gold. Hell, even after doing that I was left with one shotgun bullet trying to fend off giant amoebas in D6, clinging on to Miller because I thought I wouldn't need that flamethrower.\n\nThis experience made it real easy for me while playing in Spartan Hard mode. I nearly found all the hidden locations, almost always have abundant ammo until I can't loot anymore, and successfully pulled off the true ending (after failing in the first one). Mechanics wise, Metro 2033 Redux is very solid. The story felt a bit short but maybe that's just me. I can't really say much about it because it does feel like it's only half of the tale and the sequel will answer all the questions I had for this one.\n\n9/10","November 22, 2015","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If you havent expirenced the series yet DO. NOW. GET TO IT.\n\nSo before I begin, I want to say that this series is my favorite, and for many reason ( which you get to hear ), so I may be a bit biased. Also, almost everything I say here can also be atributed to the original. So, as previously stated, I love this series, and when I heard about the redux, I was scared, as I didn't want it to be shamed by what is basically a next gen console port by things like new voice actors, or possibly streamlining for "wider appearl". I also feared that Ranger Mode would be cut off and sold seperately, as w/ the original Last Light. Thankfully, since THQ desolved into the ether, neither of those things are there. Instead, we have good 'ol Metro:2033 but with better graphics, and other devolpers need to realize that this is how you do it.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe original's gameplay (i.e. gunplay/stealth) was just fine and it hasnt changed a bit. This may sound like a criticism, but its not. While some games try to innovate and fail and some try to innovate at the behest of everything else, Metro games try to instead set the bar by good atmosphere, world building and of course, good gameplay by using what works and results in a bar that is only raised in my book by Half Life. The guns feel good, and especially in Ranger Mode, the games hardcore playthrough mode that remove almost all hud elements ( you have to count the bullets left in your magazine by looking at it) and increases damage to enemies and the player (it also makes resources more scarce, but we'll talk about that later). If you prefere a stealthy approach, you are in luck. While the levels where stealth is encouraged are extactly Thief 2 big, the are nicely sized and have multiple access points and little secrets to discover. Also, it takes the idea of Thief's Light Gem (a little gem at the bottom of the screen that displays how visible you are) and incorporates it into a watch that you can see when holding your weapon out. Overall, I liked the gameplay, my only annoyance that a lot of guns were REALLY quiet. The Duplet, an icon of the series, (a double barrel shotgun made out of pipes) is no louder that an slightly miffed cat coughing. But worth it and im sure the modding community can fix that issue.\n\nEnviroment/World: 10/10\nThe Metro Series has the advantage of being based off of a book, and even more of one by being by a Russian author. (I'm not being biased against all but Russians, but the Russian side of a nuclear apacolyplse is rarely touched otherwise, especially in games.) Books have much better world and story that most games The idea of the Moscow civilians in the underground metro being the sole survivors is just genius to me, and lavely to play in. When you aren't sneaking through the underground section, you are on the surface, sneaking by or just fighting off mosters and enemy factions and that is really quite fun as well. Since most of the game is in dark, claustrophobic enviroments, it is very welcome to walk around the surface. When you are on the surface, you need a gas mask to survive. You also need filters, which you find in the world. These filters have an alloted amount of time before they run out, the more you have, the more time you have. This I find an espicially nice touch, adding to the Survival-horrow aspect. The enviroments however, at least compared to its successor, are quite linear. On the surface, you have wide open spaces, but a rather set path to travel them. In Last Light, you have wide open spaces that were, wide open. This made you want more filters, so you could explore more, and get better weapons/ammo or other gear. A similar problem is underground. While Last Light had more exploration in its tunnels, 2033 has a bit less so, but it isnt really noticeable. Also, in the metro stations that serve as towns, often you are immediatley rushed through, with little time to breath. In Last Light, these are calm areas, with little things on the side to do, be it help a child find his teddy bear, or watch an old man tell children about birds and green trees. However, all these are made up for by the facts that A)The sequel didn't exist yet, so it really should not be compared to it, and B) The setting is so unique and instantly interesting that it completely makes up for it.\n\nStory/Characters:\nAs I said earlier the fact that this is based off of a book gives it an advantage story wise. The entire draw of books are stories, not filling Nazies and Communists with bullets and then stomping off to the surface for a quick irradiated run through the wastes. And it really shines through to the game.\nSummary:\nYou play Artyom, a child who grew up shortly after the war ended in the Metro station known as Exhibition. When your station is threated by the Dark Ones, irradiated mutations that seem to be superhuman, you begin your odyssy to Polis (another station) to take the message of your missing friend and save your station.\n\nOk, that sounds cheesy, especially with the inclusion of communist and Nazi factions, but it is made up by the character of Artyom himself. In gameplay, he never speaks, but on loading screens, he writes in his diary, and reads it aloud, so you hear his voice, which is nice, since silent protagonists annoy me, and ones who voice opinions i disagree or annoy me with their character (see Booker DeWitt) I dislike even more. Also, if you find paper throughout the level, Artyom writes notes in his journal which shed more light on the situation and also don't do the Mass Effect thing of huge exposion dumps via the Codex.\nSome thing that annoys me, once again taking cues for Thief (not that its a bad thing, I love the first two of those) is that no matter how much Artyom tries not to care, he still gets embroiled with the factions.\nI didn't do a X/10 rating for this section because I don't know what to thing of it. The mark of a good story is that you think about it afterwards and on my first runthrough of the original, the story really did stick with me, especially the ending MINOR SPOILER  leaving Artyome morally ambiguous and almost regretful, but still glad he did what he did  END MINOR SPOILER. The ending was also good as it rounded out the story with no sequel hook, but still was open enough to have one. However, they're was a lot of little things that dragged it down, especially the beginning. It begins en midias res with you fighting monsters close to the end of the game. Then it jumps back 8 days to when you are in your metro station, meeting w/ the guy who goes missing. Then, finally he goes missing and your journey begins. This made it feel drawn out, and results in lowered expectations. But i guess I liked it\n\nNice little touches:\nYou can wipe your gas mask to wipe blood and grime off it\nYou have a lighter which clears away cobwebs\nYou have a notepad that displays objectives and it has a compass that points the way if you are lost\nAll of the above remove the need for a hud (more immersive)\nFlashlight needs charging\nMilitary grade rounds are the currency, so shoot'em or spend'em\nFeels like an odyssy as the camera almost is never outside the players perspective and the story is continuous\nGood weapon and character design\n\nAnnoyances:\nWhen picked up by Demons (really big mutated bats) and then dropped, the animation is buggy (might be fixed later on)\nSometimes switches to military grade rounds without saying so\nDepending on the order which you collect paper, Artyoms notes are sort of out of order\nNOT SURVIAL HORROR- NOT SCARY\nSpartan mode has resources up the wazoo\nAssorted minor bugs\n\nOverall: 9/10, Don't bother if you already have Metro:2033, unless you NEED graphic updates. If you havent expirenced the series yet DO. NOW. GET TO IT.\nOh also play at night","August 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hadn't played that game because it's not really my type of thing, so I was hesitant about Metro. It turns out, though, that Metro is really more like Bioshock than STALKER, which suits me just fine. The English translation is sometimes pretty bad, I encountered a few bugs (the worst of which was getting stuck in a wall and having to reload a checkpoint), and the way the story is conveyed can be pretty ham-handed. That being said, the developers do a great job of world building. Between the art design and overheard conversations, the environment does most of the storytelling, and it does it quite well. It's always refreshing to play a game made by a non-American developer, especially when, like Metro, their game presents their culture instead of just trying to mimic American culture.\n\nAs for the mechanics of the game, there are some interesting weapons, the most original of which are the pneumatic weapons that require you to pump them occasionally to keep the air pressure topped off. There are also a couple of unique enemies, the best of which is the Librarian, a monster who won't attack you as long as you look him in the eye. And then there's the gas mask mechanic, which requires you to wear a gas mask when you are outside the Metro tunnels. The masks require filters, which need to be replaced after five minutes, so going outside the tunnels creates a nice tension. The action is tight and exciting, and there are a number of different difficulties to suit your preferred playstyle. I wasn't particularly satisfied with the way the story wraps up, but I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and look forward to playing the sequel, Metro: Last Light.","October 12, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is basically 2033's story with Last Light's gameplay. There are some differences between 2033 Redux and the original; some levels have been shortened or lengthened, merging into each other where in the original there would have been a loading screen, and there are some new parts entirely.\n\nHonestly, my favorite part of this game is how incredibly beautiful and immersive it is. Redux is the best looking game I have played in a very long time, and the graphics are even slightly better than Last Light.\n\nThey brought back the watch-checking feature, but unfortunately it doesn't bring up your inventory as it once did. And, probably most unfortunately, they decided to keep Last Light's console-based inventory system (not saying this because I am anti-console gaming, but because selecting your weaponry using a radial wheel inventory system with no HUD on Ranger Hardcore mode in the middle of combat is, to say the least, unnecessarily difficult).\n\nThe stealth is still quite bit dumbed down compared to 2033, and "survival" mode doesn't come close to the level of scarcity in the original. In that game, there were plenty of times when I had to choose between playing slow and suffocating or risk getting detected in order to quickly scavange for more air filters, and that was fun!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love 2033 Redux. It just doesn't quite capture the same difficulty level that was present in the original game. It's fun, no doubt, and it has quite a bit of replay value to find all the collectibles and try out the different difficulty levels, play styles, endings. I just wish they hadn't catered to the more casual side, or at the very least made Ranger Hardcore mode as difficult as it was in the first. Still, if you're a fan of the Metro series or have never played a Metro game in your life, you definitely need to get this.","September 1, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has an amazing storyline with great character detail and development. Metro 2033 Redux is nicely polished into a clean first person shooter with realistic shooting and gameplay. The plot is exotic, filled with rich dialouge and detail. Shooting is easy to learn but the game can be very difficult at times which helps you understand how treacherous life in the Metro is. The game can really give you a dose of anxiety since you have to withstand multiple enemies and hardships.. From fighting dozens of people during an immense blizzard to fighting creatures in the depths of the Metro tunnels... the intensity is balanced nicely, giving this game an amazing vibe. When Metro begins to calm, you're thrown back into action. The best experience is when you first step outside and witness the streams of sunlight and snow resting on the chaos and destruction. Of course there are some downsides... the length was too short for my standards and the game didn't feel fully completed by the end. I wish they expanded the variety of creatures that roam the outside world and maybe a few more weapons and attachments. But overall  great soundtrack, visuals, characters and imagery and I easily give this game a 8.4/10","July 19, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been improved in a multitude of ways, and today I shall be analyzing them for you.\n\nFirstly, per style for my reviews, graphics. It's not spectacular, but a vast improvement over the original. It seems much more realistic now as opposed to its ancestor.\nWould like to instate that hostile characters are repetitive though.\n\nNow gameplay. Although it might come off as your standard FPS, alongside the CODs and Battlefields in the world, I can full-heartedly state that this is a stigma. Metro 2033 is a survival shooter, and despite it having similar attributes to typical fps, it's not. By that, you murder monsters, and scavenge bodies for loot, and currency. Currency being Military-Grade bullets, of course.\n\nThere's the attribute of its music, eerie and hollow which bursts my heart at various times. You're always butt-halfway on the seat, 'cause you're ready for the oncoming horde of jumpscares by the Darkness.\n\nWhen with companions, they are now able to assist by shooting the creatures, as opposed to not doing damage whatsoever. Furthermore, you need to be cautious with your ammunition. No firing aimlessly, tap like CS:GO.\n\nAnd yes, it's terrifying as hell. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game spooked me.\n\nWith that, a MUST-PLAY.","March 26","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Walking through a market as a kid in a hockey mask chases another with a hammer. and the mom whose kid loves pet rats but lets them go in the tunnels instead of letting it be food.

This one happens to be my favorite game of all time, so this review may be a bit biased.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, there is a mix of stealth and shooting sections and one never overpowers the other. Stealth is vastly improved over Metro 2033, using the PathEngine and adding stealth kills/knockouts with an animation. The graphics are gorgeous. The Dead City's derelict beauty, the underground Metros feel more cozy and humanic, monsters more terrifying. The swap from 2033's 4A engine to Last Light's modded 4A engine was nothing but beneficial and the game looks superb. This game is optimized so damn well. It ran on my horrid laptop at 45 fps 75% of the time except when I was on the surface. The game looks great and performs even better. The sound design is pristine, HUGE immersion factor. The story is the best in a FPS I've ever played; to sum it up for you:\n\n"You are Artyom, a man who lives in Exhibition, but when Dark Ones threaten your home, you must go on a perilous journey to the heart of the Metro to warn the rest of the Metro of the apparent danger."\n\nBut like every good game, there are some flaws here they are:\n- Artyom's sleeves will randomly change during cutscenes, I never realized this until my 4th playthrough so it's not very distracting and it never randomly happens.\n- The game sells itself as a horror game but I've never really felt scared.\n- The moral point system doesn't really matter since Last Light begins off the bad ending.\n- The stealth system works for the most part but the way it is built will allow you to crouch right next to an enemy undetected as long as you're in a shadow. (Your watch's light sensor)\n\nThis game is one of the greatest I've ever played or will play, I have no doubts it will ever leave my top 10, and with this my final verdict is a:\n\n9/10: Fantastic mechanics but little nitpicks like sleeve changing can really bring you out of the immersion sometimes.","June 14, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/286690/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter with survival horror elements by developer THQ which is based on an international bestseller of the same name. The story takes place in an alternate history where Russia was heavily damaged during a nuclear war: the population of Moscow had to flee inside the local metro, where it still lives in the present time, given the city is now completely in ruin and contaminated. The player takes the role of Artyom, a boy born inside the metro, as he tries to save his station by the menace of mysterious entities known as the Dark Ones.\nMetro 2033's gameplay is your typical first-person shooter fare and is divided in equal measure between stealth and action sequences: while some levels require you to sneak past several enemies if you want to survive, other encounters are just hold the line missions where you have to put down several incoming hostiles. Truth be told, stealth is never strictly mandatory, but given the nature of the game as a survival horror, your ammunition and tools are limited and require good management, so most of the time evading conflict is extremely useful. You can collect different weapons and upgrade them with several components to personalize them following your style of playing: you can also use grenades of various kinds and throwing knives. Metro 2033 has an in-game currency, military grade bullets, that's used between the various missions to buy weapons, upgrade and tools: it's somehow rare and, in need, can be used as regular ammunition. Another important part of the game's gameplay is your gas mask: there are several contaminated areas in the game that can be navigated safely only using your mask, which breaks down over time, requiring you to invest in new filters. You can find Artyom's reports scattered around the levels as a form of collectables. Metro 2033's difficulty settings range from normal mode (the easiest setting) to ranger mode (the hardest).\nAn important part of Metro 2033's charm is indeed its atmosphere and environments: the locations you are going to visit both inside the metro and on the surface are rendered in great details and there's a lot of NPCs activity to experience. Some times you can even take some choices to either help someone or gain something for yourself: how you face such situations can award you an additional choice at the end of the game (but see below).\nThe Redux version of Metro 2033 offers a complete graphical and UI of the original game in order to make it look like more the sequel, Metro: Last Light. An important change is giving the player the choice between two styles of playing, survival or Spartan. Choosing Spartan means playing an action-oriented game where your character can suffer more damage and dish out more as well, on top of ammunition being more common and weapons reloading faster: choosing survival allows you to play Metro 2033 more in line with its original edition, with a more fragile protagonist and slowly reloading weapons that force you to use stealth more. Of course, there are other minor changes to be found between the original and the Redux version.\nThe only issue I had with Metro 2033 is the final sequence itself: not only the story progression becomes increasingly slow, but there's no more room for stealth and you are thrown into straight direct battles against several mutants. This is aggravated by you not having much ammo left at this point of the game, forcing you to either die several times or become creative with the few resources you have left. The very finale of Metro 2033 isn't that great either, because the option to pick an alternative ending relays on a certain numbers of very precise responses to NPCs you may have just missed or skipped.\nAside from that, however, I found Metro 2033 to be an excellent and gorgeous game with a good emphasis on survival, I would definitely recommend it","May 18, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it on the slightly harder mode my first time through and it took me ~15H to beat. I can't wait to start Metro: Last Light (Redux) now!!! 9.4/10!\n\nPros\n=====\n-Good story\n-Atmospheric\n-Multiple Enemy types where some are not so wise to shoot (keeping it spoiler-free! :])\n-Ammo conservation for realistic survivalism\n-You're alway kept busy whether it's shooting mutants, watching your back, reloading your weapon, cycling through grenade types/knives or wiping blood and dirt off your gas mask (very cool in my opinion! I wish more developers would incorporate these effects!)\n-P + NPC vs E (Mutant/Bandits) Teamplay\n-Weapon Trading System was not too complex (Although if they incorporated armour that would be even better! :D)\n\nCons\n=====\n-You always get the feeling like you're coming back to where you started (Your lifeline is holding "M" which will give you a nav point. This game may have taken me ~2H less if I knew that...)\n-Some parts are not so straight forward (Ex: You're in the tunnels and you need to burn the cobwebs to proceed - I had to YouTube the answer. The game will not always spoonfeed you the answer)\n-The use of gas mask filters is both a positive and negative - It's cool that you need to replace your filters to mimic realistic filter replacement... However, when you're down to about a minute and the game autosaved then you're frantically running around either trying to find more or beat the level - There was one level that took me over 4 hours because I got lost in a building and had to be on the other side of it. The game had saved and I had to remember about 6-7 turns and drops then wedge myself in a crack in the floor in order to get to the near end of the level. Then I had to fight 12 guys with basically no filter. I barely beat the guys when my filter had run out and I had to make a mad dash to the exit, I could've sworn I had less than 3 seconds before I died :/)","March 6","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the reason to play the Game again are the Gameplay Improvement 2033 got from Last Light: The Weapon-Upgrade- and Stealth-system is now like it was in Last Light, which is a huge improvement the Original 2033.\n\nThey also changed the Difficulty System: Before you choose your actual Difficulty (Hardcore, Hardcore Ranger etc.) you can choose between Survivor (Immersive) and Spartan (Newbie-Action). I would definitely suggest to play on Survivor Ranger Hardcore if you want a immersive Game.\n\nSo in general if you already played through 2033 its no must have, but especially the improved Stealth-system is really nice. I had huge problems with Stealth in the original 2033, so I doubt I would play through the original again.

One thing that stood out to me was the immersion ,from the realistic sounds ,to wiping my gas mask ,and topping it up with filters i have scavenged ,the transition from the metro to the surface is one of the greatest gaming experiences ,due to the sheer detail in which both areas have been constructed.... the contrast of these areas is enough to take ones breath.\n\nThe gun play is actually really satisfying ,and after playing many FPS ,simulator or not ,this excels at creating a feeling of power ,and realism to each and every gun (which are all unique). The customization is a great add on to the game ,it allows you to kit out your shooter to how you like it ,mostly between stealth ,long range or a more close and personal PDW.\n\nThe enemies in this game vary greatly ,from bandits to mutants to even the Nazis ,each and every one behaves differently leading to a somewhat challenging combat system ,if new to the gerne ,and even some veteran players could be caught off guard. The characters in this game haven't got too much back story ,but the development throughout the game keeps you questioning their beliefs ,and keeps you intrigued.\n\nI would recommend to anyone who likes the post apocalyptic  gerne ,with a little horror added to it along with good shooter aspects. wish i played the first metro 2033 before redux ,but if like me you haven't had the chance ,please get this game!\nThanks\n\nWould also recommend metro last light\nI am yet to read the books","January 15","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Metro 2033 was developed by 4A Games and published by THQ and after "Redux rebuild" by Deep Silver. Original game was released in 2010 and was a huge success, awarded with lots of high rated awards. In august 2014 developer released Redux versions for both Metro 2033 and its sequel Metro 2033: Last Light, featuring newest version of 4A Engine, with better graphics, new animations, lighting, gun handling, new AI mechanics and much more. Ratings:\n\nPros:\n+ Incredible story, based on bestseller novel Metro 2033\n+ Lots of gameplay detail and content\n+ Amazing graphics, especially with Redux rebuild\n+ Astonashing animations, which makes game even more realistic\n+ Two gameplay modes, depending what kind of gameplay you want\n+ Stealth option is amazing, especially after rebuild\n+ A lot of plot twists, amazing dialogs and sayings\n+ Achievement system ( i did all of them, and it actually forces you to finish\ngame at least two times in order to achieve them all\n\nCons:\n- I have noticed, that after Redux rebuild, kids have wrong voices, like some\nold lady would voice act them. ( only in English, Russian works fine )\n- At some points, enemy AI attacks you way more then other friendly AI's\n\nI simply had one of the best FPS single-player experiences while playing the game. It might have few flaws, but they are just so minor compared to what package this game brings. If you like that kind of games, you should definitely go for it. Seriously outstanding AAA game.

Overall, I recommend it.\n\nTo start with the bad, some NPCs you'll collide with, some you won't; monsters pop around and clip with everything; sometimes sound will be synced, sometimes not; flashlights shine through walls; guns don't feel very "punchy", kills are unsatisfying; child voices sound like adults obviously putting them on; night vision sometimes randomly turns on and off,  and will be stuck on through cinematic sequences.\n\nMy biggest complaint: no explanation whatsoever of what the mysterious (SPOILER ALERT) dark figures are, and yet they pretty much haunt you the entire duration of the game.\n\nTHE GOOD: you can clearly tell this game was based off a book because the writing is awesome, the story is immersive, it's what kept me going. The tunnels and stations are ambient, I loved listening to NPCs interact, the voice acting was good for the most part. The majority of the game you spend with at least one other companion, and it makes for less of a horror-like experience, which, to me, is a good thing. I appreciated a little company when having to traverse Moscow's mutant-ridden metro system.\n\nAnyway, decent game despite it's few issues, I recommend it!","January 17","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the reason to play the Game again are the Gameplay Improvement 2033 got from Last Light: The Weapon-Upgrade- and Stealth-system is now like it was in Last Light, which is a huge improvement the Original 2033.\n\nThey also changed the Difficulty System: Before you choose your actual Difficulty (Hardcore, Hardcore Ranger etc.) you can choose between Survivor (Immersive) and Spartan (Newbie-Action). I would definitely suggest to play on Survivor Ranger Hardcore if you want a immersive Game.\n\nSo in general if you already played through 2033 its no must have, but especially the improved Stealth-system is really nice. I had huge problems with Stealth in the original 2033, so I doubt I would play through the original again. But if you get it cheap in a Sale, I'd definitely recommend it.\n","February 23","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I usually detest the idea of re-releases because many are obvious ploys to make additional money on a product that usually has changed very little from the original, I can honestly say that Redux is a huge improvement.  The graphics are beautifully enhanced (less pixelated, more colorful and detailed than before), improving the game's immersive quality. Also, there is now seamless, even-handed progression in quality from Metro 2033 Redux to Metro: Last Light Redux, so that they're more like chapters of the same book rather than first outing and sequel.","November 26, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One thing that stood out to me was the immersion ,from the realistic sounds ,to wiping my gas mask ,and topping it up with filters i have scavenged ,the transition from the metro to the surface is one of the greatest gaming experiences ,due to the sheer detail in which both areas have been constructed.... the contrast of these areas is enough to take ones breath.\n\nThe gun play is actually really satisfying ,and after playing many FPS ,simulator or not ,this excels at creating a feeling of power ,and realism to each and every gun (which are all unique). The customization is a great add on to the game ,it allows you to kit out your shooter to how you like it ,mostly between stealth ,long range or a more close and personal PDW.\n\nThe enemies in this game vary greatly ,from bandits to mutants to even the Nazis ,each and every one behaves differently leading to a somewhat challenging combat system ,if new to the gerne ,and even some veteran players could be caught off guard. The characters in this game haven't got too much back story ,but the development throughout the game keeps you questioning their beliefs ,and keeps you intrigued.\n\nI would recommend to anyone who likes the post apocalyptic  gerne ,with a little horror added to it along with good shooter aspects. wish i played the first metro 2033 before redux ,but if like me you haven't had the chance ,please get this game!\nThanks\n\nWould also recommend metro last light\nI am yet to read the books","January 15","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game made me feel human, feel more than vunerable, but attactched to these people's sorrows. Too many games make you feel like on giant set peice moving on a restricted path. But this path is a journey, a journey which took me far past the rails and glowing mushrooms, the frusterating librarians and decrepit abandoned Moscow buildings. Through Artyom's eyes we experience a journey from a small station to the end of the line. All throughout is a masterfully spun narrative, where humanity itself is put on a stage, mostly, man's inhumanity to man.\n\nBut there is a light, a silver lining, will you be that light? Charging your flashlight with a homemade fool's charger and stumbling into deep pits of disgusting teleporting water.

Had the original on the 360 and although visually its not a big difference they have added parts that weren't in the original and features and weapons from Last Light. Could've done with a slight tutorial though as I had no idea they changed a few controls and how certain things did things. There's a fair few bugs as well, got a different one every time I started the game up. Nearly encountered a game stopping bug and had to restart the chapter.

"the library" THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! Don't forget to get yourself Last Light too to complete the story since this one only handles half of it. if you just wanna try it out go with this one since it's story feels completed enough to be a title on it's own. i've gotten all the achievements for this game. So basically what that means is that i loved this game so much i decided to unlock all of them. there is some gun customization in the game for those whom like a bit more from the weapon system and stealth play is one of the best fps stealth play i've seen so far. if your looking for a open world game this is not Crysis 1 or far cry. This game is pretty straight forward when it comes to combat (Stealth/Attack head on/Bit of both). If you like Games with ATMOSPHERE this is one of them. if you don't like spiders i reccomend you stay away since the redux version has spider bugs.

I played it on the slightly harder mode my first time through and it took me ~15H to beat. I can't wait to start Metro: Last Light (Redux) now!!! 9.4/10!\n\nPros\n=====\n-Good story\n-Atmospheric\n-Multiple Enemy types where some are not so wise to shoot (keeping it spoiler-free! :])\n-Ammo conservation for realistic survivalism\n-You're alway kept busy whether it's shooting mutants, watching your back, reloading your weapon, cycling through grenade types/knives or wiping blood and dirt off your gas mask (very cool in my opinion! I wish more developers would incorporate these effects!)\n-P + NPC vs E (Mutant/Bandits) Teamplay\n-Weapon Trading System was not too complex (Although if they incorporated armour that would be even better! :D)\n\nCons\n=====\n-You always get the feeling like you're coming back to where you started (Your lifeline is holding "M" which will give you a nav point. This game may have taken me ~2H less if I knew that...)\n-Some parts are not so straight forward (Ex: You're in the tunnels and you need to burn the cobwebs to proceed - I had to YouTube the answer. The game will not always spoonfeed you the answer)\n-The use of gas mask filters is both a positive and negative - It's cool that you need to replace your filters to mimic realistic filter replacement... However, when you're down to about a minute and the game autosaved then you're frantically running around either trying to find more or beat the level - There was one level that took me over 4 hours because I got lost in a building and had to be on the other side of it. The game had saved and I had to remember about 6-7 turns and drops then wedge myself in a crack in the floor in order to get to the near end of the level. Then I had to fight 12 guys with basically no filter. I barely beat the guys when my filter had run out and I had to make a mad dash to the exit, I could've sworn I had less than 3 seconds before I died :/)","March 6","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are looking for an atmospheric game, great buy it, and if you are looking for a good FPS it's a great buy.\n\nBTW, there's no multiplayer in the game. Also, I'll update the rewiew as i play more of the game.","May 15","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My black cat sitting on my desk, watched as I crawled through black tunnels and stealthily made my way around enemy's. The story griped me as the hours ticked by and the plot became more then what I set out for. As the evening became early morning and my cat long since stalked off to sleep, I prowled the metro in search for the answers I needed to save my people.\n\nI was afraid of every turn I took and jumped at every flickering shadow. The music played a haunting melody that only served to heighten the tension as I sat there in the dark, struggling to go on. I shivered in fear as I moved from tunnel to tunnel, alone with only my thoughts to ward off the terrors the lurked always just out of sight. The few times that I was blessed to have companionship, didn't last long as the evil of the metro always saw fit to take these brave souls away. Leaving me alone, weary, and sad for the loss of such good men.\n\nI knew that my journey would be a lonely one filled with fear as well as terrified excitement. The metro is never a safe place and much of what dwells in its dark places wish only to see you dead. Only your wits, courage, and gun will serve to see you through this hellish landscape of a long forgotten time.\n\nI sit alone in the dark now, trying not to shiver. I listen to the howls as they echo from deeper in the tunnels. I know I have to move but I am so tired..., So cold. Their getting closer, the howling. I ready my rifle and take a firm grip as I was taught so long ago. Is this where my journey ends, after I came so far, is this my time? The flame from my light starts the flicker and die as i prepare myself for the same. After all, it's what they've been waiting for....","May 31","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The result of said war left the surface a iradiated ♥♥♥♥-hole, and left anyone that survived in metro tunnels, thus the name. During the game you will experience ammo shortages, mutated beast packs, and radiation on the surface that you need to keep getting filters for your mask to deal with. The programmers even went out of their way to make small details that make it badass, such as, wiping your mask when it gets covered in blood, and a stealth mechanic. They then made it so that instead of dollars, you buy weapons (that are completely upgradable) with military-grade ammunition, these bullets can also be used in a fight, they do more damage than normal bullets. (badass mechanic) Then they made the world dark as ♥♥♥♥, (The Witcher level) there are mass graves, plagues, dying children, hookers, drunks (sometimes abusive), and other things of that nature.\n\nAlthough there are a few problems too. For one, the protagonist is completely silent (except for loading screens), so you are left with people asking you something and they get no answer whatsoever. Lore is not really explained in detail, but it is there. Some enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing sacks of ♥♥♥♥. (Demons, they pick you up and throw you down nonstop, and they are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to kill)\n\nOther than those minor reasons, the game is perfect.\n9/10 BUY IT","April 8","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bought 2033 when both were on sale, and din't buy last light as I usually never finish one game in series like this. I play it a bit then stop to forget about it. Metro's storyline had me hooked for more and to learn Artyom's fate. I can't say how it compared to the original, but I can say this is definitly better than call of duty.\n\nOne gripe I personally had was some of the sneak parts. There were times where I had zero clue where to go, and kept suicidally running around and dying just to figure out where the game intended for me to go. In the library, I guess I missed a discussion about the librarians, and had no clue what I was meant to do about them until I went online for answers, and found out that they were heavily buffed in the redux making them virtually unkillable. It's sneak or die.\n\nI don't mind some covert ops, but I really don't personally enjoy difficult covert missions. I was more of a fan of the shooting and killing aspect, which was good. In this game, you're able to sneakily take out enemies without alerting the rest, but an AI may grow susicous of their lost comdrade and investigate. Pretty decent AI. Not perfect but not the worst I've seen.\n\nI can't stress enough though, this game is all about the storyline. People can argue over the graphics or the difference in gameplay all day, but no one complains about the story.","December 20, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The levels have been expanded with a few new areas to explore, the AI seems to be improved at least to the Last Light level, if not more, and on Ranger Hardcore, the game seems a bit more difficult, though that might just be my own fault. Many of the maps have been cut together into longer maps with less loading screens in between, helping your immersion greatly.\nAs of 3.9.2014, there is some minor (and at one point of the game, somewhat major) texture glitching.

Yay. I actually completely forgot to do it, and I feel pretty bad now. I am a huge fan of the Metro games, enough to have earned all their Achievements (yeah, I know, but it's more for me proving my love for their games - not to show off) and played them all through on Ranger Hardcore of course. So here it is, my opinion on how the Redux compares to its original version, Metro 2033...\n\nYeah, it's good. Visually changed to look more consistent with the style of Last Light (Redux or no), superior optimization on all accounts, replaced all animations on the main character/weapons, and so on. It's also taking away some of the complexity of 2033's stealth rules, while also adding some Last Light monsters and levels, and there's plenty of 'ironing out the rough edges' thing going on here.\n\nSo yeah, I absolutely love the Redux version. It's way superior, to me, over the original. But it's still the same game, so many of the owners of the original has very little incentive to actually get it. Recommend this mostly to new, fresh players out there. Don't forget your air filters!","September 24, 2014","true","26.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything about this game it utterly gorgeous; from the dark and claustrophobic metro tunnels to the eerily beautiful post-apocalyptic streets of Moscow. Even the guns have a fantastic level of detail to them making them each unique and the level of customization they give you for them is awesome as well.\n\nWhat stood out the most to me was just how deeply engaging this game was and it was all from the small details like being able to wipe blood or water from your gas mask, or it becoming visibly damaged throughout combat and the need to change the filter. Need to see how much time is left on your current filter? Glance at your watch. Need to figure out which direction you’re supposed to be heading? Check the small compass in the top corner of your journal compass. Is your flashlight dying? Better give it a quick charge with your portable charger. I love it.\n\nThe combat, while enjoyable can become a bit dull, some enemies are essentially bullet sponges and in a game where ammo is scarce and also works as your primary currency this was very annoying. You will fight humans and mutants alike and that’s where I have to nitpick a bit, like where did these mutants come from? And if they evolved from another creature what one was it because this looks nothing like anything that was ever alive on earth and even still how did it come to evolve in such a short time after the nuclear winter began? It’s a small, mostly unimportant detail but it bothered me.\n\nAll in all this game was great and I would suggest it to anyone looking for more depth from a first person shooter or anyone who’s crazy for survival style games. I would also highly suggest using the Russian voiceover with subtitles because the English voice acting was terrible.","September 6, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game starts out as you playing a silent protagonist named Artyom.  In this world, Moscow has been severely bombed and the surface world is no longer suitable for human habitation, the only reason you are alive is due to being underground in the Metro at the time of the bombing.  Artyom since he was a young boy, all he’s known is living underground and protecting his home from the various trials and tribulations that this new stark world throws at them daily.\n\nThe main plot is that Artyom is tasked with trekking through the Metro system to contact the Rangers to warn them of the oncoming Dark Ones threat rapidly approaching his home station, Exhibition.  The main focus of the game is survival horror/shooter but has an amazing narrative and plenty of colorful npcs and situations that really flesh out the story.  Right from the get go, you learn that life in the Metro is very different from what the surface world once was.  Most things are scarce in the story, food consists mostly of what little livestock that had before the bombing, supplemented with the strange glowing mushrooms that grow within the tunnels.  In addition to this harsh and downtrodden life people hardly eek out, the currency in the Metro is military grade ammunition and is used for all purchases the player will make.  These purchases consist of guns, customizable attachments, bombs, knives, med-packs and air filters.\n\nThe main obstacle Artyom has to overcome is the mutated wild life in and outside of the tunnels, but the game sprinkles in bandits, Communists and Nazis factions to mix things up.  To get the full ride from this game, I highly recommend you play on survival mode, which will limit all materials you find and make your decisions have all the more impact on your continued living.  You’ll quickly appreciate the stealth kills when your ammo, bombs and med-packs are running low.  Survival mode keeps the game challenging and making you want to keep pushing through these harsh environments with a relative haste and not waste attitude.\n\nOne of the few discrepancies I had with that game is that they never explain the watch that is on Artyoms’ left wrist.  It is an indicator of several things all at once, the blue light on the side tells you if you are completely in darkness and if anything can see you.  The most vital of the functions is it will start beeping when you are standing in a radiation hot zone and you need to rush out of there.  And finally if you pay attention to the hands, it will let you know how much time you have left on your gas mask filter but the game usually prompts you with a message and an easily identifiable set of sounds when it’s time regardless.  I just wish that would have been in the initial tutorial, but as far as complaints go that’s pretty minor.\n\nBottom line, this is truly a great game, I enjoyed all 10 hours of it and plan on doing multiple play-throughs.  Quality-wise I would rank it right up there with Farcry, Bioshock and Borderlands.  Hopefully that is an indication if you would like it.\n\n8.5/10","September 26, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLD98/recommended/286690/","TLD98","Quel'Thalas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLD98/","39 products in account","Veterans of the original version of Metro 2033 will notice a change in how the game starts. Before you pick your difficulty, you pick the way you want to play the game. Will you pick Survival, which will require players to conserve ammo, utilize stealth, and pick and choose when to fight or flee? Or will you pick Spartan, which is more akin to the action style of Metro: Last Light? The ability to pick between Survival and Spartan is included in both of the Metro: Redux titles, and each play out very differently. Not wanting to risk compromising the dark thrill of the first time I played Metro 2033, I opted for Survival and though I was also tempted to go with the hardest difficulty available I passed it up for the normal difficulty instead.\nSo here I was, once more taking that first climb into the outside world. Or rather, first from the gameplay perspective. You see, Metro 2033 actually begins at a climactic moment in the story and then in a flash the main character Artyom retells the story, and as such you relive it from his perspective. That first scene really helps set the stage and the gut wrenching feeling of the troubles that wait ahead. The story remains as superb today as it was in 2010 as it successfully combines the horrors of war with the supernatural and paranormal sprinkled in just enough to add another layer of tension. However with Metro: Last Light showing us what the canon ending is, returning players may feel inclined not to make same the choices for what - at the time - seemed like the "good" ending.\nThe first thing I noticed other than the graphical enhancements, were the controls. I'm not sure if it is all in my head or if the controls are honestly much more polished than they once were, but I went from a game where I died more often to accidental falls or overextended movements to something that controlled as crisp and precise as other shooters. Firing from the hip was actually a viable option this time around, whereas in the past you'd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn without aiming down your sights.\nAnother thing substantially improved is the friendly AI. I cannot express how many times in the original I died because of failures of the AI. In games like Call of Duty, the AI is intentionally made useless so that the player can feel like a hero, but that same thought process doesn't transfer over well if it is one of several parts where you have to fight tooth and nail for survival. In the original game, you'd be lucky if your comrades could even kill a single enemy. Now, they still let you do most of the work but they are actually helpful in situations that would otherwise be frustrating to the point of pulling your hair out.\nHopping back and forth between the games to compare the graphics across all settings, the game looks better across the board. Of course this means that if your current PC struggled with the original version of Metro 2033 you're going to have to sit this one out. Character models and environment textures have been majorly improved, offering an intense, almost real display of a downtrodden society that dwells beneath the surface. In the above-ground segments, however, the appearances of humans takes a slight hit. The beautiful display of life in the tunnels of the Moscow metro was already amazing just a few years ago, but now that beauty has increased tenfold.\nWhile the visuals have been majorly updated and the gameplay itself feels more polished, it seems as if all of the original dialogue audio was left the same. Not that this is a bad thing mind you, but I have a pet peeve when I encounter enemies in the game that are supposed to be of an entirely different nationality using Russian accents as though it's just business as usual. Other than that, the voice work was great then and it's mostly a good decision to have kept it as is.\nMetro 2033 Redux has taken the original title and increased the quality to such heights that it was like playing a completely different game. Amazing graphics, refined and tweaked gameplay... it all makes for a much smoother experience. There are no sacrifices of the good of the original but it does successfully eliminate the bad - this is how remakes should be. Whether you have played the original or not, this is a game for anyone seeking atmosphere, story, and FPS gameplay blended into something amazing. Do not miss this experience.","October 18, 2015","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game starts out as you playing a silent protagonist named Artyom.  In this world, Moscow has been severely bombed and the surface world is no longer suitable for human habitation, the only reason you are alive is due to being underground in the Metro at the time of the bombing.  Artyom since he was a young boy, all he’s known is living underground and protecting his home from the various trials and tribulations that this new stark world throws at them daily.\n\nThe main plot is that Artyom is tasked with trekking through the Metro system to contact the Rangers to warn them of the oncoming Dark Ones threat rapidly approaching his home station, Exhibition.  The main focus of the game is survival horror/shooter but has an amazing narrative and plenty of colorful npcs and situations that really flesh out the story.  Right from the get go, you learn that life in the Metro is very different from what the surface world once was.  Most things are scarce in the story, food consists mostly of what little livestock that had before the bombing, supplemented with the strange glowing mushrooms that grow within the tunnels.  In addition to this harsh and downtrodden life people hardly eek out, the currency in the Metro is military grade ammunition and is used for all purchases the player will make.  These purchases consist of guns, customizable attachments, bombs, knives, med-packs and air filters.\n\nThe main obstacle Artyom has to overcome is the mutated wild life in and outside of the tunnels, but the game sprinkles in bandits, Communists and Nazis factions to mix things up.  To get the full ride from this game, I highly recommend you play on survival mode, which will limit all materials you find and make your decisions have all the more impact on your continued living.  You’ll quickly appreciate the stealth kills when your ammo, bombs and med-packs are running low.  Survival mode keeps the game challenging and making you want to keep pushing through these harsh environments with a relative haste and not waste attitude.\n\nOne of the few discrepancies I had with that game is that they never explain the watch that is on Artyoms’ left wrist.  It is an indicator of several things all at once, the blue light on the side tells you if you are completely in darkness and if anything can see you.  The most vital of the functions is it will start beeping when you are standing in a radiation hot zone and you need to rush out of there.  And finally if you pay attention to the hands, it will let you know how much time you have left on your gas mask filter but the game usually prompts you with a message and an easily identifiable set of sounds when it’s time regardless.  I just wish that would have been in the initial tutorial, but as far as complaints go that’s pretty minor.\n\nBottom line, this is truly a great game, I enjoyed all 10 hours of it and plan on doing multiple play-throughs.  Quality-wise I would rank it right up there with Farcry, Bioshock and Borderlands.  Hopefully that is an indication if you would like it.\n\n8.5/10","September 26, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Playstyles are totally different depending on the enemy type. Humans its best to stealth and you are encouraged to conserve ammo which you need on the mutants which offer a more survival shooting experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AfroAmericanYoshi/recommended/286690/","AfroAmericanYoshi","Black Yoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AfroAmericanYoshi/","160 products in account","I like the Steam Controller.  Not that I, myself, have used it yet.  But I do love it because it spawned a mini-game sale in celebration of its release!  I managed to pick up Metro 2033, Metro Last Light and Spec Ops: The Line with it, because I've heard nothing but good things about these games.\n\nSadly, this game may have had some overexaggerated praise.\n\nThe intro sequence is so confusing, I legitimately thought I had somehow skipped forward into quite far into the story.  But no, of course.  How could I not see it doing the whole "8 Days Earlier" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when some spooky ♥♥♥♥ rapes the protagonist.\n\nThis game's voice acting is attrocious.  Seriously, it's ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.  For example: "AG EET" "hej, wot wohz zet :o" "SIR GAY!  CHKAV YOU SINE MY SIR GAY?"  The Russian children probably have the WORST voice acting, I contracted PTSD off of it.  It doesn't feel like anyone gave a ♥♥♥♥ about the script either.  "Don't step into the water or you'll get irradiated and ♥♥♥♥."  He didn't even say it in any urgency, he said it casually as if he's watching a friend play Super Mario Bros for the first time saying "Dont fall into holes or you'll die an' ♥♥♥♥."\n\nSound design's utter wank, too.  Stock sound effects of things like punching and a Revolver firing.\n\nAKA:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2zmd53VRdg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdGzw2TnqO8\n\nAnd this game is SO ♥♥♥♥ING LINEAR.  Around 80% of my "playthrough" consisted of dark corridors following annoying side-characters to do some ♥♥♥♥, then follow some other guy to do some other ♥♥♥♥.  And if you don't keep up, they repeat the same lines.  "Hey, where are you?"  "Hey, where are you?"  "Hey, where are you?"  It was such a painful experience, I shudder to believe how even Call of Duty: Ghosts does better!  And Call of Duty: Ghosts was a boring pile of dogturd!\n\nThe mutants seem overly bullet spongey too.  It takes 3-4 shots point blank ADVERAGE to kill a walrus-rat with a shotgun and I often found myself starving for ammo very often.  The enounters with human enemies were the ONLY parts where the gunplay felt good because they WEREN'T bullet sponges.\n\nThe graphics look AMAZING however.  Even the dark corridors look extremely detailed.  The game looks at its best when you're on the surface.  All the ruined buildings covered by a thick layer of Nuclear Winter are eye candy.\n\nWait, I just realised something.  What's the story?  I know there was nukes or something and the populus of Moscow retreated into and inhabited the underground metro systems but WHY does Artyom, the protagonist, go around the metro killing ♥♥♥♥ and following annoying side-characters?  WHY are there these supernatural beings roaming around the place giving everyone nightmares?  WHAT are the Mutants mutations of?  They look like giant Walrus-Rats!\n\nOf course I can't ignore any of the bugs either.  Now, I didn't experience MANY bugs, but the few I came across broke the immersion of the beautiful world and actually ended up breaking the game.\n\nFor example, this is apparently what Artyom looks like; a spooky skeleton: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556462046\n\nNow for the issue that broke the game.  Me and my side-character tour guide bloke face was rambling through the tunnels with me and we enter a train carriage.  He then tells me to "Concentrate" and then I hear a child say "Mom, where are you?".  I saw the silhouette of the child, but he just stood there doing absolutely nothing.  I turn around to my tour guide and it seems he got possessed by the spirit of the child or something, because he was staring through the cobwebs at the back of the carriage for a good 15 minutes.\n\nIt was at that point I gave up and uninstalled the game.\n\nTL;DR: Like broken, linear, horribly voiced and horribly scripted tours through the metro systems of Moscow?  Get this game.  I for one, don't, therefore I do NOT reccomend this game.\n\n4/10.\n\nEdit: Fanboys are so much fun.  So easy to ♥♥♥♥ off ;)","November 16, 2015","false","5.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","2"

It has many improvements over the original game especially to ranger mode. You can check your inventory using your journal now, and important decisions do have hud overlays to make sure you don't accidentally click the wrong button. As for the graphical improvements, Metro 2033 Redux runs a lot better than the original, and also looks a lot better. The visual fidelity has been lifted up quite a bit, and many of the small gripes with the original game are now gone. The only issues I have had so far is that the game uses Last Light's AI and Stealth system. This sometimes does not fit very well, but that really only applies to one level. The rest of the levels work very well with the new system. If you've never played the Metro series before, I would recommend you start with the redux version if you can afford it. Both games are great, and will provide you with the same experience.","August 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Being able to check how much ammunition you have remaining only makes sense; certainly I'd be keeping inventory if I was in such a dire situation.\n\nI wish that subtitles were implemented for the idle chatter in the metro, instead of only main characters and some minor dialogue. I prefer to play the game with the Russian audio and English subtitles, seems to me more authentic that way, but not being able to read the speech of the random citizens is rather dissapointing.\n\nOverall, not bad.

Sometimes you'll kill for example a watchmen with one blast from your shotgun yet at the exact same range another might take 5-6 shells for no apparent reason.\n*Being thrown into the world geomatry, i.e after being picked up by a demon and being unable to move and again suffocating to death as artyom refuses to equip his mask despite not even taking it off bizzarely.\n\nSome users have also been reporting more serious issues like the game crahing after starting a new game or having their save files wiped.

Button prompts never displayed on-screen which is a minor negative for someone's first playthrough, mostly because of the game's few quicktime-events. Metro practically drips with, almost tangible, atmosphere probably more than any other game that comes to mind. From the wholy realistic and creative selection of guns, the gasmask you have to manually put on when you enter areas, humans, can't cope with the air or lack there-of while you're wrist-watch tells you how long before you need to manually replace a new filter, of course you don't really need the watch since Artyom starts breathing raggedly when the currently equiped filter is used up. These filters can be found spread out over the game, so the game encourages you to search every nook and crany for every scrap of accessories. The filters don't last forever, obviously, so the sense of urgency can easily be felt, again, making the atmosphere almost tangible.\n\nI loved Metro -2033-. If the story was better presented and the pacing of the game better balanced I would probably give it top marks. A feat I rarely recognize these days.

Far from it. There is simply no other way to enjoy this, admittedly already great, game. It would be wrong to even say that the biggest improvement over the original game is the visuals--though they are significantly better. The Redux version has a vastly improved stealth-combat system which makes playing as a 'ranger' with little ammo much more entertaining. Additionally, if you have a PC that can handle most of the games coming out these days, you will find there is a shocking performance improvement from the original game. Gone are most of the frame-skips which plagued combat and movement in the original game, it runs far smoother just as you may have experienced playing Last Light. I would assume Nvidia players will also experience even better visuals and particle effects with PhyX, but I cannot comment on that, owning an AMD card myself.\n\nI must also disagree with those reviewers who have said the emphasis on lighting in the visual improvements makes the game less scary. For one, games are never quite as scary the second time round or thereafter. But more importantly, Metro was never scary for its abundance of pitch-black places. You always have a flashlight available within a second or two even if it needs recharging. The atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic Moscow Metro made the game 'scary' and gave it the mood so loved by the fans--the Redux's visuals only add to the level of immersion and therefore help to build the franchise's unique atmosphere. As somebody who has also read and very much enjoyed the novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, I can also say that the contents of Artyom's 'notes' and a few other features in the game actually bring it much more in-line with the progress of the novel.\n\nIn short, the Metro franchise has become one of, if not *the* best FPS franchise on the market currently. Metro 2033 Redux brings to the original game the polish of Last Light while still maintaining so much of the atmosphere that made it seem the better game of the two. Now there is no doubt which of the two is superior.

It has many improvements over the original game especially to ranger mode. You can check your inventory using your journal now, and important decisions do have hud overlays to make sure you don't accidentally click the wrong button. As for the graphical improvements, Metro 2033 Redux runs a lot better than the original, and also looks a lot better. The visual fidelity has been lifted up quite a bit, and many of the small gripes with the original game are now gone. The only issues I have had so far is that the game uses Last Light's AI and Stealth system. This sometimes does not fit very well, but that really only applies to one level. The rest of the levels work very well with the new system. If you've never played the Metro series before, I would recommend you start with the redux version if you can afford it. Both games are great, and will provide you with the same experience.","August 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This means that the gunplay is somewhat different, perhaps a bit more casualized if you will, and the stealth is also simplified like in Last Light. The stealth in Metro 2033: Redux is arguably way too easy since it's just a binary system, you're either not visible at all, or totally visible. So if you played Last Light, it's basically the exact same stealth system.\n\nIn fact, the whole entire Redux seems to kind of scrap anything distinctive about Metro 2033 and just uses Last Light assets, gameplay, art style, etc. Which is totally fine, as it is a Redux and it provides a significantly different experience from the original game.  I really liked some of the added in secret areas and the few extended places in levels as well.\n\nOverall, Metro 2033: Redux is pretty decent and if you prefer Last Light's gameplay over 2033's, this is the version of the game to play since it's basically identical to Last Light except for the fact that it's a different premise with different levels and a different story.","August 29, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Being able to check how much ammunition you have remaining only makes sense; certainly I'd be keeping inventory if I was in such a dire situation.\n\nI wish that subtitles were implemented for the idle chatter in the metro, instead of only main characters and some minor dialogue. I prefer to play the game with the Russian audio and English subtitles, seems to me more authentic that way, but not being able to read the speech of the random citizens is rather dissapointing.\n\nOverall, not bad.

I tried playing it once a few months ago and found it difficult to get into for some reason - it just irritated me and I found the controls clunky.\n\nI tried again more recently and it was more enjoyable, once I'd played with the key bindings and been a bit more patient with the game.\n\nThe graphics are certainly very good.  The audio is a mixed bag - this is one of the few times that I've had to turn subtitles on in a game, because the dialogue is often impossible to hear clearly; even when standing a short distance from other characters.  The music is forgettable and certainly doesn't really add to the atmosphere very much.  The setting itself though is intriguing and well-realised and it's refreshing to see a game set in an unusual (i.e. non-American) locale.  I don't understand why Artyom is a silent protagonist in-game though when he narrates the loading screens - there aren't that many instances where it's really noticeable, but it seems like an odd decision.\n\nThe combat mechanics are pretty decent though I found my gun auto-aiming for me at times (certainly not reliably, so I didn't find very useful - if they're going to insist on auto-aim, then at least make it work properly) and I couldn't find a setting to turn that off, which was frustrating. The level design varies considerably from "extremely good" to "frustratingly obtuse".  Considering that it's a fairly linear game, it was disappointing to have to resort to online walkthroughs on more than one occasion because it was entirely unclear where to go next.\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of the game however is just how buggy it is.  I'm running a reasonably high-end gaming rig and experienced crashes.  Crashes to desktop.  Crashes to black.  Crashes when exiting a level.  Crashes when loading.  Crashes at the opening menu.  Total system lock-ups on more than one occasion, necessitating a hard reset.  The game randomly unbound every single keyboard command once for fun, requiring me to edit a configuration file manually to be able to use the ESC key to pause the game.  The mouse sometimes doesn't seem to stay bound to my main monitor when in game either, so sometimes firing a weapon would instead cause the game to minimise to the desktop, believing that I suddenly wanted to read an e-mail in Outlook on my other screen (I did not).\n\nAll-in-all, I can't recommend the game in its current state.  I certainly don't think it deserves the level of praise that it receives.  It is decent, sometimes even very good, but it is not an instant classic by any means and the repeated issues with the game's stability come close to ruining the experience.","June 19, 2015","false","20.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

However, the appearances are pretty much where the quality ends and the true horror begins. A game with limited ammo and powerful enemies in an irradiated wasteland? I'll take STALKER over this any day. The primary reason? It comes back to limited ammo. A game with very limited ammo where your enemies soak up bullets like a sponge has prevented me from being able to enjoy this game. I have yet to finish, and I don't think I ever will, but I got as far as the nosalise tunnel where you have to plant the bomb. At that point the mutants had hungrily devoured every last one of my bullets and were screaming for more, calling forth an angry and infinite horde of their brethren who were just waiting to tear my throat out. And they did. Repeatedly. I really wanted to like this game, its story seems great, but the gameplay leaves so much to be desired that I just can't bring myself to finish it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/recommended/286690/","XavierCrow","FissionChip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/","213 products in account","This has probably been my worst purchase experience yet. Not only did I buy this (and the original Metro that I decided to hold off playing for Redux) but it was bundled with Last Light so I can't get a refund on that now. I wouldn't care, but I feel bad about giving money to a company who apparently don't test their games. So far I've played 10 hours, about 2 or 3 of those were probably spent on the internet trying to make sense of the insane frame stuttering I was getting, the various bugs like invisible obstacles and staircases, the knife not hitting its target, seemingly random enemy awareness, and the stuff the game decides not to tell you about, like burning spider webs with your lighter (though that might be due to playing on Ranger Survival whatever mode, but the game says it's the way it should be played and I'm not going to play through every game twice with my current backlog. Seriously, we're not playing on hardcore, just throw us a quick message.)\n\nFrom what I've read, the mutants in original Metro were easy and not quite as bulletproof, but in Redux it seems to be pretty random. Sometimes they die instantly, other times they'll shrug off your point-blank shotgun blast to the face and continue to murderlize you in a swipe or two. The mutants will completely ignore all the allies between you and clip through several NPCs to get to you. Often your allies will just stand there like idiots while you're mauled to death. It just seems to be fairly random whether you get through a wave without a scratch or without a head.\n\nThere are weird choices throughout the game too. Like the difficulty settings, where enemies take more hits on Easy than on Normal. There's also no quicksave functionality, which I guess is to increase the fear-factor but I could see that being annoying, what if you have to quit unexpectedly? There's a part with never-ending enemies, which strikes me as a bit stupid in a game where resources are so scarce... but it's okay because the enemies sort of ignore you for that bit because reasons (everything feels a bit scripted in this game). Then there's immersion stuff, like there's a revolving shotgun with a neat mechanic, where you can only load 4 rounds at first until you fire it, causing it to revolve and free up two spaces that were blocked by the gun body itself, which you can then load giving you 6 rounds total -- that's cool! But when you reload the revolver, you just ♥♥♥♥ all the bullets onto the ground like "whatevs!" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  In a world where ammo is so precious it's currency.\n\nWhich is yet another unfortunate choice! Certain ammo can also be used to buy stuff, and stuff is expensive! You can swap between currency and regular ammo in your automatics, but not your other guns, but the game doesn't tell you how and its not written in the options, so you either avoid using the automatics or accidentally waste all your money. I realise it's based on a novel, but its implementation in the game seems confused.\n\nIt's a shame too because the atmosphere is great, and I found the combat against human enemies to be really fun (at least they respond to being shot!) but as soon as I start to enjoy myself, some BS comes along; either a bug, or a wave battle where I die repeatedly, or a rail shooting bit which are just a ♥♥♥♥♥ier form of wave, or I get stuck on "nothing" when trying to escape, or there's a group of enemies spawned in a previously cleared area, etc etc\n\n...I'm writing this review now as I wait around for my torch batteries to die out. Why? Because if you wear your night vision goggles at the end of the mission in which you find them, the game will force you to wear them for every scripted event for the rest of the game! (according to some, even during death sequences the character will put on the goggles before being dragged to his doom!) It just so happens the first event of the next mission is a literal rail-shooter, where it's dark and every enemy has bright torches shining in your face, which when you're wearing night vision goggles makes you COMPLETELY EFFING BLIND! Your only option is to shoot sort-of-kind-of at the lights and hope to hit anything and not get blown up by... something (I'm told it's a tank, but I can't see anything!)... but then your gun over-heats or runs out of ammo or something and you just have to wait until you're blown up by, again... "something".\n\nI can't recommend this game.","July 31, 2015","false","12.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","6"

Let's get the good stuff out of the way first, I mostly liked the world. While the whole communist vs. fourth Reich stuff was ridiculously stupid and the monster designs are pretty uninspired, the setting itself is pretty cool and there are some really great locations to fight in. Game looks pretty decent, too bad animations and really creepy faces are dragging the overall impression down, Story was weird but somewhat engaging and I am very fond of all the surreal, trippy bits. One cannot deny that all of this has a lot of potential …\n\n… and then you play the game, and it's just awful. Controls are rather finnicky, aiming and/or hitting anything is frustrating as hell since you gotta be REALLY precise - and ammo is sparse, so you better make every shot count. The survival/exploration aspect feels tacked on and poorly implemented - especially in combination with an enormous amount of invisible walls. Getting stuck in the crap that is littered around the maps forced me to replay checkpoints many times - gameplay often consists of knowing how/what to trigger and the best course of action for a lot of scenes seems to be to just run to the next checkpoint and then reload from there. Talking about checkpoints, this game seems like a good candidate for a quicksave/quickload-implementation since everything can go SNAFU in no time. Unfortunately, the checkpoint-system in use adds to the overall frustration - having to play certain bits (mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arena fights or heavily scripted stuff) is no fun at all. In the end, the actual gameplay/controls feel not rewarding at all. Hit-feedback is extremly poor and lacking, balancing seems to be all over the place and difficulty mostly gear-dependant, also fumbling with all the equipment and the whole gasmask-filter changing is really annoying and not much else.

Pros of the game: Very immersive. Fantastic visuals and graphics. Outstanding realism. Action is exciting. Cons of the game: It's very difficult in three different ways. The first way is the weak guns. Either I'm a lousy shot, I am using the wrong guns, or the guns are too weak for the mutants. Another difficulty is the lack of tutorials when it comes to inventory interfaces. It took me too long to figure out what was what. Lastly, I got ridiculously lost, and I have a great sense of direction. I've grown up playing tons of adventure games, and none of them have run me in as many circles as this game did.\n\nAnd the final dislike against this game is that, within at least the first four or five action scenes, you have to fight the same kind of mutant. It gets really old. Super Mario Bros. for NES had more enemies than this game does. I think this might be a game I'll play when my friends are at my house. Then when I get totally stumped, we can all be stumped together. I paid 17 bucks for this game. I don't feel swindled, but I feel like buying 17 candy bars may have been a better investment.","December 12, 2014","false","13.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It holds your hand for the few hours I played it constantly having a AI partner tagging along pacing your progress on scripted events. The sound design is emersive while hearing your character wheeze like a 30 year smoker was enough to make me not wanna play with headphones. The objectives aren't always clear and have mercy on your soul if you don't do them right because you'll be reloading that checkpoint before you actually know what you didn't do right. The graphics are great; especially for a little older game it mostly holds up fantastically with the exception of a few low res textures. The AI is really what killed it for me and made me stop playing. I played on hardcore which in most games is no problem for me but the AI is serioulsy all over the board ranging from deaf and dumb to Peter Parker. Sometimes they'll walk inches from you and be none the wiser, other times they'll sense your thoughts almost. It was more frustrating to play for me than Dark Souls 3 but maybe for others this will be right up their alley.

The stealth is terrible.  Once you are detected enemies find you immediately at times, and other times you can move about at will without being found.  The mutants cannot be stealthed, making that style of play obsolete.\n\nThe guns are terrible.  A BB gun is more powerful than a .44 mag?

The voice acting for Artyom while of a better quality, does lack the atmospheric feel the original had. Plus the children now sound like old women.\n\nThough even with the few issues, the graphical improvements and gameplay improvements that are there more than make up for it. Such as much better and more refined combat, better dynamic lighting, better textures in most areas, better physics engine, more areas and secrets to find, better A,I, much better performance than the original, and so on.\n\nIf you enjoy the original 2033 and felt it just needed more polish, then this is for you. If you have yet to experience 2033 and are curious about it, Redux is the best option for a first play. If you just couldn't run 2033 even on your powerful system and clamor for better optimisation, this is for you.\n\nAnother cool little feature as well, would be the option to change the playstyle. There's one option that has the more survival horror approach of the original and another that goes for a more action oriented game.\n\nOverall a wonderful remake that did much more than just update visuals, but basically everything else to a much better state.\n\nFor a remake, it gets an 8,5/10.

Having thoroughly enjoyed Last Light, I jumped at the chance to play the original Metro 2033 in a refined HD format.\n\nI was initially concerned that Metro 2033 Redux would be too far different than Last Light, as I had heard that 2033 was more of a survival-horror game and less of the creepy first-person-shooter that was Last Light. Luckily, upon loading a new game in Metro 2033 Redux you are not only given the option to choose difficulty (Normal, Hardcore, Ranger, Hardcore Ranger), but you are also allowed to choose whether you would like to play in "Survivor" mode (similar to the original 2033 experience) or "Spartan" mode (closer to the action-oriented Last Light).\n\nThis made me really happy because I absolutely loved Last Light and just wanted more of *that*.

For example, the original was based on particle effects, very fine-tuned lighting and the fact that people looked as greasy as everyone would become on shrooms and vodka. In Last Light they dropped most of the particles/lighting and replaced it with way more grass, props and increased textural complexity. Metro 2033 Redux doesn't do that - you get the simple look of Last Light but with what made it great. Feels more like Half Life 2 at times.\n\nGameplay and control wise, it seems like they took 70% of Last Light and 30% of the Original despite their rather distinct differences. Oh and the cutscenes seem to have changed a lot, too (imho worsened), along with a severe downgrade of Artyoms voice.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure why ANYONE should prefer this version over the original.

I managed to fix the issue by doing a bit of research. To cut the explanation short I'll say that the developers did a poor job optimising this game for multiple core CPUs. Ok I thought, with that out of the way I'll surely be able to enjoy the title. As it turned out, when a few hours into the game I started experiencing unexplainable game crashes and the odd "program not responding" messages here and there. Again tried fixing the problems by doing some research and digging which helped at first but quite quickly became a chore. At the end I had to uninstall the game because it would not run properly and crash randomly on me.\nAs much as I like the story and the "atmosphere" of the game, I cannot reccommend it due to the issues I had experienced.

The storyline was alright, but beyond that the game kind of fell flat.  The first 3rd of the game is very little actual shooting, which is pretty significant for a 10 hour game.  Most of the levels were really, really short.  Enemy AI was weak, as in very easy to avoid using stealth.  In other situations where stealth is not an option, the enemies tended to just be overwhelming as opposed to using any decent tactics etc.\n\nThe graphics and world were really well done and believable.  Like said before, the storyline was interesting.  I felt there just wasn't enough shooting for a shooter and the FPS mechanics and AI just weren't really well done compared to many other FPS's.

I'm impressed by how it turned out to be. Before I go on about this game, I have to say that I've played the Original version of this game too so I've played through it many times via console and PC. I've seen many game adaptations of books and most of them sucked, but this game I will remember the most. It was something so simple in the beginnning, you're Artyom, and a ranger named Hunter told you to deliver a message to a station known as Polis. Along the way, it becomes more than just that, you meet people and other stations and see what a post apocalyptic Moscow would be if everyone lived in what is known as the Metro (hence the name). I truly enjoyed the gameplay too since you can either shoot your way through or play it safe and be stealthy (I mostly stealthed). At the conclusion of my review, I have to say... buy this game- no buy the Metro Redux Bundle so you can play this game and Last Light (which I will make a review of later) if you haven't played the original versions. I definitely recommend it. 9.5/10\n\nMost people would ask, what's different between the Original and the Redux versions of 2033? Well, the most notable change is the engine, the game looks so much better (not to mention much needed stabilization for mid to low end computers) and brings features from Last Light into the mix like wiping your mask if it gets bloody. If you have never played the Original 2033 or you have played it, then I suggest picking up the Redux Version, it'll be worth playing through.","September 27, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First off, I would like to tell the people whining about how they should get this game for a bigger discount or even "free" to please go away. In life, nothing is free, and such is a case for the developers who had to work while attempting to move the company out of Ukrane due to the whole Russian/Ukranian conflict that was going on (not sure if it's still going on when writing this review). It's also note that Deep Silver would also say "HELL NO" if 4A studio decided to make it a free update as most game decisions are decided by the publishers as to whether the decision can be allowed to continue.\n\nAnyways, so knowing that people are reading this are people who beat Metro 2033 or interested in the game, is this version is worth it. My answer is yes. There are alot of reason I would highly suggest this version over the older version. The first thing is stability, and this is a huge reason. Let's be honest, the first game was pretty crap on being stable. The game felt limited by how extremely demanding the game is, even if higher video cards could get the 60 fps. Another reason to get this is the improved gameplay. Combat feels better in Redux and stealth is improved so that it works. The game also have bigger level by combining some levels together to decrease the load times.\n\nObviously, most people would thing this game only improvement is the visuals and while it's 50% of the improvement (having to move the engine to Last Light Engine), Holy ♥♥♥♥ is the visuals gorgious. The lighting is truely something to look through. Most people could make the argument that the original does have some aspect of visuals being better for astmospheric purpose and I'll agree, but it's a subjective thing.\n\nOverall, I hope people would just shut up about first world problems and try to accept the fact that the developers work extremely hard to make something enjoyable for people to play. Oh yea, and if people really want to get Metro 2033, I also suggest you do but the game can go really cheap these days to the point that I think Humble Bundle was giving the game out for free.","October 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That function is not in the game's engine, so let's say you like Far Cry 2 and onwards at least, then Metro 2033 is nothing like it. They simply have no idea how to make this first person shooter feel real. You cant do two things at the same time basically. Its an either or throughout the game.\n\n-----STEALTH:\nWhen you stealth, if you get caught (levels are btw usually not put in place for it to be possible to pull off cool stealth things), so uh if you get caught, everyone will immediately know where you are. If one person saw you there, the others who are somewhere completely different, will know instantly. The mechanics of all AI in this game is quite dumb.\n\n-----RAILS:\nYou are on rails in different carts in this game quite a lot. Do you remember sitting in the back of a lorry in Call of Duty (the first game, the good game that had actual content) and you used bazookas to kill trucks following you? How great that was. In THIS game, you see a bunch of dumb monsters jump around your cart underground and scream etc. Everything is predetermined at that point, and you're not able to shoot any of these, because to save money and programming skills, the engine in this game is so bad, that it can't produce anything but different stages and modes. Let me explain:\n\nIf a monster is running around your cart, it is in "Fixed animation mode" where it wont actually be a moving thing, it will just be an animated thing which cant interact with the world, and the world cant interact with it. It just looks the same as the things about to interact with you. What you'd think really, is when you see a monster running around like this is "OMG SHOOT IT!" but actually you cant, because it's not actually there yet. It will then make itself look like its jumping onto your cart, and then change its mode to "Stuck to your cart and you can interact with it-mode", where it will scream at you and attack you, which means you can actually shoot this thing which now has landed at a predetermined moment on your cart. It was not of its will, it was just programmed to do exactly as it was told, and that goes for every AI throughout the game. I hope my explanation was.. OK.\n\n\n-----GASMASKS (and finding your way):\nOh lord -.-\nThe most advanced and lively aspect of this game, is the realism the gas mask brings you.\nFirst of all: You need one now and then to breathe. It then gets a bunch of blood on it which you have to clean away, and while you're running around, your guy will start breathing heavier and heavier because the filter needs to be swapped quite often. This means you have to stock up on filters when you can, which means you have another thing to spend money on which in my money is just like.. "we didn't have any better ideas dude, so we put this in".\nThis also means you'll hear a heavy, annoying breathing noise. It will also cover with droplets, making your screen covered with this blood now and then and these droplets. Ugh...\n\nNow to finding your way. You know when you see that area over there where there's basically nothing, so it's probably barred off with something so you're supposed to go somewhere else? That's quite often where you're supposed to go, and you'll be stuck running around wasting precious gas mask time which you previously stocked up on, to look for where to go. Then you may ask yourself: "Where should I move?" and the answer to that is: "On". That is all. "Move on! And then when you have reached a boring cutscene of fake russian accents, stop, stock up, and move on some more in this extremely dull and boring world."\nThere is no objective to follow, you can't ask the journal for help or anything. It just happens that whatever road is open to you, is EXACTLY where you're supposed to go, even though the story has a predetermined set point of where you're going. If you're lazy, you'll be googling quite a lot to find your way before your gas mask filters are all gone. This puts a stopper to the whole gameplay experience.\n\n-----THE GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE:\nis quite sucky anyway. If you've ever seen videos of this game thinking "This game looks like another dull FPS with no real content but to move from A to B to C and kill people as you go" then you were completely spot on correct. I bought this game because everyone bragged their asses off at it, but I should seriously have trusted my instincts, and so should you!\n\n-----THE STORY\nIt sucks so far. You meet people now and then, and then they die so that you can meet a new person somewhere else. Mostly you meet them when they come in at the last second to save you. So you are a survivor, saved by those you meet, but everyone you meet who had a really good first impression, will die.\n\n-----MISC\nThey say it's a game based on a book, and the book I bet is great. The game is there to milk the book for money as cheaply as it possibly can. I'll add here that the graphics and other mechanics are also pretty bad. Voice acting is also bad.\n\nYou can save a little boy. I really wish I hadnt. He was just annoying. While carrying him, the mechanics of the movement and aiming has as slight delay because you are.. carrying a boy. Later, you will give this boy to his mother. A music will play, which means you now have 2 soundtracks playing at once. At this point, without the kid, the kid is still on your back on your shadow, and youre running with your hands as if holding a gun, without holding a gun.\n\nSmall mutant dogs or whatever come at you from wherever they want, holes here and there, which then attacks you once and runs away. While running around finding your way, this becomes extremely annoying.\n\nThe game is outdated in most aspects. For both its initial release, and the 2014 Redux update.\n\nWeapons have mods, but these are few and boring.\n\nYou're usually doing the same thing over and over again in this game, not a lot of new stuff.\n\nThe weapons are very few btw, and only 2 weapons are actually stealthy. A melee knife which you stab at people or cut their throats which both look very weird, and throwing knives, which are clunky to throw, or even find. Google how to do it, and you'll have both Xbox players and PC players ask for this. The thing is to clunkily hold tab, drag with mouse to specific thrown item (no, you cant quickly swap, are you mad?) and then hit the throw key. Which reminds me: Throwing a grenade from darkness into unsuspecting enemies means they will see you the moment you throw it, scream "there he is" in fake russian, and everyone in the area will shoot at you immediately like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----CONCLUSION---------> VERY disappointing game which I dont understand why people have been bragging about.","March 8","false","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, there were a few missions where the AI is just too damn clever and you will end up dying over and over, however if this does happen, youre likely playing wrong, so look for a way around because this game is like that, it is rather linear but the constant sidepaths can, with the promise of more money for more loot and ammo and shiny new guns, make it feel much more open.

The only guns from Last Light they put into the game were the AKSU(which serves no purpose, as it is just a crappier Kalash, when the Kalash is plentiful), the Bigun (which is very overpriced, not great) and the flamer(which you get very close to the end of the game, and has to be hand pumped slowly, I dropped it as soon as I could, because I had never seen any flamer fuel before and figured I'd get stuck with a useless empty gun, but as soon as you get it, you find flamer fuel everywhere!). Despite these complaints, I still enjoyed the game. The new gamemode options are really great.","August 28, 2014","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything I loved about FPS makes it back to the table with this.  I am talking about OLD FPS games from when they were fun - in the 90s and MAYBE early 2000's... before Call of Duty ruined it all.  Not saying COD fan's won't enjoy this - contrary - I think it'll be a breath of fresh air to them and find out what a game with an immersive environment really is.  This is an absolutely stunning game, visually 100% and the sound/effects are entirely 100% also.  Weapons are upgradable and there is plenty of choice.  Even for a casual gamer, you WILL stand a chance to survive in the easier difficulties.  For more seasoned gamers, there is RANGER and RANGER HARDCORE modes to really test your skills (and get some coffee for that last one, or vodka, you're going to need it!).\n\nAlso worth mentioning is I didn't have to install and log in to any third-party make-sure-you-paid-for-it-and-log-you DRM type softwares such as UBISOFT and EA are doing these days (two companies I've blacklisted).  It's so nice to just be able to run the game, instead of being punished for buying a company's product like a good honest citizen.  This really means a lot to me as a PC gamer of 20 years now.  THANK YOU.\n\nWouldn't be complete without telling you that this runs absolutely wonderfull on a 2gb Radeon 7850 graphics board, running pci-express 3.0 on a Z97 Asus Hero board, 16gb ram and an i7 4790k cpu @ 4.6ghz.   Using SSD's in raid mode there is 0 wait time (about 2 seconds max, much less time than it takes you to read).  GFX defaulted to very high, there was absolutely positively NO hitching, stuttering or anything of the sort, and I don't think it ever dropped below 60fps.  I am sure I could turn up the gfx settings some, but why bother, the game is absolutely gorgeous.  Users of Multi-GPU or even Single-GPU powered systems on AMD FX setups, rejoice, you will also find a pleasureable experience on your 6 or 8 core CPU!  This game is MULTI-CORE ENABLED, and will use your quad-core quite well.  This game is a testament to just what can be done when a developer uses the processor and gfx hardware to it's fullest potential.  I cannot wait to see what they have planned next!\n\nHands-Down, Entirely worth the 25$ (US) entry fee.  No qualms, no regrets, no questions about it.  Would have bought it sooner if I found time to play it before-hand.\n\nAlso, on a side note, still entirely worthy, this games studio was also previously (had members from) GSC Game World which designed the STALKER (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) game trilogy.  Not only are those games worth picking up if you like this one (though they are a bit more free-roaming), the studio has re-formed and IS working on a STALKER 2!   Keep tuned!\n\nAnd now for the rest of things...\nI did quit playing this game after an hour or two, however, as it did get just too hard too fast and the controls were much 'clunkier' feeling than the older 1st person style games I was used to.  Where's the auto-run key.  I ran out of ammo too often and was killed, again and again.  While I don't feel i've wasted my money at all (it was fun for the first hour or two and many will enjoy/rave about it), I don't think I will ever buy a first-person-shooter game again.  FPS games, while even this one is one of the best, have just gone to crap these last 10 years... COD, Battlefield, GTAIV, they're all too complicated.  What was wrong with simple?  I don't want a shooter simulation I wanted a game.\n\nI still recommend this game if you love FPS games with a challenge.  It's far too much challenge for someone in their 30s just casually playing around though.","January 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there were a few missions where the AI is just too damn clever and you will end up dying over and over, however if this does happen, youre likely playing wrong, so look for a way around because this game is like that, it is rather linear but the constant sidepaths can, with the promise of more money for more loot and ammo and shiny new guns, make it feel much more open. However, especially in the stations, you will find the linearity more apparent. The atmosphere is so well built up, you feel so immersed, then you just kind of notice the linearity, and it makes you hope that the next metro game will be open world, because that would just be badass...","August 30, 2014","true","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as Artyom, a citizen of metro station Exhibition. You awaken to your father speaking to you, concerned of the well being of Exhibition after recent attacks from an unknown horror, leaving the station in a state or terror and despair. You walk with your father, through the crowded corridors of the station, listening to conversations between wives and war torn soldiers. You look at children playing and drawing along the walls, hearing the faint song playing from a guitar in the distance. You feel a sense of peace, just to be shaken back to reality by the alert of another attack.\n\n\nThis is, the reality deep within the Metro of post apocalyptic Moscow. Families trying to survive desperate times and soldiers trying to survive mutants. Around every corner are unknown dangers waiting to strike.\nIt is the morning when your friend enters your small room to get you ready for the caravan delivery you will be embarking on. It is the first time you've left the safety of your home station, but are assured it will be a safe and a short trip between here and a neighboring station, you have other plans to journey to Polis station however. You ride the caravan with your friends feeling calm when you're told by workers the main tunnel is closed off, and that you will have to use an alternative access tunnel. This is where things take a turn for the worse.\n\nYou will have to fight, sneak and survive your way through the metro on your odyssey to Polis station. Every table is turned against you willing for your failure, whether that be bandits, hostile soldiers or horrifying creatures, mutated from living and breathing the nuclear radiation on the surface above, in the dead city of Moscow. Few allies are made but you rely on them with your live and vice versa. In the metro a man is his word so be careful who you trust.\n\n\nThe gameplay graphics are in a word, great. Shadows are strong as is the darkness and the overall atmosphere is intense. As I travel outside in the ruins of the city I appreciate the lighting and the reflections.\nSnow and ice have a more traditional life like look about them over being overly bright. The many buildings are fairly detailed and as we go down into the metro tunnels I can see light sources and lighting reflections are top notch. The game uses a wonderful stealth system, though it can be buggy at times.\n\nHostile soldiers will be alerted to excessive sound and from seeing you crawl around the metro in dimly lit areas. In the game you wear a watch that acts as both a gasmask timer alarming you to replace your gasmask filters, as well as a light indicator telling you how visible you are in lit areas. The less light shining on you the more stealthy you are.\n\n\nThe game controls are relatively easy to use. Among standard shooter game controls we see a few extra controls required for game specific items like your universal charger, that keeps your flash light and night vision goggles charged if you have them, and along with controls for fitting your gasmask and replacing filters. We have controls for swapping out ammunition in assault rifles from regular low quality metro made bullets to premium prewar military ammunition. Be careful using prewar ammo as it also serves as currency within the metro.\n\nThe game is honestly poorly optimized, as at highest settings and anything above 1080p you'll need some serious central processing and graphics processing power. Using a 3570k paired with a r9 280x and 8gb of system memory, I can run high settings at 1080p in direct X 10 and achieve more than acceptable frame rates however. Setting to direct X 11 is where things get tough, along with other settings like anti aliasing and PhysX for those of you with Nvidia graphics.\n\n\nOverall Metro 2033 is an amazingly fresh horror first person shooter. It offers a wonderful atmosphere to experience with some tough challenges, especially at higher difficulty settings.\nIf you like games similar to whats been described I'd give Metro 2033 a look for sure.","February 10","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There will be some vague objective, but it never seems to be reached. Once a mission is "completed", the next mission has a totally new story with new charaters that you don't care about. Cutscenes are too long without any interesting story/dialogue. Combat is just shooting at wild mutations that are Call of Duty style dogs. I did have one shootout with a group of human bandits, but they were all extremely stupid and died in one hit with any weapon.\nAside from direct gameplay, the game has some features I did not totally enjoy. Firstly, many important parts of the game such as the currency, weapon upgrade system, and many general controls (such as using medpacks to heal) are not explained at all. This can lead to a lot of confusion and bad decisions that could easily be avoided by better game development. The in-game currency, called "ammo" is extremely confusing since it is used to purchase new weapons and upgrades, but may also be the ammo you use to shoot (??).  The ammo currency is just given to you by the AI throughout the story in huge doses (60 ammo for completing a mandatory objective) but is hard to obtain in any other way, making it a non-reward and an almost unnecessary part of the game. As stated earlier, many of the vital in-game controls are left unexplained such as the use of stimpacks, flashlights, or stealth. Often times your AI allies will follow their preset linear story paths without any pause, leaving you no time to explore the game world. While this is not a problem for games like Call of Duty where the objectives are the entire goal, Metro's quasi-open world has weapons, ammo, and miniobjectives spread throughout optional sections of the world. The AI's linear progression forces the player to either skip passed these scattered items, or to just ignore the storymode for long periods of time.\n\nOverall I do not recommend Metro 2033, but I could definitely see how some people would enjoy it.","December 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrisshow/recommended/286690/","Chrisshow","Downey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrisshow/","102 products in account","I've seen a lot of hype for these games, and they seem to have good reviews, but 102 minutes into 2033 and it's just been boring overall.\nGameplay-wise, every mission is extremely short (less than 10 minutes each) and each mission has no real story. There will be some vague objective, but it never seems to be reached. Once a mission is "completed", the next mission has a totally new story with new charaters that you don't care about. Cutscenes are too long without any interesting story/dialogue. Combat is just shooting at wild mutations that are Call of Duty style dogs. I did have one shootout with a group of human bandits, but they were all extremely stupid and died in one hit with any weapon.\nAside from direct gameplay, the game has some features I did not totally enjoy. Firstly, many important parts of the game such as the currency, weapon upgrade system, and many general controls (such as using medpacks to heal) are not explained at all. This can lead to a lot of confusion and bad decisions that could easily be avoided by better game development. The in-game currency, called "ammo" is extremely confusing since it is used to purchase new weapons and upgrades, but may also be the ammo you use to shoot (??).  The ammo currency is just given to you by the AI throughout the story in huge doses (60 ammo for completing a mandatory objective) but is hard to obtain in any other way, making it a non-reward and an almost unnecessary part of the game. As stated earlier, many of the vital in-game controls are left unexplained such as the use of stimpacks, flashlights, or stealth. Often times your AI allies will follow their preset linear story paths without any pause, leaving you no time to explore the game world. While this is not a problem for games like Call of Duty where the objectives are the entire goal, Metro's quasi-open world has weapons, ammo, and miniobjectives spread throughout optional sections of the world. The AI's linear progression forces the player to either skip passed these scattered items, or to just ignore the storymode for long periods of time.\n\nOverall I do not recommend Metro 2033, but I could definitely see how some people would enjoy it.","December 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil-lemon/recommended/286690/","evil-lemon","Unforseen Lemonquences™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil-lemon/","293 products in account","I'll be honest here. Despite having an already positive bias for this series (enjoyed both the games and the books. 2034 was actually the inspiration for me to learn Russian :V. Still rusty), I'll say that I do not think its worth to buy this and Last Light Redux (especially so) at full price for players who already played the non-Redux edition of these two games. Mostly because the changes aren't that big aside from the visuals (2033 is especially noticablily better and more stable compared to 2033). I'd suggest to buy this game at any price above 50% for players who have played the previous games. If you have the means and don't mind supporting the developers by paying the 50% price tag for both (like i did), then by all means get it, its a terrific experience.\n\nHaving said that, I do understand that revamping these two games isn't free and people need to feed their families and whatnot. I'm just saying that for those of us players who are tight on their budget but are very keen on playing the redux editions, just wait until there's a 66% or so sales. It's worth every penny.\n\nNow to my personal opinion on Metro 2033 Redux.  (Last Light Redux will be seperate)\n\nThe changes is impressive. Downright amazing to even the tiny changes they did. I won't spoil anything, but people who played the original 2033 will definately notice all these tiny changes and appericiate that. Visuals aside, I can tell alot of passion and effort went into creating 2033 Redux. It's from all these tiny changes and "secrets" that you can tell people enjoy doing the things they did. Here's to one certainly hoping to more games based on the Metro universe. I'll be highlighting points in this long ♥♥♥ review so its easier to read through.\n\nGunplay\nThe combat in this game is as what you'd expect from Last Light. Solid, fuild and fun. Unlike the original 2033, 2033 Redux's combat is more enjoyable and viable. Infact, I'm not sure if many people noticed but in the original 2033, there were some painful gun bugs that made gunfights very difficult and fustrating. If you're like me, if you used  Hellsing and Tihar  heavily (stealhier plays), there's a bug where the Hellsing and Tihar projectile would fire slightly above the iron sight/scope when zoomed and even higher when not using zoom (files above the laser sight) even when squatting completely still. The  Shambler  too had a bug where you could load more than 6 rounds into the shotgun by cancelling loading animation halfway at a certain point (switching) (not neccesarily complaining but yeah you get the point :V. Pretty useful bug when fighting horde scenes). Redux  seemed to address these bugs  and combat was relatively smooth.   HOWEVER [/b] , not sure if devs are working on a fix but the gun can get "stuck"if you were to cancel the reload animation too many times (repeatedly switching weapons or opening the notepad just as you pressed the reload button). When this happens, your character cannot do anything aside from moving and turning flashlight open/off. You can't fire, reload, switch, recharge your battery, climb ladders, use consumables and lighter. But if you enter a cutscene (e.g when Artyom and Bourbon jumps into the hole leading to Dry station).\n\nGrenades and other throwing weapons  were also way better in Redux than in 2033. the "throw" of the bombs and knives had more oomph in them. Also they didn't had a short delay where the actual damage would be done after 1-2 seconds upon detonation as in the original 2033. As for the  throwing knives  however, I would've appericiate if they kept the orignal 2033 style of using throwing knvies were you would actually hold them like a weapon and hold your throw to aim (by holding down the fire button). You could also throw knives faster this way. Of course this is a personal preference, I have no trouble using Last Light's throwing knives system, but would've personally preferred the original 2033 system.\n\nGameplay [/b]\nAs you would've expected, movement  is very smooth and there are plently of secrets around. Ontop of the original bunch of  stashes  already present, there are some new additional stashes around asides from the safes (you'll need to find both the keys and the safes). Keys are easy to spot, they have a blight red cloth attached to them so you can spot them more easily. Safes are abit harder to find at times though. Maybe becaue they blend in the background aesthetic pretty well. Enemy  AI  are also much better and sharper (played only on Ranger Hardcore, not sure if there improvements are also very visible in easier difficulties) than the orginal 2033 and even Last Light to some extend. Unlike 2033 unrealistic AI were if the enemies in the area are alerted to your presence (for example Frontline level), once they lose sight of you they won't know your current location until they make visual contact with you again. Original 2033 had an annoying AI system were if they knew your presence, they can "see" you regardless of where you go and how quietly you moved. Their  reaction times  are also alot better. Im even impressed by the fact that if you are shooting a them, they  can actually dive for cover and roll out/side step of your line of fire  (not that it saves them anyway, but still pretty neat). I do have complaints though regarding  armor . Having beaten the game twice now, I'm pretty sure that Stealth and Heavy armor are removed from the game. In the original 2033, you could purchase these armors in Armory station and Polis for about 100 or 150 bullets.\n\nVisuals [/b]\nImpressive. Compared to the original 2033, 2033 Redux is really amazing and immersive. The skybox, terrain etc are all very well detailed especially if your specs can handle.\n\nMinor complaints [/b]\n- Personally referrred the old English Artyom voice actor (I know its better to play it in Russian for that immerson)\n- Some military rounds "secrets" that were scattered around the stations you visit are missing (not sure if intentional or the developers forgot to include those because they are not entirely gone)\n- They removed the Abzat you would get when Andrew the Blacksmith saves you from the Reds (It would've been on his bed). Not that you can't get the Abzat though. Just would've been nice to get it for free and then sell it :V (I horde money like that).\n- Is it just me or does Miller's beard and hair overly shiny when you shine light on it. Might be a visual bug on my computer but who knows. Too lazy to reinstall to find out.\n- Ammo limit (except for military grade rounds). I would've loved to horde ammo the way I did in the original 2033 D:\n\nOverall conclusion [/b]\nMetro 2033 Redux is worth playing. I'd highly recommend it even to players who already played the original non-Redux. You might like some of the changes and not so for the others, but it still stands for me that the game is still worth playing and replaying even after you've beaten it on both Survival and Spartan playstyle.\n\n\nIMPORTANT PS :  I forgot to mention that in the level where you had to piggyback the boy Sasha in Hole station, it is actually easier to go through the level than it was in the original 2033 because the sway is less "heavier" and also you can actually sprint (I can't remember if you could sprint in the original 2033, but I'm pretty sure you couldn't sprint). He also doesn't spam his annoying lines "LOOK OUT. OVER THERE " etc etc. So cheers to less hate on Sasha. Atleast I don't feel the need to take the ammo his mother offers after saving him (Like hell yeah im taking it, your son was a god damn pain in the ♥♥♥). STILL CAN'T FIND THAT GUN HE MENTIONED THOUGH D:. Maybe it was just a normal script thing.\n\n\n\n9001/10 wood play again.","September 15, 2014","true","36.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

''What is this another clone of Fallout? Screw it.'' So I forgot it. To be honest, at this time, I was more interested by the Fallout franchise, it was when the dual Reduxes reboots weren't on the market, only the original games were there. When the Reduxes came out, I was curious to see what they changed,updated.upgraded,ect. I watched a couple of gameplays on YouTube, I wasn't impressed. So, I went on the review section on the game's store page. It all came to one thing: the story.At this moment, I dared this game to be better than the FPSes I played: the Bioshock franchise, the Half-life franchise, Deus-Ex: Human Revolution and Wolfenstein: The New Order. Suprisingly, A sale on the dual reduxes came out. I bought them both. Then I started playing Metro 2033. There is one thing that the Metros had but the other games didn't have: The urge to scavenge, keeping track of how many minutes you had left on your filters, looking for filters,ammo, new gaz masks,etc. It may seem like nothing, but this makes a big difference in how you play this specific game. It adds another dimension in immersion which makes the game spectacular. If you play on Ranger or Ranger Hardcore, you'll be immersed in the game in maximum 5 minutes. You won't pay attention to the hours passed on this game, you'll pay attention to the game. Apart from the immersion ther is alot more to the game. The story 10/10 : the mix of present and past adds alot to the experience. The music 11/10, it makes you feel like you are wandering throughout a wasteland but it makes you feel like you have nostalgia for the land that was before the War, which is exactly what this game needs. Characters: 9/10: it does not make you feel like these people are your friends but more like partners,comrades. The art style, 10/10 : the perfect balance of colours and ruined landscapes for this kind of game. The combat system, 7.5/10 Intuitive but lacks originality in using the environment around you and your enemies. Overall Gameplay: 9.5/10.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10, for standing out for this kind of game.

It's all about the consoles.\n\nMy problem is that the vertical mouse sensitivity (Y-axis) is only a fraction of the horizontal sensitivity. This makes aiming with a mouse extremely annoying and takes all the fun out of playing the game.\n\nThis is not just a problem for me. The Steam forums and other Metro forums are filled with threads complaining about this issue. From what I've seen, the developer Deep Silver has not even acknowledged the problem. It's obvious that they don't care about the PC market and therefore they do not deserve our money. I have requested a refund but I fear it's been to long since I purchased the game.","March 12","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I honestly think this might be one of my new favorite shooters or atleast in my top 5. The whole fact that they got survival, horror, shooter and stealth done CORRECTLY is more than i can say for the majority of games on steam now aday. I love it and would recomend it to anyone looking for a good time and a thrill.

Gameplay wise it might work a little better but the original had this special feel... more about survival.\nThe "improved" graphics isn't an improvement at all. Check the youtube videos.\nSome textures might have a sharper resolution but that doesn't actually make them look bettet when the texture artist actually sucks. That's amateurs work as seen in average game mods at best.\n\nBetter get the original game. This one here was a big waste of money and I'm actually upset that I bought it.
