It's hard to make characters interesting when you're not sure how the player will be interacting with them. But while most of the characters are a little tropey (annoying, arrogant rival; upbeat, snarky sidekick; supportive, mysterious boss; etc.), they're still entertaining, and the Dystopian Cyberpunk world is done very well. I'd like to see some sort of internet analogue in a sequel, but that's the result of wanting more, not feeling that the story was missing something.\n\nThe one real problem I have with this story is one that I have with most Choice of Games products--no asexual option. Yes, you can turn down romance and such (after identifying as straight, gay, or bisexual), but when you do, it feels a lot like you're missing out on content. Wouldn't normally complain about this, as this game is still far ahead of most of the industry, but the dev makes a big deal about being inclusive, so I feel like making noise might be worth doing.\n\nSo, basic information:\n\nPros:\n-Cyberpunk\n-Noire\nGlory v. goodness morality system (you'll be familiar with it, to an extent, if you've played anything in the Heroes Rise series)\n-Cool glowing eyes\n-Gender/sexual inclusivity\n-Robot bits\n-Exiled science vikings, maybe?\n\nCons:\n-No dragons\n-No magic\n-No weird internet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n\nSo yeah buy it.","October 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","36","55","3","1"

There was so much that could have been done with this that wasn't.  It had all the makings of a really interesting epic story and in the end it felt like the writer got bored with it and shipped it incomplete.\n\nAlso apparently a couple of achievements are bugged.

'Ratings War' is, however, far more comprehensively realised than most examples of it's kind on your bookshelf. Though I wouldn't discourage children from playing the game I would emphasize it's maturer writing style and suggest it's suitability for any age, according to taste.\n\nThe story itself is engaging, reasonably original and has a good sense of narritive cohesion, though now on my second run-through I'm unsure whether the choices I made had any real impact on the story itself, rather affecting other more superficial (but equally important) features. It's difficult to give a specific example without spoilers, but romantic implications, for instance, may arise that affect your gameplay.\n\nI picked it up at £1.34 in a sale but at it's normal £2.00 price 'Ratings War'  more than reasonable for an evening's entertainment. With a playtime of around 3 hours and some deal of replayability it's definitely worth a look. The free demo contains the first chapter, which I think is enough to decide for sure if this is the game for you!\nTo conclude, in case you haven't realised this by now, I would thoroughly recommend this game to any fan of crime fiction.","October 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's competently executed and I've recommended it to several people already.  The cyberpunk theming is nice, but not deep, which I think is actually the fault of the character POV rather than the author.  It isn't sci-fi to the character!  The author does seem to have given thought to the implications of the technologies presented.\n\nI can't give an unmixed recommendation, but I'm going to limit myself to one big complaint.  My biggest complaint with the game is with a certain character who is both 'the cavalry' at a critical point, and then talking about throwing the PC under the bus a few pages later.  Come on, that doesn't make sense.  An ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can save the day without ceasing to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  "I don't like you, but I'm not letting THAT happen to you," is a thing people can be motivated by.\n\nThe protagonist herself (her by default; player can choose otherwise) is a peaceful but tenacious individual who is sympathetic in every path I've played so far.  I like that decisions are typically given sympathetic treatment whether they conform to the preferences of people outside of journalism or not.  People aren't villains in their own POV.  (I wonder if accepting that bribe is treated sympathetically, too...)  In general, the game's writing is empathetic, and save for the character I complained about in the second paragraph every character major or minor is given some footing for the decisions they make.  That's pretty awesome.\n\nAlthough it is not without its quirks, I recommend Ratings War as an experience.","October 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I got Choice of Robots via a sale and was simply interested in playing a completely text based C&C game. I really liked Choice of Robots, your coices really mattered and you were able to explore totally different stories. I think i played around 7 playthroughs of Choice of Robots, this game sadly appears to be a little different.\n\nI managed to stop at a playtime of 115 minutes - yes i am a slow reader - before writing this little review, and at the moment I am contemplating whether or not i want to refund the game, not necessarily because of the money, but more in order to weighten my verdict. Keep in mind that i interrupted my first playthrough and that i am thus not capable of garanteeing anything, the far smaller amount of achievements - compared to Choice of Robots - nevertheless reflects my thoughts.\n\nThe story seems to be rather out of your hand, while you could make nearly every single decision in Choice of Robots, this game let's the protagonist or other characters take crucial decisions for you, eliminating the possibility of different playthroughs diverging significantly storywise. To elaborate what i mean i'll have to comment on one example for this, which is impossible without a mild spoiler.\nThe scene where i stoped and looked at my playtime:\n\nYou are making your first real investigation (it did not seem to me that the story could have diverged earlier) and interview someone who called for help, you get out and talk to your "editor"/helper who wants to meet and talk about the leads you gathered. The protagonist and her helper quickly talk about where to meet and it is decided that you meet at a coffee. You can't decide differently and you still get an achievement for drinking a coffee. This just feels odd. Espacially since the consequences of meeting in the office rather than in a coffee place are talked about, instead of giving you the possibility to think about the different outcomes and make a reflected decision, changing the path the story would take.\n\nAll in all i am fairly dissapointed at this game atm, and will consider whether or not i will refund it within the next days.\n","December 3, 2015","false","4.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I suggested people SHOULD buy this. That's before I signed up on their website had the chance to talk to one of their owners. I think people should read this BEFORE buying. What he says this is a direct quote.\n\n"Choice Of Games embodies the same view of Antia Sarkeensian." End quote\n\nShe is a person who mislead people several times, calls games sexist or objective to females. I was told not to buy their games unless I did agree with her world view. This is one of Owners of site where the games from telling me this.

If you can catch this on sale, I'd definitely pick it up. If you're looking for a little more bang for your buck, I'd reccomend the Heroes Rise trilogy or SLAMMED!, as they have longer stories. The heroes trilogy lasted me roughly 15-20 hours, though I think I played it twice, and SLAMMED! took me about 5 hours for one playthrough.","October 5, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KatPet/recommended/406650/","KatPet","Pharah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KatPet/","399 products in account","Much like the other Choice of Games titles, Ratings War brings an interesting premise with a dash of romance, flair of an evolving player character (driven by choice, of course) and a stylistic read wrapped up in a cheap package. While shorter than most titles, Ratings War was rather entertaining and it definitely had one of the more well established future noir settings that I've been aching for.\n\nOverall a great companion for a rainy day. Like all the other text games I do not recommend it for elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't do this genre. If you're open minded I would go with Tin Star or the Heroes Rise trilogy if you haven't played one before simply because those are both longer and far more entertaining.","December 14, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
