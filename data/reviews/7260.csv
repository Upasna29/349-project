The Norse God of Mischief is on the loose across the world, so local heroes must each travel across their lands and help their own Gods safeguard the world.\n\nPros: This game has plenty of dungeon crawling. With each of the four characters, you have an entire campaign set in a different part of the world, interacting with different Gods and different enemies and creatures. There is a large variety of weapons and armors, and different levels of rarity very similar to the Diablo series. Graphics are ok if you're zoomed out, and you heal quickly enough when idle that you can jump right back into action after a few seconds of rest.\n\nCons: The game is basic, story is bland and so is the voice-acting. Crafting is pretty good, or at least it would be if it was of any use: Why would you disassemble your Two-Handed Hammer's magical handle if you'll throw it away as soon as you start getting the Spiked Hammer a few levels later? Why would you recycle for material your old weapons and armor if you can't even sell the material, which will be outdated as soon as better material becomes standard a few levels later? The game lags terribly whenever you're walking along an invisible wall (whether a ledge or an actual wall). Game gets quite repetitive after a while. You'll find equipment for classes other than your own (example: finding an Aztec Shaman armor while playing the Norse Campaign), which doesn't make sense seeing you can't transfer inventory between the different characters, and the characters will never set foot in the other campaign settings. The advertisement in Steam would have you believe this plays in 3rd person mode, but you actually play in isometric view (image #11 is the only accurate representation of the game).\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nIt's an ok game. I'd even say Loki: Heroes of Mythology is a great way to just get the hack & slash crave out of the way when you're done with other Diablo clones. Unfortunately, that's as far as I'll recommend it, as the lack of intriguing story or puzzle (of any form) prevents it from being more than that.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","March 13, 2015","true","15.7"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","35","39","3","0"

There are different classes to play each entrenched in one of four mythologies; Norse, Greek, Egyptian or Aztec.\n\nCharacter controls and the interface are functional, but lack polish and feel.\n\nIndividual enemies are extremely well drawn and animated.\n\nThe terrain feels blocky and awkward, almost as if it was an afterthought.\n\nThere is no smooth transition between zones, and the zones are all square tiles with portals linking neighbouring zones.  Moving between one square tile zone and the next brings up a loading screen.\n\nThe game balance in early game is among the worst I have ever experienced.  Your character will keep dying and respawning at the zone entrance.\n\nLoki has a nice design concept which has been extremely poorly implemented.  This is a lack-lustre attempt to create a "me too" game to cash in on the Diablo / Diablo 2 franchise success.  The quests, storyline and mythology are the strong points, but these are let down by poor gameplay mechanics and lack of balance.\n\nAs an alternative consider playing any of the ARPG games in the Blizzard franchise (Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3) or consider Titan Quest and it's add-on Immortal throne.  Sacred and Sacred 2 are also alternatives worth consideration.  Other alternatives include Spellforce, Spellforce 2, Dungeon Siege, Dungeon Siege 2.\n\nLoki is not a bad game, but it lacks much of the finesse, polish and playability of the top games in this genre current at the time of its release.  In other words Loki is not to be considered a good game, but rather a mediocre attempt to imitate games that are good.  That said, Loki is not the worst game in this genre, but certainly could be contrived as making a half-hearted attempt at achieving that accolade.\n\nWorth picking up when it is on sale at good discount, but Loki is not a game you will be tempted to re-play too often or remember with fond nostalgia.\n\n4/10","October 24, 2014","false","13.1"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","38","51","3","0"

I swear it looks like a completely different game than the one I'm playing. I guess anything could be made more exciting if you zoom the camera in on action shots. When you actually play Loki you'll notice that you spend almost the entirety of it a mile away from the action, watching your hero slay countless foes in repetitive drab backdrops in the hopes of getting a hold of that phat loot.\n\nIf I had a grain of sand for every hour that I've spent with games like Diablo 2, I could create my own Sahara in the backyard. Naturally I'm easy prey for games like Loki. Eventually my better sense prevails and I realize that I'm playing with hot garbage.\n\nThe biggest problem with Loki is that you're staring at a giant middle finger while playing. It's in the background and it almost feels like if you alt-tabbed at just the right moment you'd see it. That middle finger doesn't appear until you start leveling up. Getting a level up is usually a good thing in Action RPGs. You become stronger, you gain new abilities, and you can proceed to take on new challenges. In Loki however the monsters level up with you, and they tend to do so at a better rate. The gear you find doesn't in any way compensate for this rapidly growing disparity.\n\nI have no idea what happens 5, 10, or even 20 hours into Loki. Does that middle finger grow in size? Does it disappear for awhile and then come back with a vengeance? Or is it like a heart beat? Pulsating and thumping every second as a reminder that you're spending time with something that hates you almost as much as it hates fun? I don't know and I really don't care to find out.\n","March 24, 2014","false","3.6"," 49 of 75 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","49","75","10","1"

Heck, Diablo 2 looks better. This game has unpolished looking graphics, a horrible UI, a rather badly made loot system, a frustrating skill system, and lousy combat.\n\nThe character balancing was pretty godawful too. You choose one of four characters (Greek Archer, Nordic Barbarian, Egyptian Wizard, Aztec Shaman), each of which have three skill trees that you can access by worshipping one of three different dieties for that particular class. You may only put points into a tree if you are currently worshipping that particular god. It is a rather needlessly complicated skill system.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is also a tad skewed. Picking anyone other than the Egyptian and you're gonna have a hard time with this game, the difficulty curve spikes pretty high, even on Normal difficulty. Picking the Egyptian however gives you access to various AOE spells in each of his diety trees, any of which you can use to nuke monsters from around corners and generally out of their lines of sight to kill them without aggroing them. Some bosses being the exception with this tactic, but still rather easy to kill with his spells regardless. The melee characters all have hard times avoiding great amounts of damage and the  Aztec Shamans pet spells seem lackluster by comparison to the Egyptians nuking.\n\nThe voice acting is subpar, even for this games time. The monsters themselves can vary soundwise from normal levels to occasionally ear splitting combat screams depending on the monster type involved. You have to slog through the story on each difficulty to actually get the final ending, and go through each other classes area on each difficulty fighting their bosses along with your own. Combat is repetitive, frustrating (if you're not the Egyptian), and boring (if you are). The boss fights are pretty painful to get through as well. Particularly the final boss in the Aztec area. I hated that fight.\n\nAll in all I'm probably giving this one a bad review because I had played Titan Quest right before it. Titan Quests only problem after release was a slight memory leak. This game had many more issues and overall can't compare to it. Or Diablo 2. Or Diablo 1 for that matter. Even the first two Sacred games have a certain charm that this one just....lacks.

The inferface is clunky and the story is generic, but the action is great, the bosses are epic, and the gear is amazing looking (for its time, the gfx are getting progressively more and more dated).  Don't let my puny 11.5 discourage you --- I played this game A TON from the disc copy and did multiple playthroughs on a norse warrior and a playthrough each for Aztec and Egyptian. I'd love to love the ringtossing Greek, but the physics on the ring never gelled for me. This game is $10 and worth every penny -- if you can get it for less it's a must have.","May 17","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game that you play if dont have a life or got much time to waste.","June 1","false","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
