Each level has a few waves of enemies & each level gets steadily harder. It is arcade like so content is limited. (this is a ea title so i'll try to update this as updates come out. date of review is 9/9/15)\n\nIf you like this review check out my steam group\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Blinkdog","November 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

He played it at their booth the whole convention.\n\nIts easy to play and super fun. You start out in a room with a few monsters, which you can shoot with your wand fairly easily. Each level gets progressively more difficult with more monsters and more interesting wand spells. At some point in the game you will find yourself with monsters all over, spells flying everywhere in complete mayhem. Thats when the magic happens... Crazy Fun!\n\n\n\n\n","November 16, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
