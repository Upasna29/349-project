I've included my full thoughts about the game in video format here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6ttH2kswAY\n\nTaking the role of the ninja Hayate, you must traverse 16 stages to avenge the death of Princess Kinuhime!\n\nNinja Senki DX is a tough-as-nails action-platformer with a focus on perfection in execution and memorization.  While it's possible to sight-read levels to get through them, collecting all of the coins, killing all of the enemies, or completing a level within the 'speedrun' time limit definitely requires practice.\n\nThere's a lot of intentionally-NES-style design here.  Enemy placements are such that they'll catch you offguard the first time almost every time. Jumps are tight, leaps of faith are not always marked.  I would call this a negative for most games, but Ninja Senki has been built with this style in mind.  Instead of being frustrated by unfair design, I found myself wanting to take another shot at it and perfect my technique.\n\nThe DX version includes a completely remastered soundtrack that is *exceptional*, along with the charming 8-bit style graphics, and tight controls, Ninja Senki DX ends up being a pretty satisfying platformer in the $5 range.","February 23","true","1.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

My review focused on the PS4 version of the game, but in my few hours on the mac version (long enough to test each mode), I didn't have any issues.","February 23","true","5.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/recommended/405540/","excitehype","Excitehype","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/","363 products in account","Full Review for Ninja Senki DX (PC, PS4 & PS Vita) was originally published on Excitehype[excitehype.com]\n\nOver the past few years there have been a lot of 8-bit revival indie games. Some just have the appearance of a game from that era, others fit the mold perfectly and feel like they belong on cartridge (i.e. Shovel Knight, Undertow, Cave Story). Enter Tribute Games, who pride themselves in creating pixel art games based on the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I’ve been a fan of these guys prior to them becoming Tribute Games with XBLA & PSN release of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game from Ubisoft and their first official Tribute game Wizorb. They later brought the Metal Slug/Contra metroidvania Mercenary Kings to PC and PlayStation consoles and followed up the next year with the arcade style 8-bit survival beat em up, Curses N’ Chaos. So of course I was excited for the release of their next title, Ninja Senki DX. Much like Scott Pilgrim, the original Ninja Senki was a pre-Tribute game and was created by Tribute co-founder Jonathan Lavigne and released on PC as freeware back in 2010. So to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the game, Tribute decided to re-release the game on PC, PlayStation 4 and Vita and included an arranged soundtrack, a challenge mode, 2 secret modes, multiple endings and more.\n\nNinja Senki DX at it’s core is an old school platformer that feels like something out of the Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System era regarding gameplay and difficulty. You play as Hayate a ninja set on revenge after his lady friend, Kinuhime was killed by a ninja demon. Simple enough, right? The game has you go through 16 stages filled with enemies that you take out with your Mega Bus….I mean Shurikens and various death traps which pretty much feels like a Mega Man game mixed with the fast action pace of the original Ninja Gaiden Trilogy. Much like those games, the controls are super tight and at times take precision to avoid certain death or to strategically take out your enemies. That’s pretty much it gameplay wise. There are no secret powers you obtain or anything like that, it’s a straight forward playthrough the stage and try to collect all Korban (coins) and kill all enemies as fast as you can for the best score. You have a boss fight every now and then but it’s nothing special but that’s okay. As simple as the game seems, it’s challenging as hell and trust me, it will cause you to rage in certain areas of the game. (Especially the last boss fight)\n\nIt’s definitely a title geared towards hardcore retro game fans and speed runners. Aside from replaying the main story at harder difficulty (hardcore mode), the only other replayability the game provides is the challenge mode and the 2 secret modes Ronin mode which allows you to play the story as one of the samurai enemies (Musashi) and boss rush. But comparing all that content to the price point ($5) it seems like a steal.\n\nIn closing, if you are looking for something to get your old school gaming or speed running fix ,especially if you are a fan of Mega Man, pick this one up. Ninja Senki DX is an awesome plate of retro goodness as well as the rest of Tribute’s catalog. Ninja Senki DX is available for PC via Steam, PS4 and PS Vita. You can also download the original freeware here.","March 13","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays like a super enhanced version of Mega Man. Super responsive controls in a visually retro package. I was a fan of the game in it's freeware edition and in some ways I prefer the previous incarnation. Mostly the soundtrack, but to my delight you can toggle betwwen the original score and the revised. Excellent game, buy it.","March 11","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ninja Senki DX isn't a bad game, there's just not enough for me to keep playing. The graphics are nice to look at, going for a more gameboy/gamegear aesthetic.There isn't much on screen at a time, and the few things that are on screen being huge and easily identifiable. I think my problem with it is that if you go for your primary mechanics being the ole' tried and true Jump n'Shoot, you gotta try to do something with your level design/enemy placement that's interesting. I don't feel this game does that, even if the controls themselves are pretty solid. I got it on sale for like $2, and I feel it's worth about that.","May 19","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
