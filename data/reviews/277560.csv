Where Angels Cry is a mediocre point and click adventure with the environment progression of a HOG, but... without any actual HOG scenes whatsoever. Sure, it contains a selection of unimaginative puzzles and constant item collection - and it almost excites you with the promise of a medieval mystery as it starts - but sadly the game cannot avoid ending up as a short and tedious adventure with a distasteful plot presentation.\n\nIt is the Year of Our Lord, 1286 and as I have stated before, we are promised a medieval mystery. We take the role of a nameless monk who'd be sent to a secluded monastery set high in the Alps from Vatican, to investigate the murder of a fellow monk and the miraculous phenomenon of an angel statue crying blood as we are already there. So far, so good. We have The Name of the Rose atmosphere mixed up with Wainwright's Stigmata storyline. Yet, the actual thing here has little to do with either of these fine stories. No one knowing your true identity, you are mostly free to investigate the monastery that consists of 4 areas and a village nearby. With each passing moment and each new discovery, my expectations diminished with the game until the last scene - which was the moment that I threw my already diminished basket of expectations out of the window.\n\nHere in this paragraph, I'll be ranting about story and concept build up, so whomever would like to try this game and avoid spoilers, please skip ahead or stop reading. First of all, I know that the given concept here must have been tempting to hurl in all medieval clichés, but there really should be an orderly and meaningful way to do that instead of all this soup of terms like "sin", "temptation", "sacrifice", "Angels", "Templars" etc. Whomever arranged the storyline, clearly has a vague outline of the concept and kept throwing in these notions until they somehow stuck together to make a setting. The storyline is so badly arranged, it crumbles to pieces the moment you'd ask an intelligible question like "why the f*ck the Spear of Destiny is here of all places?" or "what has done the prior abbot so meaningful and beautiful that an angel would descend from heaven to cry for him?” See, all these questions have no satisfactory answers. There is just the accumulation of medieval motifs, hoping to build up a storyline eventually.\n\nEnvironment art is considerably dull and badly rendered compared to pretty screenshots that we see in the store page. Those are taken from the iPad/Android version with enhanced graphics. Environment design itself is somewhat alright, but nothing actually breathtaking. Apart the main character, all others are voice acted properly but the dialogue text itself is agonizing, ridden with the unnecessary - and narratively false - amount of usage for words like "nay", "pray tell", "alas" for everyone around to establish a false sense of authenticity! It was hilariously contradictory to see a simple peasant woman capable of using Shakespearean terms - completely wrong though!\n\nThe game consists of 7 short chapters which would give you approximately 3 hours of gameplay. You are to walk around, collect random items disguised in a similar color palette environment, use them in appropriate places and solve a selection of easy puzzles now and then. That's basically it. We have already an achievement system here in the game which has never been converted to actual Steam achievements sadly - lessening to need for exploring the game to an unnecessary extent.\n\nI hear that the game has a sequel - which would be far better than this, I hope. Even if you are strictly into medieval concepts like me, I wouldn't recommend the game. For casual HOG lovers, there are surely greater games you may explore. For the adventure gamer: avoid the game like the plague.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","April 22","false","3.3"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","4"

It will transport you in that world.\n\nThe game definitely has cinematic ambition for mood, plot, etc..\nSettings are well thought and bring good mood.\nDesigns are well created.\nVoice acting....while it is pretty good acting and it is the team's choice, I believe it is better to stick with original voice actor instead of trying to pull accents even though it is supposed to be in the alps, hopefully it does not dither to suspension of disbelief but it definitely can be confusing for very short time, so my definite choice would have been "speak English or Italian for a good majority of the acting and elder monk(s) or special key role(s) (for example) can use a mix.\nCharacter animation are limited and that is a good thing in this case and game.\n\nTotal hours played does not say much about my experience. I stumble on this game on Steam while working on Photoshop, Maya, Mudbox, and Articydraft open at same time, although I repeat again this game may suffer of a little - here and there, it definitely is worth it overall and I had to voice up before I go back to work or it would grind me all day long ;-)\n\n\n","February 27, 2014","true","2.4"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","50","65","0","2"

If you like games like Myst or The 11 Hour, this is something for you. It has some nice puzzles, minigames, dialogues, finding and combination of items and all of them are possible with logical thinking. Of course, it also has some strange puzzles where my first thought was "that was unnecessary complicated", but they were not too much weird, like using a rubberduck to build a trampoline. The price of that game is really surprising. The voice acting is well done, it has beautiful music which fits perfectly into the game (for the most time) and quite decent graphics, even though the world looks rather stiff sometimes and they could have animated a little bit more. But for just 5 euro you cant do anything wrong and i would say the game is even 10-15 euro worth.","February 27, 2014","true","4.0"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

You're a monk that needs to investigate something strange in a monastery, however, the similar background stops here. Indeed, the story isn't as complicated and mysterious as that book.\n\nHowever, playing a monk in the Middle Ages is nice, because the genre isn't really full of games like that. However, Where Angels Cry isn't really a full hidden object game.\n\nIndeed, the game is lacking of hidden objects scenes. You're just in front of a point-&-click game, where you find items, combine them, use them and then, you have also some puzzles. The majority of them are easy but some of them will give you an hard time. And I could say the same with the items to find: some of them aren't really visible, nearly being drowned in the background. Finding nails for example is hard as they're not really shown.\n\nWhat's good with the game is that you're visiting the same locations but at different moments. Indeed, some chapters are set during the night, whether you're in the monastery or in the village.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable. True, I've seen better games in that field. Because Where Angels Cry seems outdated. Really like it was released 10 years ago and not 3 years ago at least. If you play that game, it's not for them anyway. The soundtrack and the voice acting were fine too.\n\nIn other words, Where Angels Cry is an average game. I spent 7 hours in it because of three playthroughs: one for the game, one for the guide I've made for finding the angels and one to review it, as I wasn't really sure of my memories for this one - apart that I've bought the next game quickly, apparently pleased by the aspect "monk detective". For the price, you're not robbed but I suppose that it's better to wait for a discount.\n\nAnd whoever thinks I'm reviewing it because I will play soon the sequel... well, you're right :).","March 28","true","7.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/277560/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","A couple of nasty puzzles in this one - if it sounds delicious you might be tempted to try this game already!\n\nFirst off though - it's short. Sure, the same could probably be said of all hidden object games, depending on your skill, perception and how many H/O games you've already played, but this could probably be blazed through in two hours.\n\nThe visuals and settings are not bad. Objects aren't very hidden - they sort of stand out from the scenes a bit, in their shading and also a vague object outline. People are a bit wooden - moreso than other H/O games I've played. They have minimal or no animation to them, and even the voice-acting doesn't strike me as particularly good. The monks are often high-pitch, at least one sounds nasal, most sound like Americans. I believe going for a more traditional voice cast would have been a pro move as the voices do tend to detract from the immersion.\n\nThe story is ok. It could do with a little work - the first half of the game is repetitive at times, a lot of revisiting the same scenes, a lot of finding the same object just on a different day. Might as well take that bucket of water to bed at night, save yourself the trouble.\n\nThe art is a bit simple and bland, definitely worth a spruce up. More scenes would help with this.\n\nCompared to other H/O games out there, this one let me down. While it does have achievements, these are currently not on Steam, only in-game. There are no steam cards either. But even if there were, I still think my final verdict would be the same. Get it heavily discounted or not at all, 4/10 for effort.","November 21, 2015","false","4.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

The voice acting is sub-par, and the story flimsy. Most of the action consists in collecting random objects that everyone has carelessly strewn about the monestary. The logic puzzles are mostly achievable and mildly diverting, except for one mini-game near the end that consists of a bejeweled-style "battle" with a Knight Templar. It perhaps wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't a timed exercise.

And unless you really enjoy puzzles, you're going to blast through the entire story in an hour and a half. Speaking of, there really isn't a story or a big mystery. An in-game character tells you flat out who the murderer was in the first night, and the rest is pretty easy to figure out from the most basic of clues. I got this as part of a Groupee's bundle, and for the $1 I paid, it was a fun entertaining use of an hour. But I wouldn't recommend it at the price they're asking for on Steam.

This one is much better as the storyline is more interesting and the setting is in a mediaeval monastery and village - what could be better!\n\nThe best aspect of this game is the artwork. Backgrounds are nicely drawn and provide a good atmosphere.\n\nThe game is very simple though and too easy to complete. I played on the hardest of 3 difficulty levels and did not need a walkthrough or hint of any form at any point.\n\nIn fact, one of the most annoying occurences of this game is that it really dioes its best to try to give you hints, even when you don't want one. It has a hint timer and then a stupid book that keeps shaking and desperately wants the player to open it to read an obvious hint or blatant answer. I think it would have been much better to do away with the book and the hint timer on Challenge difficulty mode.\n\nThe story is ok, but a bit daft, but serves the purpose. The ending is poor, as it is so abrupt with absolutuely no confrontation or one last big puzzle. One of the most disappointing endigs I have seen in a game.\n\nThe puzzles are either find inventory items (very easy) or minigame tasks, which are almost all very easy apart from one, which took me about 45 minutes and that was a slider to get a square block past smaller blocks and out of the puzzle frame.\n\nSome of the voice acting is cringeworthy, particularly the attempt at an Italian accent by the person who voices the monastery cook.\n\nIt is a simple, casual game and not a full on adventure game.

It's just very cliche in what puzzles it uses. As per most hidden object games, the cutscene parts are low quality and the voiceacting is pretty bleh. That's par for the course I feel with HOGs. But the puzzles and length and depth of story fall short. You can beat the game pretty quickly and it feels weird.\n\nMost games have logic behind finding this item or that. This feels like someone wanted to make a HOG game and used every cliche HOG concept in them. Find random tools or random objects all the time. Also this isn't a really HOG game in that there are no scenes where you have a lit of items to find. You mainly jsut look for gems or marbles that appear.\n\nOverall while playable, this game doesn't get very high marks in the enjoyable category.

Once quieted, the game was far more enjoyable.","May 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some good puzzles, especially towards the end, but the negatives just tip it the wrong direction. Bad graphics, dodgy voice acting, some quite linear gameplay, and for 2 hrs, too short. The story could have been fleshed out a bit more but felt rushed. For the right price this is a short time killer but don't expect much depth here.","July 7, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you would have asked me during the first half of the game I would have likely said 'sure, buy it on sale', but they took a somewhat interesting religious/fantasy story filled with monks and intrigue and templars and well.. they just dropped the ball. Probably lost it while hiding all those damn marbles. The game is attractive enough. the graphics are not amazing, but nice. , It has some fairly interesting puzzles, though most of them made little sense with regard to story and surroundings and ..sigh.. the storyline.. well we kinda covered that. Don't expect an amazing ending. The voice acting was horrible and lackluster and where it should have drawn me into the story, it left me yawning and wishing a comet would fall on someone's head instead, preferably mine, by the end of the game.\n\nIf you can pick it up for a buck or two, and expect nothing, you'll get an hour or so of something mildly entertaining, at best, to pass the time.","August 10, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Barely any story (and that little is boring), bad visuals for this kind of game, voice acting is terrible, mini games are boring and the game is too short.\nBut music is really good and mystic... that is the only plus I found here.","August 21, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unusual, but you get used to it.\nPuzzles are the strong point of this game, engaging and varied (don't be fooled by the Towers of Hanoi early on, the following puzzles are much better)\nVery nice music\nGraphics are okay, nothing special, good enough for this type of game\nNice in-game achievements but no Steam achievements\nBetween 2.5 and 3.5 hrs playtime\nOverall a good casual game, frustrating at times but always with hints available if needed. You can even skip puzzles.","March 15","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
