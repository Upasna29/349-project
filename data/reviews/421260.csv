But that isn't true.\n\nThe gameplay follows the "Easy to learn, hard to master" scheme, as you'll learn almost everything about the gameplay mechanics in 10 minutes, then you are thrown into randomly generated levels. The challenge there is getting to the highest rank possible - every won game gets you closer to rank promotion, every lost game gets you farther.\n\nRank determines the difficulty of generated levels and provides a big challenge for everybody, as you'll have to keep a winrate better than 50%. While you'll be trying, you'll realize strategies and combos with specific units that you haven't thought before and... well, you'll get better.\n\nThere are two modes, light mode that is best for new players (but also provides a challenge) and dark mode, which was introduced later in Militia (but on Steam it's a expansion that is already included with the basic game). Fighting both orcs and undead is really tough job, you'll often find yourself thinking your plan for some time, as there is no way back after you take your turn. There isn't an undo button, every mistake comes with a regret (and lose, and getting closer to losing your rank).\n\nThe whole presentation, from graphics to sounds, is simply awesome. Graphics are great for the game's intention, you'll just learn few pictograms, falling in love in it meanwhile. Militia is a big surprise for me, as it's simply great game. It features balanced difficulty and it's a pleasure to play for everybody who wants a casual strategy game, or for those who are alone and would like to play a board game.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 5","true","6.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

It was released on December 2nd, 2015 for £4.79. A review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nMilitia is a “bite sized” turn based strategy game which heavily plays like the classic board game chess. The game is simply played with just a mouse and has no controller support. The game has nice contrast between the two competing sides and the ‘board’ on where it is played. No issues arose for me during my time playing Militia. The replay value is very high if you can learn and adapt to a more simple styled game. There are no difficulty options but the enemies get difficult with each level you complete.\n\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\nEasy to Learn – Within a few moments of playing I fully grasped the game controlling my troops with ease. There was a help screen in the game which I did not need\nEver changing challenge – The enemies adapt to you, the levels are randomized and the difficulty ever more increases keeping the challenge fresh.\nMusic  –  The music in the game is really outstanding and a real strong suit to the game. It really adds to the atmosphere. You could easily just leave the game running and enjoy the music.\n\n\nWhat I disliked:\nPrice – The price at £4.79 seems steep for the type of game you’re getting.\nNo control of your units at the start – All the units are placed down randomly posing a greater challenge. I would like some control over where the troops would be placed though. I would also love to have control over what type of troop is gained.\nLimited in turns – You only have a certain amount of turns to kill all troops before losing. You also are heavily outnumbered.\n\nIf you enjoy games like chess and have a great amount of patience for simple games, you could easily find yourself playing this game for long periods of time. The challenges keep rising and the randomization of the game keeps you on your toes. The game may not have a lot of depth but I fully enjoyed the simplicity and the easiness to grasp the game and rules. If you do love chess and any other styled game, this will be enjoyable.\n\nScore: Wait for a sale\n","December 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","1"

Easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nYou pit three random player-controlled units against a much larger number of weaker enemies. You have trickier and more powerful options, but a single mistake means losing 1/3 of your firepower.\n\nThe game has an elegant tutorial and is very quick to learn.\n\nIts ranking system accomplishes two difficult tasks at once: motivation to get better at the game, and an effective difficulty curve. You'll probably blast through the first few ranks easily, but soon you'll find yourself in challenging environments that push you to master the mechanics. I can confidently say this regardless of your skill level or aptitude for this sort of game.\n\nOverall, a great buy for the price. You can play one of two distinct rulesets, either Light or Dark. Light offers much simpler mechanics, with units that jump and attack in easy-to-understand ways. Dark offers complicated individual pieces that do things like push other units, generate explosives, and warp across the edges of the board.\n\nI am excited to see how many hours of play this game offers me.","January 6","true","5.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

The movement patterns are simpler with their limited range but those attack patterns, swap spells and refresh abilities of your units combined with the amount of enemies vs your 3 ones makes you think - or lose. This part makes Militia much more like a table top or the fight part of a classic RPG...with 1 HP units...\nLimited number of turns adds some additional pressure even though to me it seems at the moment that it is more of a rule to prevent endless fights - only have had 1 or 2 fights where i came close to the limit.\nMore frustrating (but also challenging) is the "3 wins vs 1 lose"-mechanic which means you have to clear 3 floors before it's a (real) win and you gain XP but every lose will cost you XP immediately. Those XP are only counted toward a level showing your progress and difficulty level - no upgrades or character progress or something like that involved.\n\nOh, and the game swaps out your remaining 'support' unit if you lose your last 'fighting' unit to give you a better chance...or make your fine plan totally useless after that mistake...","January 5","true","8.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

At the beginning of each round you are placed on a procedurally generated board with the objective of using your given pieces to clear the board of the 'Captain' pieces. The only real way that it's like chess is that any given piece has a specified move set.\n\nThis game is the almost the definition of "Easy to Learn, Hard to Master" the rules are always the same and in theory if you just think hard enough there's no way you can lose! However you always miss that one archer in the corner or that imp. It's strategy in its purest (and arguably best) form.\n\nWhilst the game is local only it scales in difficulty with your ability. The more matches you win the higher your ranking the more difficult the scenarios. However if you fail a match you lose ranking and thus the difficulty decreases. Ideally this means that you slowly hone your skills and hit rank 10! (I'm still only at rank 5... it gets hard fast).\n\nIf that's not enough for you the game also includes the 'Dark World' Expansion which adds an entirely new mode. It features completely new pieces for you and the computer which allow for abilities that wrap around the board, create or detonate explosives and lots of other new abilities that make for an even tougher experience. This again comes with its own laddering system. It pretty much doubles the amount of content in the game.\n\nMilitia is a great game and one I'm likely to lose a fair amount of time to. It's simple yet compelling and likely appeals to a very wide audience including those who do not traditionally play games. The game is great on Steam but also maybe better as a portable game which is available on tablets. The developer also looks to be adding even more content in the future such as endless mode and time attack so it seems that I'll lose even more time to it.\n","December 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game play is emergent from a set of easy to grasp moves that each piece, yours and the computer opponent, can make each term.  Some have likened it to chess, and in some ways it does have that feeling. Mostly when you make a move you think is safe and realize it wasn't. But it doesn't feel like playing chess against a computer (which will generally kick your butt) but rather like an adventure game.  Imagine a tactics game where every move has to be given some careful consideration.\n\nThe play is deliberate and quick. Once you clear a level, you tomble into the next, and it's one of those "just one more..." sorts of things and BOOM an hour or more has gone by!\n\nI recommend this game whole heartidly. It is an example of what really good game designers can accomplish with minimal (but very pleasingly assembled) production values.  To them, I say well done.

Each level is randomized, with different friendly units and initial enemy positions. Similar to chess, every unit has specific movement and attack rules, so gameplay involves planning out where the enemies might move (their movements are randomized within the rules set) and where friendly units can attack. The game can get quite difficult, and losing a match knocks the difficult level down too far, requiring several successful campaigns to compensate. Still, Militia is an engaging, straightforward turn-based strategy game.","January 12","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It is so simple yet so good. The design is well made, and you will learn how to play it very easily thanks to the simple and intuitive tutorial.\n\nIt's basically somewhat similar to chess: you have a checkered board and different units with different movement patterns and abilities (same goes for the enemies). The difference is that you have very few units and all of them are placed in various positions of the board (don't know if randomly or with premade layouts). You can move/use ALL of your units 1 time and then it's the enemy's turn. The objective is to kill the "captains" of the enemy team and not necessarily all of it's units.\nWhen one level is passed you will immediately start a new one, each one getting harder in difficulty, giving the player an increasing challenge. The game also immerses the player directly into the next level without having him click his way through various menu screens, keeping him engaged and willing to play that "one last level".\nGoing on with the levels you will also "unlock" different units, enemies and level layouts.\nThere are also 2 game modes with slightly different game mechanics, one of them a bit more complicated than the other one, both of them interesting.\nElegant and sober art keeps the look and feel so "clean" and swift.\n\nI still haven't played much but I will certainly be playing it again.

Each time you start a new game, you go through three floors of randomly-generated battles, with three units out of five classes on your side and a bunch of enemies with an equal amount of diversity on their side. Everything moves and attacks according to specific, easily-understood rules; for example, the Warriors can move two spaces and cleave all three spaces in front of them, and the Imps can only move two spaces diagonally.\n\nThe goal is to kill all enemy captains marked with a star, but going straight for them is often a bad idea since all units die in a single hit. Keeping track of areas the enemy can attack is as crucial, if not moreso, as it is in more mathematically-complex tactical RPGs like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars.\n\nIf you manage to get through all three rounds, you gain EXP, and if you gain enough EXP, your rank goes up and so does the difficulty of future games. Losing, on the other hand, makes you lose EXP, which can be a bit upsetting since it feels like an arbitrary time-wasting punishment.\n\nLast but not least, there's also "Dark World" mode which has entirely different units from the normal game, as well as Endless and Timed modes.\n\nOverall, this game is great if you want something quick to pick up, puzzle through a few rounds, then put down for another time.","May 5","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, some of the early game difficulty is reasonably easy, but with the new changes to force a bit more strategy and causing you to think about your moves a bit more due to what's on screen and the number of turns, and the game's chess like mechanics do work in that sense. The developer obviously gives a crap about his game and meeting gamers requirements, as he responded rather quickly to my initial video/information, and changed the game in line. So in short: like Chess? Like strategy? Take a look at the game.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/MhFGxq6L93E\n\nLists:\n+:\nGood core strategy elements. Can work on a rather basic level.\nThe Dark Army plays a bit funner then the light, and I like the unconvential mechanics at play here. In particular, even though I didn't like it at first, the force mage was a nice touch and really became fun to use once I got a hold of it.\nGood Implementation of controls to see where you can move, and color coating certain elements of the game (like teleport moves) to understand what it meant.\nAdvanced tactics in refresh mechanics works rather nicely, rewarding players for smart play.\nLike the simple aesthetic and there's a clean look that works rather well.\n-:\nThe AI. The AI's inability to take advantage of the situations at times can lead to easy solutions and can really ruin the experience. The generals in question shouldn't charge you with reckless advantage if they are the last one alive. It's somewhat balanced by the increased difficulty, but it's still something that can be improved.\nSome different objectives would have worked rather well for the long run.\nDo wonder why there's a break up in the light/dark world mechanics. Seems like both would work with each other in the long run, and there's not that much different between the two.\nGeneric music is generic.","December 2, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

Other than that, a hugely interesting and fun game that, as others have said, is reminiscent of chess.","December 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Simple and addictive. Although those always tended to be easy unless you were in the final levels of the minigame, at least the ones I played.\n\nBut this game is like an improvement on that, with interesting mechanics, difficult but doable puzzles, and very out of the box unit abilities that makes great use of a 'wrapping around' affect.\n\nSeriously, when I grabbed this (And it literally only took like five minutes to download) I sat and played it for about three hours. It's that addictive and compelling. So don't be turned off by it's minimalist style, it's a fantastic game.\n\nThe only con I can think of is the music, which is rather obscenely loud by default, but you can turn it down, so it's not that much of a con.","February 22","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pieces in Militia are fantasy creatures with special attacks, but the tactics are stripped down to the point that it plays more like chess but feels like the classic Archon if the battles played out in one click, turn based on the board with each move. The game has a light side and a dark side to play with different pieces in each. You get limited turns to clear the board of captain pieces three times. If you succeed, the game gets harder. That's it. I like it.","January 17","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
