A great concept and fun, but some of the details make it really frustrating, at least in the single player mode. After your inevitable death, you have to start at the very beginning of the level, often going through (awkwardly slow) cutscenes again. You can't hold more than one weapon at once, and when you do have a decent weapon, it's use it or lose it. You can't switch back to your infinite-ammo pistol to save the better gun for something later. I gave up on one of the single player missions because I'm convinced it's not supposed to be possible.\n\nStill, the game manages to be fun, and the multiplayer probably has a lot to offer when you're playing with four friends.","November 25, 2013","true","9.6"," 104 of 150 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","104","150","0","2"

In short, the game has a lot of good mechanics I do enjoy, but the whole game is just marred by dull, uninspired level design and poor choices that make what could be an awesome game far too dull and needlessly difficult to enjoy. The game has a single player campaign, but boasts online multiplayer through a server connection, so you'll need friends and someone to host.\n\nI'll start with the good. The game plays well enough and a controller is recommended. You have a trigger to shoot enemies, a left stick to walk and a right stick to aim. You have a flashlight that you can turn on or off, but since it never runs low on power, why turn it off? Then there's one button to reload and another to interact with things. The interactions are limited and most of the time you're picking up a weapon with the button. Other times you can pull a wall switch using the button.\n\nTo make the game more interesting, you can use the interact button to pick up and place objects that you'll find or forge using scrap. I say forge, but its just paying to have it made. There are gun sentries, flame sentries, barbed wire barricades, bear traps and so on. It turns the game into a tower defense that I rather enjoy, even if the levels are just too dull and simple to get much out of them. The companion, and weapons do their job with the only catch being that you still need to collect things from the corpses. As well as it does its job, i question the choice of targets that the sentries make. When something is closer to them, they chose to shoot a further target. Perhaps that's just closer to their view cone. Whatever the reason, I'd shoot the enemy beating me up than the one further away.\n\nYou'll find a wide array of foes, most of which are inspired or taken from Resident Evil. If you're going to take something, borrow from the best. There are arm stretching mutants, zombie attack dogs, swat zombies, electric zombies and bosses with sack heads wielding chainsaws. Other than that, there are acid sputters, exploding foes, typical zombies and a giant worm of a boss that burrows out of the ground.\n\nThere's a diverse array of things to do with good simple mechanics to do them, such as driving sections, shooting sections, on the fly tower defense and boring turret sections. Shooting zombies from a helicopter the size of ants with a mini gun designed to shoot from the side rather than top down is a needless chore. Having a cool down mechanic only prolongs the experience.\n\nNone of it is all that fun. Shooting feels weak. You can get shotguns, flame throwers and machine guns, but it never affects the zombies in a satisfying way. They all feel equally ineffective and the zombies have the same animation cycle, so if you can get a group of them together, watch as they conga line in sync with one another. The rail gun feels effective, it goes straight through a lot of zombies and everything off screen too. To balance it out, you need to reload after each shot. Chainsaws put you in harms way, because when you get close to a zombie, they can still hit you.\n\nYou start with a trusty pistol that has unlimited ammunition, but a limited clip. Shooting feels sluggish, like its slow to empty an entire magazine. I would say that's your character taking aim. Each of the weapons has a laser sight to ensure that you'll hit a target if your aim is correct. Of course weapons like the rocket launcher fire projectiles, so they have a chance to miss.\n\nThere are alternate weapons that get dropped at random by zombies. You can carry one at a time and there is no way to switch between them. If you get a new weapon, you need to drop your old one. There's limited ammunition and reloading takes quite a while. Of course, in a zombie apocalypse I'd probably take just as long to switch out a magazine. When your alternate weapon runs out of ammo its back to the pistol\n\nDead Sky has a few glaring issues. Nothing game breaking, but they could be improved. The first is its awful voice acting. I'd rather have bad voice acting than no voice acting, but this was a step above abysmal.There's even an announcer to tell you pick ups like "Flame thrower," and "Shotgun."\n\nThe second is the lack of checkpoints for a game with no health. To some people this is a feature, until you feel just how dull the game is with its basic level design such as a cabin in the woods with a square lawn and an underground sewer that's just a single passage with a slimy center to walk through. Having to do these over if you fail becomes a chore. If its too much, there's always a different level of difficulty.\n\nOne of the biggest sins is the camera distance. The game keeps the screen centered on you with only about 35 - 40% to the north, which becomes an issue. I'd rather see more of where I'm going, but I suppose that's a personal preference. This way you can see zombies creep up behind you long before they get to you.\n\nSpeaking of getting to you, sometimes the zombies are a distance away when they hit you. This is demonstrated with the game over screen that freezes the game as is so you can clearly see the distance. For a game that has no health at least early on, this is a big issue. You'll have to compensate and just stay away from zombies, but some of these creatures will chase you faster than you can walk.\n\nWith all the negatives out there, the single player campaign ends with a cliffhanger of what looks to be a level aboard a train followed with "to be continued." While its best to leave an audience wanting more, it feels so short and bland that its an insult to anyone that would get that far. I'd rather have a remix of areas with previously used assets than just have it cut off after six quick chapters; one of which is just a turret section. Its all just to drive you into the multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is relegated to a horde mode with waves of zombies. There's no way to select from games and that hurts the fun. You need to know a server IP to join, so you need a friend, but at least you can purchase a four pack for less than the price of three.\n\nWhen you do play the game online, its a simple survival that borders on tower defense and the best mode it can be. You select from four different uninspiring and small maps that are a mere square of land and you stay alive by purchasing upgrades like health and defense. You lay down traps and turrets. Then you strive to survive. It feels just as tacked on as the entire single player campaign.\n\nDead Sky is a budget game that manages to feel cheap rather than a good game. It has all the right mechanics, but none of the fun. With the extensive diversity it has, its never fleshed out. You use it once then destroy and that sums up the entire experience.","October 17, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This MUST have a lot of fixes, because, as the game is now, it's worse than an Early Access.","March 21, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

An MP oriented shooter, only its unplayable.\n\nHere's the problems:\nYour basic weapon is a pistol, weak and slow. For every weapon pick up you gain two clip with it, after that you drop back to pistol. There is no weapon select even if you take that one extra weapon. The two clip is a joke especially for the railgun and the rocket launcher as these clips consist of 1 shot!.\n\nThe reload minigame is a nice feature but not in a game where millions of zombies running towards you.\n\nThe shop system is broken as time not stops not even in the SP campaign. The upgrades are even more fun as you have to go deeper in the shop's menu in real time. For your hard earned money (scrap-metal) the bought turrets last only a few seconds on normal difficulty (haven't tried harder).\n\nThe screen is too small. The charging type enemies are nearly impossible to avoid as you don't have that small reaction. The poison bomb fatty's poison area is annoyingly high and unavoidable.\nThe best thing that there are two enemies that can and will ATTACK FROM OUTSIDE THE SCREEN (at least on 16: 9 resolution) giving you no chance to do anything. The spitters and the megaannoying pullers are just terrible. The best happens when 2 pullers come, one pulls you out and the second pulls from the first, than the first pulls from the second and they start ping-ponging with me and i cannot do a f@@@@ing thing.\n\nSure it's an MP game but they were nice enough to put in an SP campaign THAT HAS 6 LEVELS! These: 1 is a training defense mission, easy / 2 you are invincible and must drive a car and kill zombies / 3 you must defense a cabin (!) that you abandon when a helicopter comes. If you wait enough and don't take the copter, you can see the bosses too and dies very fast. 4 The only mission that is good, must go through a sewer. 5 Again invincible in the copter shooting helpless zombies down there. 6 Defense mission so hard had to try it 6 times on easy difficulty. The winning screen is just an offense. Seems like a new level but it's not, it's the end.\n\nFor a real MP top-down shooter choose Nation Red, for SP choose Nation Red (yes, that's SP is very good though there is no real campaign) or Dead Horde.","March 23, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While the concept sounds interesting on paper, the execution is far from resembling anything that could ever be mistaken as a fun diversion. Even the title screen comes off as clunky and amateur. And I wish I had heeded the warning bells that screen set off in my head, because the gameplay is far worse. It's actually kind of an impressive achievement, come to think of it-- Dead Sky is so void of entertainment value that it is impossible to even revel in how bad it is.\n\nZombies are supposed to be the pizza of videogames; even bad pizza is still pretty good. And yet Dead Sky somehow manages to make even killing zombies feel boring and tedious. I can honestly say I have never regretted a purchase as much as Dead Sky. Even if the game was free-to-play I would not recommend that anyone play it. There are better trainwrecks out there.

HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!! :-)\n\nDead Sky is a top down, twin stick shooter at heart.  It's simple arcade mayhem with a couple of other other game types thrown in for fun.  The game has lot's & lot's of zombies of all different types and speeds!  It's pretty fun, but very short!  That's really all that matters to me in a game like this.  The fun factor!  To me, it's the perfect Halloween party game!  :-)\n\nI really don't see what everyone is complaining about other than the slowdown which can be avoided if you stand still for a moment, but it is annoying at times.  The screen will freeze for a second and keep doing it randomly until you kill the enemy causing the slowdown.  It usually happens when certain zombie types spawn or when they attack the cabin. Kill them off and the lag will stop!  Sometimes reloading helps too!  So there are some bugs.  That cannot be denied!\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are decent and are somewhat cartoony like the game Crackdown.  There is a black outline around the character models.  It fits the game well.  There are enough options on the game menu to scale the graphic settings for many different video cards.  The lighting and animations are good.  Day and night cycle is great!  Fullscreen and windowed modes supported.\n\nSound:\nSound is okay.  Nothing grinding or annoying.  Voiceovers vary in quality.  Music is cool at times.  Gun sounds and explosions are all done well.\n\nGame Modes:\nSingle player mode consists of 3 different game types.  Top down 3rd person shooting & driving.  You get to run zombies over in a car.  Very simple and easy.  Then there is a FPS sequence from a helicopter going in a circle around a city intersection.   You get to shoot zed's and a boss.\n\nMultiplayer (MP) consists of 4 small coop maps to choose from with a store/workbench to buy stuff in the middle of the map.  I played MP alone, but it is kind of hard alone.  You really need to pickup as much salvage as you can to buy turrets and other items.  One review I read said the turrets only last a few seconds and that is NOT true.  They last a very long time if you protect them from damage!\n\nThe single player campaign is very short, but fun.  The game is really made for multiplayer though, but does feel unfinished and rough around the edges at times.  It's pretty basic.  Kill zombies as fast as you can and stay alive as long as you can!\n\nControls:\nControls are pretty tight and work well.  You aim with the mouse and walk with WASD.  You CAN shoot while walking which is always nice!  So you can walk in any direction and shoot in any direction at the same time.  Pickup and place items with "E".  There are a few onscreen icons to click on to change items.  The controls are NOT clunky and are responsive.  Key binding and gamepad support.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's an arcade game.  If you go in thinking that way, the limited ammo in the weapons is forgiving.  You get different random weapons all the time and sometimes must choose which one you want.  Usually the closer weapon is the best weapon! lol :-)\n\nYou walk at a good pace and faster than most of the enemies!  I have never gotten stuck or caught on objects.\n\nAll the weapons are cool and feel powerful, but are pretty standard and limited.  Ammo usually lasts until a new weapon drops, or you just go back to your starting pistol which has unlimited ammo.  The flamethrower is awesome!  Even your starting pistol shoots pretty fast and is fairly strong.  Two or three good head shots usually does the job!   Just keep your weapons reloaded at all times!\n\nReloading is NOT a chore and becomes second nature!  You have to reload in many games anyway.  Now, if you successfully reload "Gears of War" style, you get a 30% increase in damage for that clip.  It's pretty easy to do and doesn't distract from gameplay at all.  If you miss the mark trying to get the 30% damage increase, you get penalized with a slight delay in reload time, but only like an additional second or two.  Your gun doesn't jam or anything like that.\n\nNote that you DO NOT  have to try and get the damage bonus.  You can just hit the "R" key once and reload with normal damage ammo.  It only takes a couple of seconds to do a normal reload.  If you do want the 30% damage increase, you must hit the "R" key to start the reload process, then hit the "R" key again at the right moment to get the 30% damage increase.  It's not that hard and I usually get it every time now!\n\nSlowdown is there and it does distract from the gameplay at times.  If they had fixed the slowdown problems, the game would have gotten much better reviews IMO.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a fun zombie survival game IMO and could have been awesome with a little more work!  The game does have major issues that can be a game breaker for some people, but it can be a lot of fun IMO!!!  I recommend this game to diehard zombie fans ONLY!  Are you a diehard zombie fan?\n\nRight now, at $2.50, it is a great deal IMO!  Get it while it's hot! :-)  It's going back to $5 Nov 3rd!!!  I'm going to play it some more and maybe update this review.  I've gotten worse games that cost a lot more!  I give it 3 stars out of 5!\n\n\nPROS\n+ Fun arcade style zombie killing splatterfest\n+ Single Player campaign\n+ Multiplayer Coop Mayhem\n+ Many different enemy types, including zombie dogs\n+ Random boss battles\n+ Nice graphics style, smooth animations & special effects\n+ Creepy atmosphere and lighting, with day & night cycle\n+ Bloody & gory as it should be\n+ Fast & furious gameplay\n+ Random weapon drops\n+ Deployable turrets, mines & traps\n+ Weapons feel powerful with laser sights & moveable reticle\n+ Tight controls with key binding support\n+ Gamepad support\n+ Both fullscreen and windowed modes supported\n+ Cheap price for a PC/Mac/Linux game\n+ Zombies Chainsaws & Flamethrowers! Oh Boy!\n\nCONS\n- Game feels unfinished and low on content\n- Game lags and briefly locks up at times\n- No developer support\n- Very short single player campaign\n- Only 4 multiplayer maps\n- Game gets repetitious fast\n- Barely enough time in between rounds/waves to buy stuff from the store/workbench\n\n\nHere are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.","October 31, 2014","true","1.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've played some many almost broken indie games, but this one takes the cake. The sad thing is, if the developers actually played their game to see how poor it was they may have had a decent game.\n\nFrom what I could get through in the single player, it appears there are two phases. First a typical top-down shooter. You walk through generic, uninspired levels and kill zombies along the way with very little threat.\n\nThe second stage is the tower-defense/swarm segment, this is the completely broken part.  The swarm begins immediately, so you never really get a chance to prepare your defenses. If you get your first sentry down, you already have a huge backup of enemies. Fine, can handle them. The further into the wave you get, the more enemies/specials run at you. You MIGHT be able to get the third turret down at the cost of another.\n\nSkip this one. Generally on steam if the reviews are "mostly negative" it's completely broken. This game is completely broken.","November 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

The game is also poorly  optimized, medium settings and still getting framedrops in a game like this? The aiming is kind of slow and sluggish and the "turret speed" that i'm guessing is the mouse option is kind of weird, can't change it... or better, somehow i did it, it went from 7 to 5 but i seriously didn't even know how.\nIt's a mess of a game and there are better options out there, the good side of this game is that it offers a good challenge if you're up to it (aka ignore the problems), i only played 10~15m and it was enough for me, maybe i would play a little more if the game run better.","April 3, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either I'm skilled or the game is to easy and short. I dont know if they are exstending it or leaving it to be a 40 minute game but there are fun suvival maps that you can play with friend. I think this game is going in a good direction but it needs more game modes better JOIN as you have to type in IP addresses to the server you want. Yes there are alot of negitive things in this review but the game style and the game play was fun! But lack of content is letting the game down. 4/10","September 7, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave up on the second level when I found no way to heal myself. special weapon ammo is spotty at best, and I never got to a point where I could really try the turrets, though the first level would indicate it to be lacking. The lighting was far too dark as well, though that may just be more my monitor then anything else. If they ever give this game some serious TLC i might give it another shot, but at this point, it's just not worth playing.","August 21, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel that there are some area of the game that can be improve on like when you in the helicopter and need to kill 25 zombie the mini gun should be able to hit multiple target or there should be some explosive barrel that you can hit to take out multiple of them, since that picticular part I a little tideous. The secound thing that should be added is a dodge mechanic because it would be useful when you get surounded.\n\nOverall the is a good time waster if you have nothing better to do\nHere a video of my let play of the game  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_YQbbgGFvFsgyHr19hq1PQ","January 27","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
