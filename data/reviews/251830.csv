It's pretty much a must buy, especially at this price. It's about a 4-5 hour game that will continuously make you smile. Where some of the frustration coming from the gameplay is mediated immediately by the hilarious characters and overall lighthearted feel of the game. It's like playing a comedy act, in a sense. It has an amazing artstyle, unique and very pretty. "So much art... such beauty" to paraphrase a certain seagull. The printscreens really doesn't do the game justice.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a mixture between platforming, point and click and stealth. It's fine, nothing incredible, but it does it's job. It isn't too hard to progress. It does suffer from having the game be in the way of everything else, where you just want to get past these annoying stealth sessions to get to the good/fun part. The writing and voice acting shined a lot brighter than the gameplay did. This made the mood go down a bit when if you're a complete ♥♥♥♥-up you will be stuck at a few points for a while, but as said before, the game will make it up to you with it's intelligent writing, more or less hilarious humor, artstyle, new and intriguing situations.\n\nBuy this game, now, please. Go do it. It's the most I've laughed in a game since Psychonauts and it's really something everyone should play. It's a game with personality, a personality you will like, and that's sort of rare. Have fun.","December 14, 2013","true","4.8"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","0"

The graphics reminded me of Psychonauts, another great game. That's also where the comparison (mostly) stops. Because this game is charming, fun and original, and it manages to do all that all on its own, without the need to copy from other popular games.\n\nYou play as Ray and early on in the story you manage to get an arm sticking out of your head. Not just an arm, it's actually an alien that makes use of your body. With this arm you can read the minds of other people to get hints on what to do next, but some of the people will also be reminded or think of certain events and that way items can be created.\n\nThe game plays like a platformer, but the gameplay itself is similar to that of a point-and-click adventure. Minus the frustrating, boring puzzles those games usually have.\n\nThe voices are done very well, with plenty of variety as far as characters go.\n\nIt's just a shame that this game is so short. A playthrough will last around 4 hours, which is enough, but it's not enough for a wonderful game like this. I enjoyed it all the way through and never got frustrated. That's partly the reason why I hoped it would last longer. Maybe for a possible sequel (the game does hint at one after all).\n\nA game like this should be a critical and financial success. It truly deserves to be. But I seriously doubt that will happen...\n\nAnyway, let's wrap this up. My verdict: Stick It To The Man is a must-play and must-own for any serious gamer !\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","December 19, 2013","true","5.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Few games venture into the realm of comedy, but Zoink jumps in head first with no reservations. Every line and character is progressively more absurd than the last, with each joke zipping by so fast you might miss it if you aren’t paying attention but making it easy to enjoy the ride due to having little time to actually dissect what’s going on.\n\nstick it to the man pic 1If you were to break it down I doubt Stick It To The Man would elicit much more than a chuckle, but it’s how fully embedded it is in its ridiculous plot and satirical commentary that makes it all work. Every time I started the game it would take a moment to adjust to its outrageous style of humor, but a few minutes later I’d be sticking stickers all over things they don’t belong on and having an immensely good time watching the chaos unfold. Stick It To The Man is like a roller coaster that only goes up, with the stakes and quality of gags getting more and more insane the longer the game goes on even as you’re waiting for it to all come falling apart.\n\nThat’s not to imply Stick It To The Man is a particularly long game, clocking in around 3-4 hours, but it’s so densely packed that I think that’s all I could realistically take. It often felt like I’d been playing longer than I actually had simply do to how much stuff was always happening and continuing to happen even while I was trying to comprehend the scene before. It’s frankly a little exhausting to play, but in a way that makes you glad for its brevity because it ends right when you want it to.\n\nThere’s undeniably a lot of Stick It To The Man that’s little more than functional boredom, whether it’s the dull and obtuse puzzle designs or the few aggravating times you come across an enemy and have to manage the clumsy platforming controls to avoid them. There are only a few instances of this sprinkled throughout the game yet each always longer and worse than the last time you came across one. These scenes might work on a technical level, but there’s never any need for them to have been included.\n\nBut then everything circles around again to how delightfully written Stick It To The Man is even at its worst moments, and how that was more than enough to counteract its mechanical deficiencies for me. It’s as stupid as it is clever and delivered with enough style to make even the most cringeworthy joke work. Even though I can’t say I had a lot of fun playing Stick It To The Man, I was more than happy to spend some time reading the minds of its terrible, oh so entertaining hooligans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NzuvA9nImg\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I simply can't leave this game uncommented even after only this little amount of time - here I'm sitting, listening to the menu music 4th time in a row. I actually listened it once in the menu before starting the game, it's so awesome (Just Dropped In by Kenny Rogers) The game is really promising - intresting paper world with lots of fourth wall breaking (Ray noticing about how absurd that he has to jump a lot to get to home during a tutorialish first level, checkpoints are photocopiers what prints you as respawning), really well-written and witty dialogues with puns, jokes, and don't forget about the great voice-acting!\nThe game itself is a little weird, it reminds me to some cartoons of the 90s in terms of graphics that's borderline bizarre and weird, but this also gives the game some uniqueness - speaking about being unique, don't forget the "giant pink spaghetti hand".\nSo far platforming mechanics are solid and controls of the character, including the arm are easy to get used to - the mindreading is a great idea, I'm really looking forward for some good laughs and creative problem-solving using this tool.\nI'm really looking forward to continue to play this game, but first I really need some sleep, I'll update the review probably after the completion the game and/or getting all achievements :)\n\nEDIT: Finally finished - 15.8 hours, with lots of afk/desktop running. I would say people are quite right when they say the game is ~ 5-6 hours long , but it really depends on you listening to every single person, or just skip it.\nThe game was fantastic, intresting and I'm especially happy that the story stayed just as solid at the end as it was at it's beginning. I've found quite a few instresting sentences, dialogues, pictures that made me laugh - I even got to save Santa! :)\nThe final level was outstandingly creative - don't want to spoil anyone's joy of exploration - I'll just say it can be hard with mothers  ;)\n\nStick It To The Man! was maybe the most unique game I've played in the past months, along with Jazzpunk.  This game was really a joy to play, always staying curious about what madness the developers put into the next scene.

Your main goal, thanks to being able to read their minds, is to help those in need with an 'extra' arm/hand that grew out of your head (weird, I know~!).

The paper art style is really amazing and the characters you meet along the way all fit the crazy and stylized look. Mechanics enhance the 2D platforming and support the humor of the diologue.\n\nThis is a truly funny game (if you like this kind of bizarre comedy) which is something that not many games can say about themselves.\n\nIf you liked Psychonauts at all, you will like this game. It has similar themes, style, humor, and even a similar name for the main character. The game is somewhat nostalgic with the paper/cardboard art and is very fun to play (if you don't mind being stopped to hear some minor characters engage in a bit of banter every two minutes).","August 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The jokes were close by, each of them funny and punchy. The music was fun - most of it wasn't memorable at all, yet it fit perfectly, but the title song was magic. The art was unique, original, fun, and throughout the game world are little background and foreground jokes that add a bit of spice to an already fantastic looking game. Characters were lively, silly, voiced EXCELLENTLY, their inner thoughts giving way to some very good jokes - it's little homages to gaming were tasty icing to naturally good comedy - that actually handle scat humour with real wit. You learned to love our little protagonist and his head... thing. While the puzzles were strange, they made sense, and the wonderful thing about this game that they were solved simply by curiously peeking into peoples thoughts everywhere you went, and you wouldn't play this game if you didn't want to do that. And, like many other people, the game is actually fun for the brief sections where you run from the guards. Those parts get harder with a proper curve, and are fun, and briefly exhilirating. It was a nice way to counter balance the slow puzzling. And the length? It had a story to tell, and it told it quickly. This kind of game was more like a movie than anything else, and the running gag can only last so long. So, by not making looong pointless areas, they condensed everything to a perfectly proportioned pie of funny and pictures and visual stimuli, with a quick, fun story. I wouldn't want it longer, because everything they did felt good. I didn't feel like I wanted more - was satisfied, and laughing. And that, with good voice acting, art style, jokes, pacing, gameplay, game mechanincs, characters, music, and identity, is really, all you can ask for, isn't it? And this game had all of that in SPADES. LARGE SPADES. SHOVELS, EVEN.\n10/10, Liked It, 5 Stars, *****. And it's not satanically expensive! Buy it!\nBuy it now!

Sure, it deals with similar subject material and has a similar design aesthetic, but that's like saying "EVE Online is a spiritual successor to Galaga". The games are barely similar, the matching artstyle is the closest you're going to get.\n\nSITTM plays more like a graphic novel with limited adventure game puzzle solving mechanics. You'll get that nice rewarding feeling from putting the right item into the right slot, but the majority of your time will be spent patiently listening to every mind-reading audio file, regardless of whether or not the puzzle is already solved. You will feel a compulsive need to read EVERY mind you come across, even if it's unnecessary, and you probably should because there's an achievement for it. Ultimately, while having the game come to a stop every 30 seconds so you can read a new mind does indeed break good, natural gameplay flow into splintery pieces, I immediately forgive it. The game is never boring, and no amount of dialogue could stop be from being impressed by the beautiful design.\n\nWell... I SAY that, but I never actually finished the game :/.\n\nThe game plays in 2.5D, and I have to say, I've played with better platforming controls. The protagonist can swing to designated areas and manipulate certain pieces of backdrop, but regular jumping to certin platforms is finnicky, and you will find yourself slipping off quite often if you didn't jump PERFECTLY.\n\nI would have rated this game way lower, but it's rare to find a game that makes me laugh so damn hard.

I wasn't expecting it to be the type of game where you have to tactially avoid baddies & make sure you jump correctly to certain ledges. I found this element frustrating as the game went on as it was a case of repeated the same actions over & over again. The puzzle solving in the game was too simple & obvious. I missed that feeling you get whilst playing an Adventure Game of trying to work out things to progress further. The storyline was also pretty basic and almost as two dimensional as the cardboard characters. It's main strenghs for me were the ideas, art & humour. This game is packed full of quirky ideas & creativity. I have never played a game like it before. The Game Design is simular to Little Big Planet with a linear 2D layout. Another strong point was how much you (Ray) feel like an outsider during the game. By mainly interacting by listening to things thoughts, whilst being ignored, it made it seem like you were an alien on your own planet. It juxaposes the other characters who we feel are really the wacky ones.

It's not too terribly challenging/tricky, but there are a few points now and again where it becomes unclear what exactly you're supposed to do next and it'll either take a while of back and forths trying various things or finding access to a new section, or seeking out a walkthrough.","January 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This, combined with the world aesthetic can lead to some pretty extraordinary and hilarious situations. And when I say hilarious, I mean times I genuinely laughed at the clever dialogue and puzzles before me. I even went through and tried to find all the funny dialogue I could, which is quite the achievement.\n\nThe aesthetic for the game is a world made of paper, string to hold things in place, and stickers. With your giant purple hand, you can remove and place stickers in different situations to solve puzzles. For example, if you place a horse head next to a singer, she'll think she's being attacked by the mob, and scream, at which point you can take her screaming mouth and use it somewhere else. It's very creative, fresh, and compelling.\n\nThe story and characters were very likable, especially Ray. He wasn't a perfect person, but he made a perfect protagonist. Paired with lovely voice acting, it was truly something special.\n\nIf I had one problem with it, I would say that there were too many chase areas in the levels. While you could create a checkpoint after clearing it once, there were too few ways to solve them for the number of times it was iterated, and often was unreliable at times when trying to grab thoughts and hitting pins instead, resulting in a quick death.\n\nAll in all, this game was a nice experience. It didn't take too long to beat, around 5 hours, but the time I did spend with it was incredible. An excellent story wrapped up in a competent game with an amazing presentation.","September 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/251830/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Stick it to the Man! is an adventure game, using 2D puzzle-platforming as the vehicle for its clumsy humor. You'll solve puzzles by reading people's minds, and manipulating them into thinking about a certain item that you can use somewhere else on the chapter. It's certainly not a hard game, with it nicely structured levels, always subtly guiding your way, never proving frustrating.\n\nIt's been said to be "Psychonauts" spiritual successor. While I have not played Psychonauts, I've played other Double Fine games, and the influence is clear! While the game mechanics don't seem to take the spotlight, they're very well conceived, and fit very well with the game's theme and aesthetics. It was one of the more enjoyable games I've recently played!\n\n\nPresentation\nThis is probably the highlight in this game. Everything from the visuals, to the music and the voice acting is awesome!\nIt's a very colorful game, done in 2.5D. This is achieved by making every sprite like a cardboard cutout. The levels are then set in layers. While the game is mostly 2D, you can sometimes walk back and forth, discovering some charming details that would otherwise be blurred.\nThe character design is also great. While everyone looks silly, their designs clearly shows their personality, coupled with the problems you'll solve and the voice acting... It's good.\n\nThe music is mostly jazz (it reminded me of the bebop soundtrack in Grim Fandango, maybe a bit silly at times) with a bit of sci-fi synth thrown in, at times. I really liked it, and it's certainly something that not only fit the game, but it's also something I'll listen to after I'm finished with the it! (You can get it here: http://stickittotheman.bandcamp.com/releases with a PayWhatYouWant model)\nThe sound-effects Also fit well with the cartoony style. Never felt out of place, so that's good.\n\nThe voice-acting was also great! Reinforcing the characters and the overall feel of the game, and was mostly well done! There were a few characters that felt a bit inconsistent, but nothing too major. Also, you can rewind and fastforward their speech, making the voices even sillier, with a higher tone, if you're in a hurry. It's these details that make this game so enjoyable, honestly!\n\nThe game's writing is great as well! It's not anything deep, as you can imagine (although it does hint at some major issues, in a very lighthearted way), but it's certainly funny, if you're into this kind of humor.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nThe game's divided by chapters, each with its theme, set of characters and puzzles. You can always go back to previous chapters through the menu, so you don't need to worry about missing an objective and being blocked from going back. This is something I very much appreciate! I hate being blocked for apparently no reason.\nMost of the chapters also have some achievements. Most of them are just a guide to silly characters that were more well hidden. It's a good use of them, to be honest! There are a couple of them that were more skill-based, if you're into that. But the Stick it to the Man! is a very laid-back game, and it never really tests your skills or patience.\nEach level has lots of checkpoints, and you'll never lose any progress. The worst that can happen is you being sent a few meters back, but you never lose items or conversations.\n\nEach level is about 20-40 minutes long. It felt just the right length for me. I played each chapter in one sitting, sometimes 2, and it never felt too short or to drag on. Also, since the levels can be fairly long, walking back would be a pain. As such, they've implemented a sort of fast travel system. Once you reach a certain point, a pipe open up, and you can go back instantly (and go forward once again).\n\nIt's a very comfortable game to play, as weird as it sounds. It's never frustrating, you're unlikely to walk around back and forth pointlessly, it's not punishing... just a nice, funny experience, overall.\n\nMechanics\nBasically, you're hit on the head, and an alien just happens to casually get into your brain. When that happens, a giant floppy pink hand grows out of your head, which only you can see. Nah, of course you're not crazy! It's alieeeens.\n\nAnyway. This giant hand gives you the ability of reading people's minds, and materialize their thoughts. As freeing as it sounds, it's a very "linear" game. They'll only think of things you need, of course.\nWhen you encounter a character, you'll learn about their problems, and then have to find the solution, somewhere. The game's is very similar to a point n' click. However, while the solution aren't too obvious, at first (since they're very non-sensical -- in a good way!), you can easily find everything by walking around and getting more items. If you have more than one, you'll store them, and can switch between them with the mouse-wheel.\nIf you stay put, your character will also say something about the item, leading you in a general direction. There are also very subtle environmental hints, so I doubt you'll get stuck.\n\nSo yeah. You'll walk around the level, speaking to the characters and reading their thoughts, often leading to some very peculiar situations, as you solve their problem in funny ways.\n\nAgain, it's not a game you'd play for the mechanics, but they're still very well put together! They fit with the theme, and even amplify it, never proving a nuisance, unlike other games in a similar style. It's very well designed!\n\n\nIt's pretty hard for me to get more to talk about. The game is very good, but it doesn't seem to do anything that jumps out at you. Everything just seems to fit together brilliantly, to me.\n\nFor an adventure game, the 2D platforming certainly helped, against the traditional Point n' Click style\nUsually, games like this opt for the point n' click genre, rather than 2D platforming. As a result, their movement system is also very clunky and slow, going around the screens, taking seconds of waiting at a time. Stick it to the Man! avoids that entirely, by giving you total control at all times!\nIt makes the game incredibly better, in my eyes. It's not that I have anything against Pn'C games, but I usually find myself frustrated when I have to walk back and forth very slowly, simply to try a random combination of items.\nThis game, however, makes movement faster, and every scene seems to have some little detail that makes the walking around even more enjoyable.\n\nLack of punishment\nThere are games that benefit from being punishing and challenging. This is not one of them, and the developers recognized it very well. It's not that there isn't any challenge. There certainly is (mostly by being chased around the guards -- which people didn't enjoy very much!), but even if you "fail", you don't lose progress, and the more challenging sections are short, just keeping things varied.\n\nThe puzzles keep moving you forward\nLast point I want to make. You rarely have to backtrack to solve a puzzle, at least to the point of annoyance. You'll usually gather items as you go, and use them either very near the place, or further ahead. On the times you do have to go back, the solution are clear, and there's usually an easy game to get back. Again, the point of the game is to present you with a silly story and character interactions, and it does that very well!\n\nConclusion\nI don't have anything else to say, honestly. I really, really enjoyed the whole way through. It's on the short side, but it's certainly worth it. If you like Double Fine's games (the Stacking and Grim Fandango particularly coming to mind -- And Psychonauts for most people), give this one a go! I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\nEven if you don't... if the description sounds appealing, I still recommend it. It's just a very good game!","January 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player controls the main character Ray, who has a glowing purple space spaghetti thing sticking out of his head. Ray uses this to read the minds of other characters. In pursuit of his own goals Ray must help other characters fix their life problems which are usually quite humorous (though sometimes I found them pretty sad). Most of the gameplay consists of simple platforming in the pursuit of various items and characters. There are sections where Ray must avoid enemy agents. These sections can be pretty tough in the last couple sections, but death just results in you being printed out of a nearby Mr. Copy so its not that frustrating.\n\nThe game looks and sounds amazing. The soundtrack has a lot of jazz numbers with sprinkles of other stuff like disco or Mickey Newberry's "What Condition My Condition Is In". It all fits well with the environments and mood of the game. The paper cut-out look works great and is bright and colorful. Also this game could run on a toaster. I was downsampling from 4K and it was still running at 80 fps.\n\nWhere this game really shines is the writing and humor. All the characters, even the most minor ones have a real personality to them. I was laughing within the first minute and proceeded to do so for the entire game. There were even some moments that found a way to be funny, sweet, and sad all at the same time. That and a heavy dose of self-awareness make a really compelling experience.\n\nI clocked in around 4.5 hours for my playthrough but it is definetly worth it for the price.","May 14, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/251830/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","A severely overlooked game - it seems like it has a really small amount of players across all of its platforms; and yet I imagine that there is a really large amount of people who would enjoy this game so much!\n\nNow, the first thing that I will say is that the game is pretty short and can be completed (100%) in 5 hours, or probably under that. However, I did not regret my purchase of this game at all. Worst case scenario for you: Just buy it on sale, and you should have no issues.\n\nThis game is so unique and drew me in much more than I expected. The story, from a high-level perspective, is a bit cheesy, and the villain of the game is also somewhat annoying and lacks thrill, BUT that is intentional to fit with the overall style of the game. It is really off-the-wall, filled with random silly jokes and a good bit of dark humor (a couple of places are surprisingly dark), but it all flowed together, in an intentionally messy way.\n\nThe art is in this paper and sticker format, which actually was done in such a way that I enjoyed it very much. It was not tacky at all. Everything is very well drawn, and a good amount of the level design and characters have this interesting sort of dreary, grimy look. Some items, buildings, people, and so on, are brighter and stand out from everything else that has a background tone or shading, but the background itself is really detailed and by all means should be looked at just as much as the stuff with which you interact.\n\nThe theme song of the game was a very good pick, and the sounds and music as you play are pretty simple in most places, but also enjoyable. I did not have a problem with anything that I heard in the game. Then you have the voice acting, which was amazing. So many characters voiced by a small amount of people, and they were definitely unique as well. I didn't notice any characters sounding too close to each other.\n\nThe game itself is split into chapters, or essentially levels, and you must explore the levels and solve small puzzles where other characters are wanting specific objects. You must find the objects either lying around somewhere, or by obtaining them from other characters. As you help certain characters out, they will sometimes do things like break/open doors for you to continue on in the level, or end up giving you another item that you will have to figure out how to use. While the general idea is simple or not necessarily exciting, the game really benefits from its style as mentioned above, as well as the actual gameplay of how you will do the puzzle-solving.\n\nYour character, Ray, has an accident and ends up with a weird arm sticking out of his head, which in and of itself allows for the gameplay. The game is an interesting mix of platforming and point-and-click, where you use your mouse to control the arm and grab objects that you need, as well as do something stranger: read other characters' minds. When you read their minds, you will sometimes just hear thoughts and jokes, while other times will give you hints about what to currently do in a level (e.g., what a character might be looking for), or even end up having a character release a thought cloud which contains an item that you can grab and carry with you.\n\nDon't worry, though: You shouldn't get bored by the above, as the level design and characters are very interesting (as I know I have said multiple times so far), and just about every time you give an item to someone, a cutscene will occur showing some wacky events happening that will very likely make you laugh (assuming you enjoy the humor of the game). Hence, I had fun every single minute of the game, running around and figuring out what to do with so many weird items and people you encounter.\n\nAgain, I will say that the game surprised me. I watched some of the trailers and thought it seemed really odd, and maybe funny, but I didn't go in with any fancy expectations. It turned out to be a lot more than what I felt while watching the trailers. So, unless you absolutely hate the scenes in the trailers, I would say to give the game a chance, even if you are on the fence or somewhat unsure. I expect that you will also be surprised like I was. I really recommend this game.","March 31","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer that's more of a point-and-click, but neither of those facets of the game aren't super successful.\n\nThe main mechanics of Stick it to the Man! are reading people's minds to gather information and manipulating the world by peeling off stickers and placing them on other things to solve problems, all while avoiding government agents out to get you.\n\nThe mind reading part is tedious. The voice acting is great, but some characters speak very slowly and by the time you finish reading the subtitiles, the character is only halfway through his or her speech. Dialogue cannot be skipped in pieces or scrolled through, only sped up or skipped entirely.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't anything special. One of the recurring "puzzles" (if you may call it that) is escaping the agents trying to get you. I didn't enjoy any of these segments. I'm assuming the game expects you to cleverly sneak around the enemies, placing stickers on them to make them fall asleep or distract them. However, this is usually impossible to do as you can't see all the agents on the screen at once and you have only a few seconds before they notice you and start chasing you around. It's much easier to just run to the other side than trying to spend time sticking stickers on people and getting caught.\n\nStick it to the Man's strongest element is its art style. The character design is amazing as every character looks unique with a different personality. Everything has a cardboard or paper-y texture, but it's different than, say, Paper Mario. It's almost as if the game would be stronger as a cartoon instead of a video game, or maybe if the focus was more on a point-and-click style than a platformer.\n\nOverall, I don't think I can recommend this game as a game, but, if you like art and design, it might be worth it to at least try it.","July 2, 2014","false","4.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

There are some platforming challenges involved, but calling them "challenges" is really stretching the definition of the word. The whole thing definitely leans on the casual side of the gaming fence, but what it lacks in challenge it more than makes up for with a great soundtrack, stylized and attractive visuals, and writing/voice acting that at the least got me to smirk for most of my playthrough if not made me laugh out loud a few times.\n\nA short but thoroughly enjoyable experience and a game I'd highly recommend giving a shot.","December 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoyed my time, but I can only recommend the game if you like a style and bizzare sense of humor (it's a pretty short game, you need 4-5 hours to finish it on your first playthorugh).\n\nI like a style and a humor, and first couple of levels are very-very fun. Cut-scenes are fun and the game doesn't show you the same cut-scene if you die. If you replay some level, press backspace for 5 seconds to skip.\n\nVoice acting is very good, and most of the dialogs are funny. And you can hold 'd' to speed up the speech if you are bored.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of things I didn't like: it can be a problem with my PC, but controls feel clunky to me. I spend a lot of time retrying jumps of moving platforms. And I am not a new person to the platformers genre. Controls aren't rebindable (at least from the menus). Sometimes you think you can make the jump, but the platform is a bit far away. This won't be a problem, but you have goons in this game.\n\nFirst two or three encounters with goons are good. However, after some time goons are not fun anymore. I just hoped it's the last goon on this level. Good thing you are not forced to do the same section more than once, developers provides you short cuts after you beat the section.\n\nAnd the last thing: I liked some quests, but a lot of them are illogical. I finished a lot of the puzzles with brute force, and  sometimes, couldn't get a logic even after finish.","March 8, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The characters, voice acting, and art complimented the game in a way I too rarely see. Very entertaining overall.\nThe downside, it's short. I mean 5 hours max. I had played it for 3.5-4 hours, put it down. Started to play again the next day, and was disappointed to find that I was already at the end. It leaves you wanting more. A satisfying experience overall though. I would give it a 8/10, if it were longer it would probably hit 9/10.","May 4","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However I was taken by surprise. This is not a point and click adventure game - it's a platformer and a damn good one at that!\n\nThere are some really tricky platforming challenges throughout the 9 chapters. You will be swinging and jumping from platform to platform to out run the bad guys. The actual puzzles in the game are more trial and error, there were moments where I was absolutely stuck and couldn't work out what to do next,  and had to result to just spam clicking each object in hope something happened.\n\nControl wise, very simple. I used the Xbox controller and had absolutely no problems at all. I can imagine it would be a little more difficult with keyboard and mouse, but name me a platformer that isn't like that.\n\nThe story is actually quite enthralling as well.  I didn't really think that such a simple looking game would have such a fulfilling story.  I couldn't wait to find out how the game ended. There are plenty of little "side stories" which all come with some sort of value to the puzzles as a whole.\n\nThe games definite strong point is the humor in the writing. I was laughing throughout the whole playthrough and if you like a good laugh while playing a video game, you will not be disappointed here.","June 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

Stick it to The Man! is an alternative graphic style game which is pulled off really well, (As well as the protagonist pulls walls off buildings) and I mean really, really well. The music is nice and fitting as well, and the voice acting is of good quality, but that's as far as this game goes. The storyline, I honestly believe they just made it up as they went along, and the dialogue is often cheap, (I'm willing to forgive them for that though, they had to include some cheap dialogue to have as many jokes as what they did (and they had a lot, mostly irony and dark humour, but some satire against popular culture as well) prepare to be pun'd) but the most disapointing part of the game is the gameplay itself, it is literally just a combination of zelda style item collecting / trading, and hostile encounters that pretend to add gameplay, but aren't very well expanded on. This game isn't a puzzler, it's a storyline grind without a storyline, and for that reason I give it a thumbs down, but if it were the free online flash game that it is meant to be, then even if the graphical fidelity wouldn't be nearly as amazing, it would do really well. If you are buying games full price; avoid this game.\n\n[EDIT] I forgot to mention, this game does work extremely well with a gamepad, so if you can, then use one.","December 27, 2013","false","6.7"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","1"

You play as a dude who has an alien in his brain, which gives him mind reading powers and, since the alien is basically a stretchy arm, the ability to jump between platforms and grab things like stickers.\n\nThere is a lot of dialog, which might not be unusual for an adventure game, but I feel like I'm never really playing the game. I was unexpectedly shuffled out of a level without being able to finish all of the tasks, because there was no indication to which tasks were the important ones. The game is full of strangers in the city that you have to help, as you run from some bad guys trying to catch you because of the alien attached to your brain.\n\nTo find out what each stranger needs, you have to read their minds with the sticky arm, which is a really cool, unique feature. But like I said, it slows down the game play so much and a lot of the tasks feel really pointless. The graphics are awesome as well, and I love the paper world feel. But the platforms are easy to jump between, or just frustrating when you've got identical bad guys chasing you so that rather than enjoy the new area you just discovered, you have to instead rush through it to get away.\n\nI really want to love this game, but it's almost impossible. Also, the adventure puzzles are really easy to solve. Once you read everyone's minds, it's really easy to see that you just visit a bunch of places in order and grab the stickers from them and put them elsewhere.\n\nAnd this one is really just my opinion, but the characters are so overly dramatic and cliche that I find it grating. I realize they're probably like this on purpose, but for a game with more adult themes it's weird how cartoonish and childish the cast is.\n\nIf you really want to experience this game, maybe wait for it to go on sale. Who knows? You might really like it. It's not a horrible game, but definitely not one I would recommend to buy at full price.","December 16, 2013","false","1.5"," 10 of 33 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","10","33","0","0"

The story is kinda serviceable in a not-very-realistic-at-all way, but of course the humour is the selling point.\n\nI found the puzzles to be fair in difficulty.

Like Psychonauts - game’s obvious influence - its humor is self-referential and clever, while peeking into minds of others is thrilling, and can be scary sometimes.\n\nGeoff Thew in his review[www.hardcoregamer.com] gives great examples of the type of humor you can expect here:\n\nStick It to The Man is an eminently sly and self-aware game. This is a story of paper men living in a sidescrolling world, and they know it. The hazmat container only drops in the first place because the paper airplane carrying it falls apart in a storm. Ray always forgets how much jumping is involved in his morning commute, but when lost he remembers that the way home is to “go right, and then go right, and then pretty much keep going all the way to the right.” This is classic adventure game humor with a sharp edge, and it’s riotously funny.","October 7, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the dialogue got really long widned, and I found myself skipping most portions going "yeah yeah, get this over with", but something compelled me to finish it. What was that something? I'm gonna DEFINITELY say the art direction. It's simple, elegant, and definitely has the psychonauts/little big planet look that I find so hilariously charming. It isn't a difficult game, but it was good enough to complete. I think the Balloon lady has the best punch to her dialogue. :)","December 13, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very little thinking required on the player's part. Simply run all over the map and use everything on everything. Anything you can interact with is highlighted leaving all the guesswork out.\n\nStill, a charming game with obvious LucasArts/Double Fine influences. The levels are small enough that the puzzling and platforming back and forth does not get too tedious.

The mood is light, platforming is stress free and the puzzles are rather simple, designed to put a smile on your face, rather than pose serious problems. People looking for a more serious mental exercise should probably pass this one up.\n\nThe game has really excellent voice acting. Many other outspoken modern titles manage to do a lot less with a lot more resources in this regard, while SITTM characters are imbued with actual character thanks to the actors. This being said, some characters speak a bit slowly so they're king of a chore, however you'll promptly realize you can control voice pitch with A and D keys. Which provides even more fun potential.\n\nI recommend not rushing through the chatter, there's fun to be had with the dialogue (which for the better part is actually monologue.)\n\nHadn't had any stability issues, the game ran perfect. The only thing worth mentioning is the fact it has an iffy resolution support and since my screen's native resolution wasn't on the list, I dialed it down a bit and turned on the windowed mode. Which worked out well enough.\n\nI guess I'd rate this one with a solid eight out of ten.","January 3, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, perhaps not everything.\n\nThe game opens with Ray, the player character, whose job is testing hard-hats. The symbolism behind Ray’s career is soon apparent when an accident occurs that leaves him with severe head trauma. The moral? Wear a hard-hat on construction sites, literally. While not offering a great deal of difficulty with its platform-style mechanics, Stick It presents gamers with something refreshingly unique in a video game – a comedic look at the tragic effect of a decadent society on the mental health of its members. Ray’s ability to read minds and the obstacles that follow as the result of the accident become a constant, subconscious reminder to always keep your head, i.e. mental health, protected.\n\nWhen Ray wakes up, he a notices that there is a neon-pink arm sticking out of his head. This chimerical arm is your best friend. The arm gives Ray the ability to read minds and navigate the game space. It also serves to help Ray rip stickers (in traditional puzzle solvers these would be the “items” in your inventory) out of the game world as well as NPC minds, and stick them in different places to solve puzzles. Ray, however, finds the protuberance alarming and sets off to find a way to get rid of it. As no one else can see it but himself, Ray’s first plan is to head to a psychiatrist who, we soon see, needs more help than he does.\n\nThe game is divided into ten chapters in which Ray is faced with several obstacles to moving on to the next stage. Ray gets around these hindrances by helping other characters with their troubles – and a colourful cast of oddballs it is who require Ray’s help. From a suicidal taxi driver who wants a new set of teeth to a woman with an abandonment complex who prefers her pets taxidermied, Stick It leaves no allusions to obsessive compulsions or mental ailments untouched. The game does not stop there. The social stigma that accompanies those with mental disorders is also represented by a cast of mental institution staff and law enforcement officials who are constantly chasing Ray and locking up those who are deemed unfit.\n\nStick It does not suggest slapping stickers on, what are serious problems in real life, as a solution. That would be all too easy. What Stick It does do, is create a turbulent backdrop of a modern city with the imaginative use of art and colour in order to present, and make you think about, a tragic social problem. More importantly, it does so in a game that is packaged with distinct style, charming characters, comedic dialogue and a genuine, if naïve, notion that love will conquer all.\n\nI say play it.\n","August 27, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throughout the journey the player is treated to different set pieces and many colorful characters along the way. There's a lot of comedy in the game but like all comedy it may not appeal to certain demographics; I found a few chuckles in my playthrough but I could see some might not enjoy the jokes as much as me.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes the player basically has to grab stuff and stick it to other stuff in hopes of advancing the plot, and along the way one's treated to interesting thoughts they can read. It's mostly a simple platformer puzzler with relatively easy puzzles, so it's not the most challenging game in the world. Most of the entertainment comes from the jokes and character interactions.\n\nI'd say it's worth the money if you catch it on sale or on the Humble Bundle like I did.","March 8, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Point and Click was hard to do on a counsel because you will, point and click.  There have been attempts to revive the genre, but not much has happened with it except for re- releases and re-makes. Until now,\n\nStick it to the man is a game that advertises as an action platformer, but its really a point and click game in disguise, it also a game very much about comedy.  Here Let me give you a basic plot description, The Main Character Has Psychic powers, can read peoples minds to help solve their problems, its has a unique artstyle and sense of humor. There is also platforming and puzzle solving.\n\nNow if you know anything about good games your mind should instantly think of Psychonauts, and if you don’t know Psychonauts, 1st you should, and second go watch the Zero punctuation review on it or something, but if you’re to even do that then ill explain, Psychonauts, is an action platformer, puzzle solver, with unique art style and sense of humor, The main character also can read minds.\n\nSo now that i’ve gotten that comparison out of the way, I’ll talk more about this game, The art style of the game is a mixture between the weirdness of psychonauts, and the Cardboard of tearaway. The game also has a depth to it, you can move up and down the foreground, and background like in little big planet, but  the game never uses this to its advantage, i can only remember using it one time and that was when i discover i could even do it.\n\nThe Music in the game is repetitive unfortunately, every time you run into an enemy it plays the same music until you’ve successfully escaped, its always the same no variation of bad guy music.\n\nThe Gameplay of the game is centered around one central gimmick, your mind arm, Your mind arm is somthing you get in the very beginning of the game, and its what makes this game. It is your  cursor, its what you use to interact with the world, It's what lets you read minds to solve problems, it helps you platform acting like a grappling hook. Its what manages your inventory, and tears off stickers.\n\nSticker by the way are exactly what they sound like they are parts of the world that have been highlighted that you can rip off and stick to other things using your mind arm. You can get stickers by finding highlighted things in the world, or by reading someone's mind see what they are thinking of the literally ripping the thought out of their mind as a sticker. Stickers are the items used to solve the puzzles the game presents you with and you can have more than one at a time, this is where the inventory comes in. The inventory is just the d-pad left and right on the controller, it keeps it simple and easy.\n\nThe Control of the mind arm is… not so great. It you use the right analog stick to aim the arm, then it has an auto lock on to objects, the auto lock works but its also a problem. When there is more than one character next to another (which happens a lot by the way) it becomes hard to lock on to who you want to read  the mind of sometimes only allowing certain angles. The platforming is also floaty, it just doesn't feel super responsive, some of that may be attributed to the artstyle, but at some points especially when around enemies, you just don't feel like you have the amount of control you should.\n\nFloaty Controls aside, its the story and style that makes a point and click game, and boy does it have it in spades. This game is funny, thats hard to find in games now a days, you either have absurd humor, like goat simulator, or good character dialog like in borderlands. This game does both surprisingly well.\n\nIll give you an example of one of the puzzles, in one portion of the game you are tasked with escaping an insane asylum on and island. You meet tons of crazy characters each with different personalities and goals, You meet a captain who says he’s slain a great whale, you eventually find this whale decomposing, you also meet a taxidermist in the asylum, you bring her to the what and she sows it up, you then meet a man who is hyperventilating into a bag, you take this mans you take this man to the whale and he blows into the bowl hole filling it with air, you now have a raft made out of a dead whale that you use to escape the island.\nIf dead whale raft isn't funny to you, then something's wrong with you, or your an animal rights activist who doesn't like video games. The entire game is filled with over the top moments like that.\n\nThis does bring up some points negative though, almost all point and clicks suffer from this, and that is convoluted puzzles, you know when you just don't know what to do so you have to try everything with everything else, yah that moment. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often but when it happens it really slow the games pace down.\n\nThe game also has a lot of backtracking, like most point and clicks . Most of the game takes place on large maps that you have to fully explore to solve the puzzles, and get to the next area, but the backtracking isn't that bad and there are some parts in the game that will let you do a quick travel to certain areas.\n\nAlthough this game definitely suffers from all the problems that have always plagued Point and clicks, it works well and is definitely the benchmark for a counsel point and click game, so if soul successor to Psychonauts sounds good to you, dont hesitate to buy.\n","September 7, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both in the humor and the fact that the focus of the story is around brains. That's not a problem. I like psychonauts. It doesn't really rip off any elements or steal any jokes from the game, either, so it ends up working really well. Ray does sound quite a lot like Rasputin though. Which is fine.\nThe main gameplay is jumping around platforms, grabbing stuff with your magic spaghetti hand, solving puzzles, and avoiding enemies. There's not a whole lot of depth to it and the game ends up being rather short, but it doesn't ever feel repetitive either. The stealth segments are probably the weakest, since most of the time there's no reason to not just brute-force your way through them. The puzzles aren't too difficult as usually you're told exactly what you need and where, which is good since they'd be very adventure game-y puzzles otherwise. The weirdness of the scenarios actually adds to the variety and it's amusing to see just what the game decides to do next. The game also looks great and sounds great, the paper aesthetic is played with quite nicely and the music is pretty fitting for the tone and style. The only real downside is the length; while it makes for a pretty complete package, the $15 price tag may not be enough to justify the experience for everyone.

Stick it to the Man is the latest game to try and add a bit more adventure to our lives and does so with some platform elements, a bunch of stickers and a strange alien spaghetti hand.\n\nThe somewhat crazy story follows the character of safety helmet tester Ray. One day on his way home a strange canister drops out of the sky and hits him on the head. The canister contains a strange little alien named Ted (Who looks a bit like a cute Krang from the Turtles cartoon). Ted hides inside Ray’s brain and grants him the power to read people’s minds via a giant alien spaghetti arm he now has growing out of his head.\n\nIt sounds odd and it is, invoking more than a few memories of Psychonaughts in terms of style and tone. Ray must use his new powers to escape the people who are hunting him and find out what has happened to his girlfriend. This is done via a combination of light platforming sections and using the hand to read people’s minds, find out what they want and then slapping the appropriate sticker into their thought bubble.\n\nThe graphical style of the game represents the world in a pop-up book style. Characters are paper thin and everything comes across like a twisted comic book. It’s a style that works really well and it helps to add charm and humour to the already excellent script and characters. Stripping the outside of buildings off like paper to reveal what’s going on inside in a particularly nice touch.\n\nThe game is 2D and has Ray move around a set map. Around the map are agents looking to capture him and this is where the platforming comes in. You can use Ray’s alien hand to grab hold of drawing pins and pull him to different places. Using this ability and a combination of stickers that make agents fall asleep or become confused, you have to make your way undetected past the goons to the next area. Being caught results in restarting from a nearby checkpoint so though the controls can be a little bit loose it never caused us any frustration.\n\nThe puzzles for the most part are fairly logical (at least within the logic of the world), and we never came across anything that had us stumped or frustrated for a massive amount of time. The only slightly odd puzzles that are likely to stop you dead are when you need to get people to follow you. One in the mental asylum springs to mind where a character repeatedly said that an object would be perfect for her cat but actually needed to be led somewhere else.\n\nPuzzles generally involve reading a characters mind which creates a thought bubble. From here it’s all about grabbing stickers from people’s thoughts and taking them to the appropriate place to use them. This is what you’ll be doing for the bulk of your time and it’s a testament to the design that it doesn’t feel like one giant fetch quest (which effectively all point and click adventures are).\n\nStick it to the Man isn’t massively long but it offers up an inventive and fun adventure that you can’t help but like. It came as a nice surprise as we hadn’t really heard much about the game before. What we have here is a combination of a good script and some fun play mechanics which create a fairly unique title.

The style and humor reminds me so much of psychonauts, which on it's own was enough of an incentive for me to try this game out; luckly the games mechanics and gameplay are just as enjoyable (^-^) The story itself is simple but still quite enjoyable, and the characters are freaken awesome and a joy to interact with. Hell, the voice actor for Ray does OVER 10 OF THE CHARACTER VOICES FOR THIS GAME ALONE. Now THAT is impressive, especially since some of the ones that he does sound nothing alike. The only real downside to the game is its length, which for me clocked at around 8 hours but only because I scoured for every brain I could read and tried to get a majority of the acheivements; if you aren't a major completionist, you could probably get through the story at around 5-6 hours. Despite that though, I'm glad I bought this game, and I definately encourage others who are fans of psychonauts sense of style and humor or who are just fans of simple scrollers with quirky dialouge to try it out.","February 1, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sort of like the older Castlevanias where you're locked in to your jump distance.

This is useful if you're going back through the chapters to read the minds you've missed\n-I've got 5.3 hours logged for total completion (with about half an hour or so of idle time).

Not that that last part matters all that much, but it gives you an idea of how interesting even the side content of this game can be.\n\nThat being said, even disregarding what my playtime says, the game is pretty short in length (probably around 6-8 hours, I'd say, less if you don't read everything's mind) and while some of the enemy evasion sections feel a little on the strict side in terms of getting them just right to get past the guards, the rest of the game is very enjoyable. Especially so if you're not sure what to make of the game and pick it up on a sale. Many of the puzzles are amusing and creative in their own right, often pulling themselves together through the pleasantly bizarre mechanic that the game hinges on, peeling the thoughts from other characters and inexplicably making them real, or peeling parts/items from other characters or the environment for use elsewhere.\n\nThere are some moments where you may find yourself wondering where to use some of the gathered items, the stickers as they call them (hence the game's name), but generally it becomes a rather straightforward affair of picking up what you can and figuring out what remains available to interact with to progress. If you're looking for a laidback puzzle platformer that takes more design cues from old adventure games than games like Braid, and an interesting art style, an enjoyable soundtrack, and a somewhat amusing sense of humor, you can't go too wrong with this game.\n\nWhat it may lack in length and challenge, it more than makes up for in its variety of amusing scenarios.","October 4, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Light on reflex platforming and more focused on exploration, humor and riddles. It is a wild ride into the minds of people living in a paper world. Like Psychonauts - game’s obvious influence - its humor is self-referential and clever, while peeking into minds of others is thrilling, and can be scary sometimes.\n\nGeoff Thew in his review[www.hardcoregamer.com] gives great examples of the type of humor you can expect here:\n\nStick It to The Man is an eminently sly and self-aware game. This is a story of paper men living in a sidescrolling world, and they know it. The hazmat container only drops in the first place because the paper airplane carrying it falls apart in a storm. Ray always forgets how much jumping is involved in his morning commute, but when lost he remembers that the way home is to “go right, and then go right, and then pretty much keep going all the way to the right.” This is classic adventure game humor with a sharp edge, and it’s riotously funny.","October 7, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The craft put into their storytelling is always amazing.\n\n'But Brock,' you say, 'this game is not by DoubleFine at all! Explain yourself!' Well, as I prefaced, this game is a difficult one to pinpoint in my brain, but the one withstanding element throughout the whole thing was this constant reminder of the humor and stylization that DoubleFine creates in their game Psychonauts.\n\nWhile the story is somewhat lackluster for me in Stick it to the Man, it easily is made up for the sheer volume of interesting character background and stories therein. This game allows the player to enter the mind of most any biological being, dead or alive, and therein the game shines!\n\nThere's rich little mini-stories that are perfectly done, and I almost believe that the writers knew about their main story as being straight-forward, so they decided to sprinkle the whole thing with entertaining sub-plots throughout, making an entertaining ride.

With the help of these stickers you solve all the "puzzles" in the game. I put puzzles in quotations because they're not real puzzles, there is basically no thinking involved, you just try sticking every sticker where it is possible and you solve it, that's all there is to it.\n\nSimilarly, there is no difficulty involved with the platforming in the game. And sadly the same goes for avoiding the enemies. They move in predictable patterns and it's easy to lose them even if you get spotted, that means that you're just going thorugh the motions most of the time.\n\nDespite all that the story, dialogue and art style are here to save the game. It's hard to do humour in video games and Stick it to The Man! manages just that quite often. I am not talking about laugh out loud moments, but I was most certainly entertained throughout the game, even if there is a bit too much of listening to oneliners when you're reading people's minds. Finally, the art style alone is worth checking out, it gives the illusion of everything being made from paper or carboard and it achieves a very nice effect which doesn't get old until  the end.\n\nI couldn't recommend the game based on the gameplay alone, however the style of the game is absolutely worth checking out.\n\n6½ / 10","March 4, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many characters whom you'd expect not to see more than once, that they'd come on screen, think their quirky thought, and then practically die of screen. But instead you see more than one situation progress throughout the game that doesn't follow the main story. It really does do a great job with it's writing. The gameplay it self is very simple, and not amazing, but still very fun.  My only major complaint is I wish they had made the game longer.

One of my favourite things about it would have to be the characters. There are many characters whom you'd expect not to see more than once, that they'd come on screen, think their quirky thought, and then practically die of screen. But instead you see more than one situation progress throughout the game that doesn't follow the main story. It really does do a great job with it's writing. The gameplay it self is very simple, and not amazing, but still very fun.  My only major complaint is I wish they had made the game longer. However, it's better to have an amazing game that lasts 5 hours than a decent game that lasts 100 hours. Still, there's enough replay value in it to give it a couple more plays.","March 9","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
