And honestly, the game designer did a pretty good job. The mechanics aren't new or spectacular, and in general, there's only ever one way to solve the puzzles, but a puzzle game can't have everything.\nOf the mechanics it does have, I can speak positively. The guns - most easily described as platform, crossbow, grapple, and magnet - allow for some interesting and actually challenging puzzles, and even if the game's nothing to look at visually, ordinarily the core gameplay at work here would signal a thumbs-up from me.\nBut- and given my non-recommendation, you knew there would be a "but"- the controls and physics are wonky. It's fine for my character and the objects to be somewhat floaty, if it didn't make setting up the more elaborate platform solutions frustrating to the point of rage-quitting. I'm not talking about puzzle difficulty here - I'm talking about the very simple aspect of control, which any game that uses platformer elements should implement properly. No matter how often you try, your boxes will slip, slide, perform mind-bending dances and fall off of the platforms you have spent minutes - nay, hours - placing them onto. And then you will have to try again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again, and again, and again.\nThe ratio of hours I have spent attempting to place one box on top of another box/platform while in mid-air, or attempted to carry a box over my platform-gun's tiny platforms to the number of hours I have spent actually playing the game is probably 1:1, maybe 2:1. The character becomes easier to control as more time is spent on the game - so depending on your speed at solving puzzles, you may become an expert before reaching the stages in which mid-air stacking is necessary - but it should not be required to spend 10 minutes solving a puzzle and 30 minutes trying to stack boxes. Even with practice, that is my experience at the end-game levels.\n\nAs to the levels themselves; I can only say that experiences shall vary. Most of the puzzles were not very difficult, although several of the later puzzles would have made me feel justified in my purchase were it not for the control issue.\n\nI cannot recommend this game until the physics and controls are fixed. That's too bad, because the designer really did come up with something clever and created some interesting puzzles.","July 27, 2014","false","10.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","6"

And what a puzzle game! The puzzles are very well done, many of them having that "aha" moment where you figure it all out or use something in a way that you wouldn't have thought to before.\n\nThere are a few things that I would consider flaws, but they were fairly negligible in the face of all the quality puzzling entertainment I got out of the deal. One of the only complaints I have is that it seems like it could've done more. There are a lot of mechanics, and I don't know if they fully exhausted all the puzzles they could've made with them.\n\nStill, a very good, even great spatial puzzle game.

Buy the game NOW! This game is now one of my all time favorite games. It is logical (who would guess from the name eh?), it has a diverse gameplay (things are always changing to introduce new gameplay mechanics), it challenges the mind in a VERY balanced way (it is not too difficult yet difficult enough to cause you to stumble sometimes and think deeply), has great graphics (the screenshots may look very simplistic, but it serves the game's purpose very well and the overall level design makes the game very explorative too), has a catchy tune to keep the player motivated, and has ALOT of content to keep you busys and having fun for many hours. The best part: non-violent and female protagonist (some mention of killing, etc, but mostly empty threats and it all plays well when you reach the end - you will see). Truely a progressive game!

Some of the puzzles are fun and inventive, and some of the guns are fun to use. Unfortunately most of them require you to do things in a specific annoying order that only the game creators knows. The bow is the most fun. Early on the puzzles aren't too bad but they get pretty impossible that even actual websites that write reviews say you will be looking up a lot of them. I get it puzzles should take them thinking but after having used a walkthrough often and seen what they wanted I thought "That it so complicated and convoluted why would i waste an hour trying to figure that out, life is too short. Sometimes they have hints but they aren't helpful and they don't come on till after you've sat around for 10 min trying to figure it out. I got to level 9-4 and following a walkthrough I got to this part where based on the pictures the guy took and the mechanics of the game a gate should have been triggered to open and it didn't. Since there is no restarting from any checkpoints you just have to do the entire level over again, which was 30 steps long and super convoluted. I would have beaten the game but after a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug thats a problem with the game ruins a level it's not worth replaying just for a game like this. It tries too hard to be portal but most of the puzzles are annoying rather than fun. Good sense of humor in the game though. 4.5/10.","February 13, 2015","false","5.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edderiofer/recommended/308360/","edderiofer","edderiofer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edderiofer/","308 products in account","The level- and puzzle- design of this game is absolutely superb. Each level showcases some novel way for the different mechanics to fit together; not a shred of level is wasted. As far as I can tell, none of the puzzles are easily broken, either, whether with ninja moves or unconventional puzzling. The levels themselves are also very challenging; particularly upon nearing the latter third of the game.\n\nA few things are unfortunately still desired; a more lenient physics engine (jumping is somewhat fiddly, as is stacking blocks, as you'll see from many reviews), a better menu (options should come BEFORE savefile selection!), more levels (only 40+8 bonus), and possibly a better redesign of the final level.\n\nThe number of mechanics is sometimes overwhelming, too. In addition to the 4 different guns and the zapper, there're also bombs, grapplable boxes, light boxes, heavy boxes, polarized boxes, lanterns, impact-toggled switches, lasers, colour-mixing puzzles, ice, glass, barriers that objects can't pass through, barriers that put out lanterns, barriers that arrows can pass through but you can't... Suffice to say, you may find yourself trying to recall what exactly a green dashed barrier does, and how it's different to a blue dotted barrier.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, this is definitely a good one I can recommend to you; it's up there along with English Country Tune and Snakebird in terms of pure gameplay. It is definitely worth the 4 GBP, whether on sale or not. But be prepared to spend more time on it than you might think, and be prepared to wish for more by the time you finish.","November 7, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On a few occasions I was scratching my head in confusion for a while until it finally dawned on me what I needed to do. The actual basics to play the game are really intuitive and easy to pick, there isn't really a learning curve here. I played something else recently where basic movement was a challenge because the player character was difficult to control. But in this she would just go where I wanted her and you have good air control. That helped the experience a lot. About the story? There is an occasional text dialogue from an anime looking character but I found that I was too preoccupied just playing the and I missed half of it.\n\nIn terms of presentation, to me the game looked good. I liked the shadow effects. The music was good too.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game.

They all do neat and interesting things to help you interact with your environment; and although homage is paid to the FPS-style puzzle rules set down in Half-Life and Portal, the gameplay elements are unique and to not copy from those games.\n\nThe controls feel very loose at times, and I still get annoyed that the jump mechanic is set default to the "W" key rather than the spacebar. Additionally, the story seemed very one-dimensional. However, these minor irritations do not detract too much from the size and scope of the campaign - 40 playable levels plus a short epilogue to cap the story arc. There are also bonus levels and a map editor, so that you can make your own maps and upload to them for other people to try out.\n\nDespite my complaints about the controls and the storyline, this puzzle game was worth the money I paid for it. This is a puzzle game done really well, and fans of Portal will feel right at home with this great game.","May 26, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
