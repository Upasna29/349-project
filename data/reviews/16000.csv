And that's enough to content us, really.\n\nSadly the art in this is pretty abysmal. Objects are resized in a way that does not make sense relative to each other; likewise, objects are fuzzy that should be in focus and conversely. The photos that the art is sourced from are pretty ugly/dull, and garish colour filters are applied liberally to make matters worse.\n\nI understand that this was done in an effort to make the object hunting a bit more challenging, but the combined "eyesore power" of all these techniques used at the same time is just too much.\n\nThere's a game show conceit in Discovery! A Seek and Find Adventure, and that's at least a novel way to frame the different environments. They bungled the meat of the game though, letting us hog people down.","April 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","25","28","12","2"

But this game is hard. Objects are so well hidden, that you regularly have to use the Hint button (at no real cost). I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Probably a good thing, but THIS hard... I'm not sure.\n\nAnyhow, I guess it can be fun with a couple of friends, but if you're playing alone, you basically have all the time in the world. That doesn't make it any easier, but it also doesn't make it any more fun. Still, you can't find a similar game like this on Steam, so if you're into these games this one is a must own.\n\n[Rating: 67/100]","July 13, 2011","true","0.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Literally it's a "Stack one HOG scene after another and make a superficial story about it" - Who don't like to be abroad, but this is styled like a gameshow and overcrowded with searchable objects.\n\nFurthermore some objects don't seem to work correctly and the additional features of the game like achievements and characters are also only a little additional suggar instead of a cherry on a piece of pie.\n\nI wouldn't recomend this game since it grows boring really fast, even with the game-show theme it's boring. This game is no masterpiece and on a 1 to 10 scale it will not even reach 3 points in my opinion - the artworks are also nothing special.\n\nBuyer beware, even though I didn't encounter gamebreaking bugs (playing 30 minutes) it is far too expensive, far too boring and of course far too vanilla ... you might as well take a burger and nail it to your knee, it is exactly as painful.","March 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I'd expected them to get harder to play against as you unlocked them, but they don't.\nI was going to play it till the end and then uninstall it, but I lost the will to live on the second last game.\nThe graphical style is horrible, and makes every image look the same.\nDid you ever play sims 1, and download an object which sat at completely the wrong angle, was very 2 dimensional (even for the sims 1) and the texture didn't fit the game. That's what the graphics in this game reminded me of. It's like someone gathered up all those objects and pasted them onto postcards to make this game.\nI'm normally quite easily amused by trivial games, but I wouldn't play this again. There are much better HO games out there to waste my time on without regretting it.\nIf you like HO games and are looking for one that's a bit different I'd recommend Pickers, which is made by Mumbo Jumbo as well.","May 27, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/16000/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","This is another one of those games that I really wish that there were a neutral rating for. It is not a bad game, but it has flaws that left me torn, and ultimately opting not to recommend it. For one, there is not much real playing time involved here, at all (though it does at least try to implement true replayability via mini games and different game modes, though over the course of the game one tends to start to learn where things are in the scenes). My total time playing it reflects a great deal of replaying after needing to restore everything on my computer, as I wanted to know what happens in the end of the game, out of simple curiousity. My assessment:\n\nAt first, the game show idea is compelling. What could be better than adding in some AI opponents to race against in a hidden object search? Yet, in this game all of your opponents were apparently dropped on their heads as children. Repeatedly. Then, even though you unlock new opponents as you progress, their level of challenge doesn't go up any. So wide is the margin with just casual play that you could pretty much put on a blindfold and play the main levels without an issue when it comes to winning against your opponents. The exception to this comes only after the main levels are completed and you play in the tournament of champions, when the level of challenge presented by the opponents seems to jump up a bit more toward what you might be expecting (or, at least what I was expecting). But, at that point, whether you'll even care anymore is anyone's guess.\n\nThe graphics and naming of objects are also a bit iffy. That is to say, while I definitely wasn't expecting much, the hidden object scenes are quite annoying to work with compared to many such games due to the almost choppy nature of the graphics (this is hard to explain, but if you look closely at the blown-up screen shots you should somewhat see what I mean) as well as the fact that items are not always named and/or depicted clearly. Something will look more like one thing while being called something else, for instance, or will be depicted in an unfamiliar fashion, thus requiring a hint or dumb luck to find.\n\nOverall, it is an excellent original concept for a hidden object game, but it ultimately fell just a bit short of my expectations. As I said above, I'd give it a neutral rating if I could, but as I can't, I also find I cannot bring myself to recommend it.","June 29, 2014","false","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Pretty much killed my desire to continue...\n\nIf you fancy hidden object based fun (with a handful of very short minigames) in a fast paced and competitive environment then this is probably a reasonable game to go for.\n\nOn the downside though whilst the executaion is nice, it is showing its age - the pictures suffer from being very low res and not being able to find something because it's a blur (or because it's mislabelled) is less fun than repeatedly headbutting your keyboard. When you add in no steam overlay and no achievements... it makes it a kinda meh choice. There are better games around if you want to find stuff.","May 25, 2014","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
