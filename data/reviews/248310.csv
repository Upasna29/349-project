" <FALCON PUNCH>\n\nYOU KNOW NOTHING! Play the demo, check the gameplay, read the reviews! This game is a Saturn-era platformer that NAILED IT. We are talking here about Shovel Knight levels of quality, Megaman X4 levels of quality, Sonic 3 & Knuckles levels of quality. This is full-on nostalgia trip of concepts you love, from games you remember. The whole experience is delivered in the new awesome package with suprisingly varied gameplay mechanics, great level design, smooth controls and top-level boss encounters (better quality than all Sonic's games bosses and on the level of the best from Megaman). On top of that, three distinctive characters to play means high replayability that justifies the initial price tag. This game may look like Sonic initially but in reality it plays like a improvement and modernization of Blue Blur's formula with many influences from other awesome platforming classics. It evolved from this ground-up and at the end Freedom Planet does it's own thing.\n\nIt looks well, sounds well (amazing soundtrack) and even the voice-acting that is clearly more of indies level of quality is most times solid. Storyline is nothing super special, but it's cool for one thing - it pulls out a Cave Story - in the FIRST cutscene. Stuff gets real, fast. Cutscenes can be really lenghty sometimes. I liked them, but those who highly prefer gameplay over story can disable them by choosing Classic Mode.\n\nThere are some small glitches (they will propably be patched out in near future), some plotholes and inconsistences in the story and minor places where voice-acting isn't that good. Some people also complained about difficulty curve. Bosses are in fact a bit challenging on Normal difficulty, but for me, fair checkpoint system and painless continues are more than enough to balance this out. If you are not reckless and do recognize some boss patterns, you should be fine. There are also plenty difficulty settings to choose from - you can pick Easy or Casual, if you want a sweat-less experiece.\n\nThis isn't a flawleess ride, but the overall quality of the game is unbelievably high for the first major project from this developer and only $25,000 gained from kickstarter. Again, check the demo. It gives a correct glimpse how the game really looks like and it should definietly tell you if you will enjoy the game. All in all, I highly recommend this game! It is much more than it looks at first glance!","July 23, 2014","true","93.7"," 373 of 424 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","373","424","4","29"

So, imagine having to listen to Jamiroquai's "Traveling Without Moving" constantly. It's a good album though, came out in 1996, had classics like "Seven Days in Sunny June", "Canned Heat" and "Supersonic". Speaking of Super Sonic, the lack of a certain hedgehog on the Sega Saturn was very strange. There were a couple spin-offs and Sonic X-treme (which was never released), but no Sonic 4. In fact, Sega still hasn't released a Sonic 4, I can't understand it.\n\nDuring the 16 and 32-bit days, the mascot-platformer was the most over-stuffed genre on store shelves. These games were mostly garbage like Bubsy & Awesome Possum. Anytime there was an actual hit (like Earthworm Jim), publishers would run it into the ground through a combination of uninspired sequels and marketing. Still, there were a lot of good games released during this time: Rocket Knight Adventures, Socket, Pulseman, High Seas Havoc, Adventures of Little Ralph, Keio Flying Squadron 2, Tryrush Deppy, Ristar, DoReMi Fantasy, Super Tempo Popful Mail, Astal, Clockwork Knight, etc.\n\nIt was a rough transitional period for the platformer. Due to the popularity of Mario 64, most developers went 3D (or at least 2.5D) with varying levels of success. The 2D platformers released around the time were by small teams, and unless you read Diehard GameFan, you didn't know of their existence. Freedom Planet could have been one of those games. If it had released in 1996, it would have toiled in obscurity for nearly a decade, until it was purchased by somebody in a random ebay auction. This guy played through the game, thought "Wow this is really good!", and told everyone in his gaming forum about it. I'd wager that by 2008, Freedom Planet achieved some mid/high-level of notoriety, and commanded about $80 per disc through online auctions.\n\nFreedom Planet follows the adventures of Lilac, Carol, and Millia. Three heroines, three kingdoms, one war, an alien menace, and that's the short version. There are a lot of cut-scenes in this game, and the story takes some unexpectedly dark turns. Saying anything else is liable to turn this review into spoiler-central, but I'll say this much: there's at least one scene in this game that I'd be perfectly content with never seeing again.\n\nBut enough about that mess, let's talk about the actual game. There are three playable characters, and they have a variety of unique skills. This is a fast-moving platformer, not unlike the Sonic games, so expect loops, ramps, and so on. The stages are all fairly large, with numerous optional paths, secrets, traps. and enemy robots. This is also a combat-oriented platformer, and the later stages throw a lot of baddies at the player. Freedom Planet certainly isn't lacking in boss-fights either, you can expect two or more in every stage.\n\nHow you deal with adversity depends on the character. Lilac soars with her various aerial maneuvers (including a flying dash-attack & a shoryuken), Carol has her claws, Chun-Li kicks, and a motorcycle, while Millia creates blocks and shields to frustrate anything capable of firing bullets. These skills are also necessary for getting around the stages, whether it's flying over massive cliffs, driving up walls, or even subtle tricks such as using a phantom block shield blast to propel Millia a few feet. The controls are exceptionally fluid, and the mechanics are very solid. While the levels are fun to explore, they're even more entertaining, when using every ability to its fullest extent to speed through them. Also, unlike some platformers that emphasize speed, there's no worry over taking damage from simple enemy contact.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Freedom Planet has a lot of boss-fights, and they can be pretty tough. Most of the challenge is in reading their patterns. They move quickly, and while you might see this as a sign to move fast yourself, it's all a smokescreen. What's liable to happen is that you'll bump into their attacks and get yourself killed. Instead, you want to stop, wait, and see what happens. They'll jump from one of the screen to the next, present some opening, and that's when you attack. Each character has a move that gives them some invincibility, such as Lilac's flying, Carol's kicks, or Millia's shield. Using those moves, even in last-ditch situations, could save your life. All that said, even the easy setting will lead to some boss-related deaths. The most devastating attacks tend to juggle you, which eats through a ton of life. Also, Millia has half the health of the other heroines, but she tends to kill bosses faster so it balances out.\n\nWhere this game really excels is in level-design variety. All too often, variety is a double-edged sword. Yeah it's fun to see something new and different, but when you're flying from one set-piece to the next, you never really get a feel for how the game actually plays. You buy a game, expecting a third-person shooter, but every other level involves turrets, vehicles, flying, swimming, sex QTEs, and so on. Each stage in Freedom Planet is different from one another, but not so different that you feel like you're playing another game. It's also important to note that the level-design never completely shifts gears. One stage might feature more enemies, another probably has some extra puzzles, but it never feels like "this is a puzzle stage" or "this is the stage where you fight all the time". Everything comes together naturally, and you're always in complete control.\n\nAlthough, yes there is a 2D shooter stage. Of course there would be a 2D shooter stage. I've been a platformer-fan for decades and this happens every time...EVERY SINGLE TIME. Apparently, there's always someone out there that thinks "Our game is too good, we should throw in a really weak section to give reviewers something to complain about". Towards the end of Freedom Planet, there is a 2D shooter stage. It's not particularly bad, but it's just...there. All told, I guess I can deal with a few minutes out of a 2+ hour game being merely passable.\n\nFreedom Planet is a relic, and I mean that in the most affectionate way. It's a mid-90s platformer that has all the elements of a forgotten classic, but it was released in 2014. It's unfortunate that more games aren't released that emulate this style. It seems that for most indie-developers, their favorite system growing up was the NES. That's cool and all but eh, I prefer the days of the Genesis/SNES/Saturn/PSX. I'd rather see more games that prey upon my nostalgia, and if they turned out to be half as good as Freedom Planet, then I'd be in for a treat.","February 9, 2015","true","11.3"," 445 of 527 people (84%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","84","445","527","55","26"

Most people will get the wrong idea and will knock this game down. There's gonna be a ton of people who will just glance at this and will simply presume the game is a sonic knockoff.\n\nLike with the recent indie game Shovel Knight, it takes elements from various classic games and makes it all its own identity. So does Freedom Planet with its different game play styles. You have characters that of course are fast like sonic, some fight like Zero from the Mega man games, and another who can bring up blocks via magic and throw them via Mario 2 style.\n\nThe gameplay yes, level designs take inspiration from sonic titles, along with bosses from games such as Gunstar Heroes, a bit of Ristar, and just this massive blend of genesis/super nintendo games all into one...yes it blends, do breathe this.\n\nStory wise (no worries about spoilers) feels like a good old Saturday morning cartoon show with funny humor, fun characters, and can still be dark in some areas. Themes ranging from friendships, growing stronger, revenge that shift from various character viewpoints when playing the other characters.\n\nThere's a lot going on here, its worth the 15$ definitly with its content, and along with more coming along the way with an expansion which will add an adventure mode for Milla since she's only in classic at the moment, along with characters such as Spade and Torque somewhere down the line.\n\nThis game though does get hard at the very last few stages, NES hard but checkpoints are plenty and unlimited continues are in this so its not too bad. Just expect a challenge at the later half of the game.\n\nHopefully this game does become more popular with people on youtube giving this game more attention such as YOGSCAST and reviewers such as Somecallmejohnny and more, just to name a few. Spread the word, tell people about it, and treat it like the kind of game you'd keep in your retro game collection. No scratch that, treat it like the kind of game that stays fresh and fun for years to come, even after the millionith playthrough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angel9RakouCobra/recommended/248310/","Angel9RakouCobra","Angel.9 Rakou Cobra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angel9RakouCobra/","3592 products in account","TL;DR - Freedom Planet is easily my indie GOTY, and among my favorite games of all time. Now, on to a full review:\n\nI'd had my eye on this game since its early Greenlight campaign and sadly missed its Kickstarter. Fast forward many months of watching the game evolve, and Freedom Planet's on Steam. After everything I'd seen, I set fairly unrealistic expectations for this game... and was shocked when I found they'd not only been met, but exceeded.\n\nIn short, Freedom Planet is everything you could ask for out of a fast-paced 2D platformer. It hits all the right notes with a mix of speed and platforming, coming together in excellent level design, very much akin to Genesis era Sonic titles. However, it isn't a Sonic clone; it clearly draws a great deal of inspiration, but also has enough differences to feel fresh and unique.\n\nFreedom Planet undoubtedly has a love of speed, similar to Sonic, and features great level design, with branching paths and multiple ways to tackle areas due to characters' different abilities (more on that later), but the levels can be fairly lengthy and aren't afraid to slow you down for some more intricate platforming or a bit of combat. Neither of those points are negatives; the levels never seem to drag, continuing to add in new hazards to overcome and sights to see, and being unable to simply blow through a level without prior practice makes the platforming feel that much more satisfying. Combat is also quite fun, as it maintains the game's fast pace and mixes in a good amount of variety in both attacks and enemies. Boss battles are also unique and challenging, each requiring different approaches to beat them, and ultimately being very entertaining in their design.\n\nGraphically, this game is beautiful and features very detailed sprite work. Characters are drawn down to minute details, and backgrounds and level pieces are equally detailed and varied. Each area is distinctly different from the last and very lovingly drawn. Not only does the level as a whole paint a lovely image, but the artists even took care to include small details that can truly breathe life into a game. This attention to detail carries over to the characters, with entire animations dedicated to a single usage in-game. For instance, in one level there are disco balls, which cause the characters to dance if they're stopped near enough by.\n\nThe soundtrack is also varied and fun, keeping pace with the game. Voice-overs are also surprisingly good, especially considering how games can suffer greatly from poor voice acting (to the point it would have been preferable for them to be silent). Freedom Planet's voices in no way detract from its characters, and in fact, can be rather fun and fitting, particularly in its many lighthearted moments.\n\nStory-wise, it's on par with retro-inspired action games. You're out to save the world, you'll meet some fun characters, and you'll find little plot surprises here and there. Gameplay far outshines story here, but it's a good romp regardless, and if story isn't your thing, there's the option to skip it completely and get right to the meat of the game.\n\nReplayability is another one of Freedom Planet's strong suits. As of writing this, there are three playable characters, each with distinct abilities. Two of the three even have their own story, and I've heard plans to not only increase the character count, but also to give characters unique stories and levels. Characters aren't just simple sprite swaps either; each character has an entirely different set of moves and abilities, as well as levels unique to them. Even when passing through the same levels, it feels like a fresh experience. The characters vary enough to warrant entirely different play styles and ways of going about overcoming the same areas. This is particularly prevalent for boss fights, which adds an extra layer of excitement replaying them.\n\nThere are other little extras, such as a set of 'hit the targets' levels, which are much smaller, but focus on avoiding obstacles and making your way to all the corners of the level. These are rather fun, although you'll be done with them very quickly. Keep playing, and you'll even unlock a mahjong mini-game to relax with between more intense gameplay.\n\nAll said, Freedom Planet can offer dozens of hours of entertainment for a very reasonable price. Between the levels' length and depth, each character offering a brand new perspective on the game, and simply being fun enough to drag you back for one more try at a faster run, Freedom Planet is a great value and a shining example of the incredible things indie gaming is capable of.","November 24, 2014","true","14.4"," 137 of 153 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","137","153","9","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhog/recommended/248310/","shadowhog","Shadow Hog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhog/","381 products in account","Before I review Freedom Planet, a disclaimer I feel important to mention: I have been an alpha tester for the game since April 2013, and am also a moderator of the game's forums/makeshift bug tracker. My opinions are based off not only the final product, but several unfinished builds of the game. I am probably not going to provide the least-biased, most-impartial opinion out there, although I will try; take this fact as you see fit.\n\nFreedom Planet is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, with a heavy emphasis on momentum-based physics and melee combat. Although its inspiration by Sega's seminal Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is self-evident, make no mistake; this game plays significantly differently, and hardly in a bad sense.\n\nThe plot centers around water-dragon Sash Lilac, a thief who lives a relatively solitary life in a treehouse, and her wildcat companion/roommate Carol Tea, an impulsive character with an amazing physics-defying motorcycle. The two girls rescue an unusual duck-billed turtle named Torque from his pursuers after he crash-lands in the jungle, but in doing so, are thrust into his attempt to thwart the impending theft of an artifact precious to their world of Avalice - the Kingdom Stone, the object that gives Avalice's people the ability to power their various devices and as such live their daily lives. Along the way, they ally with the hound dog Milla Basset, a shy, naive homeless orphan living on her own in the wild (and who is decidedly not a rabbit, despite her long ears), and discover the involvement of military leader Lord Brevon, who wants the Kingdom Stone for his own nefarious purposes, but whose origin is apparently not of their world.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple in execution. You control either Lilac, Carol or Milla (although you have to unlock that last one; she becomes available just for playing two stages of the other two girls' campaigns, but can only access Classic Mode as of writing), and get them from point A to point B, where a Treasure-esque multi-part boss of some fashion awaits, with the intent of slaughtering you. Each of these stages have their own unique hazards and mechanics to come to terms with: whether that's dodging oversized mining equipment, fending off three themed enemy airships, riding the back of a submarine as it bobs up and down in the water or dealing with ninjas on motorcycles, there's always something new being thrown at you, but very rarely is it so abrupt as to be unfair. The usual assortment of power-ups help you on your quest: crystals for extra lives (naturally, although the magic number is 200 instead of the usual 100), health petals to patch up wounds (or to double as crystals when you're full-health), little heads in cages as quick extra lives, and various large crystals that, when shattered, provide you with a shield (themed after Wu Xing, each offering at least two additional hits separate from your health bar, protection from attacks of their element, and some subtle bonuses besides).\n\nThe three characters go through the stages with significantly different playstyles:\n\n* Lilac can zoom around like Sparkster with her Dragon Boost, can perform a low-gravity double-jump with her Dragon Cyclone, and generally has the widest variety in her basic attacks. She's also easily the fastest on-foot of all the characters, making her a good all-rounder.\n* Carol can wall-climb, spin like a certain hedgehog, leap around from jump pad to jump pad or zoom around on a bike that can implausibly drive up walls and ladders. On the flipside, she generally has weaker attacks than Lilac (although they whip out faster) and is slower on-foot.\n* Milla can fly to a limited extent, can throw objects for ranged attacks (like item boxes or a self-generated block), can deflect some enemy attacks with a shield (itself an attack, as its dissipation shoots outwards; its power increases when combined with a generated block) and can dig things out of patches of dirt; all the typical things dogs do. However, she is slower than Carol and has less health than her companions.\n\nEach character also sees some things the others don't, whether that's an extended version of a cutscene, a different boss or an entire stage solely exclusive to them, further incentivizing playing as all three.\n\nThose familiar with deviantART (for better or worse) might recognize the three heroines. That's no accident; the characters were licensed from Chinese artist Ziyo-Ling, who used the trio many years ago on her dA page (although Lilac's species was changed from a hedgehog to a dragon, to make the inspirations a little less blatant). I'm not going to lie, when I first heard of the game many years ago, I thought it sounded like the dumbest idea imaginable to take those three fan characters and slap them into their own game. However, a demo of the game in 2012 quickly changed my mind, with surprisingly strong gameplay mechanics, fluid animations, and catchy music - such that, when the game went up on Kickstarter, I didn't think twice about pledging $30 for beta access (only to bump it up another $20 for alpha access instead).\n\nFortunately, those qualities have carried through the rest of development. As part of the Kickstarter's stretch goals, the graphics were given a once-over, adding shading to the previously flat-shaded sprites and even touching up the level art. More stages kept coming in, and alongside them several new enemies, difficult bosses and kickass music tracks. I might have had some misgivings with some changes here and there, but by-and-large, this game was pretty much what I imagined when I pledged. I suspect the art style will remain a turn off for some, but for them to skip it completely because of that would be doing themselves a disservice.\n\nI won't say everything's perfect. The plot is pretty good, but doesn't explain some plot events or the general backstory of Avalice well enough, leaving some plot holes that would need to be touched up in future patches (it's tougher for me to gauge as I've been following the game's development closely to catch little factoids in forum discussions here and there, but I expect a newcomer to be left having some questions). Adventure Mode was slated to have various hubs you could visit to access the game's stages and heal up between them, but these had to be cut in the final product, rendering Adventure Mode little more than "cutscenes, please" as opposed to Classic Mode's "next stage, please". The game is pretty easy once you get the hang of how it works, although the final stages and bosses are challenging enough to offset that (plus, it'll still be difficult to do a no-miss clear). The colored spheres you collect from enemies and treasure chests scattered about the levels do nothing more than act as currency for a gambling bonus stage at this immediate moment (a new character planned for a free future update is supposed to make better use of them, but that obviously won't apply to the initial launch). Some of the music fades out and restarts, instead of looping seamlessly (this one never bothered me, but it annoys other people).\n\nThat said, do any of those flaws irreparably mar the experience? To be blunt: no. The core gameplay is so much fun that it trumps any of the things working against it. It might be inspired heavily by other franchises, but I think the resulting mixture is something more than a cynical rip-off; it's a spirited little adventure that evokes the best of '90s gaming. Frankly, that's a game worth a look.\n\nAt the very least, try the demo linked to from the store page. It'll only take about half an hour of your time, letting you try both Lilac and Carol through the first one-and-a-half stages (Milla being exclusive to the paid product). Who knows; if you're skeptical, maybe playing it and seeing how well it comes together will change your mind.","July 21, 2014","true","25.2"," 113 of 138 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","113","138","0","1"

Lovable and memorable characters, melodious music that further invests you in the experience, and a servicable story that does its job to keep you interested.\n\nThe pixel art is meticulously crafted, making the game an absolute joy to look at. Some levels offer multiple paths to keep things fresh on multiple playthroughs, which the game encourages by having 3 playable characters. (I hear a 4th is on the way) Not to mention the devs were smart enough to have an Arcade mode option that skips all the dialog scenes for a straight up Sonic the Hedgehog experience.\n\nAhh yes, the constant references to Sonic that reviews make aren't exactly wrong. It's clear that this game borrows heavily from Sonic with its fast paced gameplay and anthropomorphic characters. Hell, the main plot of the game revolves around recovering a stone of great power, which reminds me of the chaos emeralds. But that's where the similarities end. There's plenty that this game does better than Sonic.\n\nSuch as amazing boss fights that your friends often come to assist you in. And thankfully so, as some of these bosses can be very difficult on your first attempts. However, pretty much all of the bosses are pattern based and can be defeated by observation and learning. This makes the boss fights more a battle of attrition than skill, but many of them are spectacular enough to look past this. And with infinite continues that start you off at the boss room when you get a game over, it's extremely forgiving.\n\nFreedom Planet also offers more options for dispatching enemies than Sonic. Where in Sonic you can only jump on enemies or roll to kill them, Freedom Planet gives you kicks, spins, dashes, rolls, shields, cubes, and a friggin motorcycle to plow through enemies. I'd say the term "Combat Runner" is applicable for this game, as the combat portion can feel very fluid and natural once you get the hang of it. Some of these attacks can even lead into each other, making you look like a real cool dude when you pull off a sweet combo move.\n\nI feel like I could sing this game's praises for another half an hour, but this should be more than enough to convey my feelings. It's so refreshing to see a game on Steam with so much love and attention to detail put into it. I'm looking forward to many more adventures with Lilac, Carol, and Milla in the near future.\n\nIf this game hadn't been gifted to me, it is the first I would buy at full price simply because the devs deserve it for a job well done. I have nothing but respect and admiration for GalaxyTrail.","January 4, 2015","true","9.0"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","65","73","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/248310/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Freedom Planet is a 2D action-platformer that borrows a lot from 16-bit SEGA, Treasure, and Capcom games, but manages to feel fresh and unique through clever design, a folded-in story experience, and obviously a lot of thought put into the game's excellent design.\n\nFreedom Planet tells the story of a group of previously rogue animals, Sash Lilac and Carol Tea, who find themselves involved as one of the few with the knowledge that their home planet's being invaded by an alien overlord, Arktivus Brevon, and his army, who are after a stone of great power that rests on their planet, the Kingdom Stone. Getting involved with two other animals, Milla Basset and Torque, the four of them team-up to try and save the world.\n\nThe voice acting of the game takes a bit to get used to at first, but in the end the actors did good on delivering on their roles, and what I pretty much expected to be a pretty lackluster tale tacked onto the game actually provided characters I did end up caring about, developed through the course of the game, and even got pretty emotionally touching, dark, but with the right amount of humor thrown in to keep it entertaining. However, if you don't care at all about the story, when starting a game you can choose to play 'Classic Mode', which lets you play through all the stages with no story whatsoever.\n\nFreedom Planet features three playable characters, Lilac, Carol, and Milla, all of who control and play completely differently. Lilac is the most straight-forward character, with a focus on speed and acrobatic ability. She can dash madly through stages and will be a favorite of those who have an inner speed demon. She does a variety of beat-em up style combos with slices and kicks for enemies, and uses a charge meter for a variety of her swirl and dash attacks. Carol is slower than Lilac by default, but when she collects gas from stages, she gets the ability to ride a motorbike, which she can use to do a number of spin attacks, wheelies, drive up walls, and a lot more. However, even when off her bike, she can be tactful, with a dagger with longer reach and damage than Lilac's attacks, a jump dash, wall jump, and can use certain devices in stages Lilac can't. Milla is the slowest of the crew, and needs to be played the most tactfully. She can't attack enemies directly easily, but is very good on the defense. She can fly using her ears, summon a green cube at any time which she can throw, use to collect and pick-up nearby objects like bombs, or generate a barrier shield with she can use to defend from attacks. And when she breaks her shield, it forms a laser that delivers high damage to enemies.\n\nAll three characters go through mostly the same stages, but there are a few stages that are exclusive to each character and some stages that two characters may visit while the other will go to their own unique stage. It's very interesting to see how all three tackle the same stages very differently, however.\n\nMost may expect the game on first glance to be a Sonic-clone, the game started development as a Sonic the Hedgehog fan game and has been in development for about three years. However, while playing what I was most reminded of was games by Treasure, such as Gunstar Heroes. The Sonic influence is definitely there, but this game forms itself as a beast all its own through its own unique level design, bigger focus on combat and stage gimmicks, and constantly escalating gameplay.\n\nThe level design is absolutely ace and really impressed me. The stages are unique, fun, and challenging, while both building up difficulty slowly but surely while also introducing a number of new situations and mechanics. Most stages feature completely different enemies and stage gimmicks, but manage to really use them in ways you get familiar with them quickly and then go all-out, which feels natural and progressive despite each stage having a high number of unique gimmicks. You'll do everything from climbing from spike traps, riding disco-ball Ferris Wheels, avoiding drills and kicking them into walls to bypass them, jumping between missiles to get from airship to airship, swimming alongside and avoiding missiles from a submerged submarine, and a lot, lot more. Stages are usually actually fairly meaty, being of pretty decent length and with many multiple paths to take through almost all of them.\n\nSeveral times through most stages you'll fight a number of bosses, usually 2-5 before the stage is up. And they deserve particular mention, as the boss fights are challenging, fun, creative, and feature both strategic yet satisfying encounters that come in a large variety. In a single early stage, you'll fight a golem made of blocks you've been pushing around, a skeletal chicken, a vehicle with a devastating iron claw, and a giant pray mantis with a T-Rex roar, and that again is only in a single level.\n\nAnd this all goes to an extremely awesome and rocking soundtrack that delivers something like a mixture of a Treasure and SEGA soundtrack from the 90s. Each stage has two different songs for the two different halves, and there are a number of boss and cinematic songs through the course of it as well.\n\nHonestly speaking, this is a very solid platformer. It has a good amount of optional content, from a training dojo stage in time attack to collectible trading cards you can find in stages and a variety of challenging achievements,  to replayability with the three very different characters with unique stages to each of them. It is a lot of fun to play from start to finish, and backs itself with some great style, design, and a pretty good story. The end of the game is actually pretty challenging, even on normal difficulty, and this game may feature in my opinion some of the best bosses to ever grace a platformer.\n\nIf you like platformers, and can get over the fact the game features anthropomorphic animals, this game is excellent in its own right. Its not merely a clone of anything, it's a solid indie release and maybe one of the best indie platformers to come out in some time. If you liked SEGA's and Treasures platforming games of the 90s, you need to try this game out.","July 25, 2014","true","7.5"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","0"

Well, not only does it hold its own against the very best Sega has to offer, it's also one of the best platformers I've ever played. It feels like a true evolution of a Sonic game, rather than a derivative, and in that regard I would say that this is closer to what Sonic 4 should have been.\n\nYou have a choice of three playable characters, each with a different set of moves and each one with an exclusive level to play. Lilac, a purple dragon, can perform speed boosts, an aerial spin attack that can also be used as a double jump as well as an assortment of kicks and punches. Carol, a green cat, does a bunch of quick scratch attacks, and a rapid kick; she also breaks out her motorcycle if she finds a gas canister powerup. Milla is slower and more fragile, but can make shields which double as short-range laser beam things, as well as fly short distances by flapping her ears. I have no idea what animal she is supposed to be. Possibly some kind of splotchy rabbit?\n\nThe game is split up into 10 levels. Each level is actually quite massive and varied in design. Very few levels end looking the same as when you started. On the second stage for example, you start off among ruins in a forest, and by the end of the level you're in some sort of mine, dodging machinery, and exploring caves and hidden rooms.\n\nI found that through normal play each level takes a good 8 to 10 minutes to complete due to the sheer size and the number of different pathways you can use. Certainly you would not be able to see everything that's on offer on a single play through, which is also fine because the game comes with a whole bunch of achievements to keep you busy if that's your thing.\n\nThe levels also contain a slew of collectibles and powerups, which are always a welcome way of adding replay value. Collecting hidden cards will unlock things in the gallery. Collect blue crystals to earn extra lives and red petals to replenish your health. There are also orbs that drop from bad guys and treasure chests. The only use I've found for them is during the bonus stage, since the more you've collected, the more times you're able to roll the dice for bonus powerups and extra lives. Of course, to get to the bonus stage, you need to collect something else hidden in the level as well – a yin-yang symbol specifically. Lastly, are shield powerups. They prevent you from taking damage a few times, but also have other effects such as the water shield which allows you to breathe underwater, and there's the lightning shield that attracts blue crystals toward you. Shields also make you immune to certain elemental damage.\n\nThe excellent controls make the task of finding all this loot an enjoyable experience. The level of precision you get from your movements, and the physics affecting your momentum, gives you the feeling that you're totally in control. I wouldn't say the physics are as polished as Sonic's; it does feel like the characters lack weight at times and there's some odd goings with going vertical slopes, but it's still certainly one of the better examples of how to work physics into platform games.\n\nI found myself having a love/hate relationship with the bosses. On one hand, they are a lot of fun. I found myself looking forward to each boss fight because the one that preceded it felt like an epic battle, and emerging victorious was deeply satisfying. On the other hand, they are also rather difficult and bordering on unfair if you're a greenhorn. Some bosses can wipe your entire health meter out in a single blow unless you've worked out their attack patterns and know when and where to dodge.\n\nThe game has a story mode but thankfully it gives you the option to play in "Classic Mode," which skips over the majority of cut-scenes. I say "thankfully," because the story is pretty weak, and the voice acting is a mixed bag. It might however be worth watching on your first play through to see how all the levels and characters tie together. If you enjoyed the story modes from the Sonic Adventure games, then you'll probably enjoy these too. It's a matter of personal preference, really. I don't think the voice acting meshes well with the retro visuals and bizarre creatures.\n\nOn the subject of presentation, the graphics do genuinely look like something you'd see on an older game console, in a good way. Faithfully recreating the look of 16/32 bit era games, it can have a lot of sprites on-screen at the same time, and a lot of rotation and transformation effects, so it would probably have been right at home on a PlayStation or Sega Saturn, save for the fact that it's presented in wide-screen. It would need one of those CD-based consoles to house its amazing soundtrack, which is a delectable selection of tunes that not only fit their designated spots in the game perfectly, but hold up strongly as a standalone soundtrack as well. The rest of the sound design ties everything together, with sound effects for attacks having plenty of punch, and explosion noises giving additional satisfaction to busting through a bunch of robotic enemies.\n\nDon't be put off by the dubious origins of development. Freedom Planet is solid fun from start to finish. It's a game that's suitable for everyone, and packs in a lot of quality content even at its humble $15 asking price.","January 18","true","62.1"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

The trailer couldn't focus on a single part of gameplay for very long, and it just had the main characters parroting lines that vaguely explain the plot but have little context cohesion. Then again, what's there to explain as far as context goes? BIG EVIL GREEN GUY is destroying PLANET CHINA. You must destroy Metal Gear the space invaders before they destroy you!\n\nWithout spoiling anything important, I'll just say that I enjoyed every bit of the story. Yes, parts of it were campy and it had a few plot-holes that probably aren't going to be filled for a while, and some of the jokes feel a bit forced when short-rich-kid is onscreen, but that can all be forgiven. Most of it's clean, and it's a light-hearted adventure where you get to be Hero-Pants (not her real name), a badass dragon-girl with hair-tentacles that can do the shoryuken! She's joined by a kung-fu catgirl on a motorcycle (her best friend), a not-evil space invader (who has a grudge against the main villain), and some orphan girl (plot significance unknown for the time being but she does some cool things in the background) on a quest to prevent the theft of a sacred artifact that provides power to the three neighboring countries involved in the story.\n\nNo, they never mentioned "The Three Kingdoms" in "Planet China." The writers are more subtle than I am.\n\nIn fact, the writing is really good. The villain is competent, correctly identifies the main threats to his plans, and doesn't sit on his rear-end waiting for Hero Pants to come destroy everything. He actively sets effective traps, ambushes, and even gets down to business personally when his subordinates start having trouble with certain player-controlled obstacles. He even gets a torture scene despite this being an E-rated game, complete with interrogation. The writers didn't pull any punches here: a competent villain is a villain players take seriously.\n\nHero-Pants herself, by comparison, is a pretty flat character. She's the hero, she kicks butt, she keeps a cool head in risky situations, and is the first to jump head-first into any situation where a hero is needed. In short, she's what she needs to be as a character, but she's also a cool big sister to the orphan girl she adopts. Hero-Pants also distinguishes herself by existing in a story where nobody ever criticizes or mocks her for being female, and the game itself never forces her into an awkward, forced romance sub-plot. She may not have much that makes her "special," but she's a great protagonist and the writers are awesome for their work on her.\n\nEven in gameplay, the three playable characters have different movesets and playstyles. Hero-Pants is the overall "best at everything" character, Carol is strong but requires a little more skill to use in melee and has to climb walls like Rockman X instead of just floating or dash-attacking upward, and Milla has less health but makes up for it with ranged attacks and a shield.\n\nThe levels are fairly typical for the style of game: you have a jungle level, a sewer level, aquatic ruins, a spaceship, an ancient temple, a couple of snow levels, and the rest of the usual goodies. That said, there are only two levels with "pitfall deaths" and it's completely logical to have them in those levels because you're either on dogfighting airships or on a spaceship where the airlocks have been opened. There are a couple of moments where the design could use a little polish, but overall it shouldn't be too difficult to get through the levels.\n\nThe bosses can be a different story, though. After a few levels they start to reach Rockman / Gunstar Heroes difficulty, which is *extremely welcome* in a platforming game. Part of me hates to admit it, but I actually had to turn the difficulty down to 'Easy' in order to beat the final two levels, and I *still* had a lot of trouble against the final boss in his "I don't need my giant mech, I'll just take care of you in melee" form. Again, loving that the game doesn't hold the players' hand or pull its punches in the boss fights. It just makes the victory that much more satisfying, just like how classic gaming was.\n\nI think my favorite moment in the game is the boss fight where the four primary heroes team up to battle a giant battlemech while racing through the streets. There's another team-up boss fight in the game, but this one comes out of nowhere and it's awesome!\n\nJust try not to get too caught up in why the citizens of Planet China use medieval weaponry and armor while having access to telephones, television, cyborgs and "databases" detailing the lives of the planet's inhabitans.\n___________\n\nAs it's sort-of rated to be a childrens' game, I can't say it's perfect. Some of the plot elements are a little dark, but chances are if a kid is familiar at all with video games, they've seen worse. Maybe wait until your kid's nine or ten years old before getting this for them. That said, it's possibly the only E-rated game I've ever played that treats its female characters with the same amount of respect it gives male characters. I could recommend this game for that detail alone, but it has so much more going for it.\n\nVee's Rating: "I wish I had hair-tentacles that could do the shoryuken."","October 25, 2015","true","11.4"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","33","36","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/248310/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","Jesus, this game was hard.\n\nFreedom Planet is inspired by sonic but really is very much it's own game. After finishing the game as Lilac, I feel both pleased and relieved that I managed to survive the onslaught of bosses this game throws at you, without throwing my controller out of the window. Key take home messages:\n\nBeautiful use of colours\nKick ♥♥♥ dance-dance-revolution-esque soundtrack.\nExcellent voice acting\nEndearing characters\nThis game is hard\nThe bosses are hard\nThis can be frustrating\nI found the level design to be particularly satisfying as it wasn't always just 'run from left to right until the end of the stage'. Level navigation is a key concept in the game, and there isn't always a single path to the end of the stage. There's also other challenges which involve interacting with and navigating your environment. This adds some welcome variety to the gameplay and can serve to slow you down from just running all the time so you can think about how to tackle the next obstacle.\n\nThe sound effects are crisp and have that retro feel, and the soundtrack is really great, and compliments the situations in the game well. The pixel graphics are done very well, and the use of vibrant colours makes this a beautiful game world to look at. I found myself screenshotting away on the regular, as there were many grand screen filling elements of the game. WHich brings me on to the use of screen real estate.\n\nThere's always something going on somewhere in the screen. I found there few if any dead spots, when it came to filling my monitor with game assets or just background artwork. This is not something I ever paid much attention to before when gaming, and I believe it's only really something to be noted in 2D platformers. It doesn't really detract from a game if it's not taken care of (it can even be an aesthetic design choice), but when it's taken care of I feel it can add to my enjoyment of a game world. The game as Lilac was of a good length, and seeing as you can play as other characters, there really is plenty of game to be enjoyed.\n\nFreedom Planet is best enjoyed on a controller. I used an xbox 360 controller, but I got it to work with a Dualshock 4 controller also. This is unsurprising as it's inspired by games like sonic which were initially made for the Sega (and later Nintendo) consoles, which would have used controllers of their own. Keyboard and mouse work fine, but the controls for this game are really basic, and the analogue stick really does compliment the fast paced running and jumping really well.\n\nThe story of Freedom Planet is what I can only describe as lovely, with many warming moments and some nice use of drama. It's not a spectacular story by any means, but it doesn't need to be, and it doesn't advertise itself as thus. It's nice, it adds context to the gameplay and I found it enjoyable. Not every game we play needs to be hard hitting, nitty gritty and I can definitely appreciate a light hearted, but immensley challenging game to sink my teeth into. Ultimately I found Freedom Pplanet to be a well put together, fun, fast paced, pretty, challenging but ultimately rewarding experience.\n\nBut most of all, the best way to describe this game is - fun.","August 8, 2015","true","16.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","1"

I don't like furries, and while I've been a Sonic fan since the Genesis (slightly contradictory to furry hating, I realize), I've also loathed other Sonic fans; you know the ones who make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rip-off art of their "original characters".\n\nOne thing I give myself credit for, however, is even when I go into an experience with a presupposition, I can usually still critique something fairly objectively and admit when I was wrong. Freedom Planet is quite an excellent game.\n\nThe attention to detail in these sprites is incredible. Each character is very well animated, including appropriately cartoony facial expressions. The game is fully voiced, and the acting is surprisingly decent. Granted, some of it feels over the top ("I'M YELLING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YELLING CONVEYS EMOTION!!!!"), and I find most of the female main characters insufferable (they pretty much all do the ~kawaii~, or sassy-cute voices I can't stand) but that's a personal preference and I still feel they do a good job.\n\nFreedom Planet is obviously HEAVILY inspired by classic Sonic titles (you probably wouldn't even be looking at it if you didn't know that) but also borrows a little from other Genesis masterpieces like Ristar, Gunstar Heroes, and Dynamite Headdy.\nIt is certainly inspired, but most importantly still feels like its own game. The level design is very diverse, and each one will give you something new to experience. It is also fairly challenging, perhaps due to using a health bar rather than Sonic's "rings" which keep you effectively invincible as long as you pick them up.\n\nI only really have two complaints:\n1) It feels "Furry" as hell. This is obviously subjective. If you like furries, you're in for a treat of a platformer. If they put you off, you may still enjoy the game, but presumably less so.\nIt may sound completely irrational, given that I've already confessed to being a Sonic fan, but somehow these feel... Furrier.\n\n2) I'm not 100% amazed by the physics engine. The game plays well, but the engine pales in comparison to the classic Sonic games it represents. There is no momentum; from a stopped position, with barely any speed you can run directly up a wall and even along the ceiling.\nCourse-correcting a jump feels sloppy. When you change direction left/right mid-jump, it instantly over-corrects itself, and somewhat dramatically pushes you in the other direction. Not a huge deal, but can be annoying if you're trying to pin-point a precise jump. [EDIT: I haven't been experiencing this jumping issue anymore. Either it was patched, or more likely I was just having a controller problem before.]\n\nOverall it's a fantastic platformer I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.\n\nSonic would be proud. Actually he'd be jealous, since SEGA hasn't done him nearly this much justice in years.","July 25, 2014","true","10.8"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","48","62","0","0"

Story is a bit cliche, but nothing too dull to bore you.\nIf you really hate stories and want to get into the action, there is a 'Classic' mode, where you don't have to watch the cutscenes.\n\nIn my play-through of the game, I chose Lilac. Here is an overview of her character;\n\nLilac (the purple one) is a dragon-girl (don't ask me why, I don't know either).\n\nPlaying as her is fast-paced. You'll be relying on her special ability; 'Dragon Boost' (think Sonic Dash) to gain maximum speed and fly past enemies. Double-jumping gives you a helicopter-like hover/spin, allowing you to jump further, fall slower and deal lots of damage if you time the attack right. Holding 'down' as you perform this attack will have Lilac spin downwards (or along the ground), this can be used more for combat. Lilac also has close-melee attacks, like an upper-cut, downwards kick and a hair whip.\n\nCarol (the green one) is a wild-cat.\n\nCarol plays slower than Lilac, expect more fighting than running. Her attacks deal more damage, but, once again, you'll have to play completely different compared to Lilac. I haven't had as much play-time as Carol, but I'll give you a quick run-down;\n\nCarol's special is a 'Wild Claw' attack. Simply holding the special button will shred anything in her path, easily taking out all. Double jumping will instead of gaining height, perform a 'pounce'. Time it right and you can do a quite bit of damage. This also leads on to Carol's wall-jumping ability, as well as the jumping pads scattered around the map. Standing on one of these pads will let Carol defy gravity, jumping from pad-to-pad, often upside-down. These pads will let Carol access areas Lilac couldn't, or maybe even provide short-cuts if you're into speedrunning.\n\nThere IS a special third character, although I haven't had any playtime as her so I can't say much.\n\nIf you're a platformer, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Like, it's REALLY good. REALLY, REALLY, good.\nJust go buy it already.","April 12, 2015","true","40.5"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","28","29","5","1"

There are 9 stages in total (the last stage being split into 4 acts), and instead of splitting the stage into two acts the stages transitions to different areas. For example you'll be in a hill area and then you'll move onto a forest area. You'll also come across two bosses in each stage. It might be the same boss or two different bosses. The stages are also very large and expansive, with many unlockables and power ups hidden in each part of the stage.\n\nNow let's talk about the gameplay. It plays a bit like Sonic, but has a mix of combat and exploration mixed into it. You can choose between two modes Adventure or Classic. Adventure shows you the story and Classic goes straight to the game without the story. You can also easily speed run the game since you can't get damaged from simply running into enemies. The only exception is if the enemy is attacking and your in it's line of fire. There are three characters to choose from: Lilac, Carol, and Milla (only on classic). And each character plays differently, each with their own skills, attacks, specials, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nSash Lilac: Lilac is the Sonic the Hedgehog of the game. She is able to move very fast and speed across the levels. She can perform a spin to give her some extra height while jumping as well as damage enemies in the air. And her special is a speed dash that allows her to move extremely fast as well as damage enemies who get in the way, and reach up to hard to reach areas.\n\nCarol Tea: Carol is much more offensive than Lilac. Her special makes her perform a kick attack where she attacks an enemy multiple times. When jumping she can perfrom a pounce, which does nothing, but makes up for it with her wall jump that allows her to reach up to hard to reach areas. Also to make up for her lack of speed she also has a (gravity defying) motorcycle that can make her move even faster than Lilac, and can... climb up walls?\n\nMilla Basset: Milla is much more defensive than Lilac or Carol. Milla is capable of hovering into the air like Lilac but can't damage enemies. She is the weakest of the characters with only 4 health points, but makes up for that with her energy based attacks. Instead of a basic attack or special, she has the ability to conjure up energy blocks and pick up items she can throw at enemies. Along with the blocks she can summon an energy shield to deflect and attack enemies. She also has a unique special where she can combo the energy block with the energy shield to unleash a powerful energy beam.\n\nLastly there are many bosses you'll come across. As mentioned before you might come across two, maybe three bosses in one stage. The first boss is easy, but then things get seriously difficult. As you progress the bosses only get harder... and harder... and HARDER!!! The bosses go with a certain pattern but can be difficult to fight. When I first started playing I thought I was going to breeze through the game and get the "no death clear" achievement. But when I came across the 4th stage boss I was in serious trouble. I died like 6 times trying to fight him. Once you figure out the pattern you should be able to beat the boss. But the most trouble I had was in the final stage. The final stage literally tests your skill and the bosses won't hold back. When I reached the first boss in the final stage, my final time was 20 minutes, and it only took me 6 minutes to reach the boss. The second boss was just as hard as the first boss. The third boss is not as hard, but still pretty difficult. The final boss, I'm not going to reveal a lot, but I will say: you better get used to seeing that continue screen, cause your going to see it a lot.\n\nWell I think I rambled on enough about the gameplay, so lets get to the story (no spoilers of course). The story goes on like this: An evil general known as Lord Brevon has crash landed onto a planet and now seeks an ancient relic called the Kingdom Stone to power his ship and leave the planet, as well as help grow his army. The Kingdom Stone is a power source for three kingdoms: Shang-Mu, Shang-Tu, and Shuigang. Lord Brevon and his army raided Shuigang, killed their king, and brainwashed the king's son: Prince Dail into following Lord Brevon's orders and now seeks to find his father's killer (even though he is taking orders from him). Then comes Lilac the Dragon and Carol the Wildcat, who caught sight of a crash landing ship and met Torque a "Shell-Duck", and later on met Milla the Hound. Now it is up to the group to stop Lord Brevon and bring peace to the three kingdoms before it goes into war.\nThe characters are very entertaining in the story. Literally the best part of the game are the cutscenes where the characters are talking and interacting with each other, as well as being every expressive. Lilac being a no nonsense leader, Carol being a wisecracking rebel, and Milla (who is plain out adorable) being very enthusiastic, acting more like an asset instead of a liability. In fact all of the characters are very fun and unique. Even though the voice actors are amateurs they seriously do a great job. The dialogues are cheesy, but they have a certain charm that makes it enjoyable, and makes the characters very memorable. Pretty much the entire story feels like a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nOverall Freedom Planet is a fun and enjoyable adventure with memorable characters, large levels, a fantastic soundtrack, and challenging bosses. This game isn't afraid to be hard, and you'll be determined to finish it.\n\nIt's a shame that not a lot of people know about this game. The release of the game was kind of under the radar, and it was only on the Steam front page for only a couple of days. If you look it up on youtube there are plenty of lets play videos, but only by lesser known youtubers. So far only two major youtube channels looked at this game: Yogscast Zoey and Yogscast Martyn.\n\nMartyn:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1eWoPQDUU\nZoey:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43Z1wZZRjAQ\n\nHopefully in due time the game will gain more attention.\n\nBut besides that the game is still fantastic and I hope to see more of Lilac, Carol, and Milla in the future. I really hope that some day in the future there will be a sequel. Or maybe a cartoon series... Hey if Mighty No.9 can get a animated series, certainly Freedom Planet will get it's own series... maybe... hopefully... Maybe just a sequel.\n\nThe final rating: BUY IT!

The similarities to Sonic are the first thing everyone mentions, and while Freedom Planet's inspirations are clear, the game is far from a clone.\n\nThe game has engaging combat, very tough but very exciting and rewarding bosses, a pretty good (but, imho, very poorly paced) story, some memorable characters (if you are into the story), large and varied level design, excellent 16-bit-style pixel art, catchy late-90s "CD-quality-audio"-style music, and 3 characters, each with their own unique movesets and playstyles (like, seriously. They play TOTALLY differently).\n\nI highly suggest this game for anyone who grew up with a Sega Genesis, people who love platforms, people who love Sonic, people who hate Sonic (seriously, this ISN'T Sonic), and anyone who's just looking for a good time. This game seriously needs more attention.\n\n8.5/10 ( 1.5 Points deducted for story pacing issues and for 1 or 2 bosses I don't find fair)","June 18, 2015","true","44.4"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","3"

The demo offered during the kickstarter campaign had solid controls and gameplay, but everything else felt a touch rough.\n\nNow, the finished game has launched and it's extremely polished for an Indie game. The controls and and gameplay are tighter than most AAA platformers I've played; new or old. The story and voice acting may be a little cheesy in today's standards, but face it; back in the early/mid 90s platformers always had cheezy stories and if they had voice acting it was awful!\n\nSo what does Freedom Planet have to offer the saturated 2D Platformer genre aside from good controls and gameplay? Well, the retro visuals are very well done with excellent choice in colour. The music style not only suits the visual style and gameplay, but is also quite pleasent to listen to on it's own. The levels often have several different paths can be crisscrossed at whim in most cause with each level having atleast 2 bosses(there are 10 levels in total). The difficulty curve is very nice; The game starts off fairly easy and steadily becomes quite challenging, even for the most experienced crowd.\n\nMost odd of all for a 2D platformer is that there are multiple characters with vastly different playstyles. Lilac is your standard high-powered lead character replicating Sonic the hedgehog mixed with kung-fu. Carole is slower and weaker but has a megaman-like walljump. She can also pickup gas cans to gain a motorcycle powerup which allows her to move even faster than Lilac and perform different moves. These two characters have many overlapping stages.\n\nMilla is the 3rd character currently and does not have an "adventure"(read: story) mode yet. Milla plays much slower than Carole or Lilac but has completely different abilities and much less health. Her gameplay is often more technical and she has some different levels from Carole and Lilalc.\n\nAll-in-all Freedom Planet feels like a 16-bit platformer than we were promised in the 1990s but denied thanks to 3D graphics becoming a must for all games. If you enjoyed and still enjoy the platformers from the Sega-Genesis/Saturn, SNES, and Neo-Geo era then this game is for you. If you like 2D platformers as a whole you will atleast want to check out the free demo on the developer's website.","July 21, 2014","true","19.4"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","46","61","0","0"

The game's great in some areas and poor in others, while not being as  memorable as the 8-bit wonder of Shovel Knight or as popular as Five Nights at Freddie's, this is one of those underrated gems that's just a little too overlooked.\n\nGameplay: 9/10: If you're familiar with classic Sonic The Hedgehog, you'll be fairly familiar with Freedom Planet. A fast-paced platformer with multiple characters to choose from with their own unique talents to add more versatility in the game. The controls themselves are fluent for the most part, only having a minor issue with the ends of jumps (Though this is only really apparent in a level outside of the main game itself). The difficulty itself isn't too bad, though the difficulty spike really ramps up specifically at the Stage 8 midboss, onwards. The bosses are cleverly designed and get rightfully more difficult as the game progresses, requiring you to use different strategies with your character. My only real complaint are the powerups, consisting nothing but shields, shields, and more shields.\n\nGraphics 7/10: The visuals in the game are very appealing, especially for a 16-bitish game, and most of the character designs are great. Not just the characters, but the stages are also designed very well, which is where a majority of my praise comes from, going through temples in one instance only to be traveling through a supermarket filled with baddies the next. Admittedly though, Quite a few instances feel very oriental, which throws me off of the otherworldly experiance. Knowing this is taking place on a whole seperate planet and I can't think that these sentient species decide to have their culture similar to that of Earth's Asian cultures. Call it a nitpick as well, but I can't see an alien culture heavily similar to our own.\n\nStory 5/10:The worst thing about Freedom Planet is the story, voice acting, and character developement... Respectively. While there are a couple good voices and originality put into the story, it's overshadowed by the sub-par voices and Clichés. Your characters don't go too far from being tokens, the main 3 playable characters being a good example (Lilac=levelheaded heroin, Carol=hot-temptered but a softy on the inside, Milla=heavily shy and emotional, opening up to previously mentioned characters). The story itself is passable, and you're free to select "classic" mode to ignore most of it.\n\nAs for the voice acting, a majority is tolerable with the exception of Spade, who's... Cringeworthy for having the "edgy emo kid" tone, similar to Shadow the Hedgehog but a little more "amateur-ish". Torgue's doesn't fair well either simply for having little emotion for a vast majority of the game along with a slight scottish accent, subtle to the point where can't really tell if he's got one or not. I can't ignore the voices that aren't bad at all, like the Magister's, Lord Brevon's, and the Dragon Scientist's.\n\nSound 8/10: The game's soundtrack is great overall, with a few hiccups here and there. While most tracks are great like Relic Maze's, Dragon Valley, Thermal Base and more, there are few duds like half the Dreadnaught themes that I'm not a fan of. The main theme of the game however is one of the best in it, which just amps you up to hear more of what the soundtrack has to offer. By no means is this the sound quality of Shovel Knight, it's still worth a good listen!\n\nThe game's flawed, yes, but even if you're not much of a fan of Sonic, you'd probably still like Freedom planet. It's not as fast-paced as Sonic, but that's easily countered by the special traits each character has within their abilities. As for the Sonic fans themselves: If you've wanted some resurrection in the series, Freedom Planet isn't that- It's a reincarnation.","March 13, 2015","true","17.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","29","33","2","3"

So how does it hold up? Well, as an indie action game, it is quite spectacular, despite a few noticeable rough edges. The platforming and combat are both very tight, thanks to excellent controls and the visuals are a retro treat.\n\nThe game is quite challenging on normal difficulty, however dropping the difficulty to easy makes it almost impossible to lose, even in the boss fights towards the end of the game. I haven't tried hard mode yet, but based on my experiences with normal, expect a considerable bump in the level of challenge. One thing I found very welcoming compared to a lot of platform games is the lack of cheap deaths. There are very few bottomless pits and the few instant death mechanics in the game are telegraphed well ahead of time with visual and audio cues, so they never feel unfair.\n\nThe audio needs a mention too, the music is fantastic throughout with a lot of subtle and not so subtle nods to old genesis classics. The voice acting is generally good, but can be inconsistent at times, more so in the earlier scenes in story mode. Some voiceovers are better than others, too, not only in terms of performance, but recording quality - unsurprising since the voicework was recorded on different hardware for different actors. But you have to remember this is about as indie as a game can get and the Troy Bakers and Tara Strongs of the world do not work for free. Fortunately for those who might be bothered by this, the game can be played in a "classic" mode, where all of the cutscenes between levels are skipped in favor of continuous action.\n\nIn terms of bugs, there is one very noticeable visual glitch with the airship not showing any thrust from its engines, but otherwise things behave as they should visually. Gameplay wise, I've had one major glitch so far where I phased through a solid ceiling when a block spawned on me - the block pushed me up through the ceiling. Oh and the unlockable Mahjong game's controls are very twitchy and prone to ignoring commands unless you turn control sensitivity right down.\n\nBottom line though, this is a fantastic piece of indie game development, especially given its humble origins. I'd fully recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in retro platformers and doubly to anyone that enjoys speedrunning.","July 22, 2014","true","51.1"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","39","53","0","0"

A sonic fangame gone rogue, its become some kind of astonishing hybrid of all the best Genesis titles, blended together in a fine puree. Some critics will argue that the game suffers from being slower-paced than the Sonic games we are all reminded of by this title--this is missing the point. This is what Sonic should have been all along. Let's get real, the Sonic franchise is not self-sustainable. I've played the old Sonic games and then thought to myself, what if I could have more? I thought about what that would mean, to have Treasure-inspired bossfights in a Sonic game. How would that look? How could you do that with the ring system? I've dreamt of working on a game like this, hoping that it would exist at all, but I kinda gave up on that concept many many years ago.\n\nBut here it is. Here it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is, in a glorious mix of Rocket Knight, Ristar, Gunstar Heroes, Pulse Man, and yes of course Sonic. Hell there is even some Megaman in the stage design if you pay attention.\n\nIs it a perfect game? No. Is it the perfect game for me? Oh my god yes. There is not much of a clear difficulty curve until the very end. The first two levels are easy enough but its hard to pick out a boss fight that's anything less than an adrenaline rush. If you don't like the pacing of oh say, Gunstar Heroes... No nevermind that thought. Gunstar Heroes is awesome, screw you.\nVoice acting, not perfect. There's a super adorable character who the writing and acting side of me can't stand and yet I still find her cute? Without a doubt the main antagonist's voice acting steals the show. Look forward to that!\nYou will also notice some curious sprite imperfections. I won't call them errors just oversights.\nGame can slowdown at times and will cause button inputs to get lost in translation, sometimes at critical moments. That could use some work if possible, but its something you can compensate for by acting quickly.\nSome of the boss attacks are slightly cheap. You won't know they're coming the first time around.\n\nPretend its a Sonic game made by Treasure, then give it an actually attention holding plotline. Real basic stuff but they told it right and most of the characters are actually 3Dimensional. Those that aren't are 2Dimensional and that's more than I can say for the Sonic franchise (or Treasure for that matter).\n\nBut don't let any of that fool you. References to Treasure and Sonic team aside, this is GalaxyTrail now. Look what they did. They deserve a career. Give them a career. I will hunt you down if you don't give them a career. Cuz if they get and maintain some momentum people will be comparing future games to GalaxyTrail and Sonic Team and Treasure might become relics.","December 10, 2014","true","67.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","21","25","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ampyluxe/recommended/248310/","ampyluxe","Ampyluxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ampyluxe/","114 products in account","SHORT VERSION: Heavenly movement physics, superb soundtrack, fun characters, excellent level design, and a solid challenge. Essentially the sum total of everything I love about 90s platformers. Fantastic and absolutely worth your time.\n\n-----\n\nFreedom Planet is absolutely the most fun I've had with any platformer in a very long time. It hearkens back the colorful, action-packed titles of the 90s, and though you'll hear plenty of comparisons to Sonic, Gunstar Heroes, Rocket Knight Adventures, and more, Freedom Planet has more than enough on top of it all to avoid being a mere retread and instead establish its own identity.\n\nThe story found in Adventure Mode is generally entertaining and humorous, with a few moments darker than the average Saturday morning cartoon to spice things up. Lilac and her anthropomorphic buddies unite to confront the sinister Lord Brevon, an alien warlord who's determined to steal the planet's energy source, the Kingdom Stone. Nothing too fancy, but the cast is generally likable, with an enjoyable main trio, a host of fun side characters, and a refreshingly competent villain you'll love to hate. It's clear the voice team had a lot of fun (especially with certain voices), and they do a solid job adding character and personality to the cast.\n\nOf course, if you're not into the whole "plotline" thing, the game has a Classic mode that skips all the long cutscenes to focus on the core gameplay. There's also Time Attack (with a host of speedrun challenges) and a Training mode that has you breaking targets and getting a feel for everyone's moves. The Gallery has lots of artwork, music, and other fun knick-knacks to unlock by collecting the trading cards hidden in each level too.\n\nFreedom Planet truly shines when it comes to its exceptional controls. Movement feels great whether you're blasting off with Lilac's speed, double-jumps, and invincible dash attack, leaping up walls and whipping out lightning kicks as Carol, or firing off projectiles and shield bursts as you fly through the air with Milla. All three play very differently while still finding their own niche within the (mostly) same stages, which span a huge variety of fun game mechanics and enemies, most of which are brand new each level. Powerups include a quintet of elemental shields that can take a hit or two while granting special powers like health/collectible magnetism, fire/spikes protection, or a personal air supply, plus a standard invincibility powerup (complete with main theme remix!).\n\nThere's a number of difficulty settings that cover all the bases. Casual is easy enough for anyone to pick up with its regenerating health, and Easy is a good starting point if you haven't played many platformers. Normal is definitely a solid challenge even with some experience, and Hard pulls out all the stops to make things as difficult as possible. You can switch around difficulty as you please if you find a mode too generous or strict, so it's easy to find your sweet spot. Early stages and bosses are simple, but they ramp up considerably over time, and reckless brawling will get you killed in short order.\n\nThere's truly a lot of love present in the extra little touches and nods the dev team threw in. Some are as simple as animations for sitting on benches or dancing, while others are more subtle (Lilac's a water dragon, so she can stay underwater much longer than the other characters). An especially nice touch with cutscene fights is that you don't have to sit through them repeatedly when you lose--they get right to the point once you've seen the intro for the first time. On top of it all, the game has a fantastic soundtrack that sets the mood for each stage and ties the whole experience together wonderfully.\n\nFreedom Planet is well worth picking up if you like platformers at all, and even if you aren't the biggest fan this may warm its way into your heart all the same. Absolutely recommended, especially if you can get it combined with the soundtrack!","November 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/248310/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","NOTE: This is a slightly shortened version of my review without screenshots. For the full review, please visit  Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\nIntroFirst thing's first - It is flat-out impossible to review this game without mentioning the obvious influence. As many of you probably already know, Freedom Planet began as a Sonic the Hedgehog fan game by developer GalaxyTrail. Freedom Planet is a tribute to Sonic the Hedgehog in every sense of the word, ranging from the title (Planet Freedom was the name of the planet in Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie) to the graphical style (16-bit Genesis style to a T), antoropomorphic characters, catchy-as-all-hell music and level design. This game plays much like reskinned Sonic the Hedgehog. If that sounds appealing to you, then I highly recommend this game. On the other hand, If sonic didn’t do anything for you then Freedom Planet certainly isn’t bringing anything new to the table.\n\nStoryI’ll be honest – the story is meh. Evil alien warlord has come to your planet and stolen this huge crystal that powers up everything and has made two of the kingdoms on the planet turn on each other. It’s your job to stop him. There’s not a whole lot to say, but let’s be honest, Sonic the Hedgehog never really had a story at all so we can’t really fault them too much for trying.\n\nOne warning though - the dialogue in this game is garbage. I have to commend the voice actors for doing a relatively decent job at delivering lines which are really God damn awful. Luckily, this is all skippable stuff.\n\nGameplayIn case it wasn’t obvious by now, the game plays very much like Sonic the Hedgehog. At the beginning of the game, you get a choice between Adventure and Classic mode, with the difference being that Adventure mode has the cutscenes embedded between levels, whilst Classic doesn’t. After this, you have the option to choose between two main characters – Lilac, a dragon, or Carol, a cat. Each character has their own distinct abilities and attacks, which primarily influence which areas in a level you can reach and how you approach each boss fight. Speaking of abilities and attacks – this is one thing that Freedom Planet did do to stray from the Sonic formula. Whilst Sonic primarily limited to jumping onto and spinning into enemies, the characters in Freedom Planet can attack with several different moves, allowing for a more varied approach to tackling enemies and, in particular, bosses.\n\nIn terms of level design, a lot of familiar favourites from old Sonic games can be found, including those bouncy spring things and the classic loop-the-loops. Like the Sonic games, each level is fairly open-ended. Whilst the primary goal is, more often than not, to go from left to right, there are multiple pathways through which you’re able to accomplish this goal, and the game rewards those with an exploratory itch by placing collectibles all over the levels for you to find.\nOne major difference between this and the Sonic games is that Freedom Planet sheds the classic Sonic ring-based health system for a more traditional one.\n\nThe game took me approximately 6 hours on my first run-through with Lilac. The game has a considerable amount of replay value, as playing as each of the two main characters offers a very different experience in terms of traversing the levels and more importantly, boss fights. Furthermore, the game has time trials for anyone that fancies themselves a speedrunner.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I would say this game is just about what you’d expect from the original 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games.  That is the say, the game is definitely beatable, particularly for children of the 90’s that grew up on games like this, but less-experienced and younger players are likely to struggle in the later boss fights, with the last boss being a particularly offensive kind of A-hole.\n\nPresentationThe game looks… Sonic-y. I’m sorry, but it’s hard to describe it as anything else other than 16-bit Genesis graphics … with “blast processing”, of course. If you can picture Sonic the Hedgehog with an oriental flavour then you’ll probably have a pretty good idea of what it looks like. It’s worth noting (although it probably carries no weight whatsoever to people reading this) that my girlfriend, a non-gamer who was under the impression that both games were released in the early 90s, thought Sonic 3 looked significantly better than Freedom Planet when I showed both to her one after the other.\n\nOne complaint that I had in particular was the fact that the character-size-to-screen ratio was too big. The issue is that for a game as fast-paced as this, it’s very hard to see very far into your surroundings, so you always get hit by things you weren’t prepared for. Like, I get that the original Sonic games were like this too, but that was due to the technical limitations at the time. This kind of design is a relic of the past, and it should’ve been left there.\nAnother complaint is that there are certain sections of the game where it’s particularly difficult to distinguish the things in the foreground from those in the background. There are numerous times where a platform or crate looks like something you can interact with, only for you to fall right through it. This isn’t terribly gamebreaking for the most part, but it definitely feels sloppy.\n\nThe sound in the game is tolerable for the most part, except for the sound of going on springs, which makes this wretched and piercing cymbal sound. I have no idea why the flying ♥♥♥♥ they decided to replace the awesome ‘Boing” noise from Sonic with this horrible earache, but I really wish they hadn’t.\n\nAs previously stated, the voice acting is fairly decent but the dialogue itself is cringeworthy.\nOne thing I did absolutely love about the game was the awesome soundtrack. Whilst the individual pieces don’t necessarily stick out as much as the best tracks from the old Sonics, the soundtrack succeeds in the consistency of quality – there isn’t a single track that was played in the game that I didn’t enjoy, or think didn’t belong.\n\nOverall impressionOverall, I think Freedom Planet did a great job in doing what it was made to do – be a Sonic the Hedgehog game with original characters. With that said, it really is nothing special either, nor did it bring anything new to the table. It’s unfortunate to have played this after playing Shovel Knight, as maybe I’m a bit spoiled. Shovel Knight did everything correctly – they took existing games from the late 80’s/early 90’s and made a modernised version of it that retained all the magic of the earlier games, whilst shedding the frustrating, broken and outdated aspects of them (such as the password save system of Mega man). Freedom Planet, on the other hand, chose to keep everything the same, and thus feels very dated. In other words, this game looks like it was released in 1992, and if it had been, no one would have found anything about the game to be particularly unusual.\n\nWhich also raises another question – Who exactly is this game designed for? The dialogue and storyline are blatantly childish and, for lack of a better word, “girly”. The problem then is that this style of game is almost certainly not going to appeal to a young gamer, due primarily to the difficulty and the completely outdated graphical style\nWith all that said, the bottom line is this: the game is fun, will last you a good amount of time, will probably tickle some nostalgic bones and has a great soundtrack. As a result, I’d recommend it to anyone that has already played Shovel Knight and needs another throwback to the good old days of 2D platforming. If you haven’t played Shovel Knight yet though, I’d recommend getting that one first.","November 18, 2014","true","10.4"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","6"

This isn't a Sonic clone. It's more basically taking all the best action platformers on the Genesis, and putting it on one really, REALLY good game. There's bits of Sonic, sure. But there's also Ristar, Gunstar Heroes, Pulseman, Rocket Knight Adventures, Mega Man X... (Not technically a Genesis game, but you get my point)\n\nYou've got the general speed of the Sonic games, where you get a lot of chances to just go really fast and tear through things. When you get beyond that, though, there's some really good level design, with a good number of secrets and alternate paths. And there's some of the best boss fights I think I've ever played in an indie game for a long, long while, especially when you reach the later half of the game.  It's difficult enough you might need to use a couple of continues, but it's never unreasonable.\n\nI've only beat the game with one character so far, and I'm probably going to get into another one soon.

This game needs more attention, because, without a doubt, it is definitively one of the best platformers this year, and already on my GOTY list. It's far better than Sonic has been in years, hell, I honestly think it might be better than any Sonic game I've ever played. It feels like a lost 2D Sega Saturn game that could've been a Sonic spin-off but just as much feels like its own thing, and it succeeds on its own merits.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, capturing the physics, speed and flow of the classic Sonic games while adding fairly simple combat mechanics and making enemies a legitimate threat, feeling like a sort of a mixture of Sonic, Ristar, Mega Man and Gunstar Heroes, with well-designed levels that branch into multiple paths, with a ton of hidden cards to collect. The game is challenging, but not frustrating, most particularly the bosses. I'll just say this now: Freedom Planet does bosses better than Sonic ever did, both in terms of challenge and just how damn fun they are. The demo's one boss actually pales in comparison to what the rest of the game has in store. And in some boss fights, the characters you're not playing as actually assist you in multiple ways.\n\nThe visuals and music are superb, though that's evident in the demo. The narrative is interesting, because while the story and script isn't amazing and revolutionary, and isn't really meant to be, there's just so much heart put into it and it's so well-done that there's more to it than just retro cheese. I love the characters and the story, despite my own general dislike of cutscenes, and I actually found myself laughing at some points (in a good way). But I was genuinely surprised by what Galaxytail was willing to do on-screen, which leads us to the next point - the star of the show might be in fact Lord Brevon, the game's antagonist. His evil and cruelty isn't overstated, and acquits himself impressively in the game's opening, which is in the demo. It's the sort of introduction that most villains would kill for. And that's before he performs some major dog-kicking moments later on. But that's not all to him, he's also incredibly crafty and pragmatic, and it shows in the final stage, for example. He's such a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and yet now he's one of my favorite villains. Oh, and he pulls no punches as the final boss. The opening is only a preview of what's in store for you. Expect multiple game overs.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic game, and not only embraces its inspirations, but transcends them to become its own unique experience. It's a must-play, IMO.","July 17, 2014","true","25.4"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","31","45","0","0"

This game has ended up being one of the best choices i've ever made on steam. This game is done in the style of the classic Sonic games, but with multiple playable characters with varying abilities. The soundtrack and environments in this game are STUNNING, the character designs are interesting and well sprited, and the bosses are really cool. I've heard complaints about the voice acting, but it's nothing worse than anything SEGA has put out making actual Sonics. The story is kind of cheesy but honestly what do you expect. I really enjoyed the characters personally. For those not interested in cutscenes there's a classic mode that's just the levels all strung together as well. After all these good things though, the best part of this game by far is the actual gameplay. I cannot stop playing this game. I accidentally blew almost 5 hours playing it before I knew any time had passed. If i could reccomend any game on steam right now it would probably be this one.\n\nNEW ONE\nOk so I'm sitting here with 100 hours dedicated to this game and I still play it pretty much every day. All three of the characters play differently enough that I've become dedicated to learing all of them, and the achivements for speedrunning and no death clearing are some of the proudest i have on steam. Originally i thought i'd clear this game once and be done with it, but I literally cannot stop playing this game. Once you become experienced with handling this game speedrunning your favorite stages (Jade Creek <3) is a blast. Hard mode is really quite difficult on some of the stages, and it's really rewarding to complete.

Mixes a bunch of classic game elements, stuff from Sonic, Sparkster, Megaman X, and many other games.\n\nPlayed it, loved it.\n\nPros:\n- Tight Controls, very responsive.\n- Multiple characters, each with fun combat and platforming abilities, and alternate routes through   levels.\n- Great variation in levels, from a rocky canyon, to a china themed city and shopping mall, all looking amazing\n- Platforming and Combat are fast, fun, and challenging.\n- VISUALS AND MUSIC. SO GOOD.\n\nInbetween:\n- Full enough story, wasn't great but it was engaging enough.\n- The obvious one, voice acting wasn't great. Doesn't disturb the mood of the story, thankfully.\n- Few animations and set pieces ripped straight out of Sonic games. Not really a bad thing, but it doesnt quite have the same effect.\n\nCons:\n- Audio mixing is off at times, sound goes from very quiet, to a bit too loud at times.\n- Bosses can be extremely unpredictable, and often have changing patterns that are hard to keep up with. Be ready to die many times.\n- Can't change game settings while in game.\n- ONLY A SLIDER FOR MUSIC VOLUME? WAAAA\n\nOverall, very well rounded, fufilling game. Had a lot of fun (almost entirely) the whole way though.\n\nI'd be down for a sequel.\n\nFreedom Galaxy.

Fast paced with plenty of action and challenging, but fun bosses (if you think the first boss in the demo was a walk in the park, wait until you get to the later stages).\n\nExcellent visuals with superb soundtrack that will make you want replay and explore the stages as on of the cute and charming characters. But don't let the cute and charm fool you, they are powerful fighters! Each character have their own differences of powers and game play that are fairly balanced and not game breaking.\n\nMy minor cons with the game are the cutscenes can drag a bit, but scenes can be skipped without missing much of the story and the colours of characters and visuals can blend in some parts of the game.\n\nIn short, this is a fantastic game for anyone wanting nostalgic platformer with a all new fun adventure.","July 18, 2014","true","14.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","1"

Yeah it looks quite similar, eh? But no. It's a completely different kind of game that delivers a beautiful, unique experience. A lot of the mechanics in the game resemble classic platformers and brawlers, and the entire game feels like a nostalgic trip to my times of innocence.\n\nIt's got incredibly high replay value as there are three different characters to play, and you can opt to or not to play either the story mode or just straight up the levels. Let me tell you though, the narrative and cutscenes in this game are AMAZING! The voice acting is spectacular and the animation is fluid and consistent. The story is engaging, and you really start to hate the final boss and wanna take him out. And guess what? He's actually memorable! He's not just some dude they needed for the story, he's a well crafted character whose defeat is extremely satisfying! They really put their hearts into the narrative for Freedom Planet, man.\n\nThe gameplay is as you would expect from a platformer whose main influences are Sonic games, but with so much more. It isn't just simple jumping and brawling, but a lot of modern concepts were taken into account in the development of this game. Every level introduces something new for you to learn to use, and most of these new gimmicks or stipulations are necessary for exploration and finding all the collectables. It's definitely a shame when you miss a Yao coin when you coulda gotten that bonus stage.\n\nThe graphics are phenominal! There are so many different enemy variations, so many different kinds of regions with different weather, so many locales. Toward the last third of the game things start to feel very metroid-y as far as the locations and graphics go. Everything is consistent annd beautiful and it just doesn't let up. I was seriously blown away by how pretty this game is.\n\nThe music is absolutely delightful. The rnb influence for the later levels gets me every time. The soundtrack is reasonably cheap on Steam, too. I'd say the music is on par with Valdis Story and even A Valley Without Wind 2. The feels, man.\n\nSo, if you haven't guessed by now, I rate this game a 10 out of ♥♥♥♥ing 10. This game blew me away and I can't wait to play through the other character stories and try my hand at the time attack leaderboards. Definitely recommend this!","January 17, 2015","true","7.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","3"

Not much about her except she's the most bland character in the game.\nShe's easy to pick up and use, but that's about it. She has a cyclone and a totally-not-spindash Dragon Boost.\n\nCarol is my favorite, she pretty much fits every trait I would want out of a person and I see my personality in her at times.\nMost people say Milla is the hardest to learn, but I think it's Carol. The motorcycle takes a while to master, and it's not easy to use her even after that.\nShe plays the most like a Sonic character, complete with a roll, but at the same time feels the most different; her playstyle is NOTHING like Knuckles, even though they both have a wall climb.\n\nWarning: I am in love with Carol. Do not talk terribly about her around me. My yandere will attack you.\n\nMilla, DEAR ♥♥♥♥ING LORDY MILLA WHY ARE YOU SO TERRIBLE?!\nShe has the least HP out of the characters, the worst attacks, it's like they specifically MADE her to be bad!\nThough the speedrunning community sees her differently from that, it's mostly because they love spamming the one USEFUL attack she has.\n\nThe other two characters, Spade and Torque, I know barely anything about.\n\nSpade looks like an edgy character. Most people compare him to Shadow, but I would disagree. LOOK AT THE HAIRSTYLE, PEOPLE! SHADOW DOESN'T HAVE BANGS!\nCome to think of it, all the Sonic characters don't wear clothes! Thankfully they knew that was weird and gave them clothes in this game.\nOkay, back to Spade. Judging from his boss appearance, he can throw cards, dash, and do this thing where he throws his cards at the ground and floats up.\nI'm kinda expecting him to be an anti-villian in his Adventure Mode.\n\nTorque is... Torque. He's weak, has a gun, a dash, and a floaty thing. I don't know either.\nBut... ♥♥♥♥ing aliens, man. They are WEIRD.\n\nOKAY, OKAY, BEFORE ANYONE COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS "HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS STUFF" I'LL ADMIT IT:\nI have played as them...\n\n...IN FANGAMES! You guys haven't seen the Torque fangame? He looks pretty useful in that one!\nAnd Spade is playable in Supra Smash Bross Version 5, while he uses a different looking appearance in Version 6. Well, the game did start as a fangame, beta design?\n\nI actually liked the story and the voices, as I felt it added to the game's personality and made it feel less Sonic-like to me.\n\nThe music is great too: All the boss themes (but m_boss6 and it's b counterpart) are great! It's even better when you replace all them with the Jotaro theme from Jojo's Bizzare Adventure.\n\nThe thing that stands out the most to me is THE GRAPHICS. OH DEAR LORDY, THEY ARE AMAZING.\nI enjoy the anime-esque looking characters, I mean, Lilac? Why do you have a face that would work in an episode of FMA as your sliding face? AND CAROL'S AMAZING LEGS OF AMAZINGNESS, ABLE TO HOLD A GRAVITY-DEFYING MOTORCYCLE FOR MINUTES ON END.\nThen again, it's a gravity-defying motorcycle.\n\nIn the end, Freedom Planet is one of the best games I have ever played.

Additionally, there are THREE characters with very separate and unique sets of gameplay mechanics (two available in Story mode, the third only in classic).  I've played through the entire game with all three, and I can say that even when visiting the exact same level or fighting the exact same boss (some levels/bosses are unique to certain characters, but most are shared) it became a different experience just from these characters' unique abilities. For example, Sash Lilac can periodically rocket herself in any primary or diagonal direction (and be temporarily invulnerable while doing so) while Carol Tea has wall-jumping, rolling and claw-strike attacks, and a truly awesome motorcycle. The third character, Milla, has very little health but can reflect most projectiles, and pick up powerups or generate blocks out of thin air to throw, while traversing verticle space with a klonoa-style limited flight.\n\nIf I had to nitpick anything about the game, it's a lack of multiplayer, and the voicework (while I personally enjoyed it) was for certain characters done with recording hardware of noticeably lower quality.  Neither of these small details made the game overall any less spectacular.","December 11, 2014","true","17.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

What I got was the game that became my overall game of the year for 2014, not just indie game of the year, though I do admit that I'm biased towards good 2D action games. Now, through and through, this game is loaded with good design. Fast stages that reward exploration, elaborate bosses, quite a bit of challenge (but also a difficulty option that goes all the way down to “the biggest challenge is figuring out how to die” super-easy, if you really can't beat a boss), wonderful pixel art, and even the story is interesting.\n\nThe thing that stood out more than everything else has to be the bosses, and they were the kind of fights that (figuratively) had me at the edge of my seat, then (literally) hollering when I managed to defeat some of the more difficult ones. Some of them are screen-filling affairs, and some of the bosses are the same size of the player character. Others have multiple phases, and I was particularly impressed to see one that was An homage to Seven Force from Gunstar Heroes\nThat moment was huge for me, and I was shouting ____ YEAH! during the fight... even as it destroyed me. Perseverance is rewarded, and it did eventually fall.\n\nThe multiple characters were also great, especially since they play completely differently. While I did end up preferring Lilac's cyclone and dash attacks to anything the others had, Carol's motorcycle was a lot of fun, and Milla's shield and low health requires a much different strategy. The changes in mobility, speed, range, and even basic function of the abilities was really cool, and the character-specific stages also show that the developers put a lot of thought into it. More characters are promised, too, and I look forward to playing the game through with them.\n\nAll-in-all, Freedom Planet had everything that I would want in a 2D action game, and it did it with style. It's kind of like Sonic, but it's far and away better than Sonic Team ever produced, even at their Sega Genesis heights. Among 2-D action games, I think that Freedom Planet is better than anything else that I've played in nearly 20 years, and it's up there, and even above, many of Treasure's greats. I'd rank it above Gunstar Heroes, a game that I absolutely adore.... The only reason I have to say "nearly" 20 years is that Guardian Heroes still wins out as the greatest of all time for me... but being second to Guardian Heroes is a *very* impressive feat. Yeah, Guardian Heroes is a brawler and Freedom Planet is a platformer, but let's not get too caught up in specifics here. Both fall under the broad term of 2D action.","May 21, 2015","true","31.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

How many "funny" votes do I get?!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------- THERE WILL BE NO SPOILERS TO THE PLOT THIS REVIEW -------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFreedom Planet is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer that wastes no time foraying into the realm of Genesis-style masterpieces.  Did you like Sonic & Knuckles?  Cool.  Did you like Rocket Knight Adventures? Great!  Do you appreciate a game taking those similarities and still adopting a unique identity?\n\nOh boy buddy-ro, you're in for a treat!\n\nThe game starts up with a lovely opening that sheds some light on the story: aliens invade Not-China, kidnap a prince, slay a ruler, and on top of all that, war is being waged between three kingdoms as a result of an energy crisis.  Yeah, it's basically a Sonic-like plot where the villain of the day wants the Master Emerald, but you then add a tiiiiny pinch of convoluted world-building!\n\nJust before starting the first level, you make the decision to take up the role of one of two characters, Lilac and Carol.  The two seem to act as a vigilante duo, bringing justice to where it's needed, and it's through impulsiveness like this that the plot leads us through their stories and how it intertwines with those evil alien guys from earlier.\n\nThe STORY is nothing special, I'll be honest.  It's cute and gets the job done.  I was left wanting a little bit more from the story, but at the same time, it doesn't overstay its welcome.  There's a lot of weird implicit storytelling that I think was supposed to happen.  I guess I didn't catch all of it.  Characters move to and from certain locations without explanation or motivation.  Does the world take place on a one-way road?  Nothing important was discussed between?  Who are all these characters?\n\nI'll admit that I've not yet completed the story mode with both characters either, so perhaps more of the questions get answered from seeing the other character's (in my case, Carol's) perspective of events.  That's a Sonic Adventure-ey thing to do, so I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being that way!\n\nBut overall, the story's adequate: it's there if you want it, or you can play the game through "Classic" mode if you just wanna go stage-by-stage.  It's a nice compromise!\n\nFreedom Planet is no slouch when it comes to GAMEPLAY.  It's a well-endowed woman in slow-motion: the assets run and bounce like a dream and it all looks gorgeous as it happens.\n\n...I'll work on that analogy.  It implies that the characters run slow, and they definitely don't! If you're looking for the high-octane action that my comparison to Genesis-era Sonic and Rocket Knight promised, you're on the right track.  The two characters control differently, and yet both play through the same ten levels.  The ways they get around completely change how you're getting through each level, and it's pretty amazing.  A lot of developers don't try to do stuff like that anymore, y'know?\n\nCorrection: a lot of developers aren't talented or clever enough to make a level play out unconventionally between two slightly varied characters.  That takes a lot of planning, and I commend the dev team for such fantastic thinking.\n\nLilac takes Sonic's speediness, Blaze the Cat's spinny...tornado thing, and Sparkster's jet boosters to create a fun, vanilla approach to how the game is played.  Lilac can run and move fast, but has some strategic edges in her melee attacks.  Throw on some invincibility frames from soaring through the air like a rocket and the player will soon start to notice a fun formula, especially in later levels: run fast and hop around during the levels, and coordinate your melee skills and time your rocket beautifully during boss fights.  It's a winning combo, and in the higher difficulties, this is expected to be a mastered concept less than halfway through the game.\n\nLilac's sidekick, Carol, provides a slightly slower, more exploration-based style of play.  There are many collectibles waiting to be found in this romp, and I assure you Lilac can't collect them all by herself.  With Carol's ability to cling to and climb up walls as well as a speedy motorcycle at her side, she seems to be the character you play as second to go around all the levels and pick up the stuff you couldn't get as Lilac.  Her melee attacks are less varied but much faster, and while she's not as speedy, her ability to cover a lot of ground makes for a fun, fresh take during a second playthrough.\n\nThe game looks incredible.  Just when I thought I was getting sick of pixel GRAPHICS, Freedom Planet comes along with some of the most ambitious spritework I've ever seen.  The boss fights and spectacle portrayed by them is notably impressive.  I won't spoil anything, but there's a specific boss you fight where you'll be so awe-struck at what you're fighting you'll barely be able to react.\n\nCharacter designs are cute and colourful, always reminding me of old 80's cartoons and 90's company mascots; levels are equally dynamic and vibrant...do I really have to say anything?  You see the screenshots and you know it's THAT good!\n\nMUSIC is always a pleasure in this game as well.  A lot of ambient electronic tunes, appropriate boss music, and a main theme you won't get out of your head until weeks after.  Music helps establish how players feel, and a testament to that is something as simple as getting an invincibility powerup in this game and hearing its jingle.  SEGA always nails that with their Sonic games, and I'm happy GalaxyTrail took note of implementing something so subtle yet so drastic.  Oh, and there's a level where you can walk on a keyboard and play an eight-note musical scale.  Man, I just love stuff like that.\n\nThe voice talent, while not shining as brightly as the soundtrack or the graphics, still managed to keep my attention.  My only gripe with the cast is not in their own talents, but from a technological standpoint, you could tell it's all done on an amateur scale.  Actors and actresses clearly use different recording equipment, and most importantly, you can blatantly hear the varying acoustics among different speaking roles.\n\nIt's too much to expect the developers to have rented out a recording booth and fly in their cast to do their lines, don't think I'm expecting that!  It's the simple matter of, if I were in a developer position, I would've compromised my current choices of voice talent in exchange for audition demos that sounded consistent.  Purely a personal qualm that in no way harms the game!\n\nHave I covered everything?  Nah, probably not.  There's so much more to this game that could be explained, like some extra powerups available to collect, some of the enemies being really annoying, an extra playable character(!), and some other twists and turns in both the story and gameplay itself.  For the skeptics out there, I DID run into a few bugs, glitches, and hiccups in the game here and there.  Note that none of the quirks I confronted hindered my gameplay.  If anything, watching a random enemy wheel itself into the physical geometry of a quarterpipe and continued into the void of neverending wall was pretty funny to sit and watch for a moment.\n\nThe game isn't perfect.  Some of the story elements seem questionable, some of the later levels got too lengthy/weirdly cheap and I lost steam, and most important to note is that there's a roller coaster of difficulty to ride with the bosses.  But it's all so, so worth it.  GalaxyTrail nailed to a tee what makes a Sonic game good, how to marry extra mechanics to that existing concept, and how to shape it all into an original adventure that they can call their own.\n\ndo I need to give a score?  I dunno.  8/10 or somethin'.  Numbers are dumb, so I take that score back.  IT'S GOOD, that's all you need to know!","March 30, 2015","true","13.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","8","8","6","1"

When you first boot it up, you're treated to a cool though somewhat confusing cutscene (which will make sense later on, once more of the story is revealed.) Afterward, you'll be given the option of playing 'Adventure' or 'Classic' mode. The main difference between the two is that 'Adventure' mode will let you play levels in order from the context of a narrative, while 'Classic' takes you from stage to stage like most 16-bit platformers would - with no story or transition to explain how you got there. One other important difference is that there's an additional character available for play solely in 'Classic' mode, but you'll have to trek through 'Adventure' before unlocking them.\n\nOnce you've decided which mode of play you'd prefer, you're almost to the good stuff - all that's left is picking a favorite character. The two you start out with, Lilac and Carol, are kawaii desu anthropomorphic beasties with unique abilities. Lilac channels Zero from the Megaman X series, performing uppercuts, dive kicks, and a ricochet attack that Sparkster and Ristar swear they were doing before it was cool. Having barely beaten the game with Lilac, I regrettably can't say much about how Carol plays. Based on gameplay videos I've seen of her, she drives a motorcycle and can claw stuff. Assuming you chose 'Classic' mode, there's also Milla the dog girl. She can throw blocks, flutter in the air, and dig up dirt. After briefly trying a stage as her I can confirm that she's pretty nifty.\n\nOnce all that's done, you can get into the gameplay. The large, beautifully detailed worlds are lots of fun to explore and get pretty creative as you progress. My favorites have to be Fortune Night, Thermal Base, and Pangu Canyon. Nearly every  level is peppered with unique enemies and gimmicks, and even the final stages that reuse previous assets do so in a tasteful 'let's see what you've learned from the prior stages' sort of way.\n\nThough Freedom Planet is a truly awesome game, it does have a few minor flaws. Every now and then I would experience a physics-related bug - things like: running outside the room after being thrown into the ceiling during the last battle with Lord Brevon and having my character flip upside down as they hit the corner of a sloped ceiling. However, the gameplay is solid 99% of the time, and even the 16/32-bit classics this game dutifully emulates had these quirks (I'm looking at you, S3&K).\n\nMy biggest gripe with Freedom Planet would be some of the boss fights. I really enjoy the challenge the majority of them offer, but some of them seem downright unfair. For example, during the final showdown, Lord Brevon's first form is the green airship you previously fought at Battle Glacier. The thing crashes onto the screen, damaging you if you're standing near it with no prior warning - ok, fair enough - however, this time it instantly follows that up with a high speed ram that depletes half your health bar. As far as I can tell, the only way to dodge that attack is using Lilac's ricochet move to gain temporary invincibility. So if too much of your charge bar has been used to, say, jump and attack the ship as it lands, you're going to get wrecked hard. Phase 3 of the Lord Brevon fight is a nightmare as well due to my inability to telegraph his attacks. Bear in mind, these are my thoughts based on a playthrough on 'Normal' difficulty - there are easier modes of play for a more accessible experience.\n\nBarring the occasional frustrating boss encounter, Freedom Planet is pretty much perfect. It's definitely worth the $15 pricetag.\n\n9/10.","July 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Only played the first stage so far, but I appreciate the player's introduction doesn't throw in bottomless pits, insta-death spikes, acid-armor enemies, or essentially two-hit deaths. Both of the immediate player characters play in generally unique ways, one horizontally-focused (Lilac with her twirls and boosts) and vertically-focused (Carol with her wall-jumps and motorbike). And the aesthetics are all appealing. Voice acting fits the character designs, colors are shiny and rich, and animations are charming (though my laptop did jitter the game, so despite its looks, you may want to close down some background activity). And this music! Hope to see the OST available for download before long.\n\nAn aside: Be sure of your button configuration preferences before going into a stage, since the Options menu currently isn't accessible mid-play, and if you'd like the characters' moves clarified, hit up the quick reference on the Store page, since the game also currently seems more learn-through-play for your abilities.\n\nI backed this game during its Kickstarter.

This game seems to know it's history, as there are homages to multiple Genesis games. Tight gameplay, but has some difficulty balancing problems. On the first three levels I didn't die once, then my death count was between three and nine except for the third to last level with 16 and then the last level with whopping 62. So the curve was a bit wonky, at least on the normal difficulty level. Cutscenes are a bit too long, voice acting is okay for an indie game.\n\nAll in all, my playthrough was the most fun I have had with games this year overall.

With it's excellent 2D graphics, outstanding soundtrack, smooth and fun gameplay, story with perfect tone of seriousness and silliness, huge replay value (and more to come with added characters), this game is definitely, without a doubt, worth your money. This doesn't feel like an Indie game. It feels like a AAA title where people actually putted a lot of time in developing and creating something special.\n\nSTORY\n\nI won't say what's exactly happening in it, i will just describe it. The story in this game.... Is good. These types of games don't really need deep storyline to be good, but GalaxyTrail just went for it. And surprisingly, it's dark. Ridiculously dark at moments perhaps. But, there are also lighthearted moments which make story more appealing for younger audience.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nLilac - Energetic girl that will fight for justice and those who she cares about\nCarol - Lilac's best friend, similar personalities\nMilla - Probably the most adorable dog ever? Do i seriously need to describe her?\nSpade - ah, my favorite.... He's pretty much FP version of Shadow the hedgehog, which is amazing. Can't wait for him to become playable and learn his backstory and all...\nTorque - An alien which helps main crew to return the ,,stone" back where it belongs\n\nThose are pretty much only characters that matter, dog general is pretty cool too i guess\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nHeavily inspired by Sonic the hedgehog, Gun Star Heroes and also Street Fighter (seriously, you can Shoryuken enemies in this game). Stages are really well designed and they don't really feel that linear. There are tons of gems to pick up, hunting cards for achievements and unlocking soundtrack, voice clips, artwork etc. and of course, tons of enemies and obstacles to deal with. Levels are quite long, but not too long to make you feel bored or tired. Boss fights...... Oh boy..... 3 words.... SPECTACULAR, SALT FACTORY! Bosses are so cool in this game but they will definitely ♥♥♥♥ you off if you're playing as Milla because.... She haves just 4 bars.....\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\nIt's amazing. Seriously, there's no need to describe any more than that. It's simply, amazing\n\n\nOVERALL\n\nFan of sonic games or platforming games overall? Then buy this! Don't let word ,,Indie" fool you, this game feels like a AAA title. It's fast and fun from beginning to end and after. Can't wait for more characters and a sequel to come out.","January 16","true","32.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

It all feels very solid and professional; stages have multiple ways to progress and many paths utilize the character's unique abilities to progress, the stages are very colorful and varied taking you across much of the game's world, and the stages are backed by fun but challenging bosses and a kickass soundtrack that make playing the whole game a wonderful experience from beginning to end. The only small complaint I had was the first two stages are "humble beginnings" and take place in backwater parts of the game's world so it may not pull a player in fast enough, but even then these stages are colorful and fun to play and the game picks up completely at stage 3.\n\nThe game has 3 playable characters currently each with their own unique move sets and they do offer some variation in the stage patterns. Carol and Milla being the ones that get to play Trap Hideout while Lilac is the only character that gets to play Pangu Lagoon. Millia currently lacks any story mode but its been discussed that she will have one in the future and other character playability is planned in the future as dlc.\n\nA  word of warning for people getting this because they think its like sonic. In many ways its not at all so don't go in expecting that too much. Plot is important in this game unlike sonic and the game takes a far more serious tone with it's story than sonic ever has. This is NOT a bad thing however its just something you need to adjust yourself for to enjoy.\n\nI know most of my Reviews say "get it on sale" for once I can fully recommend a game at full price in this game.

Seeing this game on KickStarter I was amazed on how much Sonic vibe from it.\n\nQuestion: Does that mean this game is similiar/plays like a Sonic game?\n\nIt may  LOOK  like a Sonic game but how it plays is a whole lot different. The stages, how the characters move and attack and even the bosses have different variety.\n\nThe Characters: Now this review is taken from my own point of view and thoughts. I am here to say that I adore every voice acting that is shown in this game. The voices are a joy to listen to in the storyline and never annoyed me even for a second. I had many laughs and enjoyment from the humor that each character said.\n\nNow one thing I enjoy in cutscenes is that I can skip them at will if I don't want to listen to the same story everytime. Luckily you can skip a certain scene or even skip to the next stage. They even thought ahead to put a nice "classic mode" so you don't have to listen to the storyline al all and go stage to stage.\n\n\nBosses: Surprising the bosses are pretty intense and can really kick your butt if you're not careful and have to start all over but overall I enjoyed how every boss played throughout the story.\n\nSmall issue:\n\n-Some bosses (mostly the final boss) can easily stunlock you and make you almost instantly lose a single life if you aren't prepare.\n\n\nOverall thoughts: If you are big fan of the high speed gameplay in games like Sonic. Then most likely you'll enjoy this game as much as I did!\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n","July 25, 2014","true","8.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Let us start with the flaws first though.\n\n- The game has some performance issues. I encountered quite a few large frame rate drops near the first few levels. I imagine in time these will be polished out in time.\n- No multiplayer - not really a flaw but certainly something to bear in mind.\n- I had trouble getting it to detect my controller on launch and even after configuring it in options. However, once I rebooted the Title, my controller was detected just fine.\n\nThe Good:\n- The gameplay is incredible, something of a cross between sonic and megaman. Each character has their own unique abilities and each have their own learning curve. The gameplay shifts from action to fast paced racing across the screens. The levels are good and lengthy, I loved the boss battles too, some very awesome epic moments and never did a smile leave my face!\n\n- The humor involved in the game is amazing and well thought out. Close to the level that MLP has, this may turn some off but I found myself really enjoying the incredible cutscenes and voice acting. The devs knew what they wanted from this and they had fun doing it!\n\n- The story is also quite well thought out. Something that is not really unique to games in general but very well thoguht out and again the humor is amazing and reflected nicely in the story. I never found myself saying "Ugh, get to the point" or wanting to skip a cutscene.\n\n- The Music in this game is also quite amazing. Some really awesome catchy tunes that just brought me to the good old days of 16 bit platforming. You will definitely have some favorites when you hear the awesome soundtrack this Title offers!\n\nIn conclusion, this really is an amazing game, the length I am seeing for levels and the depth put into the quality voice acting, animation and expressions really takes you for a ride. I can happily reccomend this to all my friends who enjoy silly humor and awesome sonic inspired games. They made this product with a clear goal in mind and it was truly a labour of love. The devs had fun and that is so rare to see these days in games,\n\nOn a side note, ZOMG more furries in Gaming!

Think Sonic, Klonoa, Vectorman, Megaman Zero, & whatever other great action platformer you can think of from days long past then throw them all in a Blender then what do you get?\n\nFREEDOM PLANET\n\nGreat voice acting, humor inducing cut scenes, cute cuddly furry characters, solid action speed platforming, remarkable retro soundtrack, best boss battles I've ever seen in an old-school game & I've played a lot of old school games.\n\nThe game has Adventure mode, Classic Mode, & Time Attack.  Adventure is the main game, lots of story & such. The voice acting is top notch & sounds great.  Classic mode is the main game without the cut scenes, but these cut scenes are worth watching.  Time attack is pretty much what it sounds like.  Beat each level as fast as you can.\n\nYou can play as 2 starting characters & you unlock a 3rd character through the games Story Mode. Each character plays differently.\n\nThe main character Lilac is a Dragon Speedster who can attack with her hair like a whip & charge a dash in several directions.  While dashing she is immune to damage for about 1 second, but it takes a few seconds for it to recharge. She also has an aerial spin that gives her a slight hover double jump & also does damage but can be hard to control & hit with in certain situations so this move is best used on flying enemies.\n\nThe second, Carol, is a Feline that can jump up walls & relies on quick attacks which can take out enemies very fast. She also has a motorbike which you can use after finding gas tanks scattered throughout the levels.  This bike enables her to climb any wall & gives her increased mobility & a double jump that also deals damage. Carol is also the easiest to play out of the three characters available.\n\nThe third is Milla, a Puppy who has less health than the other 2 but can fly & charge to create blocks to then throw at enemies or use them to fire a beam & sheild herself from damage.  You have to unlock Milla by playing the first 2 levels in the Adventure mode & she's currently only available in Classic Mode after unlocking.  Milla will get her own Story Mode later on from what I've heard.\n\nThere are other characters that will be added later to the game as DLC.\n\nThe boss fights are fun & challenging.  If playing on the hard difficulty (or even on normal) you will have a rough time.  Every boss feels unique in how they attack you & has a strategy to figure out in order to beat them.  Some bosses have a chain attack & if you get caught in it you can expect nearly certain death.  During the tougher boss fights your friends will show up & throw health pickups your way or help deal damage to the boss with you.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is the FPS will randomly drop from it's normal 60 down to 30 at times & it will lock to 30 until you find a level transition.   This problem only occurs when running the game at higher resolutions or in 3x Size mode.  Also, the difficulty can get very frustrating at the later levels, but don't let that stop you from checking this game out.\n\nIn short, this is the epitome of what games were in the early 90's & anyone who wants a good old school platformer, action game shouldn't miss out on this one.","July 21, 2014","true","16.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Maybe it's because the Character I choose (yes, you can choose different characters) is just really strong, still it's real fun to play.\n\nThe levels are quite huge and invite to long explorations if you want to find all secrets.

You can rush through the levels like you could in the old Sonic games which is quite awesome :D\n\nWhat I really like about this game is that you can choose between Adventure and Classic mode.\nClassic mode throws you right into levels without Story interruptions but I'd recommend the Adventure mode for the first playthrough because the dialogues are quite funny and the speakers (english language) did a good Job.\n\nI totally recommend this game!","July 22, 2014","true","16.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Is so, look no further than Freedom Planet. Despite the similar character art direction to those familiar with the Sonic the Hedgehog series, Freedom Planet is its own beast sporting elements from a number of classic games perfectly blended into its own unique entity. Featuring the sense of speed from classic Sonic the Hedgehog games with gameplay elements from Megaman X and a boss design approach reminiscent of Gunstar Heroes, this game will provide a unique sense of challenge rarely found in games anymore as of this writing.\n\nThe game offers a number of character each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special traits which will make you think differently as to how you would approach the same situation. For one small example, Lilac has a direction amiable airdash, Carol can either wall jump or drive up the wall on her motorcycle, and Milla has a flutter jump that is most useful for tricky platforming segments. This isn't to imply all the characters go through all the same, carefully crafted stages and encounter the same challenging boss fights however as some stages are limited to few characters or even exclusive to a single character. These stages can be enjoyed accompanied by a fleshed out story in Adventure Mode or if you are looking for just gameplay you can just select Classic Mode.\n\nOther features this game has to offer include a time attack mode that not only includes your standard ability to replay stages and tally the top results, but it also houses a series of obstacle courses that are designed around breaking all the targets in the fastest time possible alongside a snuck-in mahjong minigame in the time attack menu's on the stage select screen. The game also features collectable in-game cards scattered across most of the stages, incentivizing the player to approach and explore each stage utilizing the branching paths of each stage or explore them in creative ways with each character. The options menu also sports a variety of different difficulties, which is great news for allowing the game to be accessible or challenging depending upon your skill level.\n\nThe story itself in this game gave me the impression that it is one of those "Either you will love it or you will hate it" sort of situations. At its core, the story is about trio of friends and their ally from space stopping an evil space tyrant from stealing a precious valuable from the planet on his way off the planet. The story contains cheesy dialogue and a decent amount of humor as you'd expect from the story given its cartoon styling but the story also manages to have some shockingly dark moments, almost jarring by contrast. The narrative managed to make me personally care about the cast and their struggles, but as I previously stated your mileage may vary on the story depending on your personal tastes.\n\nTo summarize, Freedom Planet is an absolutely fantastic game and it deserves to be in your library if you are a fan of 2-D platform games or a fan of classic style games in general. This game has plenty of content to keep you busy for hours on end and provides a unique sense of challenge that will make you want to replay levels to test to see how much you skills at the game have improved. You will not be disappointed.","July 30, 2014","true","43.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","2"

Immaculate spritework.  Absurdly well-thought out, multi-layered level design.  Ingenius, perfectly balanced boss encounters.  A soundtrack so inspired I purchased it immediately after the 2nd level.  A story straight out of a 90s Saturday morning cartoon show.  (... for better or for worse - and if you think that's for the worse, hop in the Classic mode)\n\nFreedom Planet does something to me that no other game has done, not in a very long time.

Most impressive of all, is that Freedom Planet is no mere homage.  Not just a love letter.  No nostalgia trip.  It is not retro.  It stands proudly on its own accomplishments.\n\nGames like this don't come around often.

The controls are snappy and the character designs are (almost) all fairly well done and the voice acting is very pleasant to hear coming out of this type of game! The music is pretty darn good and the stage designs are large, sprawling, and look awesome! There's a lot of different ways to reach the end of an area and secrets hidden all over the maps.\n\nFor all of its positives, however, there are a few drawbacks: Namely, the story writing is not very coherent, as there are multiple poor attempts made to incite emotions that just fall flat on their face. There are lots of ideas left up in the air that never really get touched on (including the game's title, as "Freedom Planet" only mentions other worlds and never takes us to them). And while the bosses are quite challenging for a platforming game, they are often too challenging, with lots of very quick enemy movements, short periods to safely attack, and very hard-to-avoid attacks that make the fights either drag on or end unfavorably quickly. The voice acting is sometimes a little strange, and there are one or two character designs that just never quite look right.\n\nOn the whole, though, Freedom Planet is a really good platformer and it's a pleasant and refreshing experience, with several playable characters (and more on the way!). If you want a beautiful, innocently joy-filled romp of a game, this is definitely for you.\n\n[Also: Cat on motorcycle.

It's everything I want from a Sonic game without Sonic, and fixes a bunch of problems I never even realised I had with those games, such as the removal of pace-killing enemies, or a lack of motorcycle-riding tomboy bobcats. Also about a third through the story the characters just stop and watch a movie together and I find that hilarious. It does feel a tiny bit unfinished however, with one character's story cutscenes not yet implemented, and chests full of orbs left in levels which are presumably something to do with the two other characters I've heard will be playable in the future, as they aren't really of any use to any of the current playable characters as far as I can tell. Also bosses are ludicrously hard compared to the rest of the game, especially for Milla who I just couldn't beat the final boss with even on the lowest difficulties due to her lower health, despite spending several hours trying.

It's not perfect, and there are a couple of seams showing, but if you have any fondness for the action platformer genre and are willing to take the game on its own merits, you owe it to yourself to try this one; it sits with Shovel Knight as one of the best of its genre. Be warned that it can be legitimately challenging in the late-going, and if that worries you, dial the difficulty down to Easy for your first run, or even Casual.\n\nThe Good:\n- Great stage design that's well-paced and leads the player admirably\n- Fun presentation and colorful cast\n- Legitimate challenge\n- Fantastic soundtrack\n- Surprisingly long and replayable\n\nThe Bad:\n- Moderate learning curve on each character\n- Lilac's special meter regenerates a little slowly, causing unwelcome waiting at times\n- Plot occasionally loses focus and drags\n- Some bosses can be a little unfair\n\nThe Weird:\n- For a plot so animated, why are Milla's bizarre block-summoning, laser-shielding ways never explained?\n\nNow for the detailed version.\n\nLet's start by getting this out of the way: the average independent game, like the average game in general, is terrible. My hope for a new generation of developers was new, fresh takes on the ideas that they grew up with, homage to the sensibilities of old while adding new elements, and subtracting outdated ones.\n\nInstead, most independent developers use a retro aesthetic because they either don't have the money or talent to do anything else, frequently poorly in their own right, and rather than use the design elements of a bygone age to create new experiences, or at least compelling rehashes of old ones, they frequently miss the point altogether, or simply use the format as delivery for some ham-fisted art project, with little-to-no focus on the gameplay. The results are an overall waste.\n\nIt took about ten years, but this new generation does occasionally create an exception to this rule, and we were fortunate to see a major one in the way of the aforementioned Shovel Knight, a wonderful romp through one of the earliest periods of video gaming, re-interpreted with a new perspective and vigor that entertains throughout. Freedom Planet somehow pulls off the same feat with a different era, it also making showing its own flavor, and in many ways improving on its source material.\n\nIts first and arguably greatest crime, though, isn't even in the game itself. The cover art sells it extremely poorly, and fails to tell the player anything about what it is; I took one look at it and passed it over immediately, not the least bit interested in whatever game it could be. I came across the game again in a random related Youtube video for a totally different game, compelled by the thumbnail, and was immediately intrigued by the gameplay. I expected that, at worst, it couldn't fail to impress more than the generally woeful Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2.\n\nWhat followed was the surpassing of that and nearly every other expectation I had of it, starting with the surprisingly involved and animated plot. The characters are lively and expressive, and feature a surprising variety of sprites to accompany their dialogue, and the voice acting, which is present for every line in the game, is capable, if a bit too hammy here and there. The whole thing can get cheesy, but it fits, and absolutely feels like it came straight from the 32-bit age. While it's a bit long in the tooth, and takes itself a bit too seriously sometimes, it sets the tone well for the adventure, and can be skipped should one feel so inclined, besides.\n\nWhether you get to the gameplay at the story's pace or your own, though, it's immediately comfortable and tight -- Lilac, the character representing Sonic the Hedgehog's style of play, handles well, her gliding double jump gives welcome control in situations where Sonic may otherwise end up in places you didn't want him to be, and her multi-directional air-dash, while requiring some getting used to, is also handy. Carol, a bizarre hybrid of playstyles reminiscent of Mega Man X's Zero, complete with wall jumping abilities, is a riskier and more challenging contrast, and her trademark motorcycle is hilarious fun. They're eventually joined by a third character, whose playstyle is a slower, more deliberate brand that brings to mind, of all things, Tails' Sky Patrol, an old Game Gear game featuring Sonic's fox friend, though bombs are replaced by throwable blocks here.\n\nThe player guides one of these three through some surprisingly high-quality and well-paced stage design, full of interesting elements and trials to overcome, but mercifully almost entirely devoid of its source material's fondness for sudden drops into pits or facefulls of enemies and spikes. The game very rarely punishes you for not knowing what's coming up, and little is totally missable the first time around. Small design tweaks like these improve the experience without hurting its feel, and you don't realize how much you hate what it deliberately omits until you notice it's not there. Even water, the bane of many a Sonic player, manages to be nothing more than a part of the obstacle course, adding to the experience rather than impeding it. The results are frequently a treat to play, rarely frustrating or discouraging, and surprisingly technically sound, with few glitches and mishaps, something the game's closest inspiration still can't get right with any sort of consistency. Every now and again the stage design doesn't properly direct you or breaks flows in unnatural ways, but overall the game just feels remarkably tight and well-designed.\n\nEach stage is capped by a boss, often interesting itself in design. This is where the game bears its true difficulty, and many of your foes, while frequently thrilling, often featuring exciting chases and brisk brawls, are just as frequently challenging; I'm above average in terms of playing ability, and even I died a total of thirty seven times on the default difficulty setting -- although I never ran out of lives -- as in addition to their overall difficult, if welcome, design, the bosses' attacks are sometimes poorly telegraphed or approaching genuinely unreasonable. Extra chances are plentiful, checkpoints are forgiving, and Game Overs are essentially meaningless, but be prepared for the game to get the better of you until you learn to deal with some of the challenges the bosses present, or swallow your pride and dial the difficulty down in advance if you're not up to the potential frustration. Hard mode in particular is aptly named, and even seasoned veterans may find themselves face down more often than expected on the way to the credits roll.\n\nWrapping this package up are charming graphics, if not spectacular ones, and one of the best soundtracks scored. I find music to be the second most important aspect of a game, behind the play itself, as it sets the tone, helps draw the player in, and can excite them for what is to come, or what is currently happening. Freedom Planet delivered beyond my expectations, and every track during the gameplay fails to disappoint, with certain stages and the boss themes enhancing the experience and adding to the enjoyment in ways that wouldn't be possible without it.\n\nOn the whole, Freedom Planet grabbed me with its sharp production values, and didn't let me go through the entire ride, surprising and delighting me time and again. It has some rough edges, but is regardless a legitimate classic, a game I can genuinely see myself playing and enjoying years from now, just as I have many of the games of the time it borrows from and subtly evolves the ideas of. When you think about how many games you can say that about -- and mean it -- you may realize that that is among the highest praise I could give it.","December 13, 2014","true","32.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarontu/recommended/248310/","Aarontu","Aarontu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarontu/","449 products in account","This is an indie 2D platformer with cartoony anthro characters and a well done 90's era aesthetic that takes inspiration largely from the oldschool Sonic and Megaman X games (though more on the Sonic side than Megaman). The story is cheesy, as to be expected in these kinds of games, but the voice acting is pretty competent; I would go so far to say it's better than most older games and indie games, definitely better than the acting in the later Sonic games that I've played. Most of the game follows the philosophy of "easy exploratory levels with challenging bosses", though even the bosses are easy in the beginning. You'll be glad you accumulated tons of extra lives for the final levels, though, where the game actually gets challenging. (but still not TOO challenging, at least on 'Normal' difficulty it's still easy enough to complete.) It's nowhere near as hard as Super Meat Boy or the like, but then this game isn't about precision platforming, but about running through levels and beating up enemies and bosses.\n\nThis game does a number of things that make it more fun than most oldschool platformers, IMO:\n-The controls are very responsive, and your attack and move animations can be interrupted by other attacks and moves at will.\n-Some attacks make you invincible during parts of your attack animation, which you have to take advantage of against some of the later bosses.\n-Contact with enemies and bosses doesn't hurt you, only enemy attacks or spikey bits hurt you.\n-Bottomless pits are very rare. This, combined with the ability to run through enemy sprites make it a lot easier to run through levels than in the older Sonic games, which punished speeding with enemies and pits out of nowhere.\n\nIf you like oldschool platformers, especially the bits where you fight enemies and battle bosses, you'll like this game.","August 10, 2015","true","29.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's everything I want from a Sonic game without Sonic, and fixes a bunch of problems I never even realised I had with those games, such as the removal of pace-killing enemies, or a lack of motorcycle-riding tomboy bobcats. Also about a third through the story the characters just stop and watch a movie together and I find that hilarious. It does feel a tiny bit unfinished however, with one character's story cutscenes not yet implemented, and chests full of orbs left in levels which are presumably something to do with the two other characters I've heard will be playable in the future, as they aren't really of any use to any of the current playable characters as far as I can tell. Also bosses are ludicrously hard compared to the rest of the game, especially for Milla who I just couldn't beat the final boss with even on the lowest difficulties due to her lower health, despite spending several hours trying. But honestly that didn't ruin the overall experience for me, and the game is well worth your time and money.","February 4, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Its atmosphere is more whimsical than daredevil, with level features cultivating a playful acrobatic feel rather than one of intensity despite how the stakes rise and even spike as the game progresses. The physics are somewhat floaty, but treacherous jumps are few, bottomless pits are almost nonexistent, and every character has special moves to help them rocket, clamber, and flutter to many secrets off each level's beaten path. No two playable characters are the same and you'd be surprised how huge the game becomes when you go exploring.\n\nCollision damage is surprisingly absent, considering it's a 2D platformer, and a clever person can often destroy enemies by luring them into traps and hazards meant for the player. Bosses are pattern-based, but increase in aggression as you progress, so a quick thumb will save you as often as thorough knowledge will. The cutscenes do tend to drag on, but are entirely skippable and even outright avoidable. You'll miss out on some fine voice acting and interesting lore that way though. The developers clearly had as much fun making this love letter to retro mascot platformers as you'll have playing it.","July 21, 2014","true","70.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Gameplay-wise, it's impeccable, with just the right blend of difficulty and flow, and the multiple characters give it strong replay value to experience the different gameplay styles Freedom Planet offers.\n\nWhere the game stumbles a bit is in the Adventure Mode; right out of the gate, several pronouns are thrown at you and are never given any real explanation. The game just expects you to go along with it's logic from beginning to end. While some explanations are offered, the often-times clumsy dialogue make it difficult to get a grasp on what's actually going on. Humor is hit-or-miss, as is the voice acting. Still, the story has occasional gripping moments that will make up for the shortcomings for many.\n\nClassic mode is there for those who can't quite bring themselves to deal with the plot but want to experience the fantastic level design, art, and music, offering a win-win for everyone. The game is long enough to feel filling without falling into the trap of padding. The level design is fantastic, never allowing you a moment to become bored. Some bosses attack patterns are unforgiving bordering on unfair, but it doesn't quite go too far. Eventually the reflexes will come.\n\nFreedom Planet still holds onto the redundant life system, even though a Game Over really doesn't set you back whatsoever; you start at the same checkpoint you would have were lives not a factor at all. Since it doesn't effect gameplay, it's not really a complaint, but its inclusion dilutes what would otherwise be an efficient and impressively formatted gameplay system.\n\nThe Adventure Mode will be the big deciding factor for players. If you're willing to stomach some cheesiness or skip the story altogether, you will have the opportunity to experience one of the most solid platformers of the year. For the gameplay experience alone, you can't go wrong with Freedom Planet.\n\n8.5/10","July 22, 2014","true","21.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It was worth every penny, and I'm always glad to support the indie community.\n\nThe only gripe I can see anyone having with it is the voice acting, but considering it IS indie, one should not hold that against them.  Besides, they didn't really do that terrible of a job at it.  And, if you find that you just can't stand it, there are options to avoid it.\n\nAll in all, taking into consideration that this is the first major game produced by this development team and that they didn't have a million dollar budget to work with, I give this game a 9/10.

I'd heard talk of a "Sonic fan game" that became it's own thing, but never really looked into it, despite being a huge fan of the older Sonics (some of the new ones are okay, too).  A friend of mine pointed me to this, and I downloaded the demo, and I was hooked. The day the game launched, I was right there at 10 AM when Steam updated to download it.  I expected a fun little game, but what I ended up getting is perhaps one of my favorite games of the year, thus far.\n\nVisually, the game looks like an early sprite-based PS1 or Saturn game, and that's pretty neat. The sprites are detailed, the style is great, but the only gripe is the use of real time rotation. It always looks kind of cheap... why not just do how Sonic did? Then again, Sonic didn't have 3 characters (to begin with), each with attack animations and whatnot, so, whatever. It's a small gripe.\n\nThe music in Freedom Planet is spot-on, a fantastic OST. Pretty much every time I heard Brevon's theme, it stuck with me. The main theme itself is fantastic, too.\n\nThe story and the acting have caused a bit of conversation, I've been seeing. Personally, while some of the lines are rather.... bad, most of them are fine, and most of the actors themselves do a fine job, stand out characters being Mayor Zao and Carol.  The story itself gets surprisingly dark at times, as well. No real plot twists here, just a straightforward adventure, but it does end mostly satisfyingly.\n\nThe three characters play VERY differently, with Lilac being faster, Carol being a tad slower but having more focus on combat, and Milla being a puzzle game of sorts, with her ability to create blocks and such. Milla, unfortunately, doesn't have a story mode yet, and bits of her exclusive content in her Classic Mode stages look unfinished (that Minecart, guys, it looks like something you made in MSPaint).\n\nHowever, all in all, I stand by what I said. This is right up there with Shovel Knight and Super Meat Boy as perhaps my favorite indie games, if not some of my favorite games, period. To Sonic fans, Freedom Planet is better than Sonic 1 and 2. Perhaps not better than 3&Knuckles, though. That said, though, this does enough to separate itself from Sonic, and I hope we see more in this story.\n\nPS: Lange, if you're reading this, thanks for answering people's questions on that forum. I'm sorry for some people being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but your honesty was refreshing, amid the PR jungle that most games traverse.","July 28, 2014","true","18.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Yes, there are elements from Sonic. And Rocket Knight Adventures. And Gunstar Heroes. I haven't even played two of those three but I probably will if this game is any indication of their quality. It's not a rip-off of any one game/series in particular though.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, what is there to like about this game? Well, a lot.\nFirst off, the art is gorgeous, every level looks unique and there's a lot of detail put into every level. The music is also fantastic as well, not a bad track found here and the level themes all fit very well for the stages/bosses.\n\nAlso, the gameplay is, simply put, fantastic. There are 14 levels in all (though only 12 per storyline) and each is a rather large and rather diverse. They're all designed so that you can speed through them if you want, but also explore them to your heart's desire (as there are very few points of no return aside from screen transitions). The stages may take a while to get through the first time, especially if you explore around them, but soon you'll find that the speedrun achievement times are pretty darn generous.\n\nEach of the three characters (with two more planned) controls differently and interestingly. Lilac has a double jump/attack and the aforementioned Rocket Knight dash, as well as an uppercut and downward kick that are both useful in combat and in platforming. Carol has an air dash that can lead into a powerful slash, an infinite wall jumping ability, and a close range flurry of kicks that also double as invincibility frames. Plus, finding a gasoline can gives her a motorcyle with contact damage at higher speeds, a double jump/attack similar to Lilac's, and the fastest base speed of any character in the game. Milla's a bit of an odd one out, with primarily ranged attacks and a shield that can be used to reflect projectiles back at opponents. She also has a flight ability similar to Tails (though far, far shorter). Though I personally prefer Lilac over the others, I have seen plenty of evidence to suggest that all three are quite good in their own distinct ways.\n\nA few other comments about character controls: The lack of invincibility frames after being hit provides a further incentive to avoid damage, while also making some boss attacks especially deadly. All three characters can swim, and quite swiftly, making water stages much less something to be dreaded and actually quite enjoyable, though there aren't a large number of them. There are 5 different shields that all have their uses, every single one providing an auxillary function aside from protecting from a certain attack. And there's no knockback when you lose your shield, one of the worst mechanics that the classic sonic games had.\n\nThe bosses in the game start off pretty tame but ramp up in difficulty fast. You are expected to fail against many of them before you figure out how to dodge their attacks while dealing damage, but they almost never feel unfair and it's very rewarding to finally knock down a boss that's been giving you ire. The difficulty curve throughout the game is also very smooth, no sudden spikes or wildly varying difficulty curves. The game starts off fairly easy yet you hardly notice it when it's suddenly really bloody hard, because there's nothing that comes out of nowhere and puts a huge roadblock in your way. It's tough, but fair.\n\nUnless you play on easy/casual mode, you wimp.\n\nSo yeah. The negatives, then. While I personally don't have a problem with it, the voice acting and story may put some off. There are, at the very least, a few scenes that go on too long or could've been cut entirely to keep the pacing of the game better. The story isn't amazing but it's passable, and the voice actors all do a pretty good job, though I'm not blown away by any of their performances. A few off the bosses aren't quite that great either, most notably the stage 6 preboss/boss segment as Carol, and the Lilac stage 7 and everyone stage 8 final bosses are also a bit on the tedious side. The lives system also seems a bit unnecessary, as there is, as far as I can tell, no real penalty for game-overs.\n\nThere's not much about this game that I can knock it down for, though, it's a very well designed game as a whole and tons of fun. I've clocked nearly 30 hours in under a week, which probably says something about how much I'm enjoying it. I bought an awesome game expecting an awesome game and I got what I came for.","December 9, 2014","true","40.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Freedom planet started out as a Kickstarter game (oh boy) and eventually made it onto Greenlight. Thanks to the Kickstarter campaign, this game was fully supported by fans, and it payed off well, which is refreshing to see an actual GOOD game come from greenlight for once.\n\nThe game has awesome pixel art and the animations are fluid and well-done, and even though it doesn’t have all of that fancy Ambient Occlusion and what not, the game still manages to impress visually with arguably the best pixel art I’ve ever seen in a video game. It’s also very colorful and stages are flashy and a delight to look at, while not being overwhelming. The game runs at a solid 60 fps and it causes the game to really shine during the intense boss fights and other points where a lot is going on  screen. Overall, the game looks great and is pure eye candy.\n\nFreedom Planet’s story is also done well. The universe that Galaxy Trail made is very interesting, and there is LOTS of exposition on it throughout the game, so it doesn’t feel underexplored either. Not only is the world interesting, but the story itself is entertaining, and gives the game a nice feel. Luckily, the story isn’t as generic as one might first assume by looking at the game, and the idea of different nations and motives for each one makes the story feel slightly more mature than what most games this cute offer. However, some people might find the voice-acting to be hit-or-miss. I wouldn’t call it bad, but it’s not going to blow you out of the water either. Personally, I enjoyed it, but some people might be upset that it’s not as high quality as they might want. Combine that with some VERY long cut-scenes, and you might have some people that would rather skip the story all-together, which is an option if you choose the “Classic” option when starting a new game. I won’t spoil any of it here, but the games story is interesting enough to hold most players’ attention.\n\nAnd now past the story and graphics, let’s get down to what is the best part about this game, the gameplay. This game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST to play. The controls are responsive and fun, attacking enemies is satisfying, the physics are awesome, using one of the three character’s special abilities is a lot of fun to do, and the level design is fantastic. Each character has their own unique set of attacks and abilities, such as Carol being able to wall jump, or Milla, who has a deflecting shield. They are extremely different, but all keep the same core gameplay, something that the Sonic series has failed to do time and time again.  The bosses are a blast to fight and they are challenging while not being frustrating. (although they become a little unfair near the end of the game.) Levels are also long, usually taking around 20 minutes to complete and have MANY different paths that you can take to reach your goal. If you play through a stage a second time, it might feel like an entirely different stage depending on what path you choose, and there are plenty of secrets and items to find if you are observant enough to look around. The music in each stage also really sets the tone and is really beautiful to listen to. I often find myself listening to act 2 of Fortune Night while playing other games, and the main theme is awesome. Enemies are also varied and all have optimal ways to take them down, which keeps fighting them unique and challenging. For example, the soldiers are best taken down by avoiding their shots and hitting them from behind, while the bees are best defeated by using “cyclone” or “Wild Kick” on them. Thankfully, Freedom Planet is one of the most original and satisfying games I’ve played in a while.\n\nIn conclusion, Freedom planet is a beautiful game with fantastic gameplay and bosses, with awesome music and visuals, but has a hit-or-miss story. Freedom Planet is a blast to play and is totally worth your hard earned cash, especially if it is on sale. Perfect game for anyone who ever liked the sonic series or is a fan of platformers in general.

No hand-holding stuff.\n\nIt has gorgeous-looking challenging levels with amazing boss battles, decent story, phenomenal soundtrack, great achievements & levels are filled with many different kind of collectibles & power-ups.\n\nCons\n- Voice acting is good but I wish the writing was a bit better since at times it is cringy.\n\n- Carol's controls would have been better. Jumping from wall to wall is so frustrating to initiate  because of her leap jump constantly getting in the way.\nThe situation doesn't come so frequent but when it does, it can be quite annoying.\n\n- There are plot holes present in the game. Quite many.\n\n- You can't change the sound volume.\n\n- You don't have access to options menu during the game.\n\nSonic comparisons\nSure, it was inspired by it & I do respect its legacy because of the inspiration but after playing Freedom Planet, I just can't go & start playing Sonic games. It almost feels like they are inferior in many ways.\n\nIt's not a rip off or straight copy-paste either. It does have some Sonic elements but it can be a straight side-scroller as well, depends on how you play it.\n\nIn short, it feels very different yet a bit similar.\n\nConclusion\nGreat game with old-school gameplay with some minor inconveniences.\nI highly recommend it to everybody. Oh & buy the soundtrack as well.","October 7, 2015","true","63.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You go from A to B and at the end fight a boss. There are som alternative paths, but it's pretty straight forward.\n\nThis on the other hand... Oh man! The only thing these 2 games have in common is that they are both platformers. Freedom Planet is a much more story based game and you really have to find your way around in the stages. The stages are awesome and the boss fights take a lot more skill and practise to get through.\n\nI haven't came very far into the game as of writing this review, but I can ensure you that this game is worth every penny!

Freedom planet started out as a Kickstarter game (oh boy) and eventually made it onto Greenlight. Thanks to the Kickstarter campaign, this game was fully supported by fans, and it payed off well, which is refreshing to see an actual GOOD game come from greenlight for once.\n\nThe game has awesome pixel art and the animations are fluid and well-done, and even though it doesn’t have all of that fancy Ambient Occlusion and what not, the game still manages to impress visually with arguably the best pixel art I’ve ever seen in a video game. It’s also very colorful and stages are flashy and a delight to look at, while not being overwhelming. The game runs at a solid 60 fps and it causes the game to really shine during the intense boss fights and other points where a lot is going on  screen. Overall, the game looks great and is pure eye candy.\n\nFreedom Planet’s story is also done well. The universe that Galaxy Trail made is very interesting, and there is LOTS of exposition on it throughout the game, so it doesn’t feel underexplored either. Not only is the world interesting, but the story itself is entertaining, and gives the game a nice feel. Luckily, the story isn’t as generic as one might first assume by looking at the game, and the idea of different nations and motives for each one makes the story feel slightly more mature than what most games this cute offer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vholst/recommended/248310/","Vholst","Vholst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vholst/","336 products in account","Freedom Planet is a throwback to the classic Sonic games of old; you play as an anthropomorphic character moving at great speed towards the goal of defeating the villain, and that's where the similarities end. I'll be breaking down the game into four sections (graphics, audio, gameplay and final impression) allowing you to decide whether or not this game is for you.\n\nGraphics- With a wide variety of unique enviroments and consitent look, it's as much of a nostalgia trip as well as an occasional pausing to appreciate a bit of the scenery, aided by the constant high energetic theme. Occasional blips of weird pixelation occur, but nothing distracting and will most likely go unnoticed unless you are dedicated in looking for it. Each character is well designed as in they don't mesh with the action or background, but also don't look out of place, as well as being distinct from one another. Bosses and individual monsters are equally well designed, regardless of silliness of some of them (like the deadly vacuum cleaner RUN CAROL RUN!), and some of them are relatively impressive that they maintain the style with the complexity of their movements.\n\nAudio- Sounds are what you expect of a game this bright, yet you'll find yourself surprised at the variety and uniqueness of some enemy attacks or otherwise that aren't shared or repeated anywhere else. It's nice not hearing rehashed effects or abused sound effects throughout the game, making it feel progressive as you play along. Some might cause near heart attacks, such as drowning where the music slowly fades and the ticking of a clock sounds louder with an echo, touches like these are lovely. Music is as energetic as well, with an over-arcing theme of "optimism in the face of adversity". For example during the boss theme, it'll start off threatening but turn into a cheery anthem, even in defeat it'll still sound like the score is telling you to keep going, that victory is just around the bend. Lastly the voice acting, it's not the best of the best, though it does lean towards good, with only one...maybe two feeling a little out of place or forced. The leading female voicing sounds about right with each role; Lilac being a leader, Carol being a rapscallion and Milla being adorble. Occasionally, even outside boss fight banter, a character might pip up (the skeletal bird in the mines for example when you dodge it's attacks). Little touches, all welcome.\n\nGameplay- You move right, even when you need to go left for a bit, you'll end up heading right. Jumping is also important. Oh and each character is unique. Lilac being the strongest, but her attacks are a bit slower. She can spin to get a bit of lift, as well as do constant damage on a target. Also the dragon comet (sorry, name slips my mind) is ridiculous in how versatile in moving about a stage or beating up baddies. She also has an uppercut, but the dragon comet takes the cake. Carol is more of a scapper; she can pounce, kick in quick succession and chain attacks quickly, but they hit less. Using her claws, she can scale walls a bit, on red pads she can zip around a stage very quickly...oh, and the girl gets a motorbike, and she can do the kick attack while on it. Milla (to round out the more important characters) has the least amount of health, but shouldn't be underestimated. She can summon blocks of...goo and throw them at enemies, pick up things and throw them at things, and she can create a forcefield which repels projectiles, even boss ones. And if she combines the goo and shield, she can unleash   a cannon like lazer fire that makes up for her weak health. Finally, she can dig for gems and flap her arms and ears vigorously to gain lift while grunting adorably, which I was unaware was a thing. Speaking of gems, you collect them to top off a score and when you collect enough, gain a one-up, which also can be aquired throughout levels along with cards and orbs that unlocks stuff along the way while beating up increasingly difficult bosses. Fair warning, there's a odd difficulty spike about the half-way mark, where it was increasing steadily will shoot up quite a few extra notches, recommend a gamepad to save your fingers from losing skin. Side mentions before moving on; the cinematics are a welcome addition and go with the flow nicely and can be a decent length at times (but can be skipped), the extra challenges outside the main story are varied and challenging, but not impossible and the few levels dedicated to specific characters you choose to play are lovely, making your choice on character more personal.\n\nFinal Impression:\nBuy- If you at any point wanted or did play classic Sonic games and/or wanted more as well as more out of them, the upbeat music and vibrant colors which feel a bit anime in respects and something different then what's offered on the current market.\n\nPass- Again, if you hated Sonic and anything like it, you "may" not like this, it's a less serious title so the pallete and style might be offputting as well, along with people who despise all things anthropomorphic (a.k.a. furries).\n\nRecommendation- I give it a thumbs up, plenty of replayability to beat your old score or scrounge around those tucked away star cards, extra challenges, different character paths and all for fifteen dollars, and in an economy of games where they ask for four times the price and deliver a fraction of the content. There's a lot of love put into the game, and it shows it in strides, can only look forward to addition content and perhaps more games from GalaxyTrail.","July 22, 2014","true","16.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is the case for those that don't even try that. Games like Super Meatboy, Fez, and so many others offer up nothing in the ways of challenge or anything actually memorable save for the obnoxious publicity seeking invalids that put in the baseline effort to make them.\n\nFreedom Planet is the utter antithesis of that. What apparently started as a Sonic fan game has even transcended that. It's a case of the student becoming the teacher. In the end, the game finds its own voice while harkening back to golden age platformers. Sure, this will beg comparisons to Sonic's classic games (I found it to have more similarities to Ristar in many ways, not a bad thing) but bring them on.\n\nFreedom Planet is better than the Classic Sonic games. This is seriously one of the best platformers ever made. Everything about this game is outstanding\n\nVisually sharp and beautiful, the pixel work is topnotch and animations are so smooth and fluid. Environmental details are exquisite and the atmospheric touches reveal the kind of love the developers put into this.\n\nThe musical score is fantastic and heightens the experience with awesome tunes, the voice acting is well above average for any video game.\n\nThe gameplay starts out pretty simple and easy, but ramps up quickly but not insurmountably so. You're given plenty of lives and you better learn the tricks and level gimmicks to get farther. I actually have to go out of my way to nitpick something: There's a level toward the very end that brings the flow to a screeching halt. This is seriously the biggest criticism I can level against it.\n\nThe story isn't ground breaking, but it's all tied up very nicely and makes sense. Characters are likable and you do feel some emotional involvement with them.\n\nGalaxyTrail has not just made an homage to classic platformers; they've created a near perfect specimen of one. If you like 2D Platformers, this is a game you simply must have. If you're a child of the '90s who grew up with a Genesis/Mega Dive, this game is a must have. If you would like to see games have artistic merit, this game is a must have.\n\nIn short, Freedom Planet rules. Get it.","July 22, 2014","true","28.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

So much diversity and work was put into them!\nThe level design / flow\nThe ambience and synergies between the art and design used\nThe gameplay itself, no lazy regenerating health systems, no overly generous amounts of health, if you screw up, you will be penalized, there is no hand holding here, at all.\nPlenty of things to keep coming back to levels for - speed runs, collectibles, alternate paths, etc.\nLots of fun little surprises outside of the gameplay itself\nThe villain and final confrontation(s) against him\nThe difficulty - this game WILL kick your ♥♥♥ and depending on where you are in the game, even have the villains laugh at you for screwing up.\nThe use of familiar elements from other games whilst keeping a fresh and unique take of their own\nThe developer's continued support fixing any lingering issues and their involvement in the discussion forums on the community hub\nThere are two more playable characters on the way via FREE DLC, as well as new levels\nThe Bad Honestly nothing by my standards... but... (see below)\nThe Nitpicks (things not worth subtracting any personal points over, but worth noting) The voice work can be a little spotty in some places (maybe more than some depending on your own personal tolerance), but it is entirely optional. There are some moments, particularly with the villains, where the actors really nail the moment though and enhance the overall experience\nThe dialogue can be a bit corny in some spots as well... again though, completely optional\nThere is a restart option on the in-game menu, but it really isn't particularly useful from any point of view I can think of right now as it only brings you back to your last checkpoint and subtracts a life. This is okay for speedrunning, but a more traditional restart would've been appreciated too.\nThe more anime-ish bits of art (more of a personal anti-preference)\nPeople on their first playthrough may experience a few cheap deaths to the later bosses as they can be really punishing to the uninitiated, particularly since they all do so much in their respective fights. It will enhance the 'fun' factor on your subsequent visits though\nThe Verdict\n++ I LOVE this game. At $15, this is a steal for the quality of entertainment value it brings, one that I would've gladly paid more for. I cannot recommend it highly enough, this is pretty much everything I wanted in a game of this genre. The developer did such a great job making everything come together, and there is still more to come through patches and free dlc as of the time this was written.\n\nIf nothing else, try the demo and see what you're in for.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe lengthier thoughts\n\nThis game wasn't on my radar, at all in fact... mostly because I didn't know it was in development or existed for that matter. What got my initial attention was a chance encounter with a couple player reviews as I was browsing the (non-specific) section of the Steam Community hub. Seeing the game compared to other titles I was familiar with (Rocket Knight/Sparkster, Megaman, Pulseman, and Sonic), as well as mentions of the difficulty included within piqued my interest enough that I decided to check the store page to see what was up. When I saw the gameplay trailer, I was more or less hooked to the point where I decided that I wanted the game, and didn't want to wait for a sale.\n\nIndeed if you have any fond memories of the aforementioned games (preferably their 90's versions), you likely will recognize many familiar elements scattered throughout, but with a fresh take on their iterations in this game. Not that I'm relying on the nostalgia factor mind you, not only because of the fact that it paints the picture that you are playing with rose-tinted glasses, but also because there may be people interested who are too young to have experienced the games some of the inspiration was drawn from. Regardless, whether those memories are present or not, you should be able to create quite a few new ones from Freedom Planet.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the shining star here as it should be. There are currently 3 characters available for play with at least two more to be included in free DLC.\n\n- Lilac has your Rocket Knight elements built into her skillset, being able to boost in almost any direction when her special meter is full. She is in general a very fast fighter and makes great use of open spaces with the rest of her moves, particularly her cyclone attack which can be used on the ground or in the air to unleash a devastating flurry of attacks, and even increase her maneuverability.\n\n- Carol on the other hand, is your wall jumping, fierce melee fighter who can make best use of tighter spaces. What she lacks in her open-space mobility (when she doesn't have her motorcycle power-up), she makes up for by being able to pull herself out of danger by scaling any nearby surfaces. With her motorcycle, she gains the ability to double jump, boost her speed when on the ground, and ride up walls rather than having to jump up them Megaman/Super Meat Boy style.\n\n- Milla is a more defensive-based character, who summons 'phantom blocks', projectiles which can be thrown, or used to enhance her shield blast which also doubles as a means to reflect/absorb most enemy projectiles. She also has the ability to fly temporarily while in the air, and dig into the mostly sparse, softer surfaces to find items to help her along her way. Mastery of these attacks will allow for more aggressive gameplay later.\n\nEnemies themselves for the most part do not wound you immediately on impact. This typically tends to be the standard for games of this genre, which also tended to lead to some aggravating, not to mention avoidable damage/deaths and slowdowns. Make no mistake, many will hurt you, very badly in some cases, but you'll at least have time to react so that any mistakes will be player side and not because of bad design.\n\nThe bosses are some of the best moments of the game due to the fact that they evolve in many different ways over the course of the fight. Some of the encounters have a bit of randomness added to make the fight unpredictable, others add new attacks/patterns as you bring them to different damage thresholds/phases, a couple speed up as they become closer to death, some even behave differently if playing on 'hard' difficulty. All in all there's a nice variety of elements to each boss fight to make them fun (but not necessarily any easier) with each subsequent playthrough. That said, it is worth noting that you will likely meet with a few cheap deaths on your first playthrough as there are a couple "surprise!" moments that will badly hurt you toward the later levels, whether from an unexpected attack, or just the number of instances you take damage from failing to dodge something particularly painful. I like to think that it will increase the fun factor though after the initial shock wears off.\n\nThe music is phenomenal as well, we're talking the kind of quality that stays with you after you stop playing, that, assuming you don't also buy the soundtrack, you will listen to over and over outside the game.\n\nI could go on and on, but the main thing that any perspective buyer needs to know here, is that this game does essentially everything right that matters and where it matters.","August 19, 2014","true","94.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

It is an absolute love letter to people who are fans of classics like the original Sonic games and Ristar. It feels familar yet so new. It can get challenging but remains fair all the way through. Really engaging gameplay that can vary depending on which of the three characters you're playing as.\n\nThe voiceacting is a little cheesy but it gets the job done well. It gives each character unique and identifiable personalities and allows the story to be told well. Truth be told I wasn't expecting this game to have full-fledged voiceacting and when I first heard it, I was a little weirded out, but it grew on me and it's actually quite charming. The world the game takes place in is very unique and has a lot of depth to it.\n\nTons of bosses that all play out differently. Requiring you to recognize patterns and use them to your advantage. Level designs that bring new gameplay mechanics to keep you on your toes. It is pretty much exactly like how the classics would've handled it. It doesn't hold your hand but doesn't cheat against you.\n\nSeriously. Buy and play this game.

I have been playin this game nonstop since I bought it because of how much fun I have playing it. The game controls a lot like Sonic the Hedgehog 1,2, and 3, but you are also given an attack and special button and each one is unique to each character, and while the old sonic titles gave you a lot of speed and little to no reaction time, for some of us at least, you are given enough room to react and speed to react to your surroundings and obstacles. Aside from gameplay, the levels are given very nice length, none of the levels feel too long or too short, however, some levels may prove to be challenging as there are different paths, areas with collectables, and some enemies will really annoy the hell out of you at times. The art is stylish and cool, the music is kick ♥♥♥, and the story is a nice add in. Also, if you dont want to listen to the story, fear not, for there is a classic mode to where you pick your character and go.

It's like a brilliant combination of Ristar, Sonic, and Gunstar Heroes. With three playable characters, unlockables, and promised future updates, there's quite a lot of game here for $15 considering it's a platformer. Far, FAR worse games are released every day for $60. Freedom Planet is definitely worth its asking price.\n\nThe artwork is supurb and the music is exceptionally catchy as well. My only complaint stems from Adventure Mode story. I love the idea behind the Adventure Mode, but the story is just a liiiitle too cutesy and somewhat hard to follow. You're basically told right off the bat that you need to save the world by retriving some stone, but you're not really told why, or what the stone does, or why your playable characters are called "traitors", etc. The pacing and revealling of information is just off. The cutscenes are a lot longer than they need to be to convery information as well.\n\nAll in all happy with my day 1 purchase.

It has a lot of characteristics of sonic and megaman put together.  Some of the dialog in this game is extreamly corny, but very cute.  very much like sonic as you start the level and run through it till you make it to the boss of sub boss.  Megaman aspect comes into play with the disapearing platform blocks and having to attack enemies not by just jumping but slashing, speed dash and tornado spins.  Bosses difficulty jump is very hard to discribe, at first it gradually climbs but then like half way through the game the boss levels jump by like 3 to 4 levels per level.  Main villain/final boss is a bad ♥♥♥.  Super powerful and extreamly skilled, you will most likely die to him a few times.  Music for this game is outstanding and really well done.  There was though many questions unanswered in this game making me think there will be a sequal to this game.  Still have to complete the game with Carol to see if any of these answeres are given.  If there is a secret hidden boss tougher then the final boss, have not been able to locate it so i will still have to look through the levels with the characters and see if I can find one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/recommended/248310/","auldwolf","AuldWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/","423 products in account","I have to admit, as a backer of the Kickstarter, I wasn't sold on the demo.\n\nBut it's come SUCH a long way since then! What I actually played of it, yesterday and today, shows an exemplary understanding of level design that's rarely seen these days. I think the great era of platformers ended with the original Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank on the PS2, there have been some decent ones since then, but that was it so far as the greats go.\n\nThis, however, feels like it belongs in that time, but mixes in modern sensibilities. I'll explain.\n\nFirst of all, it feels like a love letter to the originality of the Mega Drive (or Genesis, if you so prefer), picking the most eccentric of the platformers to draw inspiration from. One of those fonts is definitely Sonic, yes, but it goes further than that. It also feels a bit like Gunstar Heroes, and with just a hint of something like Alisia Dragoon thrown into the mix. The execution of this rather rambunctious recipe is simply sublime. A lot of platformers which try to be like the golden era of platforming have loads of issues either with level design, the controls, or the overall feel of movement. Freedom Planet gets these things right, it has them down pat from the get go.\n\nAnd to speak to its modern sensibilities -- it has a casual mode, so those friends who found Sonic too frustrating can finally understand what you saw in those old games, it has some memorable characters, and it has fairly decent writing. Now, understand, they're not GREAT characters or writing, but they're definitely serviceable, and better than what we were offered back in the Dreamcast and PS2 days. The voice acting, however, is cheesy, but not cheesy enough to be reminiscent of those days, either. I'd say that the overall execution of this part of the game is very competent, enough so as to be enjoyable rather than grating. But your mileage may vary.\n\nFinally, if I have but one criticism, it's of the aesthetic. Notably of the curves in some of the levels that look like they were cut by na orbital laser scalpel for the purpose of existing within the levels. Some kind of outline, jagginess, or suggestion of naturally formed rock might help. Even just some moss or vines. To me, it's an issue that serves to distract me from time to time, as it is quite jarring.\n\nFurthermore, I think that the floating islands could use some more background decoration rather thanjust their foreground presence. This latter aspect is an area where I feel that lots of platformers fail, old and new. Some get it right, and a floating platform will be held up by a crane or some structure in the background, or it'll have some more presence in the background to give it more meat. I know it's a floating platform, but some of them are really, really thin, and they feel more like floating astroturf for that reason. Just having some background to make them feel more like a floating chunk of rock or whatnot would help solve this issue.\n\nBoth of those issues are graphical, so if they won't bother you, you'll love this game. I'd give it five stars, but the distractions and annoyances of the graphical deficiencies mean I have to dock it to 4 and a ½.\n\nStill, that's a very strong recommendation, and it's MEANT to be. This is a pretty groovy game.","July 22, 2014","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/recommended/248310/","Zenja-soba","Zenja (James)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/","221 products in account","Overall Game Rating: 5/5\nThis is a highly abridged review, edited from a full one. I intend on placing my full thoughts on this game elsewhere.\n\nNOTE: I've only completed Lilac's gameplay, so I will only comment on Lilac, the main character. Other characters might be different.\n\nAfter just completing it (about 5 minutes before I starting typing this), I am still breathless as to how absolutely fantastic this game is. For some (such as myself), it's just what the doctor ordered when it comes to indie platformers, especially ones that started on Kickstarter\n\nI would just like to get one thing clear: This is not a "Sonic Clone". Sega isn't the only one allowed to include slopes and loop-de-loops in a platformer. But with that said, this game certainly has similar air to old sonic games. From a story standpoint, again, it's similar, but still holds true to being it's own thing. Any other "vague similarities" can be written off as an homage.\n\n\nLevel Design: Overall really solid, as it makes a big effort to be more than just "go right until you win". There IS a minor exploration element to this (if you must compare, think of Sonic CD). For instance, you might be met with a door that needs a key, thus requiring you to find it. It's not really a problem since it hardly feels like backtracking, usually you're met with the locked door (or whatever) first, and then are expected to take an alternate path to find the solution (or to head back to the door/obstacle). Very rarely does it have you go back to find it, and when it does, the level is designed in a way to be a slightly different obstacle than the first time you came through. But other times, it will just have you go either down or up, or even have you go into a small room to complete a task. This concept may be a little jarring to someone who's used to "hold right to win", but once you are met with it for the first time (and maybe get horribly lost/confused like I did), it becomes easier to figure out what the game wants you to do when you see such an obstacle. I use the term "key" and "door", but in reality, there are only a few actual instances of it being a literal key and door, and those aren't until later levels anyway. This concept manifests as a button/trigger to make a rock fall down to break a floor, a speed boost so that you have enough speed to make a jump, a "dragon dash" recharge ring (?name?) to make it so you can get up a really long vertical hallway, and more.\nNot only that, the levels come to life with each one having one or several unique mechanics involved, such as chaining Dragon Dashes, or hanging on to giant dandelion spores, so no two levels feel the same, or have the same idea behind them. The last few levels might be an exception, as there are several parts themed around dodging tremendous amounts of gunfire and legions of enemies. Oh, and don't worry about the dreaded "water level", Lilac is a decent swimmer.\n\nMechanics: It's a no brainer that running and jumping are your bread and butter, since this is a platformer afterall. But on top of that, Lilac is apparently an accomplished martial artist. You can punch and kick enemies that are on equal level to you to take them out quickly. Lilac can also assault enemies that are within jumping range by doing a flying spin kick when you hit the jump button again; spin kicks also increase her jump height. This costs some of Lilac's blue meter to do, and cannot be done too many times in a row, but you are able to do it when you need to without much concern. This skill is useful to jump onto a platform that might have an enemy in the way, or to attack a boss that has a hit box that's just out of normal attack reach. But the main attraction here is Lilac's "Dragon Dash". Again using Sonic as a frame of reference, Spin Dash is to Sonic as Dragon dash is to Lilac, but with several key differences. First, it costs a full meter to use, so it can only be done every so often. Unlike Spindash, Dragon Dash can be done in the air, and doesn't need time to charge (but does have a startup animation). It can be aimed to shoot Lilac forward, up at an angle, or down at an angle. But the coolest thing about Dragon Dash is that when Lilac hits a surface, she ricochets off into another direction, but still keeps her angular momentum. The bouncing properties of this move will come in handy a lot, and is the basis of a lot of the level navigation. This move is also damaging in property, able to topple even tough enemies, and can hit bosses hard if aimed correctly (which is easier said than done with some of them). It's very interesting how this specific mechanic is implemented in the design of this game, as it is very satisfying to use. Luckily, there's an entire level based around it.\nOther things in Lilac's arsenal are the shields she can acquire in the levels and bonus stages. They come in 5 different colors, to match the elements of Wu Xing; the 5 traditional Chinese elements. Each shield has different properties, but all of them can help Lilac take more damage before her health bar is depleted.\n\nMusic/Sound: The music tracks all compliment the theme of the levels nicely, while also having a wide range of styles. Instead of being true to Genesis style 16-music, the music is fonted more traditionally while still having a nice classic sound. Most of the tracks offer a variety of melodies that all are very tasteful and true to what a video game sound track should sound like. The composers clearly have an understanding of what makes a good ear worm track.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the voice acting. With the game being inspired by animal character mascots of the 90's, being indie, and having the main characters being primarily little girls, the odds were stacked against a production like this to produce character voices that weren't awkward. Well, prepare to be amazed, because they actually managed to pull it off rather well! While this may be my personal experience (your mileage may vary), not once did I hear any cringeworthy voices or dialogue in any of the cutscenes. Overall, color me impressed.\n\nOther: The story can be described as detailed and colorful, while still being loaded with charm. Almost every character is fleshed out to the point where you can realistically express having a favorite character.\n\nAnother aspect of Freedom Planet worth talking about is the challenge this game gives. Namely bosses, and Freedom planet has a lot of them, in fact, there are more boss fights than levels, with averaging 2 per level, sometimes more. In my personal experience, there are some bosses that I thought I was never going to be able to beat. Yet, every boss in Freedom Planet is fair. Weak spots are adequately highlighted, and almost every attack is brilliantly telegraphed. You never feel like it was the game's fault you failed in defeating a boss, but that you realized you got the timing off, or that you were too aggressive in your strategy.\n\nFinal words: The game is absolutely breathtaking, and should certainly be looked at as a good example of design on several fronts. While I know people are just going to see it and think "oh, it's a Sonic clone", all I can say is play it to see how much it's not. Freedom Planet has a lot to offer, and I imagine it will harbor a fanbase in the future. If you are a huge fan of classic Sega games at all, you need this game, I would wager it will do something for you. It certainly struck the right notes with me, and I look to Galaxytrail with anticipation on any further projects. I can only call what they were able to do astonishing, as their breakout game being such a great game. Not many other indie developers can say that.","July 22, 2014","true","11.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Why is "Y" the pause button with the Xbox controller? I mean, it doesn't really take anything away from the game plus the fact that you can still change it on the options, but still... Y?... (Please, Ignore that terrible pun just there)\n\nAnyway, I've only played Adventure mode so far, but still, the game's tons of fun! Also reminds me a lot of the many flash games I used to play before, probably another reason why I enjoy it so much, still, it's not perfect, the game feelz pretty unfair when it comes to the boss fights, coming to a point where I had to lower the difficulty just for them, also the fact that it didn't matter how much I lowered the sensitivity of the analogstick, it still was way too sensitive, thank goodness I could change the settings to move with the directional pad instead... Kinda wonder why that wasn't default too actually, D-pads are normally better for sidescrollers... Oh well... I also gotta complain in the fact that... I feel like  having to play adventure mode twice just to see the complete story is kinda pointless... I mean... Both characters go most of the time through the same events so... Would it have made more sense if we simply switched characters through the story to get the complete experience? If the reason behind this is to be able to play every level with every character... Wouldn't classic mode work for that?... It might be just me thought...\n\nAside from that, it's pretty top notch, this mix up betwen the Sonic kind of platforming and the fighting style (from that game which name I don't remember...) made for a pretty enjoyable experience!\n\nAnd also... It's pretty short!! What? You think that's a negative? Hell no! The games I've being playing lately have being so dreadfully long it's really a breath of fresh air to have one being short! It has replay value so it's not like if you were going to get bored of it in a day!\n\nSumming up, the game is great! with great level design and outstanding visuals!

I heard nothing of it prior to launch but I was interested right away. Freedom Planet is a throwback to the old school Sega Genesis days of mascots like Ristar and Sonic The Hedgehog and it pulls it off fantastically while still being able to stand on it's own. I can safely say this game is every bit as fun as the trailers made it seem (even more)! The levels are really diverse with different pathways, the physics are great, boss battles are creative and fun, the voice acting is really good and the sound track is top notch!\n\nBesides the story, the game packs a Classic Mode that strips away all the cutscenes and plays all the levels in order, and a Time Trial mode. More features will be added and free so it won't get dull. It's a highly replayable game with huge levels and a lot of collectables. It also comes packed with achievements that let you look at the game a bit differently, for example there might be a different way of taking down a boss so experimenting and going through the levels more than once is highly recommended.\n\nThe controls can be configured to your liking so the button layout is never a chore to learn. The characters are easy and fun to control and it's a blast to play through each level. Everything pops out and is beautifully colorful, the sprites and character designs are amazing to look at, and every level still feels fresh after continuous playthroughs. I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this game, it's the perfect example of an Indie game done right! Do yourself a favor and buy this game! If you're an old school gamer you'll love it. It's highly inspired by the old genesis games but there's so much to love. It has a compelling and interesting story and it should not be missed!\n\nI give it a 10/10!","July 23, 2014","true","19.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prof_icepick/recommended/248310/","prof_icepick","Professor Icepick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prof_icepick/","455 products in account","One of the best 2D platformers I've played since the 16-bit era. Definitely deserves a place of honor alongside other more high-profile indie games like Shovel Knight and the Shantae series. While this game looks sort of like a mere Sonic the Hedgehog clone, it's more of a tribute to the Genesis as a whole. Taking elements from games like Gunstar Heroes and the Rocket Knight games (and yes, a healthy dose of Sonic), Freedom Planet delivers a satisfying experience overall.\n\nAt present, you're able to choose between three characters, with two more planned for a future release. Sash Lilac is most similar to Sonic in terms of gameplay, due to her super speed. But instead of somersaults and spin dashes, Lilac can perform a hair whip (not unlike Tails' tail whip from the Sonic Advance games), twirl in mid-air to attack and slow her decline and even perform a powerful Cyclone attack (which reminds me of Sparkster's charge attack from the Rocket Knight games). Carol Tea is a bit different, using her claws for various slash attacks and to scale walls (like MegaMan X, not Knuckles). Carol can also collect gas cans to ride her motorcycle, which increases her speed, gives her some new attacks and allows her to drive up walls. Finally, there's Milla Basset, who can fly for a short time (which kind of acts like a cross between Tails' flight from the Sonic games and Yoshi's flutter jump), form an energy shield which can reflect enemy fire, toss energy blocks to attack enemies, and even combine the latter two for a powerful energy beam attack.\n\nThe diversity in play styles between the various characters gives the game a lot of replayability. You've also got the choice of playing the game with its story intact (only available for Lilac and Carol at the time this review was written) or without. There's also a Time Attack mode where you can replay any stages you've already cleared, a set of challenge stages and even a Mahjong solitaire mini-game. There are also 10 collectables in most stages, which also adds to the replay value as well.\n\nTL;DR - if you're a fan of the classic Genesis Sonic games, Genesis-era platformers or just 2D platformers in general, do yourself a favor and pick up Freedom Planet. It's well worth the $15.","April 29, 2015","true","17.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Cute!\n\nThe difficulty is fair, and dying isn't frustrating because even if you get a Game Over, you'll still respawn from the last checkpoint, just like a regular death.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, however. The level design is a bit confusing sometimes, though I never got stuck, so that's not a major problem. Also, Lilac's special ability can be a bit tricky to use, which can lead to some annoying moments where you have to sit there and wait for the special bar to refill.\n\nOverall this is a great trip down the nostalgia lane, and a must-play for anyone who likes 2D Sonic games.","April 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(GOG customer double dipping on Steam.) Freedom Planet is a wonderfully crafted platformer made of everything I loved about video games from the 90's, and it takes all of that to new heights. Many will say the game would have felt right at home on the SEGA Saturn, and I agree.\n\nPros:\n\n• 15 Massive stages that will keep you exploring and coming back for more\n• Beautifully colored pixel art in a consistent art style makes this game stand out\n• Lively, fast, inspiring oriental music composed by Woofle and BlueWarrior.\n• 3 playable characters, and each have their own unique play style\n• Nearly 30 engaging, challenging bosses and mini-bosses\n• Speedrunner friendly! This game has a high skill ceiling\n• More achievements and secrets than you can shake a stick at\n• Performs well on laptops! Freedom Planet should even play on your old Windows XP PCs\n• Multi-platform! If you're a Linux fan, like me, you're in for a treat.\n• Buy it on Steam and get exclusive access to betas of future content!\n\nCons:\n\n• The story suffers greatly from planned lines of dialogue that were cut early in development, so some things that should make sense don't (Including Adventure Hubs, which would have made large chunks of the story optional.)\n• Voice acting ranges from nice to outstanding, but some cast members' horrible mics ruin the immersion (Everyone's getting professional recording equipment for Freedom Planet 2, so this won't be an issue in the sequel.)\n• There would be a third con here, but the developers have since addressed quite a few problems players faced with the game after launch, so I'm good!\n\nWhile the story's cohesiveness is fairly rough around the edges - in part because of time and budget constraints - it does try to tell a fun, cheesy sci-fi tale like what you would expect on Saturday Morning cartoons from yesteryear, and the main villain is more than excellent at his role.\n\nAnd if you're not all that interested in geopolitics with animal people, Classic Mode plays exactly as you would expect from a SNES/Genesis platformer, without all the story stuff. I mostly play Freedom Planet on Classic or Time Attack modes myself.\n\nNone of Adventure Mode's shortcomings undermine how outstanding the game itself is. The stages are massive, the fighting is fierce, and boss battles are thrilling set pieces. All three characters you play as are balanced and completely different from each other in terms of play style; no two playthroughs between them are the same, so it's another great source of replay value.\n\nSome people like to make comparisons between Freedom Planet and Sonic the Hedgehog, but when you play Freedom Planet for yourself, it easily becomes a game of Apples and Oranges as far as game play is concerned. The only things both series' truly have in common are their slope-based physics; the movement and combat on top of the physics makes FP a totally different beast in terms of game play. Nothing you learned while playing Sonic will help you in Freedom Planet.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an awesome game, and with its sheer amount of content, it's worth more than the price of admission. If you love platformers, Freedom Planet is a must-have for your library.","March 23","true","20.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The music, sounds effects, art direction, humour you just can't go wrong with this game!\nIts so good that it is easy to point out its flaw because it is the only thing that is wrong.\n\nWell kinda, let me explain.\nThe game is fantastic and you will be having a great time until you notice the timer and the fact you can sorta spindash. You mean like...Sonic?! So as soon as that thought enters your mind you will be trying to play the game like sonic and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The 'spindash' is exclusive to the dragon so if you pick the wildcat she will perform some kind of kick move instead which is already a shame really but she does get a motorcycle which is awesome (while it lasts). So right away you wil be trying to blaze through levels and you will then feel the controls are not quite what you want them to be.\n\nThen their is the lack of recovery frames. You have a huge healthy lifebar but often as you progress in the game, monsters (and bosses) will shoot out large beam style attacks or repeated shots and if one hits you, that huge life bar will drain very rapidly. Its a huge flaw because anyone who remembers sonic's glorydays will also remember that flashy attacks and massive beams were par for the course but you would get hit, lose rings and gain invincibility which doesn't happen in this game so dying often times feels cheap because it feels like you need to be perfect against specific monsters or bosses or else you are dead.\n\nThankfully you often restart near bosses if you die although stages are less forgiving. That said the game provides plenty of health power ups...Sometimes. The placement of them seem odd actually as if they expected you to struggle at certan parts but expected you to ace other parts so if you don't do great at those points you will quickly lose interest in the game.\n\nAs I said originally, everything about the game is great except those two flaws however if you are looking for a 'sonic the hedgehog' game then this is not it. It certainly looks the part and starts out seeming the part but this is it's own game and it is a great game at that.\n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 23, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And it was DEFINITELY worth the wait.  If you even remotely enjoyed the 16-bit platformers then this game is a must-have.  Great story, great voice acting, great characters, great art, great gameplay, i honestly can't think of anything bad about the game right off the top of my head.... maybe the absence of co-op?  Wouldn't really call that a downside tbh.\n\nI've always been a massive fan of the Sonic series, but surprisingly I actually find this game to be better in many ways, it pretty much fixes the issues that the classic Sonic games had.  The game also has very good replayability, I'll probably end up at 50+ hours of gameplay, if not more.

It's more of a Dear John letter, as in-\n"Dear Sonic, I'm leaving and taking the kids, the motorcycle, the dog, and everything else that made you awesome.  Except the speed.  You can keep your addiction to speed.  -Best Wishes, Hero Pants"\n\nFor what started as a Sonic fangame, FP has already evolved well beyond that, and with the announcement of a sequel, there's a good chance that this will establish it as a fully viable franchise.\n\nThe game is familar to anyone who's puttered around as a 2D blue hedgehog straight out of the gate, but it quickly breaks into its own beast.  First and foremost, It has a story.  Like, a deep, involving story that actually makes sense beyond 'go find some magic crystals and stop some fat man with a sick fetish for concentrating all of his impressive resources upon a completely unstrategic planet'.  Second, the levels are fun and accessable to explore - There are many routes and paths through each of the stages, and while speed-running is perfectly possible, I found myself taking upwards of twenty minutes per area, just to poke at everything on the first play through.\n\nThe pacing also excels in this one, the boss fights are spaced well and aren't too easy or too challanging (usually), and generally make sense for what your trying to accomplish at any time in the game.  That being said, some of the bosses (the standard 'figure out my pattern and I'm useless' sort common to platformers) are pretty hard, even on normal, and even after you've figured it all out.\n\nThe one thing this game doesn't have over any Sonic title is speed.  You do run fast.  But it's not a case of holding down right ceaselessly and occasionally hitting a jump button to fly over a pit or some spikes until the stage ends.  You have to fight things rather than just roll through them, in this sense it's far more like Rocket Knight, and each of the playable characters offer a vastly different approach to how you handle enemies.\n\nSpeaking of different characters, each one has their own set of stages, some with completely unique levels designed only for them.  I thought that was a nice touch.  It makes playing through the game as another person a slightly different experience than just doing the same things over and over.\n\nOtherwise, there are the usual bevy of things to collect and unlock, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the graphics are very close to later era 2D Sonic games, while still working its own style in smoothly.  There's even an amusing shmup segment that comes in two flavors depending who you are.\n\nAll in all, I highly enjoyed this game, and I am looking forward to Freedom Planet 2.","December 30, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uro/recommended/248310/","uro","Uro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uro/","270 products in account","You could call it a "Sonic clone"... if the clone was a smarter, stronger, and more likeable version of the original, who then chose to murder the original and take its place as a more productive member of society under the clone's newly chosen name.\n\nThe levels are designed surprisingly intuitively, allowing you to maintain a fast-pace throughout. All of the characters allow for a varying level of speed, but each has her own unique style of play, pretty analogous to the play style differences between Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.\n\nThough there are plenty of enemies and you're given a few combat abilities to fight them, you can often choose to ignore most of the combat entirely and rush to the boss fights. All of the bosses follow a pretty strict pattern, but solid execution is still critical to winning the boss fights, especially the late game bosses, which spike in difficulty relative to the first 3/4ths of the game.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful. It has a consistent and colorful style that isn't too chaotic to understand at first glance. Occasionally, you see platforms and walls that aren't actually walls and platforms, but they aren't frequent enough to where you'll regularly be jumping into mirages.\n\nFinally, what really brings everything together is the fantastic soundtrack. It hits all of the right notes you'd expect from a classic Sega game. Sonic CD and Virtual-On come to mind. Though it adopts that similar style, it's not just some riff on old content. The soundtrack is clearly this game's own and each track does a great job at complementing each stage or boss fight.\n\nGalaxy Trail really stepped forward and brought back a style of platformer that really hasn't had many hit games since Sonic CD. Even then, Sonic CD had a number of problems that just aren't present here. Freedom Planet really brings out the best of the platforming genre that otherwise would be a sea of slow-paced puzzle platformers, "deep" 8-bit experiences, or super-hard death fests.\n\nIf I had to describe Freedom Planet in a single line, I'd honestly say, "Sonic 3 and Knuckles... but much better."","September 23, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/248310/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Freedom Planet is quite possibly the best Sonic the Hedgehog game ever made. There's a lot of baggage with that statement, but it's also the clearest, most succinct way to make you understand what this game is. Freedom Planet could have exploded straight off the Sega Genesis with its wise-cracking heroes and manic levels and funky platforming physics and infuriating bosses. While all of those elements might not be good things, it forms a package that's one of the best nostalgia trips and all-around solid platformers on Steam.\n\nYou play as Lilac the dragonlady or Carol the catlady as they try to stop an interplanetary warlord from totally boning their pleasant little planet. Both characters have dramatically different styles of play, down to being able to utilize different features of the levels. Lilac can double-jump and fly short distances, while Carol can pounce and climb walls. Though their abilities are lifted largely from the characters of the early Sonic games, the ways they are combined in Lilac and Carol give you an enormous amount of control over your characters and how they interact with the levels. I honestly came away feeling like Freedom Planet controls better than any of the games it was inspired by.\n\nPart of this success stems from the levels themselves and their open designs. Sonic games had a habit of splitting stages into fast stages where you run through loops and tunnels, and slow stages where you do careful, plodding platforming. The levels of Freedom Planet are far more open than that, and are designed around letting you progress however you like. The main paths have lots of straightaways and loops and such to tear through, as well as plenty of open air to launch into. But there are also side paths and platforms you can navigate to using your character's powers that hide secrets and collectibles. The open-ended designs do a lot to keep you playing, since if you tire of one style you can just switch to another.\n\nThe levels themselves are explosions of hues, seemingly pulled right from the 256-color excesses of the 90s. Each of the many areas also has plenty of gimmicks, from slot machines to levitation and everything in between. One clever level lets you board enemy airships and disarm them from within. The music and sound effects are more than up to the task, taking you back to your days camped out in front of the TV with familiar tunes and jingles. There are plenty of power-ups and doodads to pick up, but if I have one gripe with the gameplay, it's that a lot of the items are not clear in their use or explained in any way. Much like the games of old, you need to consult a manual to find out what all the shields and tokens do.\n\nThat's not my only gripe, either. The bosses in Freedom Planet are an eclectic and creative mix, but become very unforgiving in their patterns only a few levels in. They are absolutely fair, and learning their patterns well enough to beat them is very gratifying, but there is almost no margin for error with some of them. The game showers you with extra lives but I went through a huge portion of them just on the bosses in the last quarter of the game. And if it seems like I'm talking around the story... well, I'm very thankful there's a mode that loses all the voice-overs and cutscenes. The plot is nothing special but many of the cutscenes drag on and on, and the VO work is awkwardly amateur-hour. Some of the story beats are unusually melodramatic, including a seriously overblown torture scene which doesn't help matters in the least.\n\nIt's a shame the story falls so flat and is told so poorly, because everything else about the presentation is fantastic. The graphics, sound, and controls evoke all the best parts of the Genesis era and make Freedom Planet a joy to experience. There are plenty of collectibles to find, an extra character to unlock, time attack modes to tackle, all on top of gameplay that'll take a good three to four hours to get through. It's not quite the accomplishment that Shovel Knight is for NES games, but if you long for the halcyon days of Sonic, or just really solid, frenetic platformers in general, Freedom Planet is for you.","February 2","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Man, I don't know where to start, this game is so rad and has so much replay value.\n\nThe controls for the characters are extremely responsive, and it just feels nice to move around and attack enemies.\nEach character has unique abilities and some of the time different levels than others.\n\nThere are plenty of stages in game, and each of them offer a fresh new experience each time with amazing artwork to its style, fantastic OST and new types of enemies introduced each stage.\n\nThe majority of stages feature a mid-stage boss and an end level boss. As the stages go on, off course, the difficulty curve will increase. Although because of how well constructed the game is, dying constantly during a boss fight doesnt get frustrating. Infact, it makes it feel more satisfying defeating the boss due to them having unique patterns.\n\nEach stage has 10 cards to collect, and this increases the replay value greatly as you may revisit the stages and still come across some areas that you never visited before.\n\nIf you choose to play in adventure mode, you will have cutscenes explaining the story in great detail and each character shows off their personality very well, accompanied with excellent voice acting. However, some people may not like the cutscenes, so if you just want to skip that and get right into the stages, classic mode will bring it more to your taste. I personally enjoyed adventure mode anyways.\n\nEven playing back through old stages through time attack mode, I still thoroughly enjoyed defeating multiple enemies without getting hit on hard difficulty.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of platforming games and want a thrill with a compelling atmosphere, DO GET THIS GAME. My friend gifted it me because I kept telling him how excited I was to get it whenever I was able to.

Where should I begin...\n\n- The fluid movement and tight, responsive controls evocative of the best Genesis and Saturn-era sidescrollers?\n- The three unique gameplay experiences including the Sonic-speed brawler, the technical wall-climbing combatant, or the tactical and exploratory summoner?\n- The large and varied environments featuring excellent level design that match the pacing and abilites of each of the three protagonists' skills?\n- The gameplay gimmicks that completely transform each experience without being tacky or overbearing and bring about multiple ways to progress through any level?\n- The gorgeous and flowing sprite animations that cram detail and character into every pixel of screen space?\n- The varied enemies that change from level to level and have their own attack patterns and weaknesses, making no two zones even remotely similar?\n- The independent story paths that bring about unique levels and all interweave in a compelling story line?\n- The absolutely fantastic soundtrack that never fails to set the right tone and mood for any encounter, and never become repetitive?\n- The fully-voiced dialogue by, for the most part, well-matched and competent voice actors that give a proper charisma and personality to each character in the story?\n- The boatloads of easter eggs and subtle attentions to detail that keep the game lively from start to finish?\n- The compelling achievements and collectibles that make replaying the game desireable?\n\nI mean, honestly. I am at a loss. If Shovel Knight is the "Super NES" indie game of the year, then Freedom Planet is the "Super Genesis" (so, Sega 32X or Saturn!) indie game of the year.\n\nMy two biggest let-downs with this game have nothing to do with the game itself. It has to do with the fact that this game received nowhere near as much publicity as some other indie platformers this year, and the fear that prospective gamers will write it off as a "Sonic clone" without so much as a second thought and miss out on one of the greatest retro revivals this side of a Gunstar Heroes re-release.\n\nWith a free demo available on the developer's website, there's no reason anyone should skip over this without at least a sample.\n\nFreedom Planet took years to create.

Coming off of Shante: Risky's Revenge right before playing this, I had concerns that I wouldn't be able to fully enjoy this game, as I've been really excited for it since I found it in Greenlight. Didn't need to though, because Freedom Planet was everything I expected and more. Truly kept me hooked from start to finish, and I've only played through the first two characters to play as. The developer says they may add more depending on how much intrest there is, which would be awesome.

Well, that's why I put them first, and why you don't see a 'No'.  Let's move on to the Pros, shall we?\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Yes, this is a Sonic the Hedgehog inspired game.  Not a carbon-copy.  They've taken the bits and pieces of mechanics, gameplay, level design and all that and then put that all into one package.  The end result is a game that will tickle your nostalgia if you're a fan for sure.  Even then, you don't need to have played sonic, or even know of its existence.\n\n-The Gameplay itself is fluid and fast-paced, to a point.  Sure you can speed through it, or you can take your time.  Maybe collect all the goodies to get that completionist feeling.  Plus, multiple game modes!  Time attack mode, 'Adventure' Mode for those that love story(Even with the long cutscenes), or just straight up 'Classic' mode.  As in, You beat a boss, onto the next stage.  No stopping.  Just gameplay.\n\n-The game, even with pixel graphics looks absolutely gorgeous.  From level design, enemy design, effects.  Whatever you look at is sure to catch your eye.\n\n-The soundtrack is equally as amazing as the art.  The kind that fits each stage through and through, and helps you appreciate both all at once.  Especially the boss music.  Oh man, if you ever loved some fitting boss tracks this game has some that'll please you.\n\n-Different Playable characters, while the other two besides the 'Main' character aren't that spectacular, offer multiple ways to explore the levels and dispose of your enemies.  On top of that, they have some pretty neat designs to boot!\n\n-The bosses are fantastic.  From the first to the last, I found myself loving every moment of the intense battles they offer.  Even if I died a ton on my first playthrough, almost every moment was as thrilling as the last.  Then there's that sweet sense of satisfaction when you finally beat it.  I don't remember how many times I threw my fist up in triumph.  It was probably a lot.\n\n-It's 15$.  Super cheap for what you're getting.\n\n\nAll in all, I have to say after playing through it once this has got to be one of the best platforming experiance I've had in a long time.  Forget whatever negative thoughts you may be having about it and just pick it up, especially if you read this far.  After all,  it took me just a few minutes of looking at all the positive reviews to decide to purchase the game.  They were right about it after all.  It's worth playing, and you should buy it.

[Sonic CD taking second place, albeit not easily since it's really good.]\n\nFreedom Planet does however, put it's own spin on things. Each character has their own unique moves. Lilac has a spin attack. Which can also be used to break special walls or even get a boost while in the air. Carol jumps up walls. Flurry kicks enemies. And has a motorcycle as a pickup that you can ride up walls. Best thing about Carol's motorcycle, is it doesn't feel like a cheap add on. You know, like in some other platformers. Where it's restricted to an area? None of that bs here. You can take that bike anywhere! So long as you have the skill to keep it intact. Milla can dig. And do creative things with her ability to shield. Of course, I'm only scratching the surface with this. I just want to give you an idea.\n\nThe story is surprisingly entertaining. The opening scene (before you press start), is a bit dark to my surprise. For a game in this genre. And I've played more then my fair share of platformers. Overall, the game's story seems to reveal an influence by anime. Which is still good in my books. The story won't win any awards in drama, but it may make you laugh. I like it.\n\nThere are numerous influences that can be seen in the game of the retro games of old too. From Megaman, to a whole range of Treasure developed games (Mischief Makers, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, etc). I feel it most with the bosses. Something about some of them remind me a great deal of the aforementioned Treasure games.\n\nThe bosses are just the right difficulty. Though it feels like there's a bit of a difficulty jump at some point. Or maybe it's just me. It's a hurdle that can be overcome with patience. And luckily, the checkpoints before a boss are forgiving.\n\nThere are two different modes. Story mode obviously, as well as classic mode which is story free. You also have access to a gallery. In which you collect various cards in each level. And there are a lot of these. There's 56 achievements you could work towards unlocking. Adding replayability to these levels on top of speed running if that's your thing. I know in shorter games, I like speed running. It can be a nice challenge once in a while.\n\nI give this game a 4.5 out of 5. With some part of me having an inner debate on adding that .5 back on. But, that's where I'm at now. Fantastic game. This could be one of the best 2d platformers out there. In my opinion.\n\nIf your still on the fence about this, there's still a demo on the official site. I'll post the link below. For $15, it's pratically a steal. And as I see it, if you DON'T like having fun - then this game isn't for you. But if you do like fun, then get it!\n\nhttp://freedomplanet.galaxytrail.com/\n\nAs a side note, when I first tried the demo I got addicted. Seriously. Multiple speed runs with Carol on the first level in the demo alone. Then, wishing there was more game after. Making the wait for the full version that much more painful. Luckily, you won't have to wait if you decide to get the full version.","July 22, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game includes some of the best level and boss design I've seen in a long while.\n\nThe voice acting is stunningly good, and while I think the cutscenes drag on a little too long in places, the story is entertaining and has the perfect "weight" to it for a game like this. Of course, if you think the perfect weight is no weight, you can play through on "Classic" with no cutscenes.\n\nA single playthrough ran me about 4 hours, but with 3 unique characters and the expansive, multi-tiered levels, there's probably enough content to keep me with this game for almost a full 20.\n\nMy one complaint is that, while most of the bosses are a well designed, statisfying challenge, the difficulty spikes dramatically on the final boss. For comparison, most of the mid/late game bosses took me 4-6 lives to figure out, but the final boss took 30.\n\nBut that's just one complaint. The game as a whole blew me away, and might just find itself up there amongst some of the older Sonic games as "something I can always come back to." Good design has staying power, after all.","July 24, 2014","true","21.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"too much" for some people who can't handle the DeviantArt vibe it gives off)\n\nI originally saw this game early on before it got greenlit and went "Mmmm, sonic clone"  But it is much more than that.  Although it isn't as brutal as games like sonic or megaman (or at least not since my last interaction with those games) but it seems to fit right in with the snes/sega genesis theme it has.\n\nBasically if you can handle Sonic the hedgehog mixed with Megaman, Mixed with driving motorcycles vertically up walls, meets Deviantart, get it.\n\nI can't emphasize how much I'm gonna replay this game purely to get the satisfaction of being able to one-life levels and bosses.

Fully voiced, options to either play the game as a story or just run through each level, and good pixel art set this game apart from many other platformers.\n\nThe Good:\n-Voice Acting for every cutscene\n-Wonderful Soundtrack\n-Tight Mechanics\n-Varied gameplay\n\nThe Ok:\n-Not very long, but you can still get about 15-20 hours out of it if you really want to get a majority of the game has to offer.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Plot requires you to fill in a few blanks and doesn't give any details. Does not ruin game, just leaves one confused.\n\nHonest Opinion:\nI loved this game. Coming off of Shante: Risky's Revenge right before playing this, I had concerns that I wouldn't be able to fully enjoy this game, as I've been really excited for it since I found it in Greenlight. Didn't need to though, because Freedom Planet was everything I expected and more. Truly kept me hooked from start to finish, and I've only played through the first two characters to play as. The developer says they may add more depending on how much intrest there is, which would be awesome. If you are looking for a solid platformer that plays like the old Sonic and Megaman game (based on who you play as) you won't find anything better in the store than this.","August 13, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Man, I don't know where to start, this game is so rad and has so much replay value.\n\nThe controls for the characters are extremely responsive, and it just feels nice to move around and attack enemies.\nEach character has unique abilities and some of the time different levels than others.\n\nThere are plenty of stages in game, and each of them offer a fresh new experience each time with amazing artwork to its style, fantastic OST and new types of enemies introduced each stage.\n\nThe majority of stages feature a mid-stage boss and an end level boss. As the stages go on, off course, the difficulty curve will increase. Although because of how well constructed the game is, dying constantly during a boss fight doesnt get frustrating. Infact, it makes it feel more satisfying defeating the boss due to them having unique patterns.\n\nEach stage has 10 cards to collect, and this increases the replay value greatly as you may revisit the stages and still come across some areas that you never visited before.\n\nIf you choose to play in adventure mode, you will have cutscenes explaining the story in great detail and each character shows off their personality very well, accompanied with excellent voice acting. However, some people may not like the cutscenes, so if you just want to skip that and get right into the stages, classic mode will bring it more to your taste. I personally enjoyed adventure mode anyways.\n\nEven playing back through old stages through time attack mode, I still thoroughly enjoyed defeating multiple enemies without getting hit on hard difficulty.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of platforming games and want a thrill with a compelling atmosphere, DO GET THIS GAME.

Raptor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Turboraptor/","259 products in account","I'll keep this brief, with the Cons then Pros.\n\nCons:\n\n-Cutscenes, while most offer story,  are long and some are a bit too frivolous.\n\n-Multiple Characters, but only one feels 'Good' while the others are gimmicky.\n\n-May leave you with a sense of wanting more.\n\n\nPretty short right?  Well, that's why I put them first, and why you don't see a 'No'.  Let's move on to the Pros, shall we?\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Yes, this is a Sonic the Hedgehog inspired game.  Not a carbon-copy.  They've taken the bits and pieces of mechanics, gameplay, level design and all that and then put that all into one package.  The end result is a game that will tickle your nostalgia if you're a fan for sure.  Even then, you don't need to have played sonic, or even know of its existence.\n\n-The Gameplay itself is fluid and fast-paced, to a point.  Sure you can speed through it, or you can take your time.  Maybe collect all the goodies to get that completionist feeling.  Plus, multiple game modes!  Time attack mode, 'Adventure' Mode for those that love story(Even with the long cutscenes), or just straight up 'Classic' mode.  As in, You beat a boss, onto the next stage.  No stopping.  Just gameplay.\n\n-The game, even with pixel graphics looks absolutely gorgeous.  From level design, enemy design, effects.  Whatever you look at is sure to catch your eye.\n\n-The soundtrack is equally as amazing as the art.  The kind that fits each stage through and through, and helps you appreciate both all at once.  Especially the boss music.  Oh man, if you ever loved some fitting boss tracks this game has some that'll please you.\n\n-Different Playable characters, while the other two besides the 'Main' character aren't that spectacular, offer multiple ways to explore the levels and dispose of your enemies.  On top of that, they have some pretty neat designs to boot!\n\n-The bosses are fantastic.  From the first to the last, I found myself loving every moment of the intense battles they offer.  Even if I died a ton on my first playthrough, almost every moment was as thrilling as the last.  Then there's that sweet sense of satisfaction when you finally beat it.  I don't remember how many times I threw my fist up in triumph.  It was probably a lot.\n\n-It's 15$.  Super cheap for what you're getting.\n\n\nAll in all, I have to say after playing through it once this has got to be one of the best platforming experiance I've had in a long time.  Forget whatever negative thoughts you may be having about it and just pick it up, especially if you read this far.  After all,  it took me just a few minutes of looking at all the positive reviews to decide to purchase the game.  They were right about it after all.  It's worth playing, and you should buy it.

Where should I begin...\n\n- The fluid movement and tight, responsive controls evocative of the best Genesis and Saturn-era sidescrollers?\n- The three unique gameplay experiences including the Sonic-speed brawler, the technical wall-climbing combatant, or the tactical and exploratory summoner?\n- The large and varied environments featuring excellent level design that match the pacing and abilites of each of the three protagonists' skills?\n- The gameplay gimmicks that completely transform each experience without being tacky or overbearing and bring about multiple ways to progress through any level?\n- The gorgeous and flowing sprite animations that cram detail and character into every pixel of screen space?\n- The varied enemies that change from level to level and have their own attack patterns and weaknesses, making no two zones even remotely similar?\n- The independent story paths that bring about unique levels and all interweave in a compelling story line?\n- The absolutely fantastic soundtrack that never fails to set the right tone and mood for any encounter, and never become repetitive?\n- The fully-voiced dialogue by, for the most part, well-matched and competent voice actors that give a proper charisma and personality to each character in the story?\n- The boatloads of easter eggs and subtle attentions to detail that keep the game lively from start to finish?\n- The compelling achievements and collectibles that make replaying the game desireable?\n\nI mean, honestly. I am at a loss. If Shovel Knight is the "Super NES" indie game of the year, then Freedom Planet is the "Super Genesis" (so, Sega 32X or Saturn!) indie game of the year.\n\nMy two biggest let-downs with this game have nothing to do with the game itself. It has to do with the fact that this game received nowhere near as much publicity as some other indie platformers this year, and the fear that prospective gamers will write it off as a "Sonic clone" without so much as a second thought and miss out on one of the greatest retro revivals this side of a Gunstar Heroes re-release.\n\nWith a free demo available on the developer's website, there's no reason anyone should skip over this without at least a sample.\n\nFreedom Planet took years to create.

I have had lots of fun with the game so far, and I'm really loving what it has to offer. The sprite animations are really well done, and there are a lot of them, making the characters have far more personality than I expected.\n\nI was expecting more of a Sonic clone based on how Lilac's levels appeared to play out during the video for this game, however; I got more than that. I feel the game combines elements of Sonic the Hedgehog and Rocket Knight, and while those comparisons are fair and easily made from a first impression, the longer the game goes on, you can see how the developers built off of those designs and were able to create their own unique personality with the game.\n\nThe voice acting itself is cheesy, and it may be hard for some to bear, but even this gives the game charm, and I can identify each character through their voices and traits. It is cheesy and over-the-top at times, but I've grown to love it. It's also nothing worse than you would encounter in any Sonic game.\n\nAlso, I want to make a nod towards the battle system. It's simple and fun, and it makes the boss battles in the game engaging and enjoyable. Some say the platforming is easy and the bosses are hard, and I just do not agree with this. The platforming isn't the hardest since you can fly through a level and not worry about falling to your death, but there are definitely some tricky parts in later stages. And bosses are mostly pattern memorizations. They do require timing and skill, but after taking the time to learn how their attacks play out, they are quite enjoyable to fight, and add even more to the game. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't see why boss fights being a challenge is a bad thing. Call me an old-timer or old-school gamer, but I like it when boss fights are a challenge, and they aren't just flashy set-pieces meant to be defeated in one life.\n\nI will say, one boss in particular reminded me of a fight from the game Mischief Makers back on the N64, and that only makes me love this game even more.\n\nTry out the demo if you're not sure. Look up some more reviews and videos on the game, but I am definitely not regretting my purchase.","July 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RymanNG/recommended/248310/","RymanNG","Rymante","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RymanNG/","384 products in account","Freedom Planet is the best Sega Mega Drive (or Sega Genesis depending on where you live) game released this year.\n\nOK so it isn't really a Mega Drive game, but it takes a lot of inspiration from notable games of that system (Sonic 1, 2 & 3, Gunstar Heroes, Rocket Knight Adventures to mention a few of the Mega Drive inspirations), the fact that the game also lists it button inputs in the menus as 'A' 'B' & 'C' helps with that impression too.\n\nWhat we have here is a 2D platform game rendered with high quality pixel art reminiscent of the 16-bit era of video games with a crazy amount of detailed sprite animation.  The level design is where the Mega Drive/Genesis Sonic inspiration is most felt.  The layouts aren't as sprawling & labyrinthine as the Sonic games but the later levels especially offer lots of different routes take to reach the end of each stage, stages which culminate in exciting & very challenging boss battles.\n\nIf you do not enjoy very difficult games or games which feature anthropomorphic, cutesy animal characters as the protagonists then maybe Freedom Planet is not for you, but the exciting boss battles, incredible soundtrack & surprisingly in-depth game mechanics with 3 very different characters to master (with more on the way) has me gushing praise for this game every chance I get.  At the very least there is a free demo available you can try first at http://freedomplanet.galaxytrail.com/","September 23, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Metalmacher/recommended/248310/","Metalmacher","Metalmacher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Metalmacher/","14 products in account","Ok... finally, after 109 deaths, 200 and something minutes... I've completed one playthrough with Lilac on Normal, and I've made up my mind on a few things regarding the game, thought'd I'd share a bit:\n\nWhat I LIKE about this game:\nIt's fast! So far I've only played with lilac, and even though you can't roll down a slope, her Dragon Boost makes up for it, more or less. Plus the level design encourages speed so that helps too.\n\nLevel design is superb, mostly. Lots of cool locales like a chinese setting or a shopping mall or fighting in the air, but it also has way too many "enemy base" style levels. Yeah, I get it, the levels are constricted to the plot, but come on... it gets boring after a while with those types of levels. Besides that though, all of the levels look great. I mean, the art is just fantastic. And there are really cool small details, like that bathroom in the mall, where you get kicked out if you enter the men's room. Oh, and of course, most importantly, all of the levels are HUGE, bigger than Sonic 3 and Knuckles I think, with tons of alternative paths.\nIt's a marvel, really, that they managed to make the levels so big and detailed, yet they received only so little from Kickstarter. It's in such a contrast to games like Mighty #9, which demands more money for less content. So high five is in order for the developers, for accomplishing that.\n\nBoss fights are the best part about the game. They are hard, but also simple, in a very hard way...  or is it hard in a simple way... anyway, each boss has it's own patterns which s/he cycles faithfully, allowing an experienced player to eventually be able to defeat them all without dying. But first timers are gonna have a rough time. These bosses require you to pay attention closely, and also force you to manage your resources (IE the special bar) carefully. They kicked my ♥♥♥... And I love it.\n\nYou don't get hit when touching an enemy WOOOOOO!! Thank you based GalaxyTrail!!\nNow, what I DIDN'T like: You can't roll. At least not with Lilac, maybe you can with the other characters. But for a game that mimics Sonic level design to a fault, it's quite criminal not giving us the ability to roll down a slope to gain speed, for the main character that is. You also can't spindash, instead Lilac has a move called Dragon Boost which uses the special bar to propel you in the direction your pressing. However the special bar has a relatively long recharge, so a lot of times you're going to find yourself just waiting and standing for the special bar to recharge. Now couple that with the fact that Lilac can't roll and the result is that she become as slow as Silver the Hedgehog from S06, until the bar finished recharging. It's so annoying that I have to go through with that, I HATE when a game forces me to slow down.... I'm the type of person who needs speed at all times, so when a game suddenly forces you to wait for the recharge bar, it just makes me so furious...\n\nThe story. Oh god the story. It is eye-rolling, facepalming, head turning, two super-sized pizzas with triple cheese and stuffed crust level of cheesy. It is Sonic-level cheesy. Don't play this game on Adventure mode unless you don't mind sonic-type stories.... Fortunately I didn't buy the game for the story, and it must be said that it's commendable for even putting a story in a platforming game to begin with! So hurrah!... But yeah, stay away from the story people....\n.... It is kind of sweet though...\n\nI'm gonna get flamed for this I'm sure.... Buuuuuut.... The music. I felt like it just wasn't memorable at all... It's very well made, and that's about it. Good music is the type of music that you hum after playing a game, the kind that has a hook, some sort of a main riff to it, but that's just not the case with the music here! I can't remember a single song, apart maybe from the main theme, maybe. It all just feels... serviceable. Of course, of course this is all subjective, and lots of people disagree with me, so take this opinion with a grain of salt, if you must. But yeah, I didn't like the music.\n\nVoice acting, it's... not that great. Again my opinion your opinion blablablaaa, but I'm not even gonna dwell on it. This isn't some triple A-budget type of game, where you have high profile voice actors and stuff. In fact, when compared to other platformers, it's actually pretty good. But that's not saying much. Voice acting is what you'd expect, basically.\nSo in conclusion, I wish it was a bit better in some areas, but regardless this is a very solid game! I'd recommend it, as others already have, to anyone who likes: Fast games, Sonic games or Platformers.  It is, however, NOT recommended for those looking for a platformer with a great story. Ye gonna have to keep searching for that one....\n\nNow, couple that with it's starting price of 15$, which goes way down during sales, and the fact that developer is promising FREE DLC and patches, you know you gonna get your money's worth. If you're a platforming fan, don't miss out on this game!\n\n\nUPDATE (21/7/2015) : I have reached Final Dreadnought 2 with Carol on hard, so far I have something like 100 deaths (jeez), I have a feeling that it is going to double, at the very least, by the time I'm finished with her story. I've had a rage quit moment a couple of hours ago but I've calmed now so I'll be jumping back into the fray in a few...\n\nAnyway, playing the game some more, I think I was too harsh on it, but I also didn't address my complaints correctly.\nFirst, Carol. I haven't played with Milla yet, but so far she is my favorite character. People say that she is harder to use than Lilac, but I beg to differ. It took me awhile to get used to her controls but once you do, Carol is revealed to be an extremely agile character who can dish out high DPS, with great maneuverability. She mostly avoids my grievances I've had with Lilac (Although I can't wait to come back to her, I want to master her as well XD ) and playing with her is a blast. Her set of skills are tailored perfectly to this game's level design, more so than Lilac's IMO.\n\nIn addition to that... The music is starting to grow on me. At first I didn't like it, as I've explained, but listening to some of the tracks a bit more, well, I can't deny that they are catchy... The chinese-themed levels especially, I love em. So reflecting retroactively on my criticisms, I've tried to understand what was it that I didn't like about the music in the beginning... And, well I don't really have an answer right now lol ^^; . Maybe it has to do with me dying a lot so I was frustrated, or maybe it's because there are too many "enemy base"-style levels in the game... I'm not really sure. I think it has to do with the stylistic variety of the songs, like, most of the songs give you the feeling of being in a high-speed rebel operation, ala Megaman Zero. Well, I probably started tuning out at some point because of that.\n\nHowever, as I've said, the tracks are growing on me. As I'm listening to the tracks I'm discovering their individual personalities, and their souls. Give me a week and I'll probably end up loving all of the tracks .\nAnd just for reference, platformers who's soundtracks I consider to be the best are: Sonic 2, Sonic Colors, DK2, DKTP and Jazz Jackrabbit 2.\n\nNow, the voice actors. They're fantastic. I've complained about them a bit, but I was wrong. Completely. Lots of the lines are executed well, but I still cringe a lot. However, I've come to realize that it's not their fault. It's the fault of the writers. In fact I'm now sure more than ever that if anyone deserves criticism for this game, it would be the writers. Why? Because they are responsible for the level variety, the soundtrack, and the lines of the characters.\n\nI want to say more, but I've reached character limit.

It's like Sonic 3, Rocket Knight and Gunstar Heroes all crammed into one game, and it's fun. Lots and lots of just plain fun.\n\nIt's a fast-paced platformer with responsive controls that feel amazing to play in impressive stages that encourage re-plays to fully explore. Difficulty is well planned; starting fairly easy and gradually getting very intense, with checkpoints generously enough placed that you won't lose much progress.\nThet art gorgeous and varied; so frequently in games pixel art is used as a budgetary or creative crutch, but not here. The megadrive graphics are a colourful globe-hopping adventure to a suitably chip-tuney soundtrack. Every setting is pulled off perfectly with lots of attention to details, it's just such a nice game to look at!\n\nYour mileage may vary, however, at the voice-acting and story. Some people might be put off by the cartoonish tone; cute fluffy critters saving the world from an evil alien emperor with the power of friendship is admittedly sugary as hell, but I thought it was endearing enough to work, even if the actual writing feels a bit doofy in places. You can of course just skip the cutscene stuff.\n\nIn all, most definitely not just a Sonic ripoff, but more a heartfelt love-letter to the classics of 90s Sega gaming as a whole. And sort of my entire gaming childhood condensed into one amazing game. Definitely worth a look!","June 12, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Which is not a bad thing. Firstly in my opinion it is better good copied than bad self made, and secondly in combination with all those elements it is unique enough to stand out in a positive way. It can stand on its own feet without having this feeling that it is just a rip off. Because it is not a rip off. I have never seen a game like this before in terms of its gameplay mechanics. But how does it play? Well, the soundtrack is addicting. Some of the tracks I have even looked up on Youtube just to listen to them again. Pixelated graphics are beautiful, smooth animation and you are noticing that the developers put alot of effort into it. The levels are ok. They are fun playing through, but you do not get the feeling that you want to replay them. You will only replay them if you want to speedrun it or you want to collect the collectibles. It also has a Story, which is nice to have but is not really appealing to me. I still could laugh a few times though. And the gameplay is pretty hard to explain in a few words. But I think saying that it is a mix between Castlevania, Sonic and Megaman would probably fit the best. One thing though that i have noticed really negative was the third playable character, Milla. Do not get me wrong, playing with her is fun! But she has no story mode. You hardly know anything from her. Which is just wasted potential.\n\nCocnlusion:This game to any fan of Sonic, Mario or Castlevania like games.\n\nRating: 8/10","March 2","true","25.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The general gist is to go to the right of course, but to get there you may have to go up, down, or even back on yourself occasionally.\n\nObstacles range from particularly tough enemies and minibosses to small puzzles or occasional disappearing platforms, chase sequences or timing obstacles which require you to use the moves available to you to get past them. There's even the classic "Push block onto button"... or in one case "push block onto ENEMY" if you want an easier way through one of them. You'll know it when you see it. There's even some clear inspiration from other Megadrive/Genesis classics like Gunstar Heroes and even a SHMUP level, which is a neat twist.\n\nIn terms of level design, it's incredibly well done. It even feels like a sonic game again; one done right in fact. I played as Lilac to start with, who pretty much plays like Sonic in every way - high speed, good jumping ability. The difference is that her attacks are done by button press, not just jumping on enemies. To counter this you don't necessarily automatically take damage from foes just by touching them, which is a welcome relief. The level design is complex without sacrificing mobility or high speed, and collecting enough crystals (of which there are usually several hundred dotted about on a level... enough that you can finish the game with a total count of over 8000 of them if you don't mind your time being ridiculously high) gives you extra lives. There are also extra lives dotted around here and there too.\n\nSprite work is fantastic, the characters are expressive and colourful, well detailed and quite well animated. There's some slightly amateurish, perhaps even lazy tricks used for their idle animations (removing a few pixels here and there to give the illusion of breathing/motion but it's kind of noticable because of how detailed and large the sprites are sadly), but everything else is rock solid and very nicely done.\n\nThe backgrounds is where the game can fall down a little unfortunately. The key part of the older 2d sonic games is that the backgrounds are detailed and colourble, but never to the point that moving through the levels at high speeds gets confusing or overwhelming, nor hides the enemies, NOR makes you feel like you're missing out on some great scenery by blitzing through it. It's a mistake that's made often on earlier and mid-game levels, but isn't such a huge deal on some of the endgame levels strangely enough. It does make the action kind of crazy though and you can get lost somewhat easily as a result, not react to enemies as quickly and also fall into some pittraps you weren't aware were actually holes.\n\nHOWEVER... I will give the game one huge credit. You will find early on you get plenty of lives: more than you need really. You'll have at least 20 by the time it starts getting really difficult, but I guarantee you'll start burning through them at a ridiculous rate on certain bosses. They are usually as fast as you, especially the smaller ones, so you'll have to have all your wits about you to make it through without losing lives... Here's the thing you. If you die, you go back to the nearest checkpoint, and said checkpoints are pretty fair. If you lose ALL your lives, you go to the gameover screen, but you can ALWAYS continue. You continue from the last checkpoint you were at, same as if you just lost a life, and you now have 5 more lives. So effectively you have infinite lives, but the gameover screen serves as a breather time for you to go '♥♥♥♥ I am getting frustrated, take a breath...chill... learn from my mistakes'; And it works! Furthermore some bosses have cutscenes. Did you die? Start again, but the cutscene is skipped almost entirely. Does the boss have multiple forms and you beat one of it's forms but then died? OKAY that's fine, start from THAT form, not the very start of the bossfight.\n\nMusic is... well I'm not going to say it's bad. It's well done and not grating, but it's nothing memorable or anything to write home about. You might find it more to your tastes perhaps, I personally didn't find it all that engaging, but it was understated enough that I didn't need to tweak the volume settings to not have to hear it, which was very nice. It was a nice background accompaniment and did nothing to detract from or spoil my enjoyment of the game, so props for that too.\n\nAs for story and all the nice little touches a game should have? This has it in spades. Comedy, action, drama, FEELS, so much of this. The story is pretty nice and it feels a little childish at times but it's definately not awful and it has a lot of charm. There's also some fantastic comedic moments that are unmissable. Don't skip those cutscenes unless you know you have watched them before! And you know what's even better? There are little secrets dotted around all over the game, going into bathrooms is a thing (for no reason whatsoever except maybe to dodge enemy fire for a brief moment), there are little hidden cards dotted around to collect (probably just for cheev hunting but hey whatever), neat little tricks to earn achievements (standing on a ledge to taunt a particular boss, or taking out another's shield before the battle even starts for example)...  And even a nicely hidden blooper reel for if you've played through the game before! Try holding down and C (or whatever button you have for special attack on your joypad with down) during cutscenes. Great fun!\n\nFinal issue though is the voice acting. Lilac's voice acting is largely on point, and especially during the more emotive scenes it's definately pretty good, but certain other characters (mostly the side ones) are rather hammy. In most cases that works great, but for the more serious side characters it's a little silly.\n\nSo yes despite the background causing issues and the music not being amazing, and the voice acting occasionally being sub-par, I would definately recommend this game. Lots of replayability, lots of charm, lots of fun!","July 17, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

After going through the game (as Lilac at least), it's probably one of my favorite games of all time as of now. The graphics and design of the game replicate many 16-bit platforms of the 90's, which is something I like, and is most notably similar to Sonic. However, it does have it's own original points, so don't exactly expect, say, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode III or Sonic 5.\n\nAnyway, I found the game to be rather great. The level design was good, I liked the characters, the music, pretty much everything about it. Although, the game does have a bit of challenge, especially in later levels, but that just adds on to the fun of the game.\n\nAnd the game isn't hard to run at all. While I usually use my desktop, this game actually runs (at around 60FPS in fact) on my Toshiba notebook from 2010 running Linux Mint, so I doubt you'll run into any optimization issues or anything.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game.

I didn't even know this game existed, let alone the amount of time it took for the developers to make this game! Now that I have my hands on this game, I can tell you that it might be one of the best 2D platformers of all time. Now, Shovel Knight deserves this honor as well, but it is nowhere near as fast paced as Freedom Planet! This game is an adrenaline rush of fun and excitement from start to finish!\n\nWith three differing playstyles from the three differing characters, you can play through this game in a myriad of ways. The levels are fairly large, and have multiple paths, allowing plenty of exploration. Secrets are everywhere, and there are tons of crystal shards to collect which are as addictive as coins or rings! You can also play other game modes, such as Time Attack or the "Target Minigame" included within that one.\n\nI never found a dull moment during these adventures either, there was always something to smile about during the surprisingly epic storyline (such as this avian guard who always lets out a quack at the end of a scene). The characters, although they appear as cute as can be, are butt kickers in every sense of the word, and don't get me started on "Lord Brevon"! The voice acting is mixed, but I loved it, and it had a lot of heart very much like the characters themselves. It was a pure JOY following the epic journey of Lilac and her friends to stop an evil alien overlord! It truly was!\n\nFreedom Planet's grand and varied adventure is a feast for the eyes or ears. The visuals remind me of a cross between a SNES game and a Sega Genesis game. The music is EXCELLENT! Absolutely memorable tunes are at every turn, with the "mid boss" and "major boss" tunes being some of my favorite tunes. With a soundtrack so incredible and fitting, you will be dancing in your seat as you play!\n\nThere really isn't much I can complain about, besides a few bugs. I am sure a few jerks are going to say this game is "way too girly" or "too cute". There also have been criticisms about this game being way too much like a Sonic game, but if anything it builds upon what made Sonic great AND more. You don't have to play Lilac if you think the game is too much like a Sonic game! If anything, the game feels like a loving homage to 90s gaming, with a story full of heart. It might be cheesy and corny, but it's full of heart.\n\nFreedom Planet, in a nutshell, is a fantastic little indie gem. It has way more value than it seems, and is an adventure worth embarking on over and over again.","July 24, 2014","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then theres Carol Tea, a wildcat who is best friends with Lilac, who uses kung fu and her motorcycle to help along the way.\n\nI played a sonic game after an hour of this, and found my hands on my game controller helping save Avalice instead, how do I say this... Sonic games just seek to make you rush through the stage to stop Eggman all the time, and titles today like Sonic Boom just make my head go numb and- ...what was I saying?\n\nThe levels have proof in themselves that they were carefully made well, maybe a glitch or 2 here and there, but you can't notice them UNLESS your trying to break the game. Another thing thats made well? Idle animation, 5 per character, just try it!\n\nOverall, i'll update this review again later, but I give this game 100/10, has that story you wish could go on and on, but sadly has to end at one point. A demo of this game is available at the time of this review, its really fun, I myself have roped 12 friends into the Freedom Planet hype.\n\nFinal bit is this, keyboard controls are fine, but ill save that for one of Telltale Games... games. so use the keyboard, or controller via usb, like an Xbox One controller, and if use that, the controller will install the drivers for you, so you can use big picture for this game in no time.\n\nI hope you all try this game, its coming to Wii U too! This review will be updated after the next update... MAYBE.","March 6, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The level design is where the Mega Drive/Genesis Sonic inspiration is most felt.  The layouts aren't as sprawling & labyrinthine as the Sonic games but the later levels especially offer lots of different routes take to reach the end of each stage, stages which culminate in exciting & very challenging boss battles.\n\nIf you do not enjoy very difficult games or games which feature anthropomorphic, cutesy animal characters as the protagonists then maybe Freedom Planet is not for you, but the exciting boss battles, incredible soundtrack & surprisingly in-depth game mechanics with 3 very different characters to master (with more on the way) has me gushing praise for this game every chance I get.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Metalmacher/recommended/248310/","Metalmacher","Metalmacher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Metalmacher/","14 products in account","Ok... finally, after 109 deaths, 200 and something minutes... I've completed one playthrough with Lilac on Normal, and I've made up my mind on a few things regarding the game, thought'd I'd share a bit:\n\nWhat I LIKE about this game:\nIt's fast! So far I've only played with lilac, and even though you can't roll down a slope, her Dragon Boost makes up for it, more or less. Plus the level design encourages speed so that helps too.\n\nLevel design is superb, mostly. Lots of cool locales like a chinese setting or a shopping mall or fighting in the air, but it also has way too many "enemy base" style levels. Yeah, I get it, the levels are constricted to the plot, but come on... it gets boring after a while with those types of levels. Besides that though, all of the levels look great. I mean, the art is just fantastic. And there are really cool small details, like that bathroom in the mall, where you get kicked out if you enter the men's room. Oh, and of course, most importantly, all of the levels are HUGE, bigger than Sonic 3 and Knuckles I think, with tons of alternative paths.\nIt's a marvel, really, that they managed to make the levels so big and detailed, yet they received only so little from Kickstarter. It's in such a contrast to games like Mighty #9, which demands more money for less content. So high five is in order for the developers, for accomplishing that.\n\nBoss fights are the best part about the game. They are hard, but also simple, in a very hard way...  or is it hard in a simple way... anyway, each boss has it's own patterns which s/he cycles faithfully, allowing an experienced player to eventually be able to defeat them all without dying. But first timers are gonna have a rough time. These bosses require you to pay attention closely, and also force you to manage your resources (IE the special bar) carefully. They kicked my ♥♥♥... And I love it.\n\nYou don't get hit when touching an enemy WOOOOOO!! Thank you based GalaxyTrail!!\nNow, what I DIDN'T like: You can't roll. At least not with Lilac, maybe you can with the other characters. But for a game that mimics Sonic level design to a fault, it's quite criminal not giving us the ability to roll down a slope to gain speed, for the main character that is. You also can't spindash, instead Lilac has a move called Dragon Boost which uses the special bar to propel you in the direction your pressing. However the special bar has a relatively long recharge, so a lot of times you're going to find yourself just waiting and standing for the special bar to recharge. Now couple that with the fact that Lilac can't roll and the result is that she become as slow as Silver the Hedgehog from S06, until the bar finished recharging. It's so annoying that I have to go through with that, I HATE when a game forces me to slow down.... I'm the type of person who needs speed at all times, so when a game suddenly forces you to wait for the recharge bar, it just makes me so furious...\n\nThe story. Oh god the story. It is eye-rolling, facepalming, head turning, two super-sized pizzas with triple cheese and stuffed crust level of cheesy. It is Sonic-level cheesy. Don't play this game on Adventure mode unless you don't mind sonic-type stories.... Fortunately I didn't buy the game for the story, and it must be said that it's commendable for even putting a story in a platforming game to begin with! So hurrah!... But yeah, stay away from the story people....\n.... It is kind of sweet though...\n\nI'm gonna get flamed for this I'm sure.... Buuuuuut.... The music. I felt like it just wasn't memorable at all... It's very well made, and that's about it. Good music is the type of music that you hum after playing a game, the kind that has a hook, some sort of a main riff to it, but that's just not the case with the music here! I can't remember a single song, apart maybe from the main theme, maybe. It all just feels... serviceable. Of course, of course this is all subjective, and lots of people disagree with me, so take this opinion with a grain of salt, if you must. But yeah, I didn't like the music.\n\nVoice acting, it's... not that great. Again my opinion your opinion blablablaaa, but I'm not even gonna dwell on it. This isn't some triple A-budget type of game, where you have high profile voice actors and stuff. In fact, when compared to other platformers, it's actually pretty good. But that's not saying much. Voice acting is what you'd expect, basically.\nSo in conclusion, I wish it was a bit better in some areas, but regardless this is a very solid game! I'd recommend it, as others already have, to anyone who likes: Fast games, Sonic games or Platformers.  It is, however, NOT recommended for those looking for a platformer with a great story. Ye gonna have to keep searching for that one....\n\nNow, couple that with it's starting price of 15$, which goes way down during sales, and the fact that developer is promising FREE DLC and patches, you know you gonna get your money's worth. If you're a platforming fan, don't miss out on this game!\n\n\nUPDATE (21/7/2015) : I have reached Final Dreadnought 2 with Carol on hard, so far I have something like 100 deaths (jeez), I have a feeling that it is going to double, at the very least, by the time I'm finished with her story. I've had a rage quit moment a couple of hours ago but I've calmed now so I'll be jumping back into the fray in a few...\n\nAnyway, playing the game some more, I think I was too harsh on it, but I also didn't address my complaints correctly.\nFirst, Carol. I haven't played with Milla yet, but so far she is my favorite character. People say that she is harder to use than Lilac, but I beg to differ. It took me awhile to get used to her controls but once you do, Carol is revealed to be an extremely agile character who can dish out high DPS, with great maneuverability. She mostly avoids my grievances I've had with Lilac (Although I can't wait to come back to her, I want to master her as well XD ) and playing with her is a blast. Her set of skills are tailored perfectly to this game's level design, more so than Lilac's IMO.\n\nIn addition to that... The music is starting to grow on me. At first I didn't like it, as I've explained, but listening to some of the tracks a bit more, well, I can't deny that they are catchy... The chinese-themed levels especially, I love em. So reflecting retroactively on my criticisms, I've tried to understand what was it that I didn't like about the music in the beginning... And, well I don't really have an answer right now lol ^^; . Maybe it has to do with me dying a lot so I was frustrated, or maybe it's because there are too many "enemy base"-style levels in the game... I'm not really sure. I think it has to do with the stylistic variety of the songs, like, most of the songs give you the feeling of being in a high-speed rebel operation, ala Megaman Zero. Well, I probably started tuning out at some point because of that.\n\nHowever, as I've said, the tracks are growing on me. As I'm listening to the tracks I'm discovering their individual personalities, and their souls. Give me a week and I'll probably end up loving all of the tracks .\nAnd just for reference, platformers who's soundtracks I consider to be the best are: Sonic 2, Sonic Colors, DK2, DKTP and Jazz Jackrabbit 2.\n\nNow, the voice actors. They're fantastic. I've complained about them a bit, but I was wrong. Completely. Lots of the lines are executed well, but I still cringe a lot. However, I've come to realize that it's not their fault. It's the fault of the writers. In fact I'm now sure more than ever that if anyone deserves criticism for this game, it would be the writers. Why? Because they are responsible for the level variety, the soundtrack, and the lines of the characters.\n\nI want to say more, but I've reached character limit.

It's like Sonic 3, Rocket Knight and Gunstar Heroes all crammed into one game, and it's fun. Lots and lots of just plain fun.\n\nIt's a fast-paced platformer with responsive controls that feel amazing to play in impressive stages that encourage re-plays to fully explore. Difficulty is well planned; starting fairly easy and gradually getting very intense, with checkpoints generously enough placed that you won't lose much progress.\nThet art gorgeous and varied; so frequently in games pixel art is used as a budgetary or creative crutch, but not here. The megadrive graphics are a colourful globe-hopping adventure to a suitably chip-tuney soundtrack. Every setting is pulled off perfectly with lots of attention to details, it's just such a nice game to look at!\n\nYour mileage may vary, however, at the voice-acting and story. Some people might be put off by the cartoonish tone; cute fluffy critters saving the world from an evil alien emperor with the power of friendship is admittedly sugary as hell, but I thought it was endearing enough to work, even if the actual writing feels a bit doofy in places. You can of course just skip the cutscene stuff.\n\nIn all, most definitely not just a Sonic ripoff, but more a heartfelt love-letter to the classics of 90s Sega gaming as a whole. And sort of my entire gaming childhood condensed into one amazing game. Definitely worth a look!","June 12, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After going through the game (as Lilac at least), it's probably one of my favorite games of all time as of now. The graphics and design of the game replicate many 16-bit platforms of the 90's, which is something I like, and is most notably similar to Sonic. However, it does have it's own original points, so don't exactly expect, say, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode III or Sonic 5.\n\nAnyway, I found the game to be rather great. The level design was good, I liked the characters, the music, pretty much everything about it. Although, the game does have a bit of challenge, especially in later levels, but that just adds on to the fun of the game.\n\nAnd the game isn't hard to run at all. While I usually use my desktop, this game actually runs (at around 60FPS in fact) on my Toshiba notebook from 2010 running Linux Mint, so I doubt you'll run into any optimization issues or anything.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. Whether you're a fan of retro games or just want a good platformer, this game is rather fun.

It originally start off as a Sonic fan game, but the creator and the developers decided to change the game completely and have it's own unique identity which is pretty original and fresh again. A throwback to the classic Sonic series, Megaman series, Gunstar Heroes, Sparkster, and Rinstar which is a huge combination of them.\n\nFreedom Planet will make you fall in love in them again, this lovely action platformer features a interesting cast of characters and this time the main heroes are female than the usual male. The characters for the story can grow on you, despite some people say about the voice acting and dialogue. Actually, it is not really bad and has a charm to it which makes the game a gem. This game has a phenomenal great soundtrack that is catchy and something you can't get enough from. Another thing is Freedom Planet could have been on PlayStation 1 and Sega Saturn back in 1998 or 1999! Since, it is huge nod to Japanese import titles of that time. With full voice acting, beautiful graphics, unique sounds, and a decent storyline. This game is not to be missed if you love Sonic and other action platforming games of old. So, buy this game today and be glad there are people who do it for the art instead of profit numbers.\n\nSupport Freedom Planet and free the planet!\n\nLilac, Carol, and Milla will be happy to assist you if you're a outworlder or an alien who needs help of moving foward to the mission on their planet Avalice.","January 31, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The general gist is to go to the right of course, but to get there you may have to go up, down, or even back on yourself occasionally.\n\nObstacles range from particularly tough enemies and minibosses to small puzzles or occasional disappearing platforms, chase sequences or timing obstacles which require you to use the moves available to you to get past them. There's even the classic "Push block onto button"... or in one case "push block onto ENEMY" if you want an easier way through one of them. You'll know it when you see it. There's even some clear inspiration from other Megadrive/Genesis classics like Gunstar Heroes and even a SHMUP level, which is a neat twist.\n\nIn terms of level design, it's incredibly well done. It even feels like a sonic game again; one done right in fact. I played as Lilac to start with, who pretty much plays like Sonic in every way - high speed, good jumping ability. The difference is that her attacks are done by button press, not just jumping on enemies. To counter this you don't necessarily automatically take damage from foes just by touching them, which is a welcome relief. The level design is complex without sacrificing mobility or high speed, and collecting enough crystals (of which there are usually several hundred dotted about on a level... enough that you can finish the game with a total count of over 8000 of them if you don't mind your time being ridiculously high) gives you extra lives. There are also extra lives dotted around here and there too.\n\nSprite work is fantastic, the characters are expressive and colourful, well detailed and quite well animated. There's some slightly amateurish, perhaps even lazy tricks used for their idle animations (removing a few pixels here and there to give the illusion of breathing/motion but it's kind of noticable because of how detailed and large the sprites are sadly), but everything else is rock solid and very nicely done.\n\nThe backgrounds is where the game can fall down a little unfortunately. The key part of the older 2d sonic games is that the backgrounds are detailed and colourble, but never to the point that moving through the levels at high speeds gets confusing or overwhelming, nor hides the enemies, NOR makes you feel like you're missing out on some great scenery by blitzing through it. It's a mistake that's made often on earlier and mid-game levels, but isn't such a huge deal on some of the endgame levels strangely enough. It does make the action kind of crazy though and you can get lost somewhat easily as a result, not react to enemies as quickly and also fall into some pittraps you weren't aware were actually holes.\n\nHOWEVER... I will give the game one huge credit. You will find early on you get plenty of lives: more than you need really. You'll have at least 20 by the time it starts getting really difficult, but I guarantee you'll start burning through them at a ridiculous rate on certain bosses. They are usually as fast as you, especially the smaller ones, so you'll have to have all your wits about you to make it through without losing lives... Here's the thing you. If you die, you go back to the nearest checkpoint, and said checkpoints are pretty fair. If you lose ALL your lives, you go to the gameover screen, but you can ALWAYS continue. You continue from the last checkpoint you were at, same as if you just lost a life, and you now have 5 more lives. So effectively you have infinite lives, but the gameover screen serves as a breather time for you to go '♥♥♥♥ I am getting frustrated, take a breath...chill... learn from my mistakes'; And it works! Furthermore some bosses have cutscenes. Did you die? Start again, but the cutscene is skipped almost entirely. Does the boss have multiple forms and you beat one of it's forms but then died? OKAY that's fine, start from THAT form, not the very start of the bossfight.\n\nMusic is... well I'm not going to say it's bad. It's well done and not grating, but it's nothing memorable or anything to write home about. You might find it more to your tastes perhaps, I personally didn't find it all that engaging, but it was understated enough that I didn't need to tweak the volume settings to not have to hear it, which was very nice. It was a nice background accompaniment and did nothing to detract from or spoil my enjoyment of the game, so props for that too.\n\nAs for story and all the nice little touches a game should have? This has it in spades. Comedy, action, drama, FEELS, so much of this. The story is pretty nice and it feels a little childish at times but it's definately not awful and it has a lot of charm. There's also some fantastic comedic moments that are unmissable. Don't skip those cutscenes unless you know you have watched them before! And you know what's even better? There are little secrets dotted around all over the game, going into bathrooms is a thing (for no reason whatsoever except maybe to dodge enemy fire for a brief moment), there are little hidden cards dotted around to collect (probably just for cheev hunting but hey whatever), neat little tricks to earn achievements (standing on a ledge to taunt a particular boss, or taking out another's shield before the battle even starts for example)...  And even a nicely hidden blooper reel for if you've played through the game before! Try holding down and C (or whatever button you have for special attack on your joypad with down) during cutscenes. Great fun!\n\nFinal issue though is the voice acting. Lilac's voice acting is largely on point, and especially during the more emotive scenes it's definately pretty good, but certain other characters (mostly the side ones) are rather hammy. In most cases that works great, but for the more serious side characters it's a little silly.\n\nSo yes despite the background causing issues and the music not being amazing, and the voice acting occasionally being sub-par, I would definately recommend this game. Lots of replayability, lots of charm, lots of fun!","July 17, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Which is not a bad thing. Firstly in my opinion it is better good copied than bad self made, and secondly in combination with all those elements it is unique enough to stand out in a positive way. It can stand on its own feet without having this feeling that it is just a rip off. Because it is not a rip off. I have never seen a game like this before in terms of its gameplay mechanics. But how does it play? Well, the soundtrack is addicting. Some of the tracks I have even looked up on Youtube just to listen to them again. Pixelated graphics are beautiful, smooth animation and you are noticing that the developers put alot of effort into it. The levels are ok. They are fun playing through, but you do not get the feeling that you want to replay them. You will only replay them if you want to speedrun it or you want to collect the collectibles. It also has a Story, which is nice to have but is not really appealing to me. I still could laugh a few times though. And the gameplay is pretty hard to explain in a few words. But I think saying that it is a mix between Castlevania, Sonic and Megaman would probably fit the best. One thing though that i have noticed really negative was the third playable character, Milla. Do not get me wrong, playing with her is fun! But she has no story mode. You hardly know anything from her. Which is just wasted potential.\n\nCocnlusion:This game to any fan of Sonic, Mario or Castlevania like games.\n\nRating: 8/10","March 2","true","25.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As well as Rocket Knight? How about Gunstar Heroes? And maybe a pinch of Megaman X? If you said yes to all of those, you'll love Freedom Planet.\n\nFreedom Planet is an indie platformer that is heavily inspired by the days of Genesis/Mega Drive platformers, in much the same way Shovel Knight takes its cues from the 8-bit NES games of old. You play as either Lilac, Carol or Milla through several stages, each taking as long as 20 minutes to beat and with both a mid-point mini boss and end-stage boss in most of them. If you plan to play through the game more than once, you should pick the "Adventure Mode" to see the stories of Lilac and Carol unfold. They're mostly the same, but there will be key differences and even different stage orders as a result of the unfolding events.\n\nMilla, the third character, is also playable, but at the time of writing this review she's only available in "Classic" mode, so you don't get to learn more about her until a later update, which I am probably going to wait for as I've just went through Adventure Mode with the other two characters.\n\nI was surprised to learn the game has a lot of voice acting in the cutscenes. Not just that, but a lot of them are actually pretty good. A couple of characters will come off sounding corny or cheesey, but very little of it is actually bad voice acting, and I was getting a very Saturday Morning cartoon vibe from it.\n\nHowever, the cutscenes themselves, while adding to the overall plot and enjoyment, can feel a like they drag on just a little too long. After completing a stage you might have to watch up to 10 minutes of cutscenes, including voice acting, before you can proceed to the next part of gameplay. This is a problem if you want to get all the story but not skip over any of the key points, however for those that do not really care, you can freely skip over the cutscenes or just play Classic Mode to get minimal interruption.\n\nMy only other complaint is the seemingly pointless addition of lives and continues. Traditionally in a game inspired from platformers of older generations, when you lose all your lives, you have the option to continue, but you will lose your current checkpoint and be put back to the beginning of the stage. This game, for as many opportunities as it provides to grab extra lives, doesn't punish you in such a way if you lose them all. Even on Hard difficulty you can eventually beat the game as you will always be at the most recent checkpoint you crossed no matter how many Game Overs you get, even against the final boss, which in itself triggers a checkpoint at the beginning of each new phase.\n\nIssues aside, I had a lot of fun with Freedom Planet, and it really makes me wish that more people would make Genesis-style platformer games, especially if they have as much polish as this.","January 19, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It originally start off as a Sonic fan game, but the creator and the developers decided to change the game completely and have it's own unique identity which is pretty original and fresh again. A throwback to the classic Sonic series, Megaman series, Gunstar Heroes, Sparkster, and Rinstar which is a huge combination of them.\n\nFreedom Planet will make you fall in love in them again, this lovely action platformer features a interesting cast of characters and this time the main heroes are female than the usual male. The characters for the story can grow on you, despite some people say about the voice acting and dialogue. Actually, it is not really bad and has a charm to it which makes the game a gem. This game has a phenomenal great soundtrack that is catchy and something you can't get enough from. Another thing is Freedom Planet could have been on PlayStation 1 and Sega Saturn back in 1998 or 1999! Since, it is huge nod to Japanese import titles of that time. With full voice acting, beautiful graphics, unique sounds, and a decent storyline. This game is not to be missed if you love Sonic and other action platforming games of old. So, buy this game today and be glad there are people who do it for the art instead of profit numbers.\n\nSupport Freedom Planet and free the planet!\n\nLilac, Carol, and Milla will be happy to assist you if you're a outworlder or an alien who needs help of moving foward to the mission on their planet Avalice.","January 31, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The whimsical character design that reminds you of the old mascot wars, the level design that makes you want to master each stage, the... somewhat haphazard plot to tie the stages together.\n\nThe one thing about Freedom Planet that lets it down is really the plot. It's solid in the aspect that it makes sense, and it feels like a lot of time was spent trying to make it feel important. Problem is, it really doesn't. Some of the stages tie in brilliantly, while others feel tacked in. All of them play smoothly though.\n\nThe game AS a game is planned out and designed well, with only a few instances where you will have to stop and think about where you're going. This, I believe, was an attempt at keeping it seperate from the series it pays homage to, Sonic, but it can really slow down the action.\nFor example, in the second stage, Relic Maze, there is a section where you need to open two doors to progress. In doing this you must take two paths, one above and one below, and find a switch in each to open the door. These, however, are the slowest part of the level, and seem to be designed to actually do this. They incorporate small switch puzzles, which seems like a good idea, but were laid out a bit haphazardly, meaning if you miss something you'll end up in the same area, walking around in circles pressing buttons for a couple of minutes. As a game that encourages speed (especially in its achievements) this seems a bit tacked on.\n\nReally, these moments are few and very far between, and aside from a few difficult boss fights, is a solid game. The breaks from the constant Sonic-esque gameplay were welcomed, however, espescially when they were done well. There's an amazing arcade-like tank section that has to be played to be truely enjoyed, which is an example of such an instance.\n\nThe oddest inclusion that sets this game apart from every other Sonic love letter is it's two dedicated attack buttons. This is an interesting mechanic, espescially due to how it is handled. Your basic attack will almost always halve your momentum in air, while slowing it even more substantially when used on the ground. However, despite this seeming like a conflict of interest as far as the genre is concerned, it had a decent implementation mostly due to the enemy placement. Enemies will either be in 'slow spots' of a level, where you need to really look at your surroundings to continue, giving you something to do while you think OR they will have such a slow attack that you can run past them without being worried. The times the game does give you fast enemies in a fast section of the game are much later in, when the game is naturally getting harder.\n\nThis game just feels right, for the most part at least, and is really worth your while if you liked the old momentum-based Sonic games. It's not just a clone, though, and even if you're into the more traditional style of platformer it's definitely worth a look at. It does have its flaws, and this review will never do it true justice, but I really quite like this game and I come back to it occasionally just to realise it again.","April 14","true","22.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Mixes a lot of the classic playstyles, with some newer touches like VA and plentyful powerups. (that granted, you will have 0 idea what most of them actually does) So yeah, it's a great mix of old and new. It also attemps to tell a more mature story, both for good and bad. As it has some characers and moves that feels more at home in a more "casual" story. Yet, it does said story rather well. So it's a give and take. It doesn't always manage to flip-flop between "srs bsns" and "roflmao" tones. I could probably have worded that better, but eh... I did love some of the running gags, but as said. It was hard to get a decent emotional shift in.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's a healthy mix of "gotta go fast" and faffing about exploring. Certain characters pander more to certain styles. So there sould be something for everyone. (that are into platforming ofc) There are some bugs and glitches, but it's mostly clipping errors. I've yet to find anything that forced a restart or anything like that.\n\nSo it's very solid in it's structure. Something I would say is the weak parts of the game, is that it heavily relies exclusively on memorization. And I know some like that, but to me, that's just a crutch to pad out gameplay. Especially at some parts with incredibly cheap traps. Or bosses with bs, 3 hit moves, that can only be dodged by using your special attack, as it makes you momentarily invurnable. So it is impossible to kinda stroll in and clear several of the bosses on your first try. As you can't without having done them before, due to said prior attacks. You need to know them beforehand, else you just get instantly killed by the unavoidable attacks, that has to be negated with a timed invurnability. Might not be a problem to some, but I found it to be one of the frustrations in the game. Even if some of the bosses are literally just unfair, (and that can be a good thing) they are unfair in a bad way, so to speak. Both due to as said that you gotta memorize the moves, but some moves are just a tad bit too cheap (and often off screen).  So be prepared to have some cheap part of a level, or a boss rack up a number of kills, or K:O's on you.\n\nGraphics are a nice retro mix. Though even there it has some contracitory tones. Like, one of the characters has to me, one of the most hilarious "hanging" animations in any pixel game to date. Which, to me at least, felt a little off in the more serious sections of the game. If there's something I think could have been a nice touch (and might be in FP2) is if the character you played got "roughed up" so to speak. Like, at low health, they looked a bit battered and bruised. As, again; with the tone. It just feels a bit odd aestetics wise when the character has 0 hp left, and stands around as if nothing is wrong. Would also have loved if you could on rare ocassions trigger a sort of "last stand" to use a cliché term. Like, instead of dying (either by slumping over, or exploding in a ball off fluff. Have to just say I love how they chose to do the two death animations in this game xP I've missed the cartoony aspects of this style of games) get a timer like the one where you are drowning. Maybe tint/dim the screen a bit, and possibly slow down the character some, and give a chance to grab a health item before the timer runs out, and the character faints. (or it could be a 100 % thing to happen for a specific character. Kinda like the character from Metal Slug that can take 2 shots before dying) I dunno, I think it'd really fit the whole "against all odds" the game is going with. Just feel it'd be neat with some "shiz just got real" indicator. Right now all that happens is that the health bar blinks a little.\n\nThough, I know such thing would add a lot extra sprites. But yeah, would at least imo be a really worthwhile addition. I haven't finished the game with all character on all difficulties yet, but even with just one character, I pretty much got my money's worth. One thing I was a bit "eh..." towards is how the replayability is handled. In that it's mostly "multi-path", so if you make one wrong turn, or at times: one of the two turns, you cannot go back. So, again: it relies on you memorizing. Which as said: To me ruins some of the whole "adventure" feel. You can't get everything in one run, you can't beat bosses the first time around. You succeed only thanks to being a magical time traveler. While I could be sorta okay with having to re-run, or at least grab the stuff with other characters, (that's totally acceptable) I do greatly dislike how I can't charge in, hypotetical guns blazing to a boss, and outwit and beat them through skill. Rather having to do a tideious grind in order to figure out their pattern and moveset.\n\nStill, I really like the game. It's solid, has good character and gameplay. It's what you expect, with some twists and turns.","February 28","true","40.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

There are hidden items scattered around the levels: cards. Not to be confused with Steam cards (though they are activated for this game), they are essentially just collectables that say "HAH, I EXPLORED".\n\nThe grapics are a great throwback, and even remain in the Sonic style/spirit. The music and sounds are wonderful and fulfill my craving of chip type things. The level layouts are pretty neat, and while some of them have a couple gimmicks, think of them in the light of something like Sonic 3: yeah they are there, but they aren't going to be relevant in pretty much any situation outside of the one you're in right then.\n\nThe only big gripe I have with the game is the engine used for the characters' movement. Long story short, you can slug your way up a wall (vertically) with no momentum. Without a proper momentum style set, the game can feel a bit too slow for the type of game it is, but it doesn't really get in the way (see: my biggest gripe, and it's still good).\n\nThis is the teams first game, so any issues I see as forgivable. You will be thoroughly impressed all things considered (if you are either into furry business or platformers), and this gives me confidence that their next game is going to blow Sega's dangly parts out of the water.\n\nAs of this review (July 22nd, 2014) there are a few things that feel unfinished, but note that the developers are looking to add more and more content to the game. Double-edged sword here, as while I wish upon you kind folks to purchase this spectacle to speed development up and of course for your joy, I would say that if you aren't tolerant of a few missing things, MAYBE wait for a sale on it (or until they get this new content out, whichever comes first), but in the meantime, I'm going to just go hammer away at this and get everything done that I can.\n\nI'd give this game as it is a 7.5/10, which I'm hoping to raise to an 8.5/10 once the new content comes out, but who knows: could be higher.","July 22, 2014","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I was so wrong. Freedom planet make look like "Deviantart the Game" on the outside, but once you get into it, it's alot of fun.\n\nThe controls can be a bit loose sometimes, but overall there aren't many major problems there. The gameplay is incredibly reminiscent of many Sega classics such as Ristar, Rocket Knight and , of course, Sonic the Hedgehog. Rather than jumping on your foes to kill and damage them, characters have a variety of punches, kicks and dashes to deal damage up close.\n\nFans of Treasure games (Gunstar heroes, most notably) might feel right at home with many of the visuals in Freedom Planet. In fact, there's even a boss that i'm certain is a reference to Gunstar Heroes itself. The art is incredibly well done and has alot of personality to it, with great care being taken in making the levels and backgrounds look very pleasing. Some of the characters seem a bit off at times, but nothing glaring.\n\nAudio-wise, the soundtrack is amazing. It's incredibly similar to many sega classics and, to quote an actual reviewer, feels incredibly "video game-y". For a videogame, that's good of course. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Yes, there are voice acted cutscenes. If that's not your bag, they've even added a "Classic" mode that's just the gameplay! The voices range from "I hope this guy got more work after this" to "Hilarious".\n\nAll in all, if you enjoyed classic Sega platformers and can get past the whole "these look like sonic fancharacters" shell, you'll find a fun game with a goofy saturday morning cartoon-like story loosely tying it together.\n\nAfter all, it could've been worse. It was gonna be a sonic fangame.","October 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/msvanessab/recommended/248310/","msvanessab","PleasantlyTwstd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/msvanessab/","68 products in account","So, after careful considration, I'm going to review Freedom Planet and hopefully not sound like a huge fan girl or dweeb.\n\nPros:  Holy ♥♥♥♥.  Freedom Planet.\n\nI refer to it as 'Sonic Cat' to almost everyone, because it takes the speed and level design nods straight from Sonic the Hedgehog (a little Google search will point you to the origins of FP, which was a Sonic-based fan game), with the attacks and beat-up stylization of many platformers of the 90s-as a dragon or a cat.  You move fast, you act fast, you can chain and cancel attacks with finesse.  It takes some getting used to-but what Sonic game didn't?  I've played as all three characters.  Lilac is hands down the best to run with-her speed isn't over the top despite being the fastest, her move set has a fantastic flow, and doesn't devolve to 'cheesy' or 'cheap' at any point.\n\nThe voice acting is actually pretty solid, and varied, as though they took some considerable time with it.\n\nDifficulty curve is pretty standard:  early levels are great for getting used to controls, exploring, feeling out which character is best for you (Lilac is my personal favorite), complete with vivid color schemes, great soundtrack that reflects the level dynamic and game length, and increases accordingly.  Boss fights are REALLY unique.  The RoboPanther looks like a big bad straight out of MegaMan, and the entire fight scene is packed with action (and you genuinely get to particiapte!).  You'll find this true with many of the boss fights overall.\n\nThe soundtrack leaves you feeling good, or in the later levels, determined to win.  Tunes are elegant, quirky, jazzy, and fulfilling like all of your favorite 8 and 16 bit gemstones.  Seriously, listen to it in your car on the way to work-it's a great ride!\n\nCons:  The story is pretty cliche, very meh at best.  It's an oddity.  However, it's still stomachable.\n\nBalance between characters is almost not there.  It's difficult to switch from Lilac to Carol to Millia, as they all have their own unique skills, but none match Lilac's even a little.  Carol has fantastic mobility, but at the cost of no double jump and lower damage ratio, and Millia is a classic glass cannon:  low health, slowest movement, can't double jump BUT does float, and hits like a truck.  Certain bosses on Lilac can be a breeze while Millia and Carol struggle slightly.\n\nThe difficulty curve, while a true curve, gets a little stupid toward the end.  Enemies make returns and gang up on you pretty bad, while still introducing new ones, and boss battles get closer to insane with each passing level.  The fourth to last boss, for example, everyone has to fight across their respective storyline...but if you aren't careful on Lilac, or worse aren't playing her, there are moves that can cover the entire screen that you can't avoid and just eats your health.  It can get frustrating.\n\nThat said, I've beat the game with Lilac, am in the final stages with Carol, and on the third to last stage with Millia.  It's doable-but it will test your patience.\n\nOverall:  snag this game.  It's a great ride through nostalgia land with new faces, great music, fun gameplay, and replayability Sonic hasn't seen since Sonic and Knuckles.  You won't be disappointed.","September 22, 2015","true","21.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But while it's clear that those games did provide a lot of inspiration for this one, such a dismissal is a disservice to an excellent piece of entertainment.  While its level layouts, character designs, and gameplay definitely take cues from Sonic, Freedom Planet is its own game.  It's less about speed and more about exploration, control, and combat, a game that rewards observation and thinking in addition to quick reflexes.\n\nThe game's bosses deserve special mention.  While the first few are fairly simple fights that one can clear without much effort, the latter half of the game features some genuinely challenging fights that require speedy reactions and good pattern memorization.  They're very challenging without being unfair, and are, on the whole, superb.\n\nThere's a story too, and it isn't bad, but it's secondary to the game's beautiful aesthetics and great gameplay.

It's strongest aspects for me is the pacing of the game that is helped immensely by it's soundtrack and audio, gameplay rules that allow yourself and enemies to be on equal footing, and a story that is not distilled for the sake of being harmless.\n\nThe story does not try to force morals and lessons on you but instead gives you a interesting, fun, and animated experience that I feel I can say attempts elements that aren't typically featured in such a cartoony setting.\n\nGameplay-wise, most of the opponents are dangerous, down to the most dormant and the level design is varied. Often you will come across situations where enemies will challenge your speed in ways that will require you to fight, use an ability, change direction, slow down, or keep to your speed until you can escape. I feel it noteworthy to mention that enemies do not damage you on contact unless they clearly can. There are moments of slow platforming and times where you can progress at a relaxing pace with each character having their own methods of progress and are equally well equipped to do so. I also appreciate that bosses act a lot like they look as a "human" boss does not rely on soaking up hits or ramming into you as much as a robot or a manned machine.\n\n\n\nThis game, while it does get very difficult, is a great blend of many game practices and I would easily recommend it.

I'm happy to say this game is not too busy wearing rose-tinted nostalgia glasses to provide an entertaining challenge and a sense of childlike wonder when you first play it. It isn't so busy kissing retro gamers' feet to provide a satisfying game in its own right.\n\nSo what does Freedom Planet do right? I mentioned "childlike wonder," and the game certainly provides this in spades. Though dialogue between characters is immensely cheesy, it ironically manages to add to the game's appeal. The writing is not exactly sterling, and pretty much is exactly what I would expect from a game on Sega Genesis, which - given the aesthetic - is probably what GalaxyTrail was going for.\n\nThe gameplay is divided amongst three different characters, who each have a unique style of play. Lilac, the "spunky dragonoid," is a more offensive character who has the ability to basically spin dash in the air and ricochet off of walls, which is necessary in order to progress through levels. Similarly, Carol - the cat girl - has the ability to wall-jump, and has a motorcycle for a power-up that can drive up walls and ceilings, as well as use red platforms to jump between walls. The basset hound, Milla, is unlocked not even after progressing halfway through the game, which makes you wonder why the developer would even gate her off to begin with. Regardless, she has a much more unique style of play from the others. She can use ranged attacks, produce a shield to block attacks, and has the ability to fly for a short period of time, similar to Tails of Sonic fame. Each character has a health bar, but Milla has a decidedly smaller one, supposedly keeping with the theme that she isn't much of a fighter.\n\nThe inspirations from Sonic the Hedgehog are made abundantly clear in this game, and yet, the game has a far greater focus on platforming than speed, unlike many of the newer Sonic games. In fact, I would argue even unlike the original Sonic games. Speed almost takes a backseat: you aren't necessarily rewarded a ranking at the end of each level for how quickly you can complete a level. It's worth fighting enemies, as they tend to drop blue gems which you can collect to get extra lives (kind of like a retro platformer, huh?), but instead of 100, you must collect 150. Some enemies drop orbs which can be collected to unlock a bonus stage at the end of each level where you roll a die that you can hit repeatedly in order to reroll and hopefully get a different reward, whether it be a plethora of shields or 1-ups.\n\nSpeaking of shields, like the Sonic games, this game does have shield powerups, but they're rather unintuitive. There are several to choose from, and they all block you from taking damage, but what exactly the function of each one is is up to you to find out. A yellow, polygonal shield in the game lets you collect gems from a distance, a blue shield producing bubbles lets you breathe indefinitely underwater (an aside, this game has the most intuitive swimming controls I've seen in a platformer in some time), and a silver shield, fire shield, and pink sakura blossom shield that seem to make you invulnerable to certain attacks (the silver shield protects you from taking damage from spikes).\n\nAll of these mechanics come together to produce a retro platformer that is hard to forget, and that I find myself booting up repeatedly just to play through the same levels over and over again just to get better. It's a challenging platformer, the likes of which I simply don't see much of anymore - at least from the Mario and Sonic franchises. The absolutely stellar soundtrack composed by Woofle and the beautiful Genesis-era aesthetic are icing on the cake. Each level is nicely varied with its own, unique mechanics, and each boss provides an almost controller-biting challenge. One caveat, however, is that these bosses seem to have a slightly wonky difficulty curve, creating this curious scenario where a boss six levels into the game is somehow easier than one from two levels ago. I'm willing to chalk this up to subjectivity: whoever play-tested the game probably thought the bosses were the perfect difficulty curve, but I found ways to easily exploit some of them. Except the final boss, of course: he's impossible to fight if you don't practice.\n\nAt an MSRP of $15, I'm shocked at how few people own a copy of Freedom Planet. It's one of the best platformers of recent memory, up there with everyone's darling Shovel Knight. It's challenging, but not hardcore punishing in the way a game like Super Meat Boy might be. You'll have plenty of fun exploring the different levels, trying to best a boss without taking any damage, or even gathering all the collectible cards. (I guess it wouldn't be a platformer without collectibles...) Top it off with the most convincing retro stylization I've seen in a game attempting to appeal to retro sensibilities, and I find it impossible not to recommend.\n\nThis game was Kickstarted, but don't let that put you off of one of the best platformers of all time. If you're anything like me, you'll find yourself in absolute delight playing this game. The fact that it hasn't had anywhere near as much press as other fantastic indie games like Shovel Knight is almost criminal, to me. I can only hope my review will convince some people to pick it up and discover for themselves a love letter to Sonic fans that doesn't try desperately to clone the franchise it's inspired by. It's a better Sonic game than any of the recent Sonic games, and it's not even trying to be. I don't know if I could possibly praise this game enough.\n\nPlease, buy Freedom Planet. If you enjoy retro platformers, you will not regret this one.","January 11, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game feels like the devs heisted people from the Saturn era to bring a game that not only looks but feels like an old school platformer.\n\nThat's not to say it's like other games claiming 'retro', no this one actually has the feel, the characters have the ol' Genesis/Playstation/Saturn era weight/ feel of 2D platformers. No havok physics engine just whatever the heck made them feel like they did.\n\nFun levels, awesome music, cheesy cutscenes and gimmicks that don't require obscure hardware to make fun. Took around 3 hours to beat the first time through (took my time, was enjoying the game) and there's 2 other characters to beat it with. Lots of different routes to go with this game and replayablilty to bring you back.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, all 3 of them play differently.\nLilac runs, jumps, kicks, has a double jump that acts as a spin attack lasting till she hits the ground, she can uppercut or kick down (which can speed you up if you do it down hill).  Then her her dragon dash which spins her up and fires her off in a direction Rocket Knight style where she'll bounce off walls and smash enemies which relies on her power gauge.\nThe gauge very quickly (5 seconds maybe?) making her very mobile.\n\nThe other Carol, is able to wall hop Megaman X style, claw around a bunch and ride a bloody motorcycle that does spin jumps like Sonic, can drive it up walls and up ladders and ...it's so cheesy and damn fun becase of it. The motorcycle is a powerup and can be lost and regained by gas tanks laying about.\n\nSo I got to play as the third character, Milla. She's very different in terms of gameplay  she floats like Yoshi, throws blocks Chip-N-Dale style and can form shields to bounce enemy attacks or even turn her block into a big short ranged beam. She's the only character so far who does not use a special bar and it's fun. Her boss fights are also drastically different since you're not as agile or offensively able.\n\nThe game clearly has a LOT of effort behind it, there's a lot of detail put into the game like holding a button to access bloopers while the story is playing out. Dancing around disco balls while fun music plays. My favorite: while in some boss fights your friends will come in to help you fight, Carol leaping in on her motorcycle to kick the boss and Milla straight up dropping health from a plane. It's really charming to see all this in action.\n\n\nIf you're going to blow off this game because it looks like a Sonic ripoff you're missing out because that's not what the game is.\n\nBrilliant game and I hope to see more from the creators. $15 gets you around 3 hours for one character playthrough and for those who skipped to the end here, each plays very different and have some unique levels and paths in stages the others have.\n\nEdited: To talk about the third character","July 28, 2014","true","117.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The fast gameplay and bright graphics provided an experience that was nothing short of pure bliss. Since then, many immitators and Sega themselves have struggled to re-create that blissfull feeling.\n\n"Freedom Planet" no doubt takes inspiration from the classic Sonic games, and it masters their mechanics alongside providing some unique gameplay of its own. 360 degree physics have never felt tighter in any 2-D platformer. Attacking enemies with Lilac's cyclone attack is very satisfying. Controls are responsive and tight, free of any lag and slowdown that existed in the early Sonic titles. Free from intrusive tutorials that plague modern game design, Freedom Planet displays an excellent learning curve. Difficulty steadily rises without any unfair spikes in challenge or poor design.\n\nAccuratly re-creating the look of 16-bit Sega titles, "Freedom Planet" boasts a colorful world to travel through. Every character is animated wonderfully- the three playable characters all have distinct moving animations from eachother! Characters even display much facial expression during cutscenes, which few would consider feasable giving the 16-bit style.\n\nThis is one of the finest 2-D platformers I've played in years. Standing up in the ranks of other Indie titles like Guacamelee and Teslagrad, Freedom Planet revives a style of gaming that has long been forgotten. I wish to see more from the creators, and would gleefully purchase this title again if it were ported to consoles.\n\nAn instant classic.

I remember playing the demo for this and having the biggest nostalgia-gasm I ever had. And when I hung around through so two versions of the demo, I found myself raising a brow at it a few different times at the changes the guys over at GalaxyTrail made to the game, then did a little backtracking to other versions of the demo and seeing how far its come along since then, from being a Sonic fangame to something far different, something that needed to attain its own identity. And to be honest, it has earned that right in spades.\n\nThe colors are vibrant, almost as if it blends every color of the rainbow into an extravagant feast for the eyes. The characters are all likable, the music is an absolute blast to listen to, everything about this game hits every single mark that it should and then some. Sure, the physics of the game kinda feels a little bit on the heavy side, but everything seems as though everything was given the proper weight, the exact amount of impact and damage severity.\n\nSo what criticisms can I lob at this game, now that I have it in my possession? To tell the honest truth, I really can't! It feels like if I were to try to nitpick at this game, I feel as though it'll only prove me wrong with a righteous backhand across the face.

Characters can fight enemies much more effectively than Sonic ever could, with cool looking melee attacks and even a guage for their special ability.

I found it to be both a nostalgia trip as well as very well put together in its own right. I would even go out to say that it is more to my liking then the Genesis Sonic games which it seems inspired by. I believe the biggest reason for this is the story, which I found quite enjoyable. It did have a few portions that were a little rushed feeling or not as deeply explored as I would have liked but it was still one of the best parts.\n\nThe gameplay was also really sharp. I found the combat mechanics to be a breath of fresh air in a platformer of this nature. Also the fact that running into most enemies didn't hurt you unless they were actively attacking gave this game multiple ways to play. It allowed you to bypass most enemies if you wanted to, while giving you a good combat mechanic if you did want to defeat them instead. The best place in this game is infact in the combat, in the form of bosses. I found them to be creative and interesting, with each one making me learn different strategies that would come in later bosses as well. That being said, there was on in particular where I felt the difficulty jumped far too high just due to the high amount of damage it could do in a single hit.\n\nGraphically this game is a joy to behold. You can tell each character and background had a lot of effort poured into them. The colors are vibrant, and most of the work has a lot of detail. That being said there are a few issues I had, mostly with the larger bosses. most of them seemed to be lacking a bit of the sharper look everything else had. They still looked good, but not great like the rest.\n\nThe sound track was very well put together. It flowed near seamlessly through levels, with each one doing a good job at setting the tone. One of the final levels themes was an exception, while it was one of my favorite tracks it had an obvious moment it looped. It broke a bit of the seamless feel. Another note is that while the music is rather good, only a couple tunes really stood out to me and made me want to listen to them outside of the game.\n\nThe biggest surprise the game had however was the voice acting. Besides a couple voices, they were all very well done. Particularly the playable characters and the main villain. I have to put out special props to the voice actress for Milla. I usually dislike higher pitched characters in games as they tend to be lower quality then the rest of the cast. This was an exception for certain. I found the character more endearing due to the voice as opposed to annoyed.\n\nOverall I found this game to be a great one, and I would definately reccomend it to anyone who likes oldschool platformers, especially those in line with Sonic the Hedgehog.","March 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is well paced and simply a lot of fun to play, with a good story.  The Sonic influence shows, but the game also feels like it has it's own identity.\n\nCritics of the game like to criticize the physics and speed.  Yes, it's not often you actually do go super top speed in this game, but it's also not often you need to.  Even though you don't move at the speed of sound, you never feel like your moving too slow. (and I think you still move faster than some of the classic Sonic games.) There are times you kind of walk up walls, (you really only need momentum and a slope to get up walls, no matter how little speed you actually have), but I find that to be more helpful than bad.  And as for Carol the Wildcat's bike....well, breaking the laws of Physics is just one of it's features.\n\nEach playable character is fun to use, and different enough that it actually warrants playing each stage with each character.  Each character also has there own story, which shows you extra story tidbits.   (well, at the time of writing this, Milla doesn't have a story mode, but she will soon, and new playable character are planned too.) And each character has a level exclusively to them. (well, Carol doesn't get one all to herself, but there is one clearly designed with her in mind.)\n\nThe story itself is great.  Yes, it's a bit cheesy, but it's in the style of a classic early 90's Saturday cartoon.  Cheesy but also serious at points.  It works well.  There were defiantly moments that had me laughing, and other moments that had me on the edge of my seat.  Of course if you just hate story in retro platformers you can always play classic, and just skip the story.\n\nThe voice acting is good.  Maybe not the best ever (I wouldn't even begin to claim to be an expert in that department), but defiantly not the worst voices I've ever heard.  Defiantly quality work.\n\nOverall this game has a classic feel and charm, but at the same time feels fresh and new.  I didn't really feel that nostalgic when playing this.  Maybe that's because I entered the video game world in the N64/PS1 era (save some original NES), or maybe it's because I was too caught up in the game itself as a title today.  Freedom Planet gets a 10/10, and is a great game for anyone who loves Sonic platformers, Retro platformers, or just 2D platformers in general.","August 5, 2014","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has the sense of speed of those games with the simple platforming and gravity defying movement. Despite that, it is strictly not a Sonic clone. The characters in this game play quite differently and there's more of a choose your own flavor in this game. You can explore the levels at your own pace, or try to set speed records by zipping through them as fast as possible.\nThe boss battles are some of the most fun things about this game, with a great sense of difficulty and this game even has difficulty settings if you find it too rough for you. Anyone can get into this game and play it quickly without the story or just enjoy the simple storyline.\nFreedom Planet is a game that one should try if they love fast paced 2d action platforming.

It had the old-school feel, some familiar patterns in what was seen of the levels in the trailers and on screenshots. Still, back then I wasn't calling it a clone as a bad thing - it was a welcome taste of the familiar nostalgia in a slightly different package.\nWhen I finally got the game and played it though I was in for a treat. More than once I'd go "Oh hey, that's just like good old <insert classic SEGA or SNES game>". The callbacks were almost affectionate and made me grin. At the same time it proved far more challenging than I'd expected (I played on normal) had a memorable soundtrack and characters you could actually get attached to. Furthermore since each character plays completely differently, having finished the story as Carol I can look forward to a different experience of playing it as Lilac.\nAltogether it's a very enjoyable if occasionally challenging platformer. If you're in it for the cutscenes, colors and plot you may want to set your difficulty level lower to avoid the frustration of multiple deaths. If challenge doesn't scare you - go right ahead and be ready for a real rush.","August 5, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The amazing sound of Genesis games and amazing story?\n\nPersonal Rating: 50 / 10. A game that deserves more than a perfect Rating. It needs a sequel, a television series, more merchandise. It's a game I want more of\n\n\n--- In-depth Review below ---\n\nBefore I start, this game has a difficulty selection. So what I say here comes from Normal Difficulty. ^^\n\nImagine them with an in-depth story like a successful television series, add a variety of bosses that are not only different, but aren't pushovers; then split the story up to 3 character (so far), told by their perspective (Replayable? Definitely!) and then as music that's so stunning and amazing, that it should have it's own album. ( Currently on Bandicamp ). That is Freedom Planet.\n\nA combination of Sonic gameplay, Jazz jackrabbit music, Kung fu panda characters with a breathtaking story. What's better than that?\n\nOnly an additional time trial, secrets, unlockables, different characters having different routes in the same levels and for STEAM ONLY (So far), a collection of trading cards that pretty much amazing by themselves.\n\nOh and you remember how common enemies are easy to kill with a dash or jumping on their head?\n\nNot going to work. Each enemy has a unique pattern completely different from the last; no reskins, copied A.i. here, completely unique and original enemy design and gameplay.\n\nI haven't even beaten 1 character yet and the story feels as satisfying as watching adventure time, sonic SATAM or any popular television show at this time. (The game is so amazing, I want it to last ^^ )\n\nIt's a game that leaves you wanting more!","August 18, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters feel like extensions of you - not an avatar that you are manipulating. Slopes let you catapault to soaring heights, and you can blast through a stage once you learn it. If you're like me and have been waiting since 1994 for an honest successor to those games, your wait is over. It easily rivals Sonic 3 and Knuckles as one of the greatest platform games ever made. You don't need to wait for this one to go on sale - it is worth far more than its launch price.\n\nThis isn't to say that it is a Sonic clone - in some ways it is, but in other ways it is completely unique. The parts of the game that could qualify as 'sonic cloning' are cloned so well that the brilliance of the originals shine through. All of the parts that are unique are thoughtfully designed and fit in with the whole.\n\nAs a fellow game developer, my only critique is that I would tweak the checkpoint system a little bit. There were many times where a checkpoint would occur just a little bit too early before a boss fight or other notable encounter, which would slow me down when I wanted to just get back into the action. I'd make it abit more like Nitronic Rush or Super Meat Boy with the 'immediately back in the action' principle. Still, this is a trivial issue and doesn't detract from the experience at all.","August 15, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is well paced and simply a lot of fun to play, with a good story.  The Sonic influence shows, but the game also feels like it has it's own identity.\n\nCritics of the game like to criticize the physics and speed.  Yes, it's not often you actually do go super top speed in this game, but it's also not often you need to.  Even though you don't move at the speed of sound, you never feel like your moving too slow. (and I think you still move faster than some of the classic Sonic games.) There are times you kind of walk up walls, (you really only need momentum and a slope to get up walls, no matter how little speed you actually have), but I find that to be more helpful than bad.  And as for Carol the Wildcat's bike....well, breaking the laws of Physics is just one of it's features.\n\nEach playable character is fun to use, and different enough that it actually warrants playing each stage with each character.  Each character also has there own story, which shows you extra story tidbits.   (well, at the time of writing this, Milla doesn't have a story mode, but she will soon, and new playable character are planned too.) And each character has a level exclusively to them. (well, Carol doesn't get one all to herself, but there is one clearly designed with her in mind.)\n\nThe story itself is great.  Yes, it's a bit cheesy, but it's in the style of a classic early 90's Saturday cartoon.  Cheesy but also serious at points.  It works well.  There were defiantly moments that had me laughing, and other moments that had me on the edge of my seat.  Of course if you just hate story in retro platformers you can always play classic, and just skip the story.\n\nThe voice acting is good.  Maybe not the best ever (I wouldn't even begin to claim to be an expert in that department), but defiantly not the worst voices I've ever heard.  Defiantly quality work.\n\nOverall this game has a classic feel and charm, but at the same time feels fresh and new.  I didn't really feel that nostalgic when playing this.  Maybe that's because I entered the video game world in the N64/PS1 era (save some original NES), or maybe it's because I was too caught up in the game itself as a title today.  Freedom Planet gets a 10/10, and is a great game for anyone who loves Sonic platformers, Retro platformers, or just 2D platformers in general.","August 5, 2014","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean the GOOD SS games too. There are a lot of familiar gameplay elements that do borrow from the classic Sonic and Sega games. Not to mention great soundtrack with large and colorful levels and some very good voice acting. Not talking Acedemy Awards quality but a heck of a lot better than what you probably heard in the Playstation and Sege Saturn era.\nYou also start of with two characters with very different movesets. I unlocked another character with a different moveset as well and they are pretty diverse in their attacks and specials. The sprite animation is top quality as well and the controls are very resonsive so yeah not floaty or slidey character movements. You can tell this is a game the developers put a lot of love into because it does not feel like an indie game at all.\n\n\nSo if you want a good quality throwback platformer from the 90s I cannot recommend this game enough.","July 26, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ok, lets do this:\n\nThere are 3 different characters to choose from, 2 you can play as from the beginning and one after beating the second level. They all have unique abilites, stats, and different paths they can all choose due to their unique abilities.\n\nThe levels are really fun. Even though a faster time means a better score, the game awards exploration with collectables and powerups.\n\nThe Boss fights can be very hard at times, but very fun and the feeling of accomplishment after beating a boss is priceless.\n\nAll this, and they aren't even "done" with the game yet! They are planning a story mode for the 3rd character, Milla, AND they are planning to include two more characters!!!! This is already a really cool game, and they aren't even done with it yet!!!\n\nWhile there are a few plotholes in the story, and there are a few glitches that haven't been patched yet, it barely effects the gameplay and the story is good nonetheless.\n\nAnd if you aren't content with the difficulty, you can change the difficulty from Casual, Normal, and Hard.\n\nSo, in brief, this game is awesome and I would recommend it any day.","July 25, 2014","true","22.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game feels like the devs heisted people from the Saturn era to bring a game that not only looks but feels like an old school platformer.\n\nThat's not to say it's like other games claiming 'retro', no this one actually has the feel, the characters have the ol' Genesis/Playstation/Saturn era weight/ feel of 2D platformers. No havok physics engine just whatever the heck made them feel like they did.\n\nFun levels, awesome music, cheesy cutscenes and gimmicks that don't require obscure hardware to make fun. Took around 3 hours to beat the first time through (took my time, was enjoying the game) and there's 2 other characters to beat it with. Lots of different routes to go with this game and replayablilty to bring you back.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, all 3 of them play differently.\nLilac runs, jumps, kicks, has a double jump that acts as a spin attack lasting till she hits the ground, she can uppercut or kick down (which can speed you up if you do it down hill).  Then her her dragon dash which spins her up and fires her off in a direction Rocket Knight style where she'll bounce off walls and smash enemies which relies on her power gauge.\nThe gauge very quickly (5 seconds maybe?) making her very mobile.\n\nThe other Carol, is able to wall hop Megaman X style, claw around a bunch and ride a bloody motorcycle that does spin jumps like Sonic, can drive it up walls and up ladders and ...it's so cheesy and damn fun becase of it. The motorcycle is a powerup and can be lost and regained by gas tanks laying about.\n\nSo I got to play as the third character, Milla. She's very different in terms of gameplay  she floats like Yoshi, throws blocks Chip-N-Dale style and can form shields to bounce enemy attacks or even turn her block into a big short ranged beam. She's the only character so far who does not use a special bar and it's fun. Her boss fights are also drastically different since you're not as agile or offensively able.\n\nThe game clearly has a LOT of effort behind it, there's a lot of detail put into the game like holding a button to access bloopers while the story is playing out. Dancing around disco balls while fun music plays. My favorite: while in some boss fights your friends will come in to help you fight, Carol leaping in on her motorcycle to kick the boss and Milla straight up dropping health from a plane. It's really charming to see all this in action.\n\n\nIf you're going to blow off this game because it looks like a Sonic ripoff you're missing out because that's not what the game is.\n\nBrilliant game and I hope to see more from the creators. $15 gets you around 3 hours for one character playthrough and for those who skipped to the end here, each plays very different and have some unique levels and paths in stages the others have.\n\nEdited: To talk about the third character","July 28, 2014","true","117.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm happy to say this game is not too busy wearing rose-tinted nostalgia glasses to provide an entertaining challenge and a sense of childlike wonder when you first play it. It isn't so busy kissing retro gamers' feet to provide a satisfying game in its own right.\n\nSo what does Freedom Planet do right? I mentioned "childlike wonder," and the game certainly provides this in spades. Though dialogue between characters is immensely cheesy, it ironically manages to add to the game's appeal. The writing is not exactly sterling, and pretty much is exactly what I would expect from a game on Sega Genesis, which - given the aesthetic - is probably what GalaxyTrail was going for.\n\nThe gameplay is divided amongst three different characters, who each have a unique style of play. Lilac, the "spunky dragonoid," is a more offensive character who has the ability to basically spin dash in the air and ricochet off of walls, which is necessary in order to progress through levels. Similarly, Carol - the cat girl - has the ability to wall-jump, and has a motorcycle for a power-up that can drive up walls and ceilings, as well as use red platforms to jump between walls. The basset hound, Milla, is unlocked not even after progressing halfway through the game, which makes you wonder why the developer would even gate her off to begin with. Regardless, she has a much more unique style of play from the others. She can use ranged attacks, produce a shield to block attacks, and has the ability to fly for a short period of time, similar to Tails of Sonic fame. Each character has a health bar, but Milla has a decidedly smaller one, supposedly keeping with the theme that she isn't much of a fighter.\n\nThe inspirations from Sonic the Hedgehog are made abundantly clear in this game, and yet, the game has a far greater focus on platforming than speed, unlike many of the newer Sonic games. In fact, I would argue even unlike the original Sonic games. Speed almost takes a backseat: you aren't necessarily rewarded a ranking at the end of each level for how quickly you can complete a level. It's worth fighting enemies, as they tend to drop blue gems which you can collect to get extra lives (kind of like a retro platformer, huh?), but instead of 100, you must collect 150. Some enemies drop orbs which can be collected to unlock a bonus stage at the end of each level where you roll a die that you can hit repeatedly in order to reroll and hopefully get a different reward, whether it be a plethora of shields or 1-ups.\n\nSpeaking of shields, like the Sonic games, this game does have shield powerups, but they're rather unintuitive. There are several to choose from, and they all block you from taking damage, but what exactly the function of each one is is up to you to find out. A yellow, polygonal shield in the game lets you collect gems from a distance, a blue shield producing bubbles lets you breathe indefinitely underwater (an aside, this game has the most intuitive swimming controls I've seen in a platformer in some time), and a silver shield, fire shield, and pink sakura blossom shield that seem to make you invulnerable to certain attacks (the silver shield protects you from taking damage from spikes).\n\nAll of these mechanics come together to produce a retro platformer that is hard to forget, and that I find myself booting up repeatedly just to play through the same levels over and over again just to get better. It's a challenging platformer, the likes of which I simply don't see much of anymore - at least from the Mario and Sonic franchises. The absolutely stellar soundtrack composed by Woofle and the beautiful Genesis-era aesthetic are icing on the cake. Each level is nicely varied with its own, unique mechanics, and each boss provides an almost controller-biting challenge. One caveat, however, is that these bosses seem to have a slightly wonky difficulty curve, creating this curious scenario where a boss six levels into the game is somehow easier than one from two levels ago. I'm willing to chalk this up to subjectivity: whoever play-tested the game probably thought the bosses were the perfect difficulty curve, but I found ways to easily exploit some of them. Except the final boss, of course: he's impossible to fight if you don't practice.\n\nAt an MSRP of $15, I'm shocked at how few people own a copy of Freedom Planet. It's one of the best platformers of recent memory, up there with everyone's darling Shovel Knight. It's challenging, but not hardcore punishing in the way a game like Super Meat Boy might be. You'll have plenty of fun exploring the different levels, trying to best a boss without taking any damage, or even gathering all the collectible cards. (I guess it wouldn't be a platformer without collectibles...) Top it off with the most convincing retro stylization I've seen in a game attempting to appeal to retro sensibilities, and I find it impossible not to recommend.\n\nThis game was Kickstarted, but don't let that put you off of one of the best platformers of all time. If you're anything like me, you'll find yourself in absolute delight playing this game. The fact that it hasn't had anywhere near as much press as other fantastic indie games like Shovel Knight is almost criminal, to me. I can only hope my review will convince some people to pick it up and discover for themselves a love letter to Sonic fans that doesn't try desperately to clone the franchise it's inspired by. It's a better Sonic game than any of the recent Sonic games, and it's not even trying to be. I don't know if I could possibly praise this game enough.\n\nPlease, buy Freedom Planet. If you enjoy retro platformers, you will not regret this one.","January 11, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember playing the demo for this and having the biggest nostalgia-gasm I ever had. And when I hung around through so two versions of the demo, I found myself raising a brow at it a few different times at the changes the guys over at GalaxyTrail made to the game, then did a little backtracking to other versions of the demo and seeing how far its come along since then, from being a Sonic fangame to something far different, something that needed to attain its own identity. And to be honest, it has earned that right in spades.\n\nThe colors are vibrant, almost as if it blends every color of the rainbow into an extravagant feast for the eyes. The characters are all likable, the music is an absolute blast to listen to, everything about this game hits every single mark that it should and then some. Sure, the physics of the game kinda feels a little bit on the heavy side, but everything seems as though everything was given the proper weight, the exact amount of impact and damage severity.\n\nSo what criticisms can I lob at this game, now that I have it in my possession? To tell the honest truth, I really can't! It feels like if I were to try to nitpick at this game, I feel as though it'll only prove me wrong with a righteous backhand across the face. I might amend this as I go along, but for now, this game is something you owe yourself to pick up right now, sit down and revel in this roller coaster ride!","December 25, 2014","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's strongest aspects for me is the pacing of the game that is helped immensely by it's soundtrack and audio, gameplay rules that allow yourself and enemies to be on equal footing, and a story that is not distilled for the sake of being harmless.\n\nThe story does not try to force morals and lessons on you but instead gives you a interesting, fun, and animated experience that I feel I can say attempts elements that aren't typically featured in such a cartoony setting.\n\nGameplay-wise, most of the opponents are dangerous, down to the most dormant and the level design is varied. Often you will come across situations where enemies will challenge your speed in ways that will require you to fight, use an ability, change direction, slow down, or keep to your speed until you can escape. I feel it noteworthy to mention that enemies do not damage you on contact unless they clearly can. There are moments of slow platforming and times where you can progress at a relaxing pace with each character having their own methods of progress and are equally well equipped to do so. I also appreciate that bosses act a lot like they look as a "human" boss does not rely on soaking up hits or ramming into you as much as a robot or a manned machine.\n\n\n\nThis game, while it does get very difficult, is a great blend of many game practices and I would easily recommend it.

While it was certainly inspired by Sonic, it is in no way a clone.

All of the characters have simple attacks and a special move they can pull off that can help them fight enemies and bosses.

The sprite work is beautifully done. It pops with bright colors and details. The music is well composed and fits the tone of the levels. The levels themselves are unique and diverse. All of these combine to make a masterpiece. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are not as magnificent. The animation behind them aren't that spectacular, the story isn't grand, and the voice acting is a little mediocre. Don't get me wrong, they can be a nice diversion from the rest of the game and they were certainly better that what I was expecting, but at times I just wanted to get back to playing the game. Thankfully, there is a game mode that lets you skip all the cutscenes.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing. First time players may have a tough time adjusting to the game play, especially the bosses' attack patterns, but will still have enough fun that will override any frustration.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsune_baka/recommended/248310/","kitsune_baka","blaze.fox.kitsune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsune_baka/","12 products in account","This is a pretty interesting concept. Where Shovel Knight was a nice homage to the hay-day of NES platformers like Duck Tales, Mega Man, Zelda 2: Link to The Past etc, Freedom Planet has elements of various Genesis era games - namely the Sonic Series. And mayyyyybe a little bit of Rocket Knight Adventures and Gunstar Heroes.\n\nFirst off, bonus points for letting me use a ~controller~ to play, I wish more games on Steam gave you that option. And I really wish there were more games in the Steam library that tried to pull off this pseudo-retro aesthetic.\n\nNow, with that being said, I think Freedom Planet is fun, but far from being "perfect."\n\nWhy???\n\nThere is a lack of certain things, such as the Spin Dash, which makes this game rather confusing for someone like me who ~grew up~ with the Spin Dash. For someone who is 12 and has never played any of the Genesis Sonic games, that most likely isn't going to be a problem. But for me, it's nerve racking. I keep pressing Down on the D-Pad and trying to charge, and what ends up happening instead is that I stop in my tracks and just jump... that's NOOOO GOOOOOD... (sorry, I had to say it, lol...) decisions like this one made me wonder just ~why~ something that was such a staple of the Sonic series would be left out of a game that is A: trying to make an homage to Sonic, and B: actually started out its life as someone's Sonic --fan game-- that later got turned into its own thing with Original Characters.\n\nSurely, at one point in this game's life, it had to have had a Spin Dash. You just ~don't~ make a Sonic fangame without a Spin Dash. Leaving out the Spin Dash is like... if you made a Mega Man game and you left out the Charge Shot, or if you made a Mega Man X game and you left out the R-button Dash, or if you made a Zero saga game and you left out the Z-Sabre. It just doesn't make ~sense~ to do something like that because those things are pretty much expected to be there. Maybe I just played Sonic games so many times that my brain absolutely ~cannot~ deal with not having a Spin Dash as it is thoroughly engrained into my muscle memory.\n\nI mean Spin Dash is a simple concept. You press down, you press the action button and you rev up and you let go of it and NYEEWWWWM! You go super fast and shoot right up that U shaped dip you were stuck in, or you go really quick through that loop-de-loop, or whatever.\n\nLilac has sort of a strange replacement for it that I would kinda compare to either the Volteccer move in Pulse Man, or Vector the Crocodile's diagonal jump thing in Knuckles Chaotix. It's nice and it gets you places, but you also have to charge it - if they shaved a few seconds off that charge time, it wouldn't be such a bother.\n\nCarol is the only one who really plays like a Sonic character, rolling around on the ground and stuff, but without momentum mechanics, it's kind of fruitless. I mean, she has a Motorbike that she spends most of her time on anyway. And she takes it ~everywhere~ .... even up ladders....\n\nMilla, surprisingly has the most fun gameplay of the 3 characters. She's some sort of little dog thing with Klonoa ears who can make green blocks and use them as throwing projectiles, or forming a block and then using the "attack" button directly after causes her to fire a large green beam. They could have made a whole game just around her and I actually think ~that~ would be more fun than either Carol or Lilac. Weird, right?\n\nThe level designs are kind of interesting, but without "secrets" (like special stages, or hidden items) to look for, it doesn't really give me a reason to try to explore them.\n\nBack onto glitches and omissions... there's a saddening lack of the "momentum" mechanics. I mean, in Sonic, you go faster the more you hold down on the D-Pad when you're rolled up in a ball and going through a loop or curve, instead of that happening here you just duck and you stop in your tracks. You can actually walk straight up a wall with no effect on your traction what-so-ever. In the original 2D Sonic games, this didn't happen. You slowed down and you fell back into the dip of the U.\n\nI also dislike the choice of having an "enemies can't hurt you by touching you, they have to actually hit you with their weapons" sort of arrangment. That arrangement works fine for a beat'em up like River City Ransom or Double Dragon where it wouldn't make sense for enemies to hurt you if they're not punching you, but in a Sonic style game, it just takes out a big part of the challenge. Having that for the "easy" / "kids" mode is okay, but the "Hard Mode" should have at least brought that "enemies hurt you if you touch them" part back.\n\nThere's also some severe glitches with... well, I guess I'll call it "the camera" even though that term doesn't really work here since it's a 2D game and not 3D, but yeah, I'll give an example. In the part where you get chased by a giant boulder ala Indiana Jones, sometimes the "camera" will spaz out and just slam you right into the boulder and then the boulder is ~ahead~ of you instead of behind you.\n\nIf this game had gotten some more thorough play-testing and also had gotten some more fan-input before being finished and released to the market, it could have been waaaaaay more enjoyable than it is at present.\n\nIf you can overlook these little flaws and omissions, Freedom Planet is actually a fun game to play - just don't go into it expecting it to be Sonic (even though that's what it was meant to be at first). If you ~really~ want to play a Sonic game and not just something with Sonic-looking OCs, go find your Genesis, or your Gameboy Advance (orrrr, go do that other thing, that I won't say since it's technically illegal, yadda yadda)...","March 19, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

First time players may have a tough time adjusting to the game play, especially the bosses' attack patterns, but will still have enough fun that will override any frustration. If you didn't get your dose of Sonic from Sonic Boom (honestly, who did?), then give this game a try.","March 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What started as a Sonic tribute game has taken threads and swatches from several of the best platforming experiences of the SNES/Genesis era and woven together a brilliant game that's every bit the equal of its retro inspiration.\n\nThe music and voice acting are commendable making this worth repeat playthroughs just to hear some of the level tunes again.  Top notch character animations deserve to be singled out.  Sprites are very emotive and easily allow you to empathize with the characters.  Control is also very solid.  The physics feel appropriate, giving you adequate control over your characters.  They're even adjusted in several places to avoid breaking the flow of the action, like allowing you to run up a wall at slow speeds to avoid making you have to back up and get a perfect running start.  It's a great improvement over many Sonic games.\n\nThe amount of love and care that's gone into this game rivals the best of Nintendo's work.  It would be a shame if you didn't at least download the demo and give it a try.  This one's worth every penny of its price.","March 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shovel Knight from Yacht Club Games delighted retro gamers and newcomers alike with its classic NES like charm, wonderful retro soundtrack and cleverly constructed levels, polished off with a unique art style that celebrates games of the late 80s. Now it seems that it’s the early 90s turn to shine with Freedom Planet, a title from indie developer Galaxy Trail that harks back to the era of a console I hold very dear, the Sega Megadrive (otherwise known as the Genesis in the US).\n\nFreedom Planet clearly takes great inspiration from many Sega Megadrive games, most notably Sonic The Hedgehog which the bulk of its gameplay elements seem to mimic. It also evokes memories of Treasure’s fantastic platform shooter Gunstar Heroes with much of its design and there are even elements of Capcom’s Mega Man X series, so there’s a little bit of Super Nintendo love in there somewhere too. The 90s nostalgia doesn’t stop there either, Freedom Planet’s art style and story is reminiscent of early 90s cartoons such as Bucky ‘O Hare with its tale of anthropomorphic freedom fighters taking on a militaristic threat to the galaxy, this time in the form of intergalactic overlord Brevon, an insectoid tyrant with dreams of absolute, intergalactic domination. This cartoon like feel is further captured in the way the story is told as it follows the three protagonists, Lilac (an anthropomorphic dragon), Carol (an anthropomorphic cat) and Milla (an anthropomorphic basset hound) who are portrayed as innocent, adolescent characters finding themselves thrust into a dangerous war that their sense of right forces them to engage.\n\nThe gameplay of Freedom Planet flows beautifully. Much like the Sonic series it pays homage to, much of the game involves racing around levels collecting gems and smashing your way through enemies at high speeds. Level designs are colourful and large ranging from a lush rainforest shrouding trap filled Aztec ruins to a bustling Chinese styled city in the middle of a celebratory festival, each level boasts new and interesting mechanics to get to grips with and a nice variety of enemies to fight. Boss battles too are cleverly thought out, a joy to look at and offer a significant, fast paced challenge that really gets the adrenaline pumping. The games three protagonists control somewhat differently, Lilac feels very much like a Sonic character with her ability to pinball around levels whereas Carol feels more like a Mega Man character with her ability to wall jump, she also has a Chun Li style kick attack that gives her more of a fighter like feel, Carol also has a motorbike that she can use upon finding gas cans scattered about the various levels, making her much faster than before and changing up her abilities slightly. Milla is a little more unique, she has the ability to create energy cubes that she can throw as projectiles, she can also create a small energy shield and has the ability to flap her ears to execute a type of double jump. Of the three main characters Lilac definitely feels like her play style fits the flow of the game best.\n\nThe soundtrack to Freedom Planet is definitely deserving of a mention, the music is absolutely phenomenal and with a whopping two hour OST (no small feat for such a small Indie project) you’re going to hear a number of great tunes that you’ll want to listen to again and again that really set the tone for every stage and situation. The voice acting is also great for such a small title, some of the actors are noticeably better than others, however the bulk of the voice acting is top notch, Lilac, Carol and Milla sound especially convincing and carry the tone of the story across well.\n\nAll in all for £10.99 (the game’s price on Steam as of the time of this review) you really can’t go wrong with Galaxy Trail’s Freedom Planet, especially if, like me, you’re a retro, platform fanatic who grew up during the Sega Megadrive era.  If this sounds like you then this nostalgic trip down memory lane is definitely a game worth looking into.","May 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

After trying the demo, it more than warranted the purchase.  The game got better from there and has since become my favorite game on Steam, and also my favorite game of 2015 so far.  While the game does have some troubles with finding a consistent tone with it's story, the characters are still well designed and very likable across the board.  Ultimately what pushed this game past Shovel Knight in terms of overall enjoyment is it's difficulty, which allowed me to play on a difficult setting from the get go.  That said, for people newer to games, there are easier difficulties as well, so everyone wins.  The gameplay feels like a mix between Sonic and Mega Man Zero/ZX.  If you're a Sonic fan looking for this to PLAY like Sonic, it's actually quite a bit different... actually more like Mega Man Zero/ZX in my eyes.  In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game more for fans of platformers or retro games, and anyone with a passing interest should definitely try the demo.  My only question is, when will Freedom Planet 2 come out?\n\nRATING:  A","April 22, 2015","true","59.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I found it to be both a nostalgia trip as well as very well put together in its own right. I would even go out to say that it is more to my liking then the Genesis Sonic games which it seems inspired by. I believe the biggest reason for this is the story, which I found quite enjoyable. It did have a few portions that were a little rushed feeling or not as deeply explored as I would have liked but it was still one of the best parts.\n\nThe gameplay was also really sharp. I found the combat mechanics to be a breath of fresh air in a platformer of this nature. Also the fact that running into most enemies didn't hurt you unless they were actively attacking gave this game multiple ways to play. It allowed you to bypass most enemies if you wanted to, while giving you a good combat mechanic if you did want to defeat them instead. The best place in this game is infact in the combat, in the form of bosses. I found them to be creative and interesting, with each one making me learn different strategies that would come in later bosses as well. That being said, there was on in particular where I felt the difficulty jumped far too high just due to the high amount of damage it could do in a single hit.\n\nGraphically this game is a joy to behold. You can tell each character and background had a lot of effort poured into them. The colors are vibrant, and most of the work has a lot of detail. That being said there are a few issues I had, mostly with the larger bosses. most of them seemed to be lacking a bit of the sharper look everything else had. They still looked good, but not great like the rest.\n\nThe sound track was very well put together. It flowed near seamlessly through levels, with each one doing a good job at setting the tone. One of the final levels themes was an exception, while it was one of my favorite tracks it had an obvious moment it looped. It broke a bit of the seamless feel. Another note is that while the music is rather good, only a couple tunes really stood out to me and made me want to listen to them outside of the game.\n\nThe biggest surprise the game had however was the voice acting. Besides a couple voices, they were all very well done. Particularly the playable characters and the main villain. I have to put out special props to the voice actress for Milla. I usually dislike higher pitched characters in games as they tend to be lower quality then the rest of the cast. This was an exception for certain. I found the character more endearing due to the voice as opposed to annoyed.\n\nOverall I found this game to be a great one, and I would definately reccomend it to anyone who likes oldschool platformers, especially those in line with Sonic the Hedgehog.","March 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trust me when I say that it's much better than pretty much any Sonic game in the franchise. Some will complain that it's a 'bit game', and to those people, I would like to remind that the current day and age is effectively a 'revival of the bit', so some humility to the undying style would be nice(though if you'll still complain, I will respect your opinions; this is the internet, after all...).\n\nHigh points:\n-A game whose fast-paced action style will invigorate fans of platformers and sidescrollers\n-Well-balanced characters whose traits suit their styles of combat and exploration\n-Immersive and catchy music\n\nTripping points:\n-The story, admittedly, could have been better, but still keeps the feel of games in the Bit Console Wars(Sega vs. Nintendo)\n-The final four levels come with a moderately steep learning curve, but by this point, the game will still be challenging you to develop accordingly, so you should be okay if you're playing well\n\nWith a free DLC coming within the next few months, at best, for Torque, Spade and Milla's story lines, this game's a good pick. It's colorful, it has a great soundtrack, and of course has its fair share of in-stage collectibles. If you want a good platformer, buy this. If you want to reminisce about the days of the Bit Console Wars, this game's great for that, too. And for those who really want the feel of a controller, there's ever-developing support for it. Galaxy Trail's flagship title is a good sign for the company, I'd say, and those who have played Strife's other works will be anticipating the next title in line.","June 16, 2015","true","38.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LinkSlayer64/recommended/248310/","LinkSlayer64","LinkSlayer64","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LinkSlayer64/","564 products in account","Freedom Planet much like Shovel Knight, harkens to an earlier era of gaming. Whereas Shovel Knight was to the 8-bit NES era, Freedom Planet leans towards the late end of the 16-bit era, taking cues from games like Gunstar Heroes and Sonic the Hedgehog (in Particular Sonic 3 & Knuckles)\nI heard about this game a long while ago, and was intstantly interested. However, the extent of my interaction with the game has been no more than the few hours I played today.\nAs a disclaimer, I play a lot of games, and absolutely love the original sonics, so my gaming level may be considered advanced (everyone has their strengths and weaknesses though) So take this as my opinion, there is no unbiased review folks.\n\nThe GoodLet us begin, this game is not just a mere ripoff, this game borrows some good things from 16 bit era games that you never realized mattered so much.\n\nTight controls - This game is extremely responsive, and the controls are solid. One thing from Sonic that was always important was he was never too floaty, the speed never exceeded an amount that made it difficult to play, and each button press connected properly. Freedom Planet copies this important detail.\n\nSimple controls - The game does not overload you with controls, it keeps things pretty simple, but with unique controls for each character. You are limited in your moves, so it doesn't take a lot for you to figure out what you need to do, where.\n\nInnovative Gameplay - Now, I say "innovative" as a relative term - the game relies on 16-bit era game design as a model, and relatively, it innovates. The unique combination of beat'em'up aesthetics with the speed of sonic creates a unique experience. One could also argue it takes the coin-hoarding from the latest entries into the "New Super Mario Bros" series.\n\nYour pace - The game never forces you to go that fast, the timer does not tick to an invisible deadline. This game does not use the improper and often misinformed recollection that "sonic games are about going fast" Instead, it captures the accuracy of Sonic games - It has good platforming, and mild exploration, and chances - qoute, chances, to go fast. Sonic was often seen as being fast because it made the platforming and exploration so tight and simple, and I feel Freedom Planet copies this well. You can run fast, you can jump around, or you can hunt down every damn gem in a level.\n\nChallenging bosses - Some people made an issue of the bosses being difficult, for me, they were just right. The game is fair about checkpoints, so jumping right into a boss is simple. Additionally, this is not a matter of rings = life. A lifebar is present, and you are given fair warning about certain attacks.\n\nFemale protagonists - I'm just generally pleased with the choice of having female protagonists. It is not a gameplay point, but a personal point.\n\nThe FlawsThe game has flaws, and I won't just ignore them, I'll go over them\nCluttered level design - by no means a deal breaker, but players of Sonic 3 & Knuckles will recognize the issue of having levels where you backtrack, and levels that are very large, sometimes, you get a bit confused. This game copies many good aspects of Sonic, but ended up copying this flaw as well.\n\nZoomed viewpoint - The game could stand to have the area zoomed-out a bit. once again, not a deal-breaker, but simply a flaw you may find yourself frustrated with once.\n\nUnclear checkpoints - I wish the checkpoints were made clear, a spinny ball, a flag, something. The checkpoints themselves are fair, but just an indicator would be nice.\n\nThe RestThings I cannot comment on are things like:\n\nThe story - it is a bit of a stock story, but by no means it is the "worst of fanfiction" (trust me, I've seen that) It gives us a clear goal, we have a protagonist, and we have an antagonist, it does that right, and it quickly gives our characters a motivation to keep fighting. That said, it is not The Last of Us, or even Saints Row IV, but it's a decent enough story. Plus, you can ignore it completely by going through a "classic" mode.\n\nVoice Acting - I am just pleased to have some voice acting, it's not good or bad to me. I'm not a professional voice actor, and I also don't expect the best from a non-AAA game, they put their heart into it, that's good enough for me. Nor do I expect to be emotionally moved by the game.\n\nThe EndAlways remember folks, reviews are of personal opinion, I try to go over the good and the bad, but those two categories will always be influenced by a reviewer's experiences, likes, and dislikes. In the end though, I hope if tihs review convinces you to buy the game, that you enjoy it, and if notm I offer my sinceriest apologies.","December 23, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is it. This is the game changer. This is a love letter to all the retro Saturn and Genesis fans.\n\nEvery playable character in this game is unique and has their own way of approaching each situation in a very smart way. The momentum never feels stale and the design is beautiful. If you don't have nostalgia for the era it probably won't grab you as much but it will still be appreciated. There's one stage that has a piano that you can step on - which ahs been done before in the Adnvace series I think but it's still nice to see it implemented into the game.\n\nI thought the story was going to be bad and with tired cliches that you usually see in these kinds of games and although some of them are present the overall story is surprisingly deep. The cutscenes are too long which I think a lot of people complain about. There seems to be a lot of filler and a lot of things could be told differently or cut out of the game all together, I'm glad it's there though, it was engaging and interesting.. and with the classic mode I can just play stage by stage while still retaining knowledge of what is happening. I feel like the adventure mode is a one time playthrough for me, to put everything into perspective. The real seller is the gameplay, and it does that very well.\n\nI definitely recommend this game! If you like platformers there's no reason that this shouldn't be in your library. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad it's here","June 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

A good comparison is Shovel Knight, only Freedom planet is an homage to old Genesis games rather than old nintendo staples.\n\nFreedom Planet features intense, fast paced gameplay that follows its own internal old-game logic(you can run up and down sheer walls as long as you have the speed, rotate around large loops ala sonic, etc.), a refreshingly simple combat system, and almost every enemy is entirely unique in sprite and animation. There are numerous mini bosses, a large stable of end-stage bosses, and a ton of beautifully rendered stages to run around in, each of which are huge, sprawling, and give you the 'freedom' to zoom around in almost any direction.\n\nThe story has a very weird saturday-morning-but-adult vibe, with brightly colored characters and voice acting work that feels almost purposefully over the top and ham-y. It's a bit surprising how dark the story gets while maintaining a relatively child-like atmosphere. Some of the cutscenes do drag on, but there's an option to run the game sans cutscenes if all you want is to have fun and run the game again for time or simply just don't care about a story at all.\n\nThere are a lot of nice, professional polish touches to Freedom Planet. Many Bosses have cutscenes, but if you die you simply respawn a bit further back, and whne you approach the Boss they leap right into the combat without having to redo dialogue again.There are a ton of secrets, and everything is bright and well animated in lots of primary colors.  The game's pacing is frantic, but in a way that feels fun rather than rushed. Every level feels different in a good way, with new mechanics added almost before you've learned the last stage's unique playability.\n\nIt does have some problems though. Some might find the deviant-art-esque characters unappealing from an aesthetics point, and the dialogue can sometimes be cringeworthy. And certain environmental effects are instant-kills, which can be tempo-ruining, pulling you out of the game. However, these are all minor concerns in what is a surprising gem of a game that should please any of thsoe nostalgic for a game that plays start to finish with a satisfying saturday-morning-cartoon power of friendship storyline.","June 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/248310/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","Freedom Planet - the moment I stepped into this game, I thought that it looked like a Sonic game, and according to the thousand-something other reviewers, I'm not alone. Avoiding the temptation of calling it a Sonic analog, what is Freedom Planet?\n\nFreedom Planet is a 2d platformer with emphasis on speed and combat. Every girl is capable of going blindingly fast, so much that it can be hard to keep up with them; they can use this speed to climb up walls, outrun enemies, and soar up to otherwise hard-to-reach areas. There's no RPG element - the characters have all the powers needed to clear the game from the moment you pick them.\n\nThe protagonists each have their own little quirks that come out in the game's many cutscenes. Those that do not like the voice acting will be pleased to know that every cutscene can be skipped - those who do like cutscenes will find a pleasantly colorful story. Opinions will vary as to whether or not the writing is good, though it is the likeable characters which help pull everything together. For a game that is trying to keep its rating child-friendly, the villain is also surprisingly brutal; where some villains are content to yell "I'll get you next time!" as the hero thwarts them, Lord Brevon acts as more of the "I don't think you really -need- to breathe right now" sort of antagonist.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game would have to be the astoundingly well done sound track. Moody tracks play during tense combat-heavy levels, whereas up-beat or thrilling songs play during faster levels. Many of these tracks are great to listen to even outside the game, ranging between atmospheric and electronica for a nice diverse blend of background music. With 3 hours with of very well done music, the soundtrack is worthy of consideration.\n\nLevels are well done and fun to go through. If one is more of an explorer, there are hidden nooks and crannies everywhere hiding little hidden power ups, crystals, and 'cards' that unlock sound files and concept art. If a person is the sort who prefers fast paced action, 'feeling' the level as they go, many of the levels challenge players to plow through them as fast as possible for the best time. Both the adrenaline junkie and the completionist will likely find a home in this game thanks to its wide yet free flowing design.\n\nAny criticism I have on the game is mostly nitpicking. I would have liked a proper borderless fullscreen mode [Edit: ten hours in, I found it], better volume control, and more importantly the ability to access the options menu while playing.\n\nI suppose I could also criticize the game's length, but I feel that is more of a testament to how enjoyable it is than an actual matter of content. At about 3.5 hours for a non-speed run playthrough, and of course a possible second or third playthrough with different characters, it still feels like we're only scratching the surface of what the world of Avalice has to offer. Heck, I'm itching for a sequel already, and this game has free DLC that has yet to be released.\n\nFreedom Planet is what an indie game -should- look like. Exciting, enthralling and imaginative, this is probably one of the best recent indie games to hit the proverbial shelves. Where some games pretentiously show off one quirky mechanic the developers came up with, Freedom Planet excels in multiple areas, managing to be great almost everywhere without being faulty anywhere.\n\nSome call it the new 'Sonic', and perhaps they're right. But maybe, just maybe, we may also be witnessing the start of something greater. A WiiU adaptation is already in the works as of this writing, and perhaps there will be more Freedom Planet in the future; we'll see.\n\nFor anyone looking for a little indie game that is not only adorable with its characters but also adrenaline-inducing in its gameplay, Freedom Planet is highly recommended.","May 22, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like merge of Sonic and Megaman, but so different, Let me point out few reasons why you should get it:\n- Perfect both for casuals and hardcores. Casual and Easy difficulty grat HP regen making the game much easier yet still enjoyable. Normal and Hard are so difficult, that you would be dying A LOT, and especialy near bosses. Thankfuly the game keeps restarting you from the checkpoint so you wouldn't need to do entire stages again;\n- It has three completly different playstyles. Words cannot describe it, just watch the trailer;\n- Seriously awesome boss fights. Even when I died over 30 times in last boss fights I still had fun... or maybe I'm just weird by having fun being stuck in a boss fights...;\n- To me the story is very decent. I usually don't care about it (that's why I don't blame Sonic Team for their... ideas) but here I had a goal to see every damn cutscene;\n- Collectibles! Who doesn't like them? And they actualy do something! You will unclock the music (which really stays in your head), voicelines and artwork! That's actualy what I found so far. Who knows what else might be there;\n- Don't like the story or just want to play like hardcores in the 90's? Sure thing, get Classic mode and ignore every cutscene or story-related dialogues. (Don't do that please... It is so good);\n\nNow many may wonder: Is this some sort of ripoff? Like some sort of random clone of Sonic or Megaman? NOPE. True, it was heavily inspired on Sonic (that's confirmed, didn't check about Megaman), but gameplay is completly different. How different you may ask? Just look at the trailer! Did you see Sonic driving a motorcycle?! Or maybe Megaman... uhhh... ok you got me there. The only Megaman I played was Megaman Powered Up for PSP but that doesn't change that Freedom Planet is different from it.\n\nSo there you have it. Freedom Planet is not a ripoff or clone of any sort, gives amazing experience, is suitable for every fan of platformers and that music! I must get sountrack soon.\nVerdict: Buy! NOW!

Well, get ready for the indie game that your friend insists is one of the best games ever, and plays once every THREE years! It’s just that good.\n\nFreedom Planet.\n\nFreedom; a word the evokes uninhibited exploration. Planet; a word used to describe worlds so big, Pluto doesn’t make the cut anymore. Get ready to explore a sprawling Metroidvania that is worthy of its title... what? It’s a level-by-level platformer with no upgrades? Then why is it called Freedom Pla [cut]\n\nWelcome to planet Avalice. Embark on an epic two-and-a-half hour adventure with your choice of character. Blaze through over ten stages as Girl Sonic…-Ristar...-Gunstar...-Ryu...-Dragon... Okay, that’s awesome. Leave something for your sidekick, why don’t you? [clip of sidekick driving a motorcycle up a wall] Nevermind.\n\nUse your skills to speed through huge lovingly detailed levels with multiple paths, then spend eighty percent of your time stuck trying to defeat bosses again and again in vain because you’re too stubborn to lower the difficulty. Ughh, how am I supposed to beat this guy?! He just punches out of nowhere and takes half my health! I’m not even playing on Hard! Patch this already! Oh good, they did. All right! Time to download… wait, I already have it? NOOOOOOOO [cut]\n\nGet ready to experience a loving homage to Sonic, Ristar, Treasure, and every other awesome Sega Genesis \ Mega Drive and Saturn game every made, with quarter-pipes, crazy loop-de-loop structures, high-speed launches,  sweet music and sound effects, elemental shields, the dread of running out of oxygen, really big lasers, really big explosions, really big bosses that shake the screen when they attack and lag the framerate when they die,  and those cool spiral elevators that were in..,. uh… Launch Base Zone? Hydrocity Zone? You know, that zone with the cool spiral elevators in it. They’re in this game.\n\nThen watch it burn your childhood nostalgia into a crisp by pointing out all the problems your favourite games had, and fixing them with simple features like: difficulty selection, more than one useful move per character, a perky 1-up jingle that only plays when the mood calls for it, a reasonable difficulty curve that ****s with you on purpose instead of drunkenly stumbling between too easy and too hard, the ability to pause cut-scenes, the ability to skip cut-scenes, the ability to not accidentally skip cut-scenes just by looking at the controller funny, an icon that tells you when something’s about to kill you from off-screen WHY DON’T SONIC GAMES EVER HAVE THOSE?! [breath], and swimming.\n\nUse your cunning to conserve your health bar and cherish health pick-ups like water in a desert… or play on Easy and watch as your health regenerates before your eyes. You might as well; the achievements don’t care. And you can change the difficulty any time you want. See? This cleared save file has 100 deaths because I played on Normal, but do you see the word “Normal” anywhere on there? For all you know, I lost all those lives on Casual. But trust me, you guys, it was on Normal.\n\nCringe, at a, well, honestly, a surprisingly well-fitting story featuring: Decapitations, Brainwashing, Worldwide War, Making New Friends, Political Intrigue, Wholesale Asskicking, Playful Teasing, Horrifying Mutations, Cold-Blooded Torture, and All-You-Can-Eat Sushi. Mmmmm. Sewwwwsh.\n\nOnce you’ve played out the Adventure Mode, take on a variety of extra modes such as: Classic Mode, which is Adventure Mode minus the cutscenes, Time Attack Mode, which is Classic Mode plus a level select menu, and… ummmm…\n\nThen, hunt for 100 cards hidden throughout the game, and try to collect the achievements, which are one part speedruns, one part card collection, one part challenges that would be tough if you couldn’t do them on any difficulty, and three parts wacky bull**** like “notice our dance easter egg”, “let the AI partner get the last hit on this boss”, and the ultimate bragging rights reward: “stand on a ledge.”\n\nBut seriously you guys, you think I’d write a review this long for a game I think is just ok? No. It’s tons of fun. Buy it now!\n\nStarring: [Lilac] “CYCLONE!”, [Carol] A Green Bobcat on a Motorbike, [Milla] Fluttercream, [Brevon] The Bad Guy From Galaxy Quest, [Torque] Plucky Duck, [Syntax] GladOS Knockoff Number 263, [Neera Li] Panda Tigress, [Spade] Panda Gambit, [Gong] Brooklyn Panda, [Dail] Another Panda? Geez, they’re doing fine here apparently.\n\nWutai Planet.\n\n[clip of Jade Creek boss, playing as Carol] Okay, so they script it so she swoops in at the last moment and claims the last hit on the boss? Screw off, glory hog, I did all the work.\n\nScore: 3\4. (Close to 3.5, but the default price point feels a little steep.

There are multiple characters to play, time attack modes, speed run attempts, etc., and a surprisingly long story mode for such a small studio. A good comparison is Shovel Knight, only Freedom planet is an homage to old Genesis games rather than old nintendo staples.\n\nFreedom Planet features intense, fast paced gameplay that follows its own internal old-game logic(you can run up and down sheer walls as long as you have the speed, rotate around large loops ala sonic, etc.), a refreshingly simple combat system, and almost every enemy is entirely unique in sprite and animation. There are numerous mini bosses, a large stable of end-stage bosses, and a ton of beautifully rendered stages to run around in, each of which are huge, sprawling, and give you the 'freedom' to zoom around in almost any direction.\n\nThe story has a very weird saturday-morning-but-adult vibe, with brightly colored characters and voice acting work that feels almost purposefully over the top and ham-y.

Some of the cutscenes do drag on, but there's an option to run the game sans cutscenes if all you want is to have fun and run the game again for time or simply just don't care about a story at all.\n\nThere are a lot of nice, professional polish touches to Freedom Planet. Many Bosses have cutscenes, but if you die you simply respawn a bit further back, and whne you approach the Boss they leap right into the combat without having to redo dialogue again.There are a ton of secrets, and everything is bright and well animated in lots of primary colors.  The game's pacing is frantic, but in a way that feels fun rather than rushed. Every level feels different in a good way, with new mechanics added almost before you've learned the last stage's unique playability.\n\nIt does have some problems though. Some might find the deviant-art-esque characters unappealing from an aesthetics point, and the dialogue can sometimes be cringeworthy. And certain environmental effects are instant-kills, which can be tempo-ruining, pulling you out of the game.

Every girl is capable of going blindingly fast, so much that it can be hard to keep up with them; they can use this speed to climb up walls, outrun enemies, and soar up to otherwise hard-to-reach areas. There's no RPG element - the characters have all the powers needed to clear the game from the moment you pick them.\n\nThe protagonists each have their own little quirks that come out in the game's many cutscenes. Those that do not like the voice acting will be pleased to know that every cutscene can be skipped - those who do like cutscenes will find a pleasantly colorful story. Opinions will vary as to whether or not the writing is good, though it is the likeable characters which help pull everything together. For a game that is trying to keep its rating child-friendly, the villain is also surprisingly brutal; where some villains are content to yell "I'll get you next time!" as the hero thwarts them, Lord Brevon acts as more of the "I don't think you really -need- to breathe right now" sort of antagonist.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game would have to be the astoundingly well done sound track. Moody tracks play during tense combat-heavy levels, whereas up-beat or thrilling songs play during faster levels. Many of these tracks are great to listen to even outside the game, ranging between atmospheric and electronica for a nice diverse blend of background music. With 3 hours with of very well done music, the soundtrack is worthy of consideration.\n\nLevels are well done and fun to go through. If one is more of an explorer, there are hidden nooks and crannies everywhere hiding little hidden power ups, crystals, and 'cards' that unlock sound files and concept art. If a person is the sort who prefers fast paced action, 'feeling' the level as they go, many of the levels challenge players to plow through them as fast as possible for the best time. Both the adrenaline junkie and the completionist will likely find a home in this game thanks to its wide yet free flowing design.\n\nAny criticism I have on the game is mostly nitpicking. I would have liked a proper borderless fullscreen mode [Edit: ten hours in, I found it], better volume control, and more importantly the ability to access the options menu while playing.\n\nI suppose I could also criticize the game's length, but I feel that is more of a testament to how enjoyable it is than an actual matter of content. At about 3.5 hours for a non-speed run playthrough, and of course a possible second or third playthrough with different characters, it still feels like we're only scratching the surface of what the world of Avalice has to offer. Heck, I'm itching for a sequel already, and this game has free DLC that has yet to be released.\n\nFreedom Planet is what an indie game -should- look like. Exciting, enthralling and imaginative, this is probably one of the best recent indie games to hit the proverbial shelves. Where some games pretentiously show off one quirky mechanic the developers came up with, Freedom Planet excels in multiple areas, managing to be great almost everywhere without being faulty anywhere.\n\nSome call it the new 'Sonic', and perhaps they're right. But maybe, just maybe, we may also be witnessing the start of something greater. A WiiU adaptation is already in the works as of this writing, and perhaps there will be more Freedom Planet in the future; we'll see.\n\nFor anyone looking for a little indie game that is not only adorable with its characters but also adrenaline-inducing in its gameplay, Freedom Planet is highly recommended.","May 22, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I tend to judge them too harshly, or as rip offs. This platformer is actually.... very good. Why is it very good? Because it's passionate. These creators didn't just make this game to sell or to be famous, they LIKED making it and it's apparent in every detail from the fluent controls, the entrancing backgrounds and interactables to the amazing soundtrack. Let's get to the breakdowns I guess -\n\nControls: The very essence of any platformer games, I judge this part the most harshly in any platformer game I play but here, well... The game controls great. There was never a time where I was frustrated from the controls, if you screw up, it's all on you, not because of input lag, or movement delays, feels like it should feel, like you're in control. Took me a while to get used to it too, since the characters don't control exactly how you would think they do. I enjoyed the fact that walking on walls is actually a thing, adds a whole new level of openness and exploration to the levels which I enjoyed greatly and it's done cleverly enough that you don't abuse it at every chance.\n\nVisuals: I can't even begin to describe how much effort was put into the visual design of each level, there's so much going on, but at the same time it's not TOO much that it's distracting. The sprites themselves are very well made and reflect the characters well enough. I would add a few more animations here and there for certain things, but all in all all of the enemies and characters are very well portrayed through visual means. The backgrounds are awesome, it's not just one big block that sticks in the background the whole time, no, they change with altitude and position and that's some thing I love. A lot of care was put into them and it shows.\n\nSounds and Music: I love the soundtrack. There's not much more to say, it has its own style, it varies from level to level and even within the same level, keeping your ears satisfied for the experience.\n\nVoice Acting: Never thought I'd need to put this for a platformer... The weak part of the game, I'm afraid, is the voice acting... My favorites really are Carol and Torque, Brevon gives a good effort too but still... Lilac, Magister, Milla, Neera.... I wasn't expecting professional voice acting, and it's not like the voices are bad or unclear... just that they're too much? I dunno, it feels odd to say that about cartoony characters but they don't feel like they belong. Magister especially with his deep narrator voice doesn't feel genuine on any level. I think a lot of the voice acting would be better if they were trying a little more underplay. Its usually loud and in your face, especially in the more emotional scenes. Its not bad enough to detract from the experience, but it makes you roll your eyes, at least it made me.\n\nStory: Not much to it, simple and to the point, predictable and linear. I think that's a good thing, keeps the atmosphere flowing and the action going.\n\nCharacters: I like them, they're each unique to play and control, each has their own abilities and movesets that diffrentiate their gameplay style a lot. Playing with Carol and her bike and Lilac are two different experiences entirely. Characters are portrayed pretty simplistically and not much is given about their background, which is a shame. I'd have hoped at least there'd be some bio for them. All we really know about the protagonists is that Carol and Lilac were part of a criminal group known as the Red Scarves, who were thieves led by Spade and that Lilac is a dragon. What happened to their parents? Where are they now? Why did they break off from the group? Not really explained. Otherwise each character's look and feel is unique and I like that.\n\nExtra Content: Collectibles of music, art and voices, not very interesting really. Aside from Adventure mode there's also another arcade sort of mode- no story, just playing. You can also unlock playing as Milla which is nice. Although I would have liked seeing the ability to play as other characters as well. Achievements aren't too complicated to get, providing that you have the time for it.\n\nAll in all it's a great game for old school sonic fans. I think this kind of platformer is a good example for today's capabilities and can hold attention very well. It's fun, flowing, quick, intense, everything you need in a good platformer. The platformer it most reminds me of, ironically is actually Megaman Zero \ZX with its different movesets, abilities, the incorporation of speed and exploration as well as story and cutscenes. To the creators - very well done. I think Sega can learn a few lessons from you about how to make a new sonic 2D platformer game. I really enjoyed it.","June 9, 2015","true","27.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is it. This is the game changer. This is a love letter to all the retro Saturn and Genesis fans.\n\nEvery playable character in this game is unique and has their own way of approaching each situation in a very smart way. The momentum never feels stale and the design is beautiful. If you don't have nostalgia for the era it probably won't grab you as much but it will still be appreciated. There's one stage that has a piano that you can step on - which ahs been done before in the Adnvace series I think but it's still nice to see it implemented into the game.\n\nI thought the story was going to be bad and with tired cliches that you usually see in these kinds of games and although some of them are present the overall story is surprisingly deep. The cutscenes are too long which I think a lot of people complain about. There seems to be a lot of filler and a lot of things could be told differently or cut out of the game all together, I'm glad it's there though, it was engaging and interesting.. and with the classic mode I can just play stage by stage while still retaining knowledge of what is happening. I feel like the adventure mode is a one time playthrough for me, to put everything into perspective. The real seller is the gameplay, and it does that very well.\n\nI definitely recommend this game! If you like platformers there's no reason that this shouldn't be in your library. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad it's here","June 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

All I can say is, wow, this has to be one of the greatest games I have ever played. It's like at my 3rd or 2nd all time favorite, and I'm debating whether I like this more than Mega Man X or not. And also, yes, this game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every aspect. Onto the review:\n\n-Graphics/Art: Probably some of the best spritework I've seen in a long time. It looks colorful, bright, and very fun. I also happen to think that the main characters Lilac, Carol, and (unlockable) Milla happen to look adorable to be quite honest.\n\n-Story: This isn't really the strongest point of the game, it's no Deus Ex-level storywriting. But it seems to be put together well enough where it's NOT cringe-worthy like your average Sonic game's story today. But the strongest point in the story-area is the characters, who happen to be quite well rounded and fun. For example: Lilac seems to be caring of others and determined to help them, even though she can have anger issues.\n\n-Gameplay: The thing you should be looking forwards to in this game by far. It has plenty of game modes and character variety for you to replay, as well many achievements to try and unlock. Also, have I mentioned that this game is FREAKING DIFFICULT? It's not Kaizo-level difficult, but more rationally difficult. And also, the bosses can be hard to fight. Especially with Brevon, Spade, and Serpentine it's hard. The enemies seem to have a good enough variety to push you over once you think you know how to stop all of the enemies.\n\n-Optimization: This game doesn't need the greatest PC to handle. Maybe a good monitor would make it better, but even when playing on a crappy 1152x648 monitor from CVS it looks great. So if you don't have the specs to play many 3D games, buy this!\n\nOverall, this game deserves my rating of 93%.

It brings back the feeling of amazement I once had playing Sonic the first first. I still remember sitting down with my first Sega game and listening to the crisp music, abosrbing those vibrant colors and beautifully designed levels. Moving so fast you got a true sense of motion Sonic really launched you into a whole new world that Mario never really touched upon. Freedom Planet has this same sense of wonder for me, the graphics are beautiful the controls perfect and the music and sound a delight for the ears. It is as if an A + developer made a new game for the Sega after all these years and put all their talent and heart into the creation. I cannot recommend this game enough, if you have any fond memories of Sega games or old pixel games in general you will not be disappointed.\n\nThat being said ths is NOT Sonic, your character cannot jump on the heads of the enemies instead you have to attack them with a button press, in a way it combines the fast pace platforming of Sonic with the perfectly timed attacks of Ninja Gaiden. Your charactrs have a large number of moves to help you get around and find hidden locations and they're so adorable!

Freedom is a like a Sonic style game done right. Sonic Team, look at this game and take notes!\n\nFreedom Planet is about the adventures of Lilac and Carol. The evil Lord Brevon have sent the planet into chaos in order to steal the kingdom stone. After Carol and Lilac meet Torque and Milla, they all join forces to foil Brevon evil plot. The story progresses like a Saturday morning cartoon, which for me wasn't a bad thing. I like that nostalgic feeling and brought me back to my younger days of watching cartoons where our heroes must stop the evil villian. With all the characters voiced, you can tell that the people who made this game had fun with this. Honestly it was a great story and worth playing again just to take it all in.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game really shine. This game doesn't have Freedom in the name for nothing. This not just linear 2D platformer. Often time I found myself going left, right, up, down, etc to reach my goal. So often do side scroller 2D platformers like Mario or Sonic just have the player go in one direction to reach the end. But with Freedom Planet, I found myself going in many directions, yet it always seem to progress me forward toward the goal of the level. You can play through the main story with either Carol and Lilac, each with their own style. Lilac plays as a Sonic like character; she can charge up and shoot herself at light speed in a direction and have a hover jump attack. Carol can climb up walls and zip through levels on her motorcycle. And if the play styles for these two characters wasn't enough to encourage a second playthrough, then you must also know that each character got a few unique levels to their single player. Second thing I like about these characters is when you play as Lilac, Carol or Milla may show up to help you attack a boss or give you some help. Sonic Team take note, this is how you should handle all of Sonic's friends. Don't force the player to learn their play style but rather have them show up to help you!\nTo make a long paragraph short, the gameplay style is fast pace and with challenges ranging from different type of enemies to just challenging platforming section. From the beginning to the ending level boss, you'll find yourself having fun with these levels.\n\nThis is what indie game should strive to be. This game is easily one of my all time favorite indie game. Between the story, voiced character, fun levels, challenging enemies, hidden items to find, and amazing soundtrack there really nothing to not like about this game. If this wasn't enough, there are more characters coming to game (from the stretch goals being met). I hope to see you all on Freedom Planet!\n","June 25, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It feels less like a fangame and more like a tribute to Sonic, among other games.\n\nYou got yer three characters: Lilac, who has the speed-based abilities suitable for being the Sonic-esque character; Carol, who has Chun Li kicks and a Mega Man X walljump, basically the Capcom character; and Milla.\n\nIdfk about Milla, but she can toss blocks at people and shoot short-ranged beams, which is pretty cool, and I can't really compare her to anything beyond that. Mario 2? Idunno\n\nThe level design is great, the environments are interesting, and the soundtrack is fantastic. But my main issue is with Lilac. As another reviewer pointed out, the level designs, while great, don't always feel suited to Lilac's abilities. They feel suited to SONIC's abilities, which would be fine if Lilac were Sonic. But she's not. She has a Rocket Knight dash and a kick. These things also ♥♥♥♥ up her momentum while she's going at high speeds (while the rocket dash does build up speed, she loses a lot of when it stops) and without a spindash there's no real reliable way for her to pick up speed, so she's left awkwardly walking up ramps.\nOkay. Not a dealbreaker though, it's plenty of fun.\n\nThere's also a story mode with cutscenes about the same length as the actual stages and voice acting. You can choose to play it that way or just run through the levels in Classic Mode. Personally, I'd go classic mode. The story isn't particularly interesting. They don't give you much reason to like the characters, part of that makes me feel it's the voice acting's fault. If there were no voice acting I might like it better. The voices fit but that doesn't mean I wanted them. Could you imagine playing through Sonic 3 with little voiced sprite conversations between him and Knuckles? It doesn't really feel right, it takes away from the charm of the characters.\nI found Lilac's whole "GIRL POWER"-ish attitude and mannerisms annoying as all hell, and I think that might be part of the problem as well. The trio feels too stereotypically girly. I'm not necessarily saying everyone needs to become manly, but the game might as well have sparkles and glitter everywhere. There's typical girl friendship drama where they break down and start crying over stupid things, and when they get sad they get sad. It might as well not be there because it doesn't help the experience at all, it hurts it like hell. They don't have legitimate emotional issues that make it worth caring about. They may care, but the AUDIENCE does not, and that's the problem. Shantae doesn't break down and start crying over meaningless friendship dynamics or carry herself as a TOTALLY GURL female. Neither does Bayonetta. It's okay for emotional drama but it needs to come along in a point where we're adjusted to these characters and can actually FEEL with them. Emotional drama out of nowhere when we can't particularly relate is just awkward and cheesy. The game doesn't give us enough time to start liking and appreciating the characters, it just tosses us a few cutscenes involving them doing stuff and then all of a sudden BAM EMOTIONS, like we're supposed to relate to these guys. Maybe this would have worked better in a second game, when Lilac and Carol's friendship would have been much more established. Come on now. The story does have its moments though, and I won't go into detail on those.\n\nProbably the only truly enjoyable and great character is the main villain, Lord Brevon, who is a genuinely smart villain, one Robotnik and Wily should take cues from. He's genre-savvy and fun to listen to, to the point where this game doesn't even deserve to have him in it. He's always steps ahead of the protagonists and isn't afraid to tear them apart emotionally, as well as find creative ways around problems and use his brain to ensure he wins. He loses in the end, like all stories go but he's probably one of my favorite examples of a villain. In fact, he's so feared he tore off Robotnik's mustache and wore it over his eyebrows.\n\nThis doesn't hurt the core gameplay but the Story Mode was kind of advertised as a big thing, effectively it's a chunk of the game that deserves as much critique as the rest of it. After beating it there isn't much left besides beating it on harder difficulties or different characters unless you're a speedrunner or something (or want to get all the gallery unlockables, which are just awkward voice clips, the awesome soundtrack and some concept art)\n\nRegardless, it's pretty damn fun and the music and nice visuals are more than enough to make up for the incredibly sucky story. I'd get it, if you CAN, wait for a sale but whatever, get it.","May 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All I can say is, wow, this has to be one of the greatest games I have ever played. It's like at my 3rd or 2nd all time favorite, and I'm debating whether I like this more than Mega Man X or not. And also, yes, this game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every aspect. Onto the review:\n\n-Graphics/Art: Probably some of the best spritework I've seen in a long time. It looks colorful, bright, and very fun. I also happen to think that the main characters Lilac, Carol, and (unlockable) Milla happen to look adorable to be quite honest.\n\n-Story: This isn't really the strongest point of the game, it's no Deus Ex-level storywriting. But it seems to be put together well enough where it's NOT cringe-worthy like your average Sonic game's story today. But the strongest point in the story-area is the characters, who happen to be quite well rounded and fun. For example: Lilac seems to be caring of others and determined to help them, even though she can have anger issues.\n\n-Gameplay: The thing you should be looking forwards to in this game by far. It has plenty of game modes and character variety for you to replay, as well many achievements to try and unlock. Also, have I mentioned that this game is FREAKING DIFFICULT? It's not Kaizo-level difficult, but more rationally difficult. And also, the bosses can be hard to fight. Especially with Brevon, Spade, and Serpentine it's hard. The enemies seem to have a good enough variety to push you over once you think you know how to stop all of the enemies.\n\n-Optimization: This game doesn't need the greatest PC to handle. Maybe a good monitor would make it better, but even when playing on a crappy 1152x648 monitor from CVS it looks great. So if you don't have the specs to play many 3D games, buy this!\n\nOverall, this game deserves my rating of 93%.

Initially a Sonic fangame, it eventually evolved into its own amazing thing. Think Sonic meets Rocket Knight and you're on the right track. What makes it amazing is that these people are CLEARLY hardcore Treasure fans and I do NOT throw that around lightly. There's a difference between "We were inspired by Treasure" (which I swear EVERYONE says) and "We STUDIED Treasure". It's like they refused to finish the game unless they themselves were blown away or something!\n\nAs for that "pesky" story? Guess what? You can turn it off. When you start a new game you get a choice of "Adventure" or "Classic" mode. Classic removes all the cutscenes. Mind you the story is pretty solid and the voicework is at worst on-par with Working Designs but if you REALLY hate it? Turn it off.\n\nThe pixel art is phenomenal, the music is great, the gameplay is fast-pace, responsive, and fun. The stages are incredibly varied, the amount of enemies is unbelieveable, and the game is LONG. This is the single greatest Indie Game I have ever played. No joke.\n\nThe fact that this isn't getting more love is outright criminal. This is the digital equivalent of Shantae in that respect, a game that gets tons of praise but nobody plays and then 10 years later is worth $300 on EBay. It's a shame this doesn't have a physical release because yes, it seriously would be one of those.\n\nGet it. Just...get it.

That's why we just don't see games like this as much anymore. Which makes me sad, because games that are this well made are truly an experience.\n\nIt feels fantastic to play this game. At times, I would forget that the objective was to go as fast as possible. Instead, I would want to wander around the stages, collecting happy colors and sound effects. It's apparent from the beginning just how much work went into this game. It's staggering. Everything blends together into a satisfying mesh of speed and wonder. Gameplay is fine tuned and polished; to the point I was sad that it had to end sometime.\n\nNow, this game is by no means perfect. I do have to bring up some issues. Character development, namely. The game has good character design, but doesn't know how to develop these characters; leading to flat one note personalities. In a game that obviously wants you to care about these characters, it sure has a hard time giving us a reason to. Cutscenes don't reveal anything remotely important about these characters beyond the basics; and by the time endgame came around, I was flipping through mindlessly until the next stage started. Side characters are even more worthless, which is a shame.\n\nA few other minor complaints here and there: having to hear "Cyclone!" every half minute is annoying, but easy to ignore once you're engrossed in the gameplay and the setting. There's also some reused assets here and there; and honestly it didn't bother me a lot aside from a few choice moments in the game. There's something to be said about a game that can make you disregard reused assets.\n\nWhen I examine the fine details of this game, I see a lot of ideas that were interesting. Most of the time, Freedom Planet is a fun ride. But, it fails in its additional ambitions. However. when I look at the big picture, I see a game that tried to be proficient in everything; but still managed to be good game overall.","January 1","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s just that good.\n\nFreedom Planet.\n\nFreedom; a word the evokes uninhibited exploration. Planet; a word used to describe worlds so big, Pluto doesn’t make the cut anymore. Get ready to explore a sprawling Metroidvania that is worthy of its title... what? It’s a level-by-level platformer with no upgrades? Then why is it called Freedom Pla [cut]\n\nWelcome to planet Avalice. Embark on an epic two-and-a-half hour adventure with your choice of character. Blaze through over ten stages as Girl Sonic…-Ristar...-Gunstar...-Ryu...-Dragon... Okay, that’s awesome. Leave something for your sidekick, why don’t you? [clip of sidekick driving a motorcycle up a wall] Nevermind.\n\nUse your skills to speed through huge lovingly detailed levels with multiple paths, then spend eighty percent of your time stuck trying to defeat bosses again and again in vain because you’re too stubborn to lower the difficulty.

Hydrocity Zone? You know, that zone with the cool spiral elevators in it. They’re in this game.\n\nThen watch it burn your childhood nostalgia into a crisp by pointing out all the problems your favourite games had, and fixing them with simple features like: difficulty selection, more than one useful move per character, a perky 1-up jingle that only plays when the mood calls for it, a reasonable difficulty curve that ****s with you on purpose instead of drunkenly stumbling between too easy and too hard, the ability to pause cut-scenes, the ability to skip cut-scenes, the ability to not accidentally skip cut-scenes just by looking at the controller funny, an icon that tells you when something’s about to kill you from off-screen WHY DON’T SONIC GAMES EVER HAVE THOSE?! [breath], and swimming.\n\nUse your cunning to conserve your health bar and cherish health pick-ups like water in a desert… or play on Easy and watch as your health regenerates before your eyes. You might as well; the achievements don’t care. And you can change the difficulty any time you want. See? This cleared save file has 100 deaths because I played on Normal, but do you see the word “Normal” anywhere on there? For all you know, I lost all those lives on Casual. But trust me, you guys, it was on Normal.\n\nCringe, at a, well, honestly, a surprisingly well-fitting story featuring: Decapitations, Brainwashing, Worldwide War, Making New Friends, Political Intrigue, Wholesale Asskicking, Playful Teasing, Horrifying Mutations, Cold-Blooded Torture, and All-You-Can-Eat Sushi. Mmmmm. Sewwwwsh.\n\nOnce you’ve played out the Adventure Mode, take on a variety of extra modes such as: Classic Mode, which is Adventure Mode minus the cutscenes, Time Attack Mode, which is Classic Mode plus a level select menu, and… ummmm…\n\nThen, hunt for 100 cards hidden throughout the game, and try to collect the achievements, which are one part speedruns, one part card collection, one part challenges that would be tough if you couldn’t do them on any difficulty, and three parts wacky bull**** like “notice our dance easter egg”, “let the AI partner get the last hit on this boss”, and the ultimate bragging rights reward: “stand on a ledge.”\n\nBut seriously you guys, you think I’d write a review this long for a game I think is just ok?

Why are you still reading this? The only people still reading this and not playing this game are people who hate fun and joy.\n\n\nSo, do you like Sonic in not a creepy furry way? Do you wish Sonic 3 had way better music? And that the back ground had a ton more stuff to do in it and alot more detail? Have you ever said "Man I wish my sprite was kinda peppy and would dance in the presence of a disco ball!" If so then this is the game for you. Its smooth, looks amazing, plays amazing, and takes allt eh cool stuff of the sonic series and several other platformers from way back when and just makes them new and fun all over again. Every level Iw as finding some new back ground item I could mess with or something new to do. The mechanics were solid and best of all, my game pad works perfect with it. I want to call it a nostalgia bomb, but really, its so good it really holds up on its own.\n\nBuy this game.","April 20, 2015","true","23.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Well, get ready for the indie game that your friend insists is one of the best games ever, and plays once every THREE years! It’s just that good.\n\nFreedom Planet.\n\nFreedom; a word the evokes uninhibited exploration. Planet; a word used to describe worlds so big, Pluto doesn’t make the cut anymore. Get ready to explore a sprawling Metroidvania that is worthy of its title... what? It’s a level-by-level platformer with no upgrades? Then why is it called Freedom Pla [cut]\n\nWelcome to planet Avalice. Embark on an epic two-and-a-half hour adventure with your choice of character. Blaze through over ten stages as Girl Sonic…-Ristar...-Gunstar...-Ryu...-Dragon... Okay, that’s awesome. Leave something for your sidekick, why don’t you? [clip of sidekick driving a motorcycle up a wall] Nevermind.\n\nUse your skills to speed through huge lovingly detailed levels with multiple paths, then spend eighty percent of your time stuck trying to defeat bosses again and again in vain because you’re too stubborn to lower the difficulty. Ughh, how am I supposed to beat this guy?! He just punches out of nowhere and takes half my health! I’m not even playing on Hard! Patch this already! Oh good, they did. All right! Time to download… wait, I already have it? NOOOOOOOO [cut]\n\nGet ready to experience a loving homage to Sonic, Ristar, Treasure, and every other awesome Sega Genesis \ Mega Drive and Saturn game every made, with quarter-pipes, crazy loop-de-loop structures, high-speed launches,  sweet music and sound effects, elemental shields, the dread of running out of oxygen, really big lasers, really big explosions, really big bosses that shake the screen when they attack and lag the framerate when they die,  and those cool spiral elevators that were in..,. uh… Launch Base Zone? Hydrocity Zone? You know, that zone with the cool spiral elevators in it. They’re in this game.\n\nThen watch it burn your childhood nostalgia into a crisp by pointing out all the problems your favourite games had, and fixing them with simple features like: difficulty selection, more than one useful move per character, a perky 1-up jingle that only plays when the mood calls for it, a reasonable difficulty curve that ****s with you on purpose instead of drunkenly stumbling between too easy and too hard, the ability to pause cut-scenes, the ability to skip cut-scenes, the ability to not accidentally skip cut-scenes just by looking at the controller funny, an icon that tells you when something’s about to kill you from off-screen WHY DON’T SONIC GAMES EVER HAVE THOSE?! [breath], and swimming.\n\nUse your cunning to conserve your health bar and cherish health pick-ups like water in a desert… or play on Easy and watch as your health regenerates before your eyes. You might as well; the achievements don’t care. And you can change the difficulty any time you want. See? This cleared save file has 100 deaths because I played on Normal, but do you see the word “Normal” anywhere on there? For all you know, I lost all those lives on Casual. But trust me, you guys, it was on Normal.\n\nCringe, at a, well, honestly, a surprisingly well-fitting story featuring: Decapitations, Brainwashing, Worldwide War, Making New Friends, Political Intrigue, Wholesale Asskicking, Playful Teasing, Horrifying Mutations, Cold-Blooded Torture, and All-You-Can-Eat Sushi. Mmmmm. Sewwwwsh.\n\nOnce you’ve played out the Adventure Mode, take on a variety of extra modes such as: Classic Mode, which is Adventure Mode minus the cutscenes, Time Attack Mode, which is Classic Mode plus a level select menu, and… ummmm…\n\nThen, hunt for 100 cards hidden throughout the game, and try to collect the achievements, which are one part speedruns, one part card collection, one part challenges that would be tough if you couldn’t do them on any difficulty, and three parts wacky bull**** like “notice our dance easter egg”, “let the AI partner get the last hit on this boss”, and the ultimate bragging rights reward: “stand on a ledge.”\n\nBut seriously you guys, you think I’d write a review this long for a game I think is just ok? No. It’s tons of fun.

The controls and movesets are great, the physics will seem pretty familiar to Sonic 3 fans, the level designs are imaginative, there's a decent story if you're like me and enjoy that sort of thing (skippable if you don't), the levels are vast and bosses/minibosses are frequent and clever.

All I can say is, wow, this has to be one of the greatest games I have ever played. It's like at my 3rd or 2nd all time favorite, and I'm debating whether I like this more than Mega Man X or not. And also, yes, this game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every aspect. Onto the review:\n\n-Graphics/Art: Probably some of the best spritework I've seen in a long time. It looks colorful, bright, and very fun. I also happen to think that the main characters Lilac, Carol, and (unlockable) Milla happen to look adorable to be quite honest.\n\n-Story: This isn't really the strongest point of the game, it's no Deus Ex-level storywriting. But it seems to be put together well enough where it's NOT cringe-worthy like your average Sonic game's story today. But the strongest point in the story-area is the characters, who happen to be quite well rounded and fun. For example: Lilac seems to be caring of others and determined to help them, even though she can have anger issues.\n\n-Gameplay: The thing you should be looking forwards to in this game by far. It has plenty of game modes and character variety for you to replay, as well many achievements to try and unlock. Also, have I mentioned that this game is FREAKING DIFFICULT? It's not Kaizo-level difficult, but more rationally difficult. And also, the bosses can be hard to fight. Especially with Brevon, Spade, and Serpentine it's hard. The enemies seem to have a good enough variety to push you over once you think you know how to stop all of the enemies.\n\n-Optimization: This game doesn't need the greatest PC to handle. Maybe a good monitor would make it better, but even when playing on a crappy 1152x648 monitor from CVS it looks great. So if you don't have the specs to play many 3D games, buy this!\n\nOverall, this game deserves my rating of 93%.

Go try it, then buy it :3\n\n*Edit*\nI'll explain in a wall of text why you should try it anyway XD (TLDR, buy it!)\nIt may seem like a Sonic clone a first glance, but that's far from the truth. This game takes elements from 2D action games from the 90's and impressively manages to stand on its own as not just a great 2D action game, but also one of the best in the genre.\nThe gameplay features speedy platforming similar to Sonic's 1-3, but also mixes it up with satisfying combat. Each character also has different moves. Lilac has the powerful Dragon Boost that allows her to charge through enemies and bounce on solid objects, plus a Cyclone spin that can be used to kill enemies above or get up to higher ground.\nCarol can use her claws to scratch enemies or can do a powerful pouncing slash. You found a gas-can as Carol? Grab it to summon her physics-defying motorcycle!\nMilla can construct a shield or a throwable block of death. Combine the two and she now has a laser attack! She can also fly for a bit and find items buried in the ground.\nThe game also has an awesome soundtrack(my favorites being Fortune Night and Sky Battalion).\n\nThe only problems this game has (though the pros heavily outweigh the cons) is that the story is kinda run of the mill and basic (and has a few cutscenes that last way too long), and the fact that lives don't matter since you start at the checkpint after pressing continue anyway.\nThe lives issue can be fixed if enough people ask about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paranomaly/recommended/248310/","Paranomaly","Codere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paranomaly/","347 products in account","This game is an interesting Sonic inspired game that has a lot of good things going for it with only the occasional fault causing a bit of distraction in what is otherwise a very fun experience. As of writing this I have only played from Lilac's route so will be using that as my baseline.\n\nThe game is a very solid platformer that has a good mix of enemies, items, platforming areas, and areas of rewarding speed. The bosses are interesting, diverse, and are difficult enough to challenge while not so hard as to be frustrating. The gameplay overall is very satisfying and the key strength of this title. It is fun to play and proves that at least someone knows how to make a Sonic-like game.\n\nThe design of the game is interesting, as I can not tell whether or not I like it. The character designs are very reminiscent of the Sonic series not only in their anthropomorphism but in the proportions and sizes as well. The pallette that was chosen is very diverse and pleasing, characters standing out and the levels feeling very distinct from one another. While I generally like most of the character designs, I have found several instances of animations or sprites that could use improvement, for example the most common seen within a game of this type: running. Lilac runs with her arms spread behind her which leads to a still top half and her feet stop as they hit the ground. This gives a bit of an odd feeling to the game at times and distracts from the goodpoints of the game. This is, admittedly, a nitpick, but worthy of attention as a lot of praise is being given to the spritework of the game.\n\nThe voice acting in the game has both strong points and weak points. The voice cast chosen are all very capable voice actors and actresses which is good to see. I am not used to the bright, anthropomorphised characters with rather normal voices, but this is simply a personal issue that many might not find troubling. The voice of Lilac can occasionally grate by simple fact of her chatter in the game. Specifically, yelling 'Cyclone!' every time you use the jump extension technique, which in my case is very frequently. Again, a very small complaint, but can be quite distracting at times.\n\nThe writing is a bit... cheesy. I personally am not a fan of most of the dialog. While not painfully bad by any means, it comes off as very adolescent at times to which I am not personally a fan. This may not bother many people though, as again the voice acting is done well and even through the criticism here I wouldn't call the writing horrible. The world it takes place in is a mix of Chinese and Japanese culture. Much more leaning towards China, really, with the occasional interjection of Japanese as well. Personally, this comes off as a bit confused and I would have liked to see a stricter choice to one or the other extremes. I do not think that a mix is bad, just that it was not realized to an extent that justified the mix in this case.\n\nOverall all the complaints are rather minor, as I do find the game fun to play. Something which, in the end, is the most important part of any game. I enjoy playing and think that it is worth the full price even before delving into the other characters available.","June 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItalianGamer97/recommended/248310/","ItalianGamer97","ItalianGamer97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItalianGamer97/","4 products in account","Freedom Planet! What a game!\n\nNow, you may initially dismiss this as a mere Sonic clone, but take a closer look and you'll find that it's not only a good game on it's own, but also coincidentally better than anything Sega put out recently...\n\nAnyways, back to Freedom Planet: It's a very high-quality neo-retro game that takes inspiration from classic 90's era games, such as Sonic, Gunstar Heroes, Mega Man X, Ristar, Rocket Knight/Sparkster, and even little bits of Super Mario 2 and Yoshi's Island.\n\nThe game's graphics have a nice retro style to them. I really dig the 16/32-bit style games from the 90's, so I guess that's a plus for me. The characters look pretty good, and can be very expressionate, especially in cutscenes, which I dig the in-engine style of.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is kick-♥♥♥, chock-full of memorable tunes. I find the voice acting to be pretty good, but I've heard complaints about the King's performance and background noise for Carol's lines. I suppose I can agree on the former, but the latter's mostly a non-issue for me... All the VAs did a great job, especially Lilac's VA, Dawn M. Bennett, and Torque's VA, Patrick Seymour. If you don't really dig the voice acting, you should at least give them an A for effort.\n\nI personally think the story's pretty good. Although I could see why people would complain about its pacing and the length of some of the game's cutscenes... It has its moments, such as the introduction to Milla being adorable as hell, and even the tragic and/or sad scenes of Lilac's torture at the end of Thermal Base, the scene where Milla seemingly dies at the hands of Brevon, the game's main antagonist, and Lilac and Carol's falling out at the end of Jade Creek.\n\nThe controls are nice and pretty tight. On my Xbox 360 controller, I found it best to use the analog stick, since the d-pad is a bit butts. I have my button configuration for this game matching my button config for my Sega Genesis emulator, but you can change the button config to however you want it to be...\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, minus a few quirks in the physics engine, but I found some of those quirks useful in gameplay, so they aren't necessarily a bad thing in my book.\n\nAs for the selection of playable characters available, you have three options as of now:\n\n-Lilac the Dragon, who is the most Sonic-like out of the three. She's the fastest on foot, and her standard attack involves using her hair/tendrils like a whip. She also has a Cyclone ability, is not only a double-jump, but also allows you to attack enemies on both your left and right. In the air, she can do a drop-kick. If on the ground, she can perform a move called the "Rising Slash", which is her strongest non-special attack. And her signature special move, the Dragon Boost, allows her to gain speed quickly, be invincible for a brief time, and bounce off of walls. And here's a little-known tidbit: You can use the Cyclone on the ground by holding down and B while running. She's my personal favorite out of the three main girls. Why? Because she's a dragon. And I like dragons. She's got a great personality too, willing to help out anyone in need like a heroine-to-be should. She's a bit arrogant in the beginning, but she has a rude awakening by the hands of Lord Brevon, the game's big bad, which I won't spoil here...\n\n-Carol the Wildcat is quite a lot like Zero from the Mega Man X series, mostly because she relies on close-quarters combat. She can wall-jump like Mega Man X, and can roll like Sonic does. Her special is a rapid-fire kick dubbed the "Wild Kick", and she has access to a motorbike, which will make her faster, and give her a new aerial attack. My main complaint with her is that the Wild Kick depletes too fast and recharges too slowly for my tastes... That and her standard attacks feel a bit weak... Her personality and/or voice might annoy some, but I'm fine with it. She's a tomboyish character, and some people might be into those type of characters... But I know a kid who's so infatuated with her that he ended up kinda-sorta marrying her. I ♥♥♥♥ ye not. I joke about Carol being that kid's waifu, but I'm pretty sure he'll get over it... and I think the kid may have control over his feelings for Carol, but I somewhat doubt it...\n\n-Milla the Hound is a bit of an oddball out of the bunch, relying on projectiles instead of up-close combat. She can flutter-jump like Yoshi from Yoshi's Island, and her attacks involve the usage of shield bursts and things called Phantom Blocks, which we like to call "Murder Cubes". She can unleash a giant long-range laser called the "Super Shield Burst" by first spawning a cube, lowering her shield, and releasing it for maximum damage, with some knockback that could be used for speedrunning. Her standard shield burst is a bit dinky, only shooting a short-range laser. If you use her properly, you can absolutely wreck some bosses. However, this power has a bit of a major drawback: Milla has only half the health that Lilac and Carol does. Translation? She's pretty much a glass cannon in fluffy puppy form... She's adorable as hell, and people who'd rather want Milla to have died at the end of the game are soulless, heartless monsters.\n\nIt's very refreshing to see female protagonists in a game of a genre dominated by male protagonists... But, if they don't sound like your cup of tea, there will be two more characters available in the future, whom will play very differently from the girls. One is Torque, with what i've seen of his gameplay style being a lot like the classic Mega Man games, being projectile-based as well. Another is Spade, whom seems to have a unique style. I played him by hacking a demo version of the game, but I get Custom Robo vibes from him, especially with his air-dashes, but Torque and Spade may change upon release...\n\nOverall, Freedom Planet's a pretty great game. It may have its flaws, but once you look past them, you have an excellent gem of a game. Hell, this is not only my favorite indie game as of when I made this review, but also one of my favorite games of all time period.

This is one of those games that makes you wonder why Sega can't make a good Sonic game anymore. This game didn't have a huge budget, experienced developers, or a huge fan-base that would buy their game just cause 'it's Sonic.' Yet it still was met with huge success and ended up as one of the top reviewed games on all of Steam in it's first opening week.\n\nI actually didn't like the balancing on the playable characters, Lilac, Carol, and Milna. Lilac is pretty much the only character worth playing with by-far the best special attack in the game. It boosts you across the screen, making it easy to hit enemies with it, and it gives you long invincibility frames that make dodging attacks easy. Now playing as Lilac or Carol will slightly change the storyline and you have to beat the game as both to get the full picture.\n\nPersonally I liked Carol but there isn't much purpose in playing her as compared to Lilac. Her special attack deals a decent amount... if the enemy just stands there the whole time and lets you do it. The invincibility frames for her special are very short as well causing you to have to time it just right to dodge attacks. She also gets a motorcycle but it gets destroyed so quickly and you find them so rarely that it's usefulness is very limited.\n\nPoor Milna... Not only does she have the worst and most useless move-set in the game, but she has half the health of the other characters. Why would they design a character like that in a game that's already hard enough? She has no story mode so you don't have to play her to get the full story so you don't have to torture yourself trying to play her. I've mostly found her most useful to find the collectibles in each level as she is a dog... that has flight for some reason lol.\n\nThis game is crazy hard with the average death count for the final boss to be around 100+, I died about 50 times to him. Though that's just on normal mode, I usually try to stay on casual mode now so I'm not killing myself trying to beat bosses. There is also alot of collectibles to find in each level and the storyline is pretty good for a kids game. Levels are also fairly long (takes me about 20 minutes a level, but can be done in about 5-10) but they're all decently unique and fun and fast-paced the whole way through. Springs don't really seem to match the old Sonic games though, most of them are plain-out useless overall.\n\nAll in all though I suggest you do believe the hype about this game, it's rare I hear a bad review about it. On sale you're gonna spend about $5-$7 for a very enjoyable experience! 4/5","July 18, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Good in short doses because too often you wanna drop it for the day when theres no obvious path to take unlike earlier Sonic games. The story is cringe worthy and so is the voice acting.

Not only is this game a calll back to all the games that I grew up with, but the absolute fun oriented with the gameplay is fantastic. While I know that this is a common sellingpoint for this game, I'd say it goes deeper than just retro style enjoyment. The music and characters are all amazing, creating actuall personalities while still maintainging an ecellent pase to the game. While the story might be the weakest part to this package, the plot is still much better than some modern games that follow similar game styles. I ftill found myself genuinely caring for the heroines, and at the same time disliking the villians. Props to the voice actors as well. This game contains well designed and thought out levels, with tough and fun boss fights to end out the action. Often, there are games that have trouble maintaining a level of difficulty without making it too hard. Freedom Planet has no trouble with this. The difficulty is very stream lined, and is incredible near the end. Don't fear though, because if the difficulty gets to hard, you can always turn it down in the options. This game even includes a casual difficulty.\nThere are tons of things too do wihtin the premise of this game. There are OPTIONAL collectibles and a vast number of hidden secrets. I had tons of fun finding these. In addtion, (and a personal favorite) there is a Majong minigame within the stage select screen.\n\nFreedom Planet is a downright amazing game that I suggest you chech out. The people at Galaxy way were really on their toes. I look forward too a sequel.\n","June 19, 2015","true","77.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have no nostalgia for Sonic, and  no fondness for the anthro-animal thing (I have some bias against if anything). So Freedom Planet had to earn a recommendation IN SPITE of these two things, rather than because of them.\n\nAnd man, did it easily do so.\n\nThis is probably my favorite "action platformer" on steam. And while the amazing music (boss theme is superb), well designed levels, and memorable boss battles all play a role, the thing that stands out most to me are two things.\n\n1. How earnest the game is.\n\nYou can tell the developers put absolutely everything they had into this. Not everything was a homerun (voice acting for example is a mixed bag), but it is easy to forgive when you see the entire package. Games are a product and you can't give a  developer a pass because "they tried"- a bad game would be a bad game regardless. The passion permeating this game takes a good game and makes the experience outstanding.\n\n2. "Stand up and cheer" moments.\n\nA "stand up and cheer moment" is when you as the player want to stop what you are doing and stand up and cheer because something was so friggin' awesome. Even games that I love dearly may noy have ANY of these, but this game has several. On paper they may sound bland, but when you experience them they are powerful.\n\n(Minor "spoiler"). One of these happens in an early boss battle while you are being hounded by a huge boss. One of your buddies flies in with a plane and lets another character drop some health for you. Meanwhile another buddy periodically runs out onto the screen and attacks the boss, until they get hit and have to run away for a bit.\n\nThat does not sound too exciting- the health thing could be done identically by just having a couple health items spawn in front of you, and I am not positive your attacking buddy even does any damage. We have all played games with these sorts of "helper" NPCs before. But hot dang, the game SELLS it. The HP drops feels like an ally desperately trying to help you in a time of need, and your attacking buddy feels like she is doing everything she can to assist you but getting pushed back. When the boss fell the party cheered, and I cheered inside too.\n\nSo in short- buy it.","July 15, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RIPZero/recommended/248310/","RIPZero","TheMLGReploid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RIPZero/","43 products in account","Freedom Planet, it was originally a Sonic fan-game, but over time grew into its own IP, and that's what you see right here. However, the game still seems to get a lot of flak for being like Sonic, and outside of the art style, and a few in-game references, it hasn't got a lot ot do with Sonic. I see references to Megaman, Gunstar Heroes, Rocket Knight Adventures and a couple other games. The question still remains though, is it good? Well...\n\nStory: I'm not going to directly say any events in the story, since that would spoil it. I will however say that it's pretty good for the most part. While a couple parallels can be drawn to Sonic, it does have a lot of elements of its own and the story itself is decent enough. It isn't exactly what motivates you to keep playing, but it still gives the levels context and is entertaining. I legitemately cared about the story the whole time, though at some points it is quite tongue-in cheek, the plot is much better than most of the Sonic games. Unlike the Sonic games with a good story however, it has fantastic gameplay too. There is a lack of backstory to the characters though, there is some given but they are never expanded on. One complaint that some people have is one certain part of the story being much too dark, but if you ask me that scene just goes to show how serious the villain is and that while the game can be, it isn't all light-hearted fun. Some people complain about the voice acting, but other than one awkward scene and something that was a result of cheesy writing rather than bad voice acting I don't have any problem with it. Said cheesy writing was a reference to Castlevania: Symphony of The Night anyways. If you still hate the story for whatever reason, you can just play classic mode instead, which completely removes all the cutscenes. As I said before, not award winning, but it does its job quite well.\n7/10\n\nGameplay: This is one of the games strong points, while some might draw paralells to Sonic here as well for some high-speed sections, overall the game puts the gimmicky "blast processing" platforming on the back shelf and lets the player explore. It's not open world or anything, but each level is quite expansive and allow for a lot of exploration, and with 3 characters, each with unique abilities replaying a certain level with another character feels quite different, and there are 2 more characters on their way for free, which will give the game even more replay value. The game also has 4 difficulty settings, so players don't need to deal with the game being too hard if they don't want to, but for those seeking a challenge Freedom Planet lives up to Sonic's difficulty torwards the end. It isn't perfect however, the game does suffer from flat out weird physics because it uses a modified version of the "Sonic Worlds engine", and there are a few minor glitches, but for the most part the game is polished and the few minor glitches that there are don't hurt the game, but are rather just a funny distraction.\n8/10\n\nPresentation: The Pixel art in this game is fantastic, plain and simple. Most of the characters are very detailed, the backgrounds and environments are beautiful, you get the idea. However some character sprites are lacking some details and I can't just ignore that, it seems like they rushed the launch just a little bit.Alongside these otherwise excellent visuals you also have some damn fine music to go along with it, each song is unique while still fitting the situation and being good in its own right, and it is one of my favorite soundtracks to any game ever, up there with the incredible compositions of David Wise for DKC and the orchestral metal of Orcs Must Die! My favorite songs being Boss Battle 1 and Final Dreadnought Round 1 kick some serious ♥♥♥, though I suggest you don't listen to them until after you've heard them in game, they add so much intensity that I can't find words to describe it. This game is just a pleasure to watch/listen to, I don't think it would be quite as enjoyable if the game didn't have such fantastic presentation.\n9/10\n\nOverall, Freedom Planet is an excellent platformer with great characters, great art, great gameplay, great... well, everything. It's not perfect, but for Galaxy Trails' first game I don't think it could have been much better. Don't let all the criticisms of it being a sonic clone stop you from enjoying it, and to point out just a few things it does differently, you don't have anything like rings, your life is displayed by petals serving as the icons. Enemies don't hurt you by touching them, they need to actually attack, you have a variety of moves, some of which consume energy from your special meter, etc.\n\nThe point is that too many poeple brush this game off as a Sonic clone/rip-off, but it's much different, and a lot better than any recent Sonic game. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just don't come in with negative expectations and I'm sure you'll have a great time with it.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10","July 17, 2015","true","42.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Every stage packs a new set of obstacles and gimmicks that make each one memerable, and really build up to the final stages in terms of difficulty! The game especially does well in its boss battles feeling rather thoughtful and satisfying to beat!\n\nThe presentation is superb with a rather vibrant quality to the sprite art, accompanied by a stellar soundtrack covering the appropriate mood and memerable melodies. The cutscenes were suprisingly well done with voice acting that sticks with you, my personal favorite being Lord Brevon, It feels like he's having fun being the apitamy of evil, and the cyborg tone to him makes it all the better!\n\nMy only criticisms being the fact Milla at this point only has a classic mode, and the lack of invunerability time makes it feel a bit painful at times. Plus the physics can feel a bit unatural when a character doesn't always slide down a slope.\nOther than that there's not much to complain about, It's a game that left a very positive influence on me and I look forward to Galaxy Trail's future projects!\n\nAlso Its one of the few game's where I went achivement hunting and bought the soundtrack.

I got a pretty strong nostalgia kick partway through the first level of when I used to play Sonic back on the Genesis - but Freedom Planet has plenty of its own features to make it a distinct title all its own.\n\nThere are several subtle but challenging twists that appear throughout some of the levels that show a large amount of creativity on the part of the developers.  Without spoiling things, one example appears later in the game on a stage set on a spaceship.  The oxygen is cut off on that portion of the ship, leaving you with a limited amount of time to race to the end of that segment.  They throw several enemies at you in the meantime, really increasing the tension and keeping you on your toes with puzzles like locked doors.  You eventually get a shield that keeps your air gauge from depleting, but the area then becomes filled with several enemies and environmental hazards like spiked balls and death rays, forcing you to still progress quickly through the stage while also giving you a real incentive for thinking on your next actions.\n\nThere are several of these small tweaks to each of the expansive levels that keeps the game from feeling too monotonous, and that's something I feel seperates Freedom Planet from games like it.   It's fresh, fun, high-energy and supported well by a great soundtrack and excellent sprite art.  I'd also like to note that the voice acting is well above par for most indie titles, and each of the characters are expressive and believable without seeming terribly hammy or annoying.\n\nIf you watched the trailers, you know what this game plays like.  If that's your thing, I definitely recommend picking it up.  It's a solid, heartful piece of work that's well worth the price.","November 2, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its not a simple bit type game that completely mimics sonic, there is similarities but this game can stand on its own just fine. Character controls are great, haven't found a problem with that yet, graphics and design are simply stunning, if you just want a game that is good for eye candy (an i don't mean the innuendo type) this is defiantly a looker for the 2D class. And its got that old school 'gamer skill' to it where you got to put all your skills to the test at every boss wither its mini boss or the final boss who can really push your limits. Coupled with challenging mini games to play off from the actual story mode, alternate modes and characters to pick up and try again with new sets of skill its worth every penny the guys behind it did their best here. If I had to have a complaint though, it would be the slight issue with some voice acting, but hey, of a 'hybrid sonic/metroidish' 2D platformer, its a gem.

High-speed aerial dashing melee combat in a China-steam-laser-crystal-punk playground of a world. An amazing upbeat adventure score that I purchased after an hour of play. A new movement element or substantial game asset you will barrel through every 15 seconds in a world that never seems to stay still long enough to wear out its welcome.\n\nI think that the worst thing I can say about it is that the story, writing and acting are for the most part saturday-morning-cartoon level fare; while some may understandably find this a little cringeworthy, it suits a colorful romp like this. It provides the occasional genuine chuckle and subtle uses of the 16-bit sprites do often express character surprisingly well.\n\nUltimately, though, it's a bit of context for what one ultimately comes to Freedom Planet to do: Drive a motorbike or a dragon girl through a combination of loops and robots to a backdrop of glowing lights and joyful music.\n\nAll in all it's an utter delight to play and behold, and I cannot sing its praises highly enough - a song that will be sung to the tune of "Dragon Valley 1."","November 26, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's incredibly addictive and visually appealing, and while i personally have not tried speedrunning must be a VERY fun pasttime with the particular game. The colorful aesthetic also makes it so even when you blaze through the levels the background remains a charming thing to look at. Another notable thing is it's soundtrack, there's a good mix of very fast songs alongside maybe some darker and slower ones, all fitting in certain situations and they're pretty to listen at to boot! The controls also feel very fluid and responsive, so if you mess up it's more than likely your own fault.\n\nThere's of course a few downsides, Like the fact that the story might not be everyone's cup of tea. There's some seriously lengthy cutscenes which focus more on the characters and their drama rather than the actual plot itself, and if you want an example of people getting annoyed at this PaperBat did a playthrough and promptly skipped a few. Another thing is that you're going to hit a difficulty spike at a certain point, one which on your first playthrough is more than likely not expected.\n\nAll in all, i reccomend it for it's great gameplay, visuals and soundtrack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IansanityExe/recommended/248310/","IansanityExe","Iansanity.exe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IansanityExe/","84 products in account","Holy moly, Freedom Planet. What a game.\nThis game holds true in what its reviewers state: it is not in any way a Sonic copy.\n\nFreedom Planet, at its heart a platformer, is probably one of the best if not the best platformers I have ever played. Having played through the game entirely, I can safely say it is my favorite platformer ever, and it goes right in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\nThe creators of this game really knew what they were doing. The story is so compelling that I found myself impatient through the levels because I wanted to know what happened next. Captivating voicing and absolutely pixel perfect graphics make it that much more amazing to me. To go along with that, the game features probably one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.\n\nGraphically, it's a throwback to an older generation of games. Having never played a game from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise (unless anyone at this point counts Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 as a game at all), Freedom Planet did what it could to make me feel that nostalgic connection anyway. Boy did it do that. Galaxy Trail picked a theme that's easy to get wrong: China. WOW is this so GOOD!!! China is prevalent throughout the entirely game, and it is truly beautiful as it stands in this game, visually and culturally. Every color in the game is vibrant and wonderful. Every object pops out in full screen and doesn't bring up the common problem that pixelated games have (when objects that can be interacted with blend into the background). The backgrounds are truly stunning and well put together. This entire game to me is eye candy of the best kind.\nGraphics bring me to the art style. The art style. Just the art style alone was what pulled me into the game in the first place. I looked at the title card on the Steam Store and instantly fell in love with it. The characters are so well designed and they move smoothly and amazingly. The art style is the kind of style that makes me beg to see more. It looks GREAT.\n\nNext up, characters. The characters. Galaxy Trail couldn't have gotten this aspect more right. Every character in the game is developed well and are given personalities as they are introduced. This is one of the few games I know of that does this, as opposed to introducing a static character and giving them a personality afterward. The establishment of character so quickly leads to an easier time getting into the story, which I will go over later in the review. The characters all have unique and interesting designs, and the voice actors put a lot of work into their jobs. It really shows that they have, as the characters' dialogue are captivating, with full voice-overs for every bit. I felt truly amazed at how easily I could connect to every character (of course with the exception of the antagonist side of characters).\n\nMusic. I don't have to say anymore.\nThe music is AWESOOOOOOME. It's so well composed, and it fits the overlying theme of the game perfectly. Even through the music, China is prevalent throughout the entire thing. Truly beautiful, and it fits the gameplay and the environment perfectly as well.\n\nGameplay. It's tight. It's solid. It's responsive. Every death and every victory you have will make you feel fully responsible because of how good they are. This game's control is comparable to Super Meat Boy.\nThroughout the game, you have the same set of moves. But while you're playing, it STILL feels like you evolve as the player. I was a fish out of water at the start, and by the end, I knew the characters like the back of my hand. I don't know what else to say, other than that the challenge this games offers is daunting, yet possible, and I mean that in the best way I can (GAME MEANT FOR GAMEPAD).\n\nThe story is truly wonderful. Right off the bat, tension is established, and you meet your antagonist, Brevon. This game does well with its immediate establishment of an antagonist. With the accompaniment of a few tertiary characters being introduced, you're immediately presented with the game's protagonists. A dragon(oid)(?) named Sash Lilac and a cat named Carol Tea, later an alien named Torque and later a dog(?) named Milla Basset. All of these unique characters fuel the story so well and progress it in the most sensible way. Freedom Planet presented me with probably the most captivating story of any game I've ever seen. I'm not even going to explain any of it. Anyone reading this who hasn't played the game MUST PLAY IT FOR THE STORY.\n\n\n\nOf course, every game has its flaws.\n\nThere are a few graphical errors in this game (objects on the wrong side of other objects). As I said, though, there are few, and the truly beautiful environment of the game distracts from any of these errors.\n\nThe dialogue is perfect, except for just one little grammatical mistake (the word "I" in the place of the word "It"). Of course, any and all games that HAVE dialogue and subtitles coinciding with each other have at least one grammatical error.\n\nAn issue I have is that nothing in terms of gameplay changes at all. The Sonic-style speed is the only thing that can be considered to change, and by that, I mean that often times it is unclear what direction Lilac or Carol are meant to go in. In conjuction with that, there is plenty that impedes the forward motion. Despite that, it isn't too much for me that I'm going to bash the game too much. It isn't too much that bashing is warranted, anyway.\n\nThis issue I have is a little bit nit-picky, but I feel it's got to be said. The character you play as normally will stick to the ground, meaning that whatever angle the ground they are standing on is at is the same angle at which the sprite is standing. This particular fact isn't what I dislike, but rather it is the self-righting mechanism in the sprites. After running up a wall or something of the sort, the entire sprite rotates from a central point back to being right-side up. To me, this is unsettling and it breaks the contingency of the character as being believable. A simple way for this issue to be fixed is to implement some sort of movement sequence in the sprite that would take the place of the awkward pivotal rotation.\n\nAnother problem I had with this game was that it felt lonely. Most levels are lengthy, meaning a lot of time may be spent in each level (unless you're a speedrunner of sorts or get stuck in spots easily, which happens on occasion). The dialogues constantly reference the fact that the protagonists have conquered a certain aspect of a level together. This is strange, considering the only time any of the characters move and fight WITH the character you control is during a boss battle in the middle of the game. This disappointed me, as I find the Donkey Kong Country-esque character switch to be nice.\n\nMy only other problem with Freedom Planet is exposition. Whether or not it was intentional is beyond me. But being a minor issue, I still found myself having troble understanding the beginning of the story until I started a second file and experienced the beginning again.\n\n\n\nBut overall, this game (in my opinion) is near perfect, and a true work of art. It shows how much work, time, effort, and love went into this game's creation. And having played the whole game from start to end in a single sitting, here's what I feel like:\nTHIS GAME IS PROBABLY THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IN THE PLATFORMER GENRE!\n\nNever has any game left me wanting more as much as this one. This game is perfect in my eyes, and it leaves me wanting more from it. I hope that the people at Galaxy Trail are working on a sequel to this, because the ending of this game has set itself up perfectly for that. If it already has a sequel, I NEED TO KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. The game is short, but it's fantastic, nonetheless.\n\nPlus, this is the first game that has ever made me cry because it ended.\n\nThis game is a work of art. Worth every cent.\nBuy it. Play it. Love it.\n\n\n- Ian J.","December 22, 2014","true","189.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battlechili/recommended/248310/","Battlechili","Battlechili","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battlechili/","174 products in account","So after spending a long time playing this game before finally beating it, I really do think this is one of the best indie games out there. If you've ever played an old Sonic game or maybe and old Mega Man X game and liked them, you'll be happy to hear that this game is in a sort of in between place for those games. Its got the exhilerating high speed of Sonic with the action and fights of a Mega Man X game. Gameplay involves running through well designed levels made to complement either Lilac or Carol's (the two characters you can currently play as in Adventure mode) individual unique abilities, all while traveling at high speeds (or taking it slow if you like), fighting awful baddies sent out by Lord Brevon, and enjoying the fun of going through loop-de-loops and running up/down walls. Levels are varied, with them going anywhere from taking place in a sunny mountain to a scientific lab. The game starts off easy (perhaps even a tad bit too easy) but picks up steam as you progresses, all the way to the point to where the game can get extremely difficult (average death amount for the last few levels made its way to over 100 deaths). But even so, there are multiple difficulty settings to change how hard the game will be, so if you don't think you're very good at these sorts of games don't worry.\n\nThe game has a nice length and load of content for an indie game (or any game really). While the main adventure mode itself, cutscenes left in, will probably only last around 8 hours if you're playing on a normal difficulty, higher difficulties can drag the game out, and character specific cutscenes depending on what character you play as add replayability. And besides that, there's also a special time attack mode with more levels to play along with the option to play as Milla (another character) rather than Lilac or Carol. Added to that, there's a bonus Mahjong mini game, lots of secrets to find and collect and plenty of achievements to unlock. As of this moment, while its not out yet, it was also stated by the game devs that the game would later allow one to play as the characters Torque and Spade (they're introduced in the adventure mode of the game along with Milla), perhaps with Milla even having her own Adventure mode too, all as free DLC. In the end, the game offers a lot of replayability and should last a really long time. As of right now I've put about 18 hours into the game and I've only scratched the surface (and that DLC isn't even out yet).\n\nThe adventure mode of the game has all the levels of the game in it with cutscenes and a storyline attached. If you aren't in it for the story or don't like the cutscenes, you can skip them or play the classic mode of the game (which already features Milla as a playable character, though you may have to unlock her through play. I'm not sure). In doing so however, you might find yourself to be missing out, as the game offers a decent though compelling enough story to keep the player interested. The basic idea is that this evil dude named Brevon has come to take the Kingdom Stone (an item full of energy or electricity or whatever you want to call it) and who else but you will have to stop him. In idea it sounds extremely simple but that's really the tip of the iceberg. The game genuinely has a decent amount of focus on story, with a decent amount of surprises and a couple really shocking moments in this game, most of which are well built in showing just how dangerous Brevon really is. He's no Eggman. He's a man with a plan ready to kill. It even shows in the opening cutscene of the game, as Brevon is extremely brutal. Its done so well in fact that it sets this game apart from other games that have really lame antagonists, or gams that have antagonists that are hatable for all the wrong reasons. Brevon is a genuinely cool, simple yet well built well characterized villain. The story also benifits not only from how well the villain was done, but by the characterization of Lilac, Carol, and even Milla. You grow to care about these characters as the game continues(it helps that some cutscenes exist entirely for characterization), and that makes any story events all the more impactful. Now, while I say this game has a decent emphasis on story, by no means does that bog the gameplay down. At a few moments the cutscenes seem to last a little longer than they should, but overall they rarely overstay their welcome and you have plenty of opportunity to enjoy the gameplay, especially in the later stages when the game cuts down on the cutscenes and the difficulty increases.\n\nDisregarding the gameplay and story, this game has a fine soundtrack, on par with Mega Man X's music. Its also similar in sound, as, just like Mega Man X games, the music doesn't seem to be orchestral (note that this does not hurt the game in the slightest, and actually improves the game). The main theme is catchy and easy to remember (and it appears even when you get temporary invincibility), some boss music (boss track 3 in particular) sound fast paced and action packed, and some of the main stages have some great music to suit the stage at hand. Some of it is dramatic as if something big just happened (one even has a couple lyrics in it, with a person starting the song with "If this is my destiny...There is no turning back"), and others are a tad mellow and are meant to be a bit more relaxing and calm, or perhaps sound more ancient. Other times it sounds like you're going to your doom, especially on the later Final Dreadnaught levels and the Brevon theme. The game comes with the soundtrack in its Steam folder too (in ogg vorbis format), and you'll be able to enjoy it (though the dev has stated that he'll release a higher quality OST with unused tracks later on). Now while we're talking about sound, it might be worth mentioning that while the music is great, the voice acting is all over the place. Some characters have great voice actors and great voices, while others sound like they're overacting or don't know how to act period. This doesn't harm the game too much; most events sound how they need to and the story and meaning behind things aren't hurt by it, but nonetheless it is a problem, which can especially seen with Prince Dail's father's voice in the opening cutscene. The quality of the microphone being spoken into also appears to vary between voice actors, with some sounding incredible and others sounding slightly amateurish, though overall the sound quality itself is all right.\n\nIf you'll notice, the game has the graphical style of older games, but despite this it doesn't hurt from it. Sprite art is a dying thing these days and even sprites can be cool to look at, show emotion, and even be endearing, and this game delivers. The game is also full of color, and it winds up being very pretty to look at, much moreso than old Sonic games, so if you're worried they'll look like that you have nothing to fear. The art is great.\n\nSo in the end, I REALLY recomend buying this game, especially if you want to support more games like it.\n","July 28, 2014","true","58.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Lilac being the middle or the mario having a lot of damaging moves and attacks to work with, and use this spin flight like move more to bounce off walls and get to platforms normally impossible to get to, Carol can wall jump, pounce, spin(kinda like sonic) at enemiesand has very rapid attacks, as well as a motorcycle power up that makes her the fastest character, lets her drive up walls and gives her a damaging arieal spin attack. Milla can make little blocks reflect shots and can fly short distences and get up to some prettty high places with more ease then Lilacs spin flight.\n\nLevels are very well designed with each one feeling different then the last, having mechanics of it;s own, and having smart multipath design, allowing for a good amount of replay abilaty . Levels get really hard towards the end but never blind side you(other then the level were Brevon turns the air off on his ship, that spot was annoying) the game is pretty generous and hard areas with checkpoints not punishing you so hard to make you do half a level because you slipped up.\n\nThe enemies are fun and add challenge to the game, most enemies do not hurt if you touche them(unless covered in spikes) which feels like a breath of fresh air to me.\n\nThe boss fights are some of the best I have played in not just an indie game but a 2D platformer in general they have a real megaman and treasure games feel where they attack you with different moves based on what you are doing.\n\n\nOverall I have to say this is probably one of the best indie platformers if not the best one out there, while this is heavily Sonic inspired, take it form me an old Sega kid, it feels inspired form sonic but it's mecanics are more a lot different.

Needless to say, Freedom Planet draws a huge inspiration from the early Sonic The Hedgehog games but as they say, imitation is the best form of flattery. The programmers behind Freedom Planet manage to take the core gameplay elements of classic Sonic games while still keeping their game unique and even original. This game isn't exactly like Sonic though, different characters have different mechanics, like Carol isn't as focused on speed as Lilac, so instead her levels focus a little more on combat kind of similar to a beat em-up kind of platformer. Not only is the gameplay fantastic but the characters each have their own distinct personalities and characteristics which enriches the gameplay even more. Another big thing this game is focused on, if not the biggest thing, is the story. If you go into the story with the mindset of looking for some kind of super depth and complexity then STOP right now. The story isn't bad and it isn't super great but it's something that really ENTICES the gameplay and sets you into the mood more. There are cutscenes that last up 10 minutes, so it makes completing levels more rewarding and the BOSS battles are just insane!!! I CANT REMEMBER taking on bosses this EPIC! The bosses are challenging but also the animation and sequences into the boss battles are just spec-♥♥♥♥ING-tacular. NOW I KNOW that you're tired of me rambling on and on about this game but if you really want a GREAT 2D platforming experience ESPECIALLY if you miss the glory gameplay of Sonic The Hedgehog series, then this game IS For YOU!! Buy it and support it. There's a reason why this game is coming to PS4 and Wii U/3Ds eShop.

High-speed aerial dashing melee combat in a China-steam-laser-crystal-punk playground of a world. An amazing upbeat adventure score that I purchased after an hour of play. A new movement element or substantial game asset you will barrel through every 15 seconds in a world that never seems to stay still long enough to wear out its welcome.\n\nI think that the worst thing I can say about it is that the story, writing and acting are for the most part saturday-morning-cartoon level fare; while some may understandably find this a little cringeworthy, it suits a colorful romp like this. It provides the occasional genuine chuckle and subtle uses of the 16-bit sprites do often express character surprisingly well.\n\nUltimately, though, it's a bit of context for what one ultimately comes to Freedom Planet to do: Drive a motorbike or a dragon girl through a combination of loops and robots to a backdrop of glowing lights and joyful music.\n\nAll in all it's an utter delight to play and behold, and I cannot sing its praises highly enough - a song that will be sung to the tune of "Dragon Valley 1."","November 26, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A relic from a time long ago that embodies what's good with the console. It even looks better than most Genesis games. Definitely one that should be remembered.\n\n\nWait, what do you mean this came out in 2014? And this is suppose to be an indie game? I thought indies were incapable of making good retro style platformers.\n\n\nIn all seriousness, this game is an absolute gem. Combining elements from Sonic, Megaman, and Gunstar Heros, Freedom Planet manages to make an amazing experence that will make old school Genesis fans smile. What started as a Sonic fangame, the guys over at GalaxyTrail decided that this game was better off as it's own thing, and my god, it was the best decision they could have made. This might make you think it's a Sonic clone at first glance, but trust me, it's anything but. This review is going to be quite legnthy, so if you don't want to read it, skip to the bottom.\n\nGameplay Freedom Planet is a fast paced game with combat mechanics. When you aren't blazing through the level at high speeds, you're either fighting enemies or solving puzzles. To help to the more combat oriented gameplay, you have a health bar in the form of red petals(it's an element many people tend to miss at first). Unlike other platformers, you don't get hurt when you touch an enemy, only taking damage if you're hit be an attack, and rarely any bottomless pits. There are also several different kinds of shields, akin to Sonic 3. Each one either makes you immune to certain attacks or grants some other effect. One thing I should really note are the boss fights. Ranging from huge machines to rivals that are about your size, they are a ton of fun to fight. Something that I feel recent playformer games have been lacking.\n\nThere are 2 characters that you can play as from the start, with another that is unlockable and more to come as free DLC. Each character is unique in that they have very different playstyles, changing how you do each level, and even having some exclusive levels. For the purpose of this review, I'll only go over the 2 from the start.\n\nLilac the dragon(yes, that purple girl is a dragon) is a more speed focused character. While not as fast as Sonic, she can still go through a level really fast. She has the more varied moves of the bunch, being punches, drop kicks, uppercuts, a twirl move that allows you to gain air to make wide gaps, and a dragon boost that allows Lilac to blaze past enemies and reach higher elevations.\n\nCarol the wildcat is more combat focused. While she isn't as fast a Lilac, she makes up for it by having faster attacks, a rapid kick that allows her to hit targets multiple times, and the ability to wall jump. Her main draw, however, is her motorbike. By finding a gas can anywhere in the level, Carol pulls out a motorbike that not only allows her to go as fast as Lilac, but can defy the laws of physics, like being able to climb up ladders and walls. It can only take a few hits before blowing up, so take good care of it.\n\nWhen you start up the main game, you will be given the option to play either Adventure mode or Classic. Adventure plays fully voiced cutscenes between levels and enables dialouge exchanges between characters and setpeices during missions, while Classic just skips all of that and lets you play the game. I recommend you play Adventure mode at least once as Lilac in order to get the story.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the game gets pretty difficult on the later levels. Unless you're really good at platformers, you're going to lose a few lives here and there. (spoiler:You will get a game over at the final boss). Thankfully, the game lets you tone down the difficulty if you're having a hard time, but if you're stubborn like most players out there, you're gonna want to stick through it to the end.\n\nStory An alien warlord crashes his battle cruiser onto your home planet, leaving him and his army stranded there. In order to get his ship off the ground, he needs a ton of energy. He thus turns his attention to the Kingdom Stone, a powerfull gem that gives power to the entire planet. You pretty much have to stop him from getting it.\n\nNow, that might sound happy and go-lucky, but make no mistake, the cutscenes can get pretty dark and brutal. Not enough to get it an M rating, but definitely not something I would let my 7 year old nephew play (Unless you let him watch R rated movies, then go ahead). The gameplay itself is kid friendly, so just have him play Classic mode.\n\nAs I said, the game has fully voiced cutscenes and dialouge exchanges during the levels. The voice acting is either hit or miss for most people. Personally, I think Carol's voice could use some work and the end level voice clips tend to get a tad cringy, but I like most of it.\n\nThe one quipe I have with the story, though, is that the cutscenes kinda tend to drag on longer than they need to. While this isn't a major pace killer for me, it can be for a lot of people. Thankfully the characters themselves are interesting enough to keep the story moving. Again, if you aren't interested in the story, just play Classic mode.\n\nPresentation GalaxyTrail did some amazing work with pixel art in the game. The game looks very pleasing on the eye, with beautiful backgrounds and nicely animated sprites, all while running very smoothly. It's a wonder how they managed to make it work.\n\nThe level design is also really good. Each stage has something unique about it that will make it memorable and fun to play. The levels are structered like Sonic 3, where there are 2 acts with a miniboss at the end of act 1 and the boss at act 2. Unlike the Sonic games, however, there aren't any acts in the game, instead combining them into 1 huge stage. When you defeat the miniboss, the stage transitions into the second part, which is quite different from the first. While this might sound like the levels are too long, they actually hit a sweet spot. They're long enough keep you entertained, but short enough to not overstay it's welcome.\n\nThe sound design is decent. The audio mixing to pretty good and the sound effects fit the game just fine. There are a few stock sounds here and there, but I can forgive it.\n\nThe one thing I want to give special attention to is the soundtrack. This game has fast, energetic, and overall catchy music that is very easy to get stuck in your head. Here are a couple of examples:\nDragon Valley\nFortune Night part 1 and part 2\nJade Creek\n\nIf you have a few extra dollars on you, I recommend you buy the soundtrack.\n\nSummery(TL;DR) Overall, this game is fantastic.\n\n+ Fun gameplay that has characters with different playstyles\n+ Great level design that keeps things fresh, with nice visuals to compliment\n+ Very noteworthy soundtrack that is worth buying itself\n= Voice acting is either hit or miss\n= Later levels and bosses get really difficult\n- Cutscenes tend to go on for a little too long\n! For god's sake, this is NOT a Sonic clone!\nIf you are a big platformer fan, or want to get a burst of nostalgia, you definitely want to pick up this game. If you read through this review(or summery) and still think this is a Sonic clone, you are doing youself a criminal disservice. It's a shame this game doesn't get enough attention, it really does need it.\n\nJust buy the game. There's even a demo right on the store page you can try if you're still not convinced. Otherwise, there's little other reason to not buy it.","November 17, 2014","true","39.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Granted, the only game I played was Sonic Advance, but I honestly just didn't have fun when I played it.\n\nWell, I came across this game, I think from a webcomic. The characters looked cute and, for some odd reason, I immediately wanted to know about them. I searched the game up, took a peek at the website.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was put off. It looks a lot like a Sonic game, and I was worried I'd end up not liking it. But they had a demo, and I still had this nagging itch, really wanting to know their stories. I can't explain it. Anyways, I tried the demo, since it was small and free, and much to my surprise, I liked it.\n\nNot only that, within three days I decided I wanted the full game.\n\nMaybe it was the nostalgic feeling of a 16(?)bit game, (apologies, I always forget the terms,) Maybe it was the adorable characters, or the fact that it had a weird, crazy, and laid back story, from what the description said.\n\nSo, the gameplay felt good, easy to figure out, easy to pick up and play, and yet I still figure out new combinations of moves daily. Exploring, at first, was secondary, since I wanted to hear the story most. (Then I discovered cards, and exploration in search of them has become one of my favorite parts of gameplay.) Combat was easy enough to grasp. Don't get hit, hit back until it's dead. Simple enough, except some enemies still kick my butt every time. (And talk about boss battles. Some of these, even the ones that use the same set of moves in an endless loop, are difficult enough that I'll restart a level just to collect a bunch of extra lives.)\nThe story is light and cutesy, lovable and, despite being so, could really bash me into the ground. The characters, adorable to look at, are also pretty cute as characters. I mean, it's no thought-provoking novel, honestly, but it's very good for what it is. I've not beaten even Lilac's campaign yet, but I'm steadily working my way there. The other two campaigns will be next on my to-do list for this game. The way it shows things from different prespectives is really neat.\nThe music is pretty nice too. Personally, I think it could improve, but the music is definitely good in this game. I especially like the invincible theme.\nHm. I don't think I have many complaints. There are a few glitches still, and there was one boss that, unfortunately, felt like it took more luck than skill to beat. Not looking forward to that one on later campaigns, honestly. I think my biggest complaint is the lack of a separate volume control for Music, Voice, and FX.\n\nAnyways, I'd recommend it. It's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but nothing ever is. Now to get back to getting my butt kicked.","October 2, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However unlike some cases with the classic Sonic games the level design in Freedom Planet is catered for speed at all times, not once does it feel like the game punished me for going fast with a cheap enemy placement. The levels are fast paced and the combat mechanics are fluid and smooth (even know Lilac's Dragon Cyclone can be spammed really easily, especially during boss fights).\n\nThe bosses themselves are big scaled, creative and challenging at times even though they can have those 'obvious weak spots' you see in some Mario and Zelda bosses. They're still fun to play and that's what matters to me.\n\nThe game's flaws CAN be very noticable, and by that I mean it's constantly being presented in your face because there is non-stop voice acting and to be honest the voice acting is pretty mediorce, it's passable at best and at points feels like you're watching some cringey furry fan-fiction at worst, it's so distracting BUT the game does offer a "Classic" mode where if you don't care about the majority of voices and its pretty lame story then so be it, you can just jump level to level when you're done instead of having a large cut-scene in-between in the normal mode.\n\nI think FP is a pretty solid game, it definitely has a lot of effort and heart put into it and it shows by how fun it is. I'd reccommend the Classic mode but if you're honestly curious about the voices and story then go ahead it's not the worst I've ever seen (still better than Mega Man X4). I reccommend this game.","October 4, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Needless to say, Freedom Planet draws a huge inspiration from the early Sonic The Hedgehog games but as they say, imitation is the best form of flattery. The programmers behind Freedom Planet manage to take the core gameplay elements of classic Sonic games while still keeping their game unique and even original. This game isn't exactly like Sonic though, different characters have different mechanics, like Carol isn't as focused on speed as Lilac, so instead her levels focus a little more on combat kind of similar to a beat em-up kind of platformer. Not only is the gameplay fantastic but the characters each have their own distinct personalities and characteristics which enriches the gameplay even more. Another big thing this game is focused on, if not the biggest thing, is the story. If you go into the story with the mindset of looking for some kind of super depth and complexity then STOP right now. The story isn't bad and it isn't super great but it's something that really ENTICES the gameplay and sets you into the mood more. There are cutscenes that last up 10 minutes, so it makes completing levels more rewarding and the BOSS battles are just insane!!! I CANT REMEMBER taking on bosses this EPIC! The bosses are challenging but also the animation and sequences into the boss battles are just spec-♥♥♥♥ING-tacular. NOW I KNOW that you're tired of me rambling on and on about this game but if you really want a GREAT 2D platforming experience ESPECIALLY if you miss the glory gameplay of Sonic The Hedgehog series, then this game IS For YOU!! Buy it and support it. There's a reason why this game is coming to PS4 and Wii U/3Ds eShop. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD!","September 9, 2015","true","10.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aidenpons/recommended/248310/","aidenpons","aidenpons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aidenpons/","12 products in account",""Do you recommend this game" MOST DEFINITELY YES\n\nDISCLAIMER: This will not be longer than my Hobbit review. How can I promise? Steam reviews have a character limit, as I found out. :P\n\nI haven't played any games that you'd know of, apart from AOE2. Sonic? Oh, that... porcupine? :P Mega... Man? Or something? What's that?\n\nSo yeah, I don't have an answer to all you "THIS IS A RIPOFF OF SONIC I HATE YOU SO MUCH OMG YES11111111111" What I will say to you is this: You liked Sonic because it was good, right? (I hope so) So, if you liked it because it was good, and this is, according to you, Sonic, you should like it too? Especially as it does a whole heap of extra-interesting stuff? No? You say you hate it because it's too close to what you like? Surely, if something's similiar and yet better than what you like, you should like it as well? No? I'm just inciting the haters? :P\n\nWhatever. :P\n\nOnto more gameplay-ish stuff, the end bosses are brilliant. Ok, you got the demo and played the first level, and you found that endboss something that you could run over (Literally, if you're playing as Carol. :P). I'd have to say that the Dragon Valley boss is the easiest in the game... but that's to be expected. Ok, it's a little too easy, but... If you'd get the full game, the LAST thing you'd be complaning about is the easy-ness of the bosses. Ok, you might be complaining about the DIFFICULTY, yes, but not the easy aspect of the difficulty. Don't be put off by this: the penalty for losing all your lives is a nice little bit of music. :P No seriously, there's practically no penalty for losing all your lives (something which'll happen a lot in the last level :P)\n\nThe characters are simply adorable.  They're all... brilliant. A sensible dragon who is determined to stop Lord Brevon, a cat that rides a SUPER FREAKING MOTORCYCLE YEAAAAAAAAH and makes all the plans (except the one that Lilac chooses), a small dog who throws jelly cubes that kill robots, an evil overlord who seeks for destruction... Where to stop. NOT HERE :P A maddended prince whose monomanical desire if to find his father's murderer, a robot that helps people who get lost by blasting them with lava (Thermal Base joke :P), a "stupid panda girl" that will make you rage, a glory-grabbing ruler, a tricksy side-crossing thief who get along with no-one... I'll spare you. :P The cutscenes just make everything come alive.\n\nOh, I know what you're thinking: "Jeez, this game came out a long while ago, the devs said that the rest of the stories and everything else would be up soon, and nothing's here." Everything you're thinking is true, except for one word: Devs. As far as I know, Strife is practically a one-man team. He's done brilliantly so far, and I have a whole load of trust that he'll continue to be brilliant. [/cheesiestcommenti'vevermadeaboutagamedev]\n\n"Please describe what you... disliked" What did I dislike? The only thing I didn't like was a little absence of "GO THIS WAY" style signs... but does a game really need to tell you that much? It's a 2D sidescroller and the exit is always on the right. :P The Thermal Base boss wasn't very good... it's quite hard to get hit even if you don't know what you're doing. (It's an absolute pain for speedrunning. :P)\n\nWhat did I like?\nOne thing was THE BEST: Just before Battle Glacier, you get to drive a TANK. :D I've got some screenshots. It's a complete change from the rest of the game, and a simply brilliant one.\nThe plot is captivating. You would have seen the trailer, right? And you would have thought "Oh yeah, normal MacGuffin, etc, they'll save it in the nick of time, never seen THIS plot before..." Except that you'd be wrong. The Stone is stolen at the end of the second (out of... 14?) stage. And it's firmly in Brevon's hands by Stage 5. This plot doesn't hang about. So what's the rest about, you ask? Is is just boring gameplay with a ridiculous plot? Nope.\n*Spoilers edited out because SPOILAHS and I hit the character limit :P*\n\nWhat I will say is that the plot never drags. Players and things are juggled around so you'll never be able to predict what's going to happen in specifics. You grow to hate and like certain characters, and there's always something new happening.\nBack onto the trailer, it doesn't do the plot justice. The plot is hard to say how it isn't the "grab the MacGuffin and run" but is really something quite different.\n\nThe characters are brilliant. They're always in-character, so to speak. You'll never be thinking "Now why did this person do that?" And Team Lilac is adorable. frankly.\n\n\nThe credits at the end were glorious. "Credits. Yay." I hear you say. Don't worry. These are the one credits I've actively enjoyed. The Freedom Planet theme is playing (which qualifies anything as awesome). But it's not just the music that pulls me in (ok, yes, it is. :P) The cast is listed, in order of appearance. By "Cast" I mean everything that has a voice. Bosses don't count because they just explode. :P And I'll tell you that everybody has an action and a line. Everybody, except for Spade. And that's not just Strife being lazy: that's perfectly in-character. If there was ONE person who just leaned against a lampost, it'd be Spade. No, Spade does not carry a shovel. He carries a laser and a deck of cards. (A deck of cards you ask? Just get the full game, and you'll soon see. :P) Anyway, after the cast is over, it goes into the long names. "Long names..." I hear you groan. I hate long lists of names in credits as much as you do.\nBut that's the thing: Freedom Planet doesn't have a long list of names. Even when things are getting a tad boring, the music WILL propel you through it. Here, I'm going to link it to you: http://galaxytrail.bandcamp.com/track/freedom-planet-theme\nThe credits aren't long. This song is the length of the credits. Actually, that's false, the last minute or so is your level stats. (First playthrough: Deaths: 200 :P)\n\n\nSo yeah. Freedom Planet's a pretty nice - no wait, it's an EXCELLENT game. The bosses are always varied and never dragging, though to be fair some of them are long, and the game's full of fun little things. The Dev Team Thinks Of Everything indeed. :P\n\n\nTL;DR This game is awesome, get it now. I'm even going to give you the link. :P http://store.steampowered.com/app/248310","November 1, 2014","true","191.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Sure there are parts where you will be booking it through loop-de-loops but it blends combat in with it seamlessly and the levels lend themselves well to it. See most enemies don’t hurt you on contact, so you have two options. Blaze through the level and hit the occasional enemy on the way or stick around and fight it out. Both options are fine and both have there rewards and the game gives you everything you need to do it.\n\nFrom the offset the game has three characters to play and all of them play drastically different. There’s Lilac who is more well rounded and great for first time players, Carol who can really kick ♥♥♥ with skillful play and Milla who is meant to be played slowly and more carefully and is really built for exploring the levels and finding shiny things. All of these characters are viable in all the different levels and they even each have there own levels unique to them. Each character is like playing a different game and most of the levels are balanced so every character has there own way of getting around them. There are even areas that only certain characters can access. It can be very difficult to build levels with multiple characters in mind and they have done a great job of it.\n\nI will say some of the bosses can take a while to really get a bead on however the game pretty much lets you try again as much as you want until you finally get it right and that moment when you do can really be satisfying. The game does use a lives system but with how the continues work its really just kind of window dressing which is a bit of a oversight but it didn’t bother me too much. Though that makes going for the games main collectible Crystals kind of moot since all it really does is give you lives unless you care about high scores or bragging rights. I do really wish they could have reworked it cause the idea of doing away with lives period wouldn’t hurt me in the slightest. The reason I stuck with it til the end was because I DIDN’T have to start a level over, I actually had a chance to learn instead of drop the game out of frustration. Lives are a product of the times, when the games were all about eating quarters. I feel like lives are a outdated relic of the past and its just not good game design anymore, hardcore gamers be damned, but really its just a small nitpick on a otherwise great game.\n\nI do want to end on a positive note though. I’m proud this game opted to have not one, not two but THREE female protagonists who are fun and interesting. I will say that while the story itself is pretty good its not super spectacular, But I do like how you get different pieces of the story depending on who you play and it does add good replay value. The characters are what really saved it for me. The writing is fun and the voice acting is also well done for having a lot of unknown actors. Having three female protagonists is really a breath of fresh air in a game industry ruled by scruffy white guys.\n\nI highly recommend Freedom Planet especially if you’ve been craving a Sonic styled platformer like the good old days that feels like a long lost Saturn game. They plan on adding more content for free later including 2 new characters with there own parts of the story to play which frankly im very excited for. Give this game a look.","July 30, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is definitely a hidden gem. It makes me sad that nobody knows that this game exists. Thank goodness my friend told me about this game because when I saw it, I loved it instantly. Here's why this game is SEVERELY UNDERRATED:\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- Interesting, addicting, and unique gameplay inspired by the classics. A Sonic-like feel to it, but with a mixture of more action.\n- MUSIC IS--HOLY SMOKES GOD-TIER AMAZING!\n- Three characters to play as, each with unique traits to use during the game. Each character's gameplay is refreshing and different!\n- Story is surprisngly good and engaging. Fleshes out characters and makes you have feelings toward them during their struggle to defeat Lord Brevon.\n- Voice acting is surprisingly good!\n- Levels are creative and well-paced. Each level has features that the characters can take advantage of.\n- ACHIEVEMENTS!\n- Able to play the story mode in two different perspectives by picking either Lilac or Carol\n- Encourages player to explore or speed-run through the stages!\n- Boss fights are amazing\n- Game presents a challenge as you go through higher levels\n- "Future content is planned! We'll be continuously adding new features, and any future DLC we include will be free of charge"\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- NO MILLA STORY MODE :( (Yet?)\n\nI really can't think of any more negatives. The game is that good. I would even say that this game is better than Sonic 3 and Knuckles and I'm a Sonic fan. What an experience this game was. Do yourself a favor! Play this game and see for yourself! Hell, if you wanna be on the safe side, play the demo.

The graphics may be very small in resolution, but look quite good and detailed even when scaled up to full screen. Animations, gameplay, storytelling and level design are all provided with a high quality level from start to end. You barely will find any boring or repetitive moments in this game, as each level is spacious but short enough to be completed within a few minutes time. If you’ve been looking for a good “old” platformer in the best sense of the word but always felt disappointed by the recent Sonic releases, look no further but treat yourself to this great title!\n\nFull review: http://metadragon.de/game-review/review-freedom-planet/","January 9, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know it seems like a sonic ripoff, but I assure you, it's much more than that. What I mean is that while it DOES have elements from the Sonic series, i.e: Sonic 1, 2, 3, and "Sonic and Knuckles" it also borrows elements from other SNES and Sega Genesis titles. Those elements combined make for one of the best games I've played recently.\n\nDiving in one by one, in terms of playable characters, Sash Lilac, to me, derives from Classic Sonic. Hair whips, her Dragon Cyclone, and Dragon Boost make her ideal for blazing through stages with practically no reason to stop. Her personality is very similar to Sonic's with a strong sense of justice and compassion.\n\nCarol Tea, with her various claw attacks, her Wild Kick, and her wall jumping abilities, make her unique for close combat. She seems to me, more laid back, a lot like Tails to some extent, but these are just comparisons. Carol is a major tomboy, if it wasn't already obvious.\n\nMilla Basset... She's actually one of the more interesting characters to me. Her nature, makes her very likeable. Her abilities, with her Phantom Block and laser make for quite an experience, especially when you combine her moves. That and the upcoming update I've heard about, I can see how Milla came to be. I'm honestly excited for that.\n\nThe soundtrack, oh man, I love this thing, special mention going to Prince Dail's boss theme, Aqua Tunnel 2, and Fortune Night 2. It's got quite the variety in terms of music genres, and I like that. The bloopers in the cutscenes were pretty funny too, especially the segment where Spade's like "G****** my coolness." The level design is really cool too. To me, it follows Sonic 3's formula in terms of act transition. The levels themselves are awesome. and near the end of the game, things get REALLY hectic.\n\nOverall, Freedom Planet made for an awesome experience from beginning to end, and I'd love to see more content come out soon. Anyway, I highly recommend this game.","January 13, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riwakim/recommended/248310/","riwakim","CalienteSnaidero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riwakim/","32 products in account","This is one of my favorite indie games of all time, for a variety of reasons. There are a few flaws, but the strengths of the game far outweigh them.\n\nPros\nGAMEPLAY. This game lets you do what you please. Want to speedrun a course? Go ahead. Want to take time to explore and collect cards and crystals? Knock yourself out. Feel like beating up a bunch of robots or fighting 99 ninjas head on? Yup, you can do that too. Anything. Not only is there an Adventure mode with fully voiced cutscenes and fun story, but you can play in Classic mode and there are time trials as well. Along with achievements, there's a ton of unique gameplay waiting for you in this game.\nLENGTH. I got this game for half price, and I can definitely say it was 200% worth it. I've already poured 60 hours into it and I've just completed Adventure mode with only one of the characters. Yeah, there's a lot of content packed in here.\nCHARACTERS. These characters are so much fun. You can play as Lilac, a dragon, Carol, a wildcat, or Milla, a basset hound, each with their own unique powers and weaknesses. They're beautifully designed and a lot of love went into making them.\nMUSIC. Freedom Planet's OST is on par with the likes of Shovel Knight. It's that good. In fact, the Shovel Knight OST and the Freedom Planet OST are my top two video game soundtracks of 2014.\nVOICE ACTORS. Now, a lot of people are complaining about the amateur voice actors and their cheesy lines, but I actually really liked the voice acting as well as the animated cutscenes. It added a lot of polish to the game, and if you don't care for story, you can always play in Classic mode. But the voice actors made the game feel complete, and I especially want to credit Spade, Torque, Carol, and Lord Brevon for having great, almost professional voice acting.\nSTORY. This shiz got dark real quick at the beginning, when  Lord Brevon beheaded the King of Shuigang in front of his son But after that it was pretty lighthearted  and it made me laugh and want to know more. The plot, although interesting, is nothing new. Still, its got a nice vibe to it, and I found the story pleasant but also significant. Reminded me a lot of Sonic SatAM if that rings a bell.\nNow for the Cons. I really only have one big one:\nDIFFICULTY. Nuts this game was hard. Really hard. I played on Normal until I reached the Dreadnoughts. Then I dropped to Easy. Then I reached the final Dreanought and dropped to Casual (I have failed as a gamer). While I found the difficulty pretty fair until the Dreadnoughts, I think the game could do with a slight tone down. If you like a challenge, then by all means have a blast. But I did not like having to lower my difficulty just so I could get past a stage.\nMALE CHARACTERS. This is a small one that will (hopefully!) be fixed with upcoming DLC. As much as I love girls in gaming, I would've loved to play as one of the male characters, like Torque or Spade. My brother (who also played this game with me) wholeheartedly agrees.\nBUGS. Some minor bugs, but no gamebreakers. Sometimes I'll just fall through the floor and have to restart, but it rarely happens and it's no big deal.\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING READING THIS LONG AWFUL REVIEW.

The gameplay is fluid and I never experienced any framerate issues, altthough some late game bugs hampered my gameplay for about 20 seconds before I went right back to normal gameplay. The levels are varied, although they can be a bit long, with one level nearly taking me 12 minutes.

The visuals and the way it plays remind me of the old Sonic games (e.g. Sonic 3 & Knuckles). Even though the voice acting has its issues I found that it really contributes to the characters' personalities - I simply fell in love with them. The game also offers a pretty entertaining story mode (Called Adventure Mode) as well as a Classic mode (Which skips all of the cutscenes)\n\nCons:\n-The voice acting is nice but it's not levelled properly (e.g. one character is voiced normally and the next is too loud)...\n\nPros:\n-Awesome retro visuals and gameplay.\n-The game is voice acted!\n-Lenghty (skippable) cutscenes between the stages. It's almost like watching a movie.\n-3 playable and lovable characters.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, Freedom Planet is very similar to the retro Sonic games - pleasant visuals, pleasant gameplay and pleasant music but it also offers some "upgrades" that the Sonic games don't have - It has voice acted cutscenes which allow you to get immeresed into the story.

It's the only way to explain a game which seems to have come from a universe where Sega released a Sonic 4 for the Sega Saturn and the franchise never suffered its fall from grace after Sonic 3 & Knuckles.\n\nDespite that comparison, Freedom Planet is very much its own game and not some Sonic clone, however strong it may have been influenced by the Blue Blur. You'll find a game which is to the late Sega Megadrive era what Shovel Knight is the NES, and like Shovel Knight it takes inspiration from multiple classics. You may find elements of Rocket Knight Adventures, Mega Man X, Ristar and Gunstar Heroes blending into the mix and its wonderful.\n\nThe presentation of the story (yes, somebody put plot in my 90s platformer) is odd for a platformer of this type, featuring sometimes lengthy in-game cutscenes and full, somewhat-cheesy voice acting. It seems somewhat reminiscent of some of the Sonic spinoff media like the comics and won't win any awards but helps add a little more life to the game.\nIf you really can't stand the dialogue or want a more traditional experience, the Classic mode should satisfy you, and even in Adventure scenes can be easily skipped.\n\nThere's more to Freedom Planet than just appealing to nostalgia and, like Shovel Knight, it very much stands up on its own merits. There's speed, sure, but there's a greater emphasis on platforming, on sometimes slowing down to deal with enemies and occasionally go vaguely metroidvania with exploration and puzzles for short segments.\nThat may not sound that great if you're looking for a classic Sonic experience, but it works well here and helps further distance the game from its main inspiration, which sometimes focused too heavily on speed.\n\nWith plenty of achievements, 3 characters for Classic mode (with more to come?). Time Attack, multiple difficulties and some fair challenge, there's plenty to experience. What can I say? If you grew up with this sort of game, you probably want this. If you loved Shovel Knight, you might dig this. If you're a long-time Sonic fan looking fondly at your old cartridges, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance.\n\nWith a free demo, what do you have to lose?","January 7, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics may be very small in resolution, but look quite good and detailed even when scaled up to full screen. Animations, gameplay, storytelling and level design are all provided with a high quality level from start to end. You barely will find any boring or repetitive moments in this game, as each level is spacious but short enough to be completed within a few minutes time.

From it's humble start as a Sonic fan-game I followed it's development as it evolved into a bigger and better game. Even in it's early days I saw it's potential, and to think that it's done nothing but improve since the initial demos! It has moved well beyond it's origins now. It's less a of tribute and more of an evolution of a classic formula.\n\nYes, the movement is very Sonic-esque. However, a key difference is the combat system. Freedom Planet uses a traditional health bar as opposed to rings. Where Sonic relies on passive attacks with jumps or spindashes, Freedom Planet has active attacks with a full suite of moves that you will need to master to survive the later levels. This is a crucial point of difference that radically changes the way the game plays. These moves integrate into the platforming very well which makes for flashy, fluid gameplay. It's very satisfying once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe varied levels are generally fun to explore, full of color and backed by great music. I found myself playing slower than I would in Sonic just to admire the environments and see what I could find. There's also a lot more to interact with in each level, and while I wouldn't claim many are puzzles it makes the game more interesting and helps break up (or is pressured by) the combat. Enemies and bosses are diverse enough to provide new challenges from level to level.\n\nIf you are a fan of cheesy dialogue and voice acting the adventure mode is a joy to play. It reminds me of a good saturday morning cartoon, balancing light-hearted humor with serious developments. If you're not into that you can opt to ignore it entirely and play through the game with no cutscenes in classic mode. The story does provide context to the levels, of course, so they are at least somewhat necessary IMO. Note that one character (Milla) is exclusive to classic mode: only Lilac and Carol are playable in adventure mode.\n\nThe difficulty quickly ramps up midway through with certain bosses rivaling Dark Souls near the end. Many enemies and level hazards are also tough to deal with if unprepared. It's up to you to learn their attacks and hone your skills as there's no stat progression to make it easier, only a very forgiving continue should you game over. Quick reflexes are necessary to make any sort of progress in the final stages where health is a luxury. It can be a nightmare to complete even on normal difficulty, but the feeling of accomplishment makes it all worth it once you finally manage to push through and win.\n\nFreedom Planet earns a well deserved spot on my list of favorite games in recent memory. Anyone who dismisses it as a Sonic clone is simply missing out.","January 9, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are superbly designed, the bosses are intense and challenging, and it gives awesome incentive to be replayed multiple times as you have three different characters (four in the later future) that not only play entirely different from one another, but also have their own levels and branching paths!\n\nThe only thing that might turn you off is its plot-hole ridden and inconsistent story. It's fanfic material, escalating between lighthearted GIRL POWER kid-friendly stuff, to dark and serious territory involving politics, war and TORTURE. And keep in mind that the characters are a bunch of adorable, simple minded furries that want to save the world from an unstoppable evil. Its transition from kid friendly mindsets of saving the world, to the characters having realistic notions of stuff just doesn't work. I won't spoil anything, but the tale that Galaxy Trail made is filled with eye rolling "cringe" moments and that's kinda disappointing. The story tries so hard to be mature for its own good.\n\nBut that doesn't stop Freedom Planet from being an excellent game. I'm not even a huge fan of old school platformers and I still adored every minute of it. Let that be a tip to any who are shy of the genre, because Freedom Planet does an excellent job balancing its mechanics by being both a 2D action game and an obstacle course platformer. You have the best of both worlds, and it never becomes a Jack-of-All trades kinda thing where it fails to achieve quality gameplay by doing too much; both aspects are next to flawless. Movement can be a little slippery and sensitive, and the physics are sort of wonky as of this moment, but the developer intends to improve the game as it treads towards its inevitable release date.\n\nBuy it, support the developers, and hope that they will make a sequel.","August 18, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a cornucopia of 90s goodness! It's SO 90s that it's practically like you're playing it on a Sega Geneis while drinking a Coke Classic at a juice bar run by Crash Bandicoot and Sonic the Hedgehog and staffed by the Road Rovers with Johnny Bravo on Next while the Mask is in the background hustling at a game of Pool with Homestar Runner and Sam & Max: Freelance Police is on TV...Yoshis. I do see a few similarities to the Blue Blur's haydays, so I can tell why SOME would peg it as a Clone, but I say NUTS to that crap! The game is WORLDS away from that guy, both figuratively and literally.\n\nThe game itself and its levels are like a bag of potato chips: You can't (b)eat just one! Case and point, I finally pulled myself away from it to write this review. If they made a sequel, I'd be all for it and waiting (I can't afford to support a kickstarter)! Not since My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic have I been so enthralled in something of this variety. In fact, I can safely say the main playable characters remind me a little of one half of the Mane Six (Sash Lilac = Twilight Sparkle, Carol Tea = Rainbow Dash and Milla Basset = Fluttershy). The only thing that I feel bad about is that it's likely going to be future Dorkly material. But that's okay, still a great game! So what are you waiting for?

If there are any complaints its the fact that the pricetag may be too much for some people and the story is rather uninspired.  The story, but not the characters.

The art style is cutesy and seems very much like a Sonic the Hedgehog and Ristar hybrid gameplay wise with the perfect amount of originality tossed in to it (mostly in the form of the combat but in other ways too). The story is cool too and way more in depth than that you get when grabbing most sidescrollers and while some of the voices I wasn't too fond of I did enjoy the plot that was given to me and the characters got the points across in times of emotion. The combat system is fun and doesn't detract from the platforming, if anything it adds to it immensely and allows you lots of room to improvise with getting through an area. The bosses are a blast to try to beat, while difficult (each one taking myself several attempts to beat), they aren't overly unfair if you know how to work the abilities at your disposal. Overall I'd say it is certainly worth the buy, those who are fans of retro-esque platformers will likely love it since it takes everything from classic high speed platforming games and improves on it ten-fold.","December 21, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from that, the gameplay felt refreshing from your typical 2D platformer, and the music was just awesome; they even retained what they did in Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and changed the music for the 2nd act of the level.\n\nThe characters are adorable, extremely memorable, and sometimes you can really feel the direct connection between some of them (I don't remember the last time I absolutely despised a villain in a game, but the main antagonist is definitely someone I despise.) There are also three characters to choose from (third one is unlocked and currently has no story mode at the moment, just classic mode), with a fourth coming soon(?). If you're not one to really care for the story (Big mistake but whatever floats your boat) then you can just play in classic mode, so the stages just go in order.\n\nDid I mention there's also Mahjong?

In todays gaming world of brown and gray it is nice to see a title that is awash with primary colours. Stages each have their own distinct theme and the colour choices fit them perfectly. The only thing I can liken it too is Dynamite Headdy or Ristar The Shooting Star on the Sega Megadrive (Genesis). If those games appealed to you and you like speed then this is the game for you.\n\nSound:\nI only have, at the time of this review, 1.5 hours  on record so its not really enough time to judge accurately. However,  from what Ive heard so far it is great. Voice acting is a bit hit-and-miss at times but for a fan game its good. Each stage music fits the stage perfectly and has a very Saturn-esque vibe going on with both a mix of synth and CD-quality audio.\n\nStory:\nAgain, as above, Im not far into the game but it is quite a light-hearted story with some occasional dark moments.\n\nGameplay:\nThe most important aspect and it delivers in spades. You take the role of 3 characters Lilac (dragon), Carol (cat, I think) and another I forgot the name of. Each have their own powerups and abilities to help navigate the expansive levels. Despite being heavily influenced by Sonic you dont have the standard "collectible items that stop you dying in 1 hit" mechanic here. There are blue gems to collect with 200 netting you an extra life. You do however have a life bar which is replenished by collecting red leaf looking items. Above your health is what amounts to a mana bar that powers your secondary attacks. This refills over time and moves cannot be performed until it is refilled.\nPerhaps the hardest thing to get to grips with is enemy behaviour. In most 2D sidescrollers simply touching an enemy results in a hit. Not here, the enemy has to be in an attack animation. Although a good idea in theory, it can make enemy hitboxes seem a bit....off :/\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nAn underrated gem that fans of classic Sonic and classic platformers will enjoy. Story, from what Ive read, is a good 5-6 hours long. Characters are well fleshed out and the music is brilliant\n\n10/10 by a country mile","December 21, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can safely say it did not disappoint.\n\nThis game is clearly influenced from popular games from the 90's, but still manages to feel original. The 3 main characters all play differently, keeping the game feeling fresh and giving it replay value (I've spent 8 hours with 1 character). The game still has some glitches, but the developer is actively working to fix them.\n\nFreedom Planet also gave me a strong sense of satisfaction.

The music and visual design marry to form an incredibly charming world. The foreground objects and background scenery are varied and feel alive with energy, from the natural out door areas through to the constructed, synthetic final areas. The character designs, even the tertiary and background characters, are appealing and feel like a "good fit" to the world they inhabit. The voice acting isn't flawless, but even that works out in Freedom Planet's favor, adding a "Saturday Morning Cartoon" charm to the dialogue.\nI was personally very impressed with the way that the main characters are depicted; games featuring a strong female lead generally tend to over-emphiasize the hero's femininity or completely ignore it. There is also a tendency to make female heroes either too strong, or too weak, in comparison to their male counterparts. Freedom Planet pretty cleanly evades this entire hail of metaphorical bullets with Lilac and Carol. Though Carol is intended to be the more tomboy-ish of the pair, both manage to show us their strength and their weakness without ever needing to stop and remind the audience, "Oh, by the way, I'm female," as though it's an excuse.\nWhile decidedly not a clone or a spin-off, Freedom Planet's roots as a Sonic the Hedgehog derived work show themselves in the level designs; expect to see ramps, looping circular paths, springs, switches, and other set peices normally unique to SEGA's 2D flagship series. As such, a number of them end up feeling out of place or clumsy (springs, in particular, cause Lilac to skid to an agonizing halt due to the momentum-handling). In general, the level layouts are probably the game's biggest shortcoming. Lilac and Carol (and later Mila) share stages, meaning that it needs to be possible for both characters (possessing radically different modes of movement) to complete said areas. Carol's motorcycle climbing ladders aside, Lilac's special action tends to send her face-planting against walls intended for Carol to climb at least a few times each level.\nThe game's difficulty can also be frustrating; many, many parts of the game feel as though they're "just right," causing some of the boss fights to be impossibly hard by comparison. Lilac in particular will have a hard time finding ways to hit some of her bosses, as her normal attacks have too little reach to avoid damage, and her dash drains her entire special action meter when used. Most of the length of the bosses was spent waiting for the dragon dash to recharge. Carol faces similar problems on one boss in particular, where her wild kick needs to be managed carefully.\nThe last two paragraphs are definitely minor complaints surrounding what is possibly one of the most amazing games I've ever played. The entire experience gave my inner child an ear-to-ear smile. Pass this one up only if you absolutely don't like things that are fun.","March 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are superbly designed, the bosses are intense and challenging, and it gives awesome incentive to be replayed multiple times as you have three different characters (four in the later future) that not only play entirely different from one another, but also have their own levels and branching paths!\n\nThe only thing that might turn you off is its plot-hole ridden and inconsistent story. It's fanfic material, escalating between lighthearted GIRL POWER kid-friendly stuff, to dark and serious territory involving politics, war and TORTURE. And keep in mind that the characters are a bunch of adorable, simple minded furries that want to save the world from an unstoppable evil. Its transition from kid friendly mindsets of saving the world, to the characters having realistic notions of stuff just doesn't work. I won't spoil anything, but the tale that Galaxy Trail made is filled with eye rolling "cringe" moments and that's kinda disappointing. The story tries so hard to be mature for its own good.\n\nBut that doesn't stop Freedom Planet from being an excellent game. I'm not even a huge fan of old school platformers and I still adored every minute of it. Let that be a tip to any who are shy of the genre, because Freedom Planet does an excellent job balancing its mechanics by being both a 2D action game and an obstacle course platformer. You have the best of both worlds, and it never becomes a Jack-of-All trades kinda thing where it fails to achieve quality gameplay by doing too much; both aspects are next to flawless. Movement can be a little slippery and sensitive, and the physics are sort of wonky as of this moment, but the developer intends to improve the game as it treads towards its inevitable release date.\n\nBuy it, support the developers, and hope that they will make a sequel.","August 18, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I may make a lot of references towards those games because this one brought back a LOT of nostalgia for me.\n\nAnyway the game is you playing either Lilac or Carol (and there's another character named Milla but she's only played in classic mode). The story starts off that an alien dictator Brevon (who reminds me of Zinyak from Saints Row IV a little) coming to the planet to kill a king and brainwash his son into doing what he wants (I don't know why he probably could have just invaded but whatever) and [MEANWHILE] Lilac and Carol see a spaceship falling on the planet where they meed Torque whose an alien (but dresses as a duck to not scare locals).\nAnyway it turns into a big debocal where they have to get several emporers, generals, mayors etc. to join to face Brevon. But in doing so each of the characters run into old aquaintences, trouble with the law, etc. So that being said I'll start off what I think of each component of the game.\n\nSTORY:\nOkay surprisingly this game has a decent story. Some of the dialogue is something you've seen before but the characters are identifiable, they're cute and the sequences of the story aren't the stupid "THIS IS YOUR DESTINY" cliche, the characters will admit they're scared you'll ♥♥♥♥ up. It's definitly rated G as far as "if this were a movie" goes but there were several moments I was like "DAYAM ♥♥♥♥ THAT HAPPENED!" It does also have a Sonic the Hedgehog vibe to it but it's still a decent story. Whether you're a pupil or an adult the story of the game does grab your attention long enough to where I didn't find myself skipping most of the storyline, there was even a teary moment at the end (but you have to see what it is yourself I'm not spoiling it) (or go to youtube, cuz ♥♥♥♥ you). And if you don't care for the story, lucky you you can just skip it.\n\nSOUND:\nThe game for being what reminds me of a Genesis/Super Nintendo funny enough does well with the sound effects, the voice acting (yea it's not just a beep in between dialogues) and music. For this game's genre type I give it an A.\n\nCONTROLS: Being that it's only arrows and three buttons you gotta worry about the controls are very fluid and they're timed perfectly. There are several moments that require a combo in each level but they're easy to figure out. And you're going to need to know because quite frankly there are points where sometimes there's no enemies to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But you'll know what you're doing by then.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Honestly it's fun as hell. It's fast paced (like sonic the hedgehog), there's explosions everywhere (like vectorman/sonic) the combos are fun to use, the bosses are hard as ♥♥♥♥ later in the game, like you literally have to start memorizing their fight pattern like a mother ♥♥♥♥er, and there's difficulties of Casual, Easy, Normal and Hard. I was on Normal, dear God some parts I didn't think I was but it didn't matter this game makes you want to keep going back. The character/enemy/boss varieties are fun and unique too.\n\nREPLAY: I'm starting my second campaign with the other character right after the frustration of beating the final boss, I love this game.\n\nOVERALL: I personally think this game is worth the try, whether you're thinking about picking it up for a steam sale or just looking for another side scroller to kill time I promise this one you'll find spending a whole day (like I did) beating it. It's also a good nostalgia for old school Genesis and Nintendo players. I like the soundtrack, the characters, the gameplay, everything about this game.\nThe only thing I'll say is I think would harm this game is some people may probably relate it too much to Sonic as if they pretty much ripped off the game, but I noticed in the credits at the end there was a special thanks to a particular Sonic Team (not THE sonic team) but it definitly shows the game was heavily influenced by it, and I believe Ristar, Vectorman and Gunstar Heroes as well. I love it when a game takes elements from others and just makes an awesome game.\n\nI give this game an A.\nGo try it now.","November 28, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Freedom Planet is to Sonic what Shovel Knight is to Mega Man.If you enjoy old school platformers, then there shouldn't be any reason for you to not like Freedom Planet... for the most part.\n\nThe good\n\nThe level design is great, and despite the relatively open levels, I never felt lost as one could easily become in this kind of sonic-like platformer. Gameplay elements change stage to stage, and are always properly introduced.\nThe music is great, and on par with oldschool classics. I highly value the quality of music in games, and this has received plenty of attention in Freedom Planet.\nGameplay is solid, and has a natural difficulty curve. The levels themselves always feels just right in terms of difficulty.\nThe pixel art for this game is absolutely gorgeous at times. The character design is also very well done.\nThe bad\nThe controls are not particularly tight due to the high standard controller sensitivity. I recommend reducing it to 50% as leaving it at 100% can interfere with gameplay, not to mention make menu navigation a nightmare.\nThe story is rather dull and uninteresting, and the overall plot feels rushed.\nWhat doesn't help the story is the often terrible voice acting. This didn't exactly help my opinion on the story, as I found myself skipping through dialogue to avoid hearing it. With no menu option to turn off voices, this was a constant annoyance that broke immersion for me throughout the entire game. The bad voice acting itself made me question giving this game a positive review, but I feel that other factors outweigh this issue.\nThe game is hard. Reel hard. This is definitely on par with standard NES/SNES era platformers, but that's fine. The problem comes with later bosses (especially the final boss) feeling artificially difficult to the point where I was on the brink of rage quitting; two thirds of my deaths were on two bosses alone. If not for the generous save system I would not have been able to finish the game.\nIt takes only about five to six hours to complete the game, and while the game has replay value in terms of multiple characters and modes, collectables and achievements, I didn't personally feel any desire to replay this particular game. Others may feel differently on this issue.","July 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I can safely say it did not disappoint.\n\nThis game is clearly influenced from popular games from the 90's, but still manages to feel original. The 3 main characters all play differently, keeping the game feeling fresh and giving it replay value (I've spent 8 hours with 1 character). The game still has some glitches, but the developer is actively working to fix them.\n\nFreedom Planet also gave me a strong sense of satisfaction. This game is not easy, and the bosses are even harder, but the feeling you get when you get that last hit makes up for it.\n\nI highly recommend Freedom Planet to just about anybody who has $15 to spend on something awesome.\n\n9/10","July 26, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music and visual design marry to form an incredibly charming world. The foreground objects and background scenery are varied and feel alive with energy, from the natural out door areas through to the constructed, synthetic final areas. The character designs, even the tertiary and background characters, are appealing and feel like a "good fit" to the world they inhabit. The voice acting isn't flawless, but even that works out in Freedom Planet's favor, adding a "Saturday Morning Cartoon" charm to the dialogue.\nI was personally very impressed with the way that the main characters are depicted; games featuring a strong female lead generally tend to over-emphiasize the hero's femininity or completely ignore it. There is also a tendency to make female heroes either too strong, or too weak, in comparison to their male counterparts. Freedom Planet pretty cleanly evades this entire hail of metaphorical bullets with Lilac and Carol. Though Carol is intended to be the more tomboy-ish of the pair, both manage to show us their strength and their weakness without ever needing to stop and remind the audience, "Oh, by the way, I'm female," as though it's an excuse.\nWhile decidedly not a clone or a spin-off, Freedom Planet's roots as a Sonic the Hedgehog derived work show themselves in the level designs; expect to see ramps, looping circular paths, springs, switches, and other set peices normally unique to SEGA's 2D flagship series. As such, a number of them end up feeling out of place or clumsy (springs, in particular, cause Lilac to skid to an agonizing halt due to the momentum-handling). In general, the level layouts are probably the game's biggest shortcoming. Lilac and Carol (and later Mila) share stages, meaning that it needs to be possible for both characters (possessing radically different modes of movement) to complete said areas. Carol's motorcycle climbing ladders aside, Lilac's special action tends to send her face-planting against walls intended for Carol to climb at least a few times each level.\nThe game's difficulty can also be frustrating; many, many parts of the game feel as though they're "just right," causing some of the boss fights to be impossibly hard by comparison. Lilac in particular will have a hard time finding ways to hit some of her bosses, as her normal attacks have too little reach to avoid damage, and her dash drains her entire special action meter when used. Most of the length of the bosses was spent waiting for the dragon dash to recharge. Carol faces similar problems on one boss in particular, where her wild kick needs to be managed carefully.\nThe last two paragraphs are definitely minor complaints surrounding what is possibly one of the most amazing games I've ever played. The entire experience gave my inner child an ear-to-ear smile. Pass this one up only if you absolutely don't like things that are fun.","March 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're well put together, fun games, but I've always cottoned to Mega Man and Mario a bit more.  So I was intrigued by this game, but wasn't expecting it to get its hooks in.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nSee, it's not really just Sonic, there's elements of all sorts of games in there, from Mega Man X to Gunstar Heroes to Rocket Knight.  And it's all fun stuff.  I love having a melee attack to use, as opposed to hopping and bopping.  I generally used Lilac, and it dawned on me that to some degree, there was some similarity between the feel of her attacks and Zero in Mega Man X4.  It's really good stuff.\n\nGraphically, it's a really nice looking game.  Lots of creative little flourishes that probably wouldn't have made it on the Genesis, although stuff like Ristar came close.  It's more like a long-lost Saturn game, and this would have been exceptionally well received had it debuted on the Saturn.\n\nHaving multiple characters certainly improves the replay value, especially since each character has a couple of unique stages.  Not to mention they're different enough to change how things feel even in the overlapping stages.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very much praiseworthy.  Lots of upbeat, rockin' tunes.\n\nThe story has been much maligned, but I quite enjoyed it.  Is it rocket science?  Of course not.  It's going for a Saturday morning cartoon vibe, and outside of a few rather dark sequences, it nails it.  I found most of the voice acting well done as well.\n\nIf the game makes any missteps, it's that it gets pretty brutally hard towards the end.  The final boss, in particular, saw me drop around 30 lives before I finally sussed out the pattern.  I'm pretty sure I can repeat it at this point, but if you don't like tough, pattern-based bosses, you may find yourself frustrated.\n\nAnyway, if you like Sonic, you might like this game.  If you positively ADORE Sonic, you might not like it, as it sprinkles in so many other elements that it becomes far more than a Sonic clone.  For me, that makes it fantastic, and well worth playing.  Two thumbs up, and definitely looking forward to a sequel!","March 26, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the soundtrack to the gameplay to the art, this game is definitely worth your time.\n\nThe soundtrack is outstanding! It's got to be my favorite soundtrack of anything, ever. Seriously, go buy it.\nThe art style is gorgeous too. The characters' animations are all lifelike and colorful, and the bosses are awe-inspiring. Clearly a lot of work went into all the sprites. There's even a neat little easter egg in the third level where the characters dance!\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun. The levels are huge, with lots of room to explore. This was inspired by Sonic, so expect loop-de-loops and running on walls, but the overall pace isn't as "go-go-go" as Sonic is. There are multiple ways to get through any given level, too - so replaying one level can actually feel like exploring a whole new one at times.\nThere are three characters at time of writing, with two more on the way, and all of them have vastly different playstyles. For example, Lilac is speedy and strong, with a double-jump and a speed-boost attack; on the other hand, Carol trades all-out speed for the capability to scale walls, smash enemies with her Wild Kick move, and even ride a motorcycle!\n\nThe bosses are quite interesting - early on, they're pretty simple, but later on, they get crushingly hard. You have to pay close attention to their attack patterns if you're ever going to survive. The final boss smashed me 25 times before I eventually conquered it - but I enjoyed every second.\n\nOn the subject of difficulty, there are four modes - Casual, Easy, Normal, and Hard. Casual is easier than easy - you take scarcely any damage, even from the most powerful foes, and your health regenerates to boot. Easy keeps the regenerating health, but you take the same damage as usual; but Hard is brutal at times. If you're looking for a challenge, that'll satisfy alright.\n\nWhile the story is not one of its strong points, with some pacing issues in the cutscenes, there is a "Classic Mode" that lets you play through the levels in order without a single cutscene to be seen, if you prefer it that way. Nonetheless, I actually enjoyed the story, despite its cheesy bits.\n\nAll things considered, Freedom Planet is not without its flaws, but they're few and far between. For a mere $15, it is definitely worth your time and money. What are you doing still reading this?! Go play it and see!\n\ntl;dr: This game is absolutely amazing. Go buy it right now.","April 28, 2015","true","64.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously, this game has great level design, interesting boss designs, an amazing OST, and three fun playable characters (with two more coming soon in a free dlc.).\n\nThe only glaring problems I have is the fact that I feel that a couple of bosses, depending on the character, could use some rebalancing.  Other than that, the story is a bit underwhelming, some of the voice overs can get a bit cringy at times, and cutscenes tend to over stay their welcome every now and again. Fortunately, one could choose to play "classic mode"  instead of "Adventure mode," which allows the player to skip the game's story elements/cutscenes/etc. and simply play one level after another.\n\nTo conclude this short review, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a good platformer. This game may have a lackluster story, but the gameplay is simply amazing and can lead to hours of fun. (Or about an hour of rage.  Milla's story-Battle Glacier. That's all I'm gonna say.)","January 10, 2015","true","64.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Several hours later I can without a doubt say this is one of the best games I've played in a very long time, if not one of the best I've played of all time.\n\nAs a person who grew up playing platformers like these, I already went in knowing I'd like it, but its not a cakewalk at all which some may take as a bad thing, but to have a game that actually is challenging is a nice thing compared to easy games that tend to be prevailant now. Many say its like a Sonic platformer, but I wouldn't really call it that alone. It's more of a combination of other platformers like Sparkster, Mega Man, Sonic, Rinstar, and others mixed into its own unique flavor. Game starts off decently easy letting you get to know how to use the characters, then it kicks it into overdrive and gets challenging (there are difficulty modes so those who don't want it to be as hard can have it this way). Level design is well done and interesting. Bosses get progressivly harder along with stages. There are three characters to play as who each play very differently than each other and each are sastifying to play as. Gameplay is pretty damn solid with nothing to say other than its really fun. You get to go fast and there aren't many momentum killing enemies. Nothing to gripe and its really damn fun to play. Story is actually pretty interesting too which I wasn't expecting since most of the time platformer games have minimal story that you tend to just put to the side if its even followable. Even playing classic mode (level to level with no story elements) its easy to catch on the story and follow along. I liked it a lot and wasn't too hard to follow in the midst of playing the game.\n\nVisuals and the soundtrack are great as well. The graphics are a throwback to stuff back in the early/mid 90s which look really nice and run smoothly. The only thing one could gripe about visuals would be the slowdowns at a bosses defeat, but that is very minor and has no effect on actual gameplay.  The soundtrack is well beyond what I was expecting. From start the start I was instantly in love with it and it only got better the more I played. The boss music is easily in my top ever of just overall game music. The stage musics are also really great too. It was the one time I didn't even hesistate to buy the ost for it. I had to have it and support it. The only thing I could find some people could have a problem with in the audio department is the voice acting (cheesy), but then again, thats not a nack on the game at all. It didnt bother me (I actually liked some of them a lot)\n\nOverall I'd have to say if you loved playing platformers back in the 90s or you just like good games, I highly recommend getting this. There are lots of things to strive for in the game from the achievements to unlocking stuff or just trying to beat your best time. The soundtrack is superb. The design is also superb. I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a while. If I had known of this when it was being kickstarted, I would have surely supported it as much as I could. I just love this so much. I can see myself still playing this a long time from now returning back to it many times.","February 3, 2015","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story isn't exactly perfect, but you can choose to ignore by choosing Classic Mode when you start a new game.\n\nThough its $/€15 price tag may be a bit too much (I recommend buying it when it's on sale), it's most certainly worth whatever you're paying for it.","February 7, 2015","true","95.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At its heart, the game feels like an amalgamation of so many gaming memories from the nineties. Sonic is one, but there are also doses of Rocket Knight Adventures, Gunstar Heroes, Blaster Master... the whole thing is one big high-octane sixteen-bit thrillride which (apart from more modern touches like completely voiced dialogue and a rather lengthy story element in Adventure Mode) feels like it would have been considered a classic without question if it had come out back in the day.\n\nThat's not to say the game is perfect by any stretch. The story, while entertaining in terms of individual cutscenes, has a weird pace (occasionally taking ten minutes or so to get through a dialogue sequence), and shifts tone between dark and lighthearted a bit too jarringly, not to mention the plot itself is fairly simple (you can select Classic Mode to play the game through minus the story sequences, though). If I had to register a balance complaint, it would be that the game's bosses, while elaborate and certainly well-designed for what they are, feel like they belong in a much harder game--if you want anything resembling the sort of comfortable platformer difficulty that games like Sonic and Rocket Knight generally provide, you'll need to play on Easy difficulty--the bosses will kick your butt and grind it into a paste while you're working to get a handle on their patterns of attack, otherwise.\n\nBut the gameplay is solid and flowful, apart from some very rare collision-issue moments that I only suffered on replays; there are three characters, one unlockable, each offering a very unique gameplay style (the main character Lilac is my personal favorite and the one I recommend starting with). The level designs are all unique, if nothing wildly revolutionary for the genre, and the sense of pace, while somewhat slower than Sonic the Hedgehog (due in part to the greater emphasis on action elements) remains consistent throughout.\n\nPut frankly, in spite of what flaws there are, I love this game and want nothing more than to get the word out there that it's a near-must-play for fans of the style of platformer that was popular back in the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive era. It's only about five or so hours long at a stretch, but it provides more than enough fun factor and content for its $15 price point, as well. At the very least, do yourself a solid one and try out the demo. That in itself is fairly substantial, featuring a full stage and one "act" of a second level.\n\nAs a side note, the music is also fantastic and el gasp, an indie game using pixel art that looks like it isn't just trying to look like pixel art because RETRO NOSTALGIA! I am almost in awe. Almost. Did I mention the game's very pretty-looking? Because it is.","December 15, 2014","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The physics are more forgiving to the player and momentum can be built up easily. It works for this game as it is slightly more combat focused. You get to choose between three different characters.\n\nLilac: Is your speedy character that lets you boost around the level and enemies.\n\nCarol: Is your melee focused character that can climb the level walls and scratch and kick enemies along the way.\n\nMilla: Is your defence focused character which can block the attack from enemies to rebound back at them. Bosses/Enemies that may be difficult with Carol and Lilac can be very easy with Milla. Oh and she can Fly.\n\nPlaying with each character completely changes the way you navigate a level, it contains low paths, high paths and each route is faster and quicker depending on which character you end up using.\nThe game has 4 Difficulty options, Casual / Easy / Normal / Hard. So it has a great range of difficulties depending on how challenging you want the game.\n\nI love the first Sonic games and I loved my Sega MegaDrive. This game feels like something from that era, and feels and plays amazingly. It's a lot of and fun and can get quite difficult at points. Especially the final boss fight, although the progression is very good so you should have a lot of fun along the way as you get better.\n\nIf you like fast/speedy platformers, then this is great. The developers have completely nailed this game. Music is also done to perfection, many tracks feel like something out of a Sonic game and it's fantastic.\n\nIf Shovel Knight was homage to old SNES games, then this is homage to SEGA classics. It's a shame it has not had the same amount of coverage in gaming media. Massively underrated.\n\n*There is also a story mode with a lot of cheesy cutscenes. The voice acting is good and the characters are quite likable, but the story can drag on. You can play the game in 'Classic' mode which skips all the cutscenes automatically. Story mode is not the strong point of this game, though I still enjoyed it.","November 27, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music and visual design marry to form an incredibly charming world. The foreground objects and background scenery are varied and feel alive with energy, from the natural out door areas through to the constructed, synthetic final areas. The character designs, even the tertiary and background characters, are appealing and feel like a "good fit" to the world they inhabit. The voice acting isn't flawless, but even that works out in Freedom Planet's favor, adding a "Saturday Morning Cartoon" charm to the dialogue.\nI was personally very impressed with the way that the main characters are depicted; games featuring a strong female lead generally tend to over-emphiasize the hero's femininity or completely ignore it. There is also a tendency to make female heroes either too strong, or too weak, in comparison to their male counterparts. Freedom Planet pretty cleanly evades this entire hail of metaphorical bullets with Lilac and Carol. Though Carol is intended to be the more tomboy-ish of the pair, both manage to show us their strength and their weakness without ever needing to stop and remind the audience, "Oh, by the way, I'm female," as though it's an excuse.\nWhile decidedly not a clone or a spin-off, Freedom Planet's roots as a Sonic the Hedgehog derived work show themselves in the level designs; expect to see ramps, looping circular paths, springs, switches, and other set peices normally unique to SEGA's 2D flagship series. As such, a number of them end up feeling out of place or clumsy (springs, in particular, cause Lilac to skid to an agonizing halt due to the momentum-handling). In general, the level layouts are probably the game's biggest shortcoming. Lilac and Carol (and later Mila) share stages, meaning that it needs to be possible for both characters (possessing radically different modes of movement) to complete said areas. Carol's motorcycle climbing ladders aside, Lilac's special action tends to send her face-planting against walls intended for Carol to climb at least a few times each level.\nThe game's difficulty can also be frustrating; many, many parts of the game feel as though they're "just right," causing some of the boss fights to be impossibly hard by comparison. Lilac in particular will have a hard time finding ways to hit some of her bosses, as her normal attacks have too little reach to avoid damage, and her dash drains her entire special action meter when used. Most of the length of the bosses was spent waiting for the dragon dash to recharge. Carol faces similar problems on one boss in particular, where her wild kick needs to be managed carefully.\nThe last two paragraphs are definitely minor complaints surrounding what is possibly one of the most amazing games I've ever played. The entire experience gave my inner child an ear-to-ear smile. Pass this one up only if you absolutely don't like things that are fun.","March 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Several hours later I can without a doubt say this is one of the best games I've played in a very long time, if not one of the best I've played of all time.\n\nAs a person who grew up playing platformers like these, I already went in knowing I'd like it, but its not a cakewalk at all which some may take as a bad thing, but to have a game that actually is challenging is a nice thing compared to easy games that tend to be prevailant now. Many say its like a Sonic platformer, but I wouldn't really call it that alone. It's more of a combination of other platformers like Sparkster, Mega Man, Sonic, Rinstar, and others mixed into its own unique flavor. Game starts off decently easy letting you get to know how to use the characters, then it kicks it into overdrive and gets challenging (there are difficulty modes so those who don't want it to be as hard can have it this way). Level design is well done and interesting. Bosses get progressivly harder along with stages. There are three characters to play as who each play very differently than each other and each are sastifying to play as. Gameplay is pretty damn solid with nothing to say other than its really fun. You get to go fast and there aren't many momentum killing enemies. Nothing to gripe and its really damn fun to play. Story is actually pretty interesting too which I wasn't expecting since most of the time platformer games have minimal story that you tend to just put to the side if its even followable. Even playing classic mode (level to level with no story elements) its easy to catch on the story and follow along. I liked it a lot and wasn't too hard to follow in the midst of playing the game.\n\nVisuals and the soundtrack are great as well. The graphics are a throwback to stuff back in the early/mid 90s which look really nice and run smoothly. The only thing one could gripe about visuals would be the slowdowns at a bosses defeat, but that is very minor and has no effect on actual gameplay.  The soundtrack is well beyond what I was expecting. From start the start I was instantly in love with it and it only got better the more I played. The boss music is easily in my top ever of just overall game music. The stage musics are also really great too. It was the one time I didn't even hesistate to buy the ost for it. I had to have it and support it. The only thing I could find some people could have a problem with in the audio department is the voice acting (cheesy), but then again, thats not a nack on the game at all. It didnt bother me (I actually liked some of them a lot)\n\nOverall I'd have to say if you loved playing platformers back in the 90s or you just like good games, I highly recommend getting this. There are lots of things to strive for in the game from the achievements to unlocking stuff or just trying to beat your best time. The soundtrack is superb. The design is also superb. I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a while. If I had known of this when it was being kickstarted, I would have surely supported it as much as I could. I just love this so much. I can see myself still playing this a long time from now returning back to it many times.","February 3, 2015","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're well put together, fun games, but I've always cottoned to Mega Man and Mario a bit more.  So I was intrigued by this game, but wasn't expecting it to get its hooks in.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nSee, it's not really just Sonic, there's elements of all sorts of games in there, from Mega Man X to Gunstar Heroes to Rocket Knight.  And it's all fun stuff.  I love having a melee attack to use, as opposed to hopping and bopping.  I generally used Lilac, and it dawned on me that to some degree, there was some similarity between the feel of her attacks and Zero in Mega Man X4.  It's really good stuff.\n\nGraphically, it's a really nice looking game.  Lots of creative little flourishes that probably wouldn't have made it on the Genesis, although stuff like Ristar came close.  It's more like a long-lost Saturn game, and this would have been exceptionally well received had it debuted on the Saturn.\n\nHaving multiple characters certainly improves the replay value, especially since each character has a couple of unique stages.  Not to mention they're different enough to change how things feel even in the overlapping stages.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very much praiseworthy.  Lots of upbeat, rockin' tunes.\n\nThe story has been much maligned, but I quite enjoyed it.  Is it rocket science?  Of course not.  It's going for a Saturday morning cartoon vibe, and outside of a few rather dark sequences, it nails it.  I found most of the voice acting well done as well.\n\nIf the game makes any missteps, it's that it gets pretty brutally hard towards the end.  The final boss, in particular, saw me drop around 30 lives before I finally sussed out the pattern.  I'm pretty sure I can repeat it at this point, but if you don't like tough, pattern-based bosses, you may find yourself frustrated.\n\nAnyway, if you like Sonic, you might like this game.  If you positively ADORE Sonic, you might not like it, as it sprinkles in so many other elements that it becomes far more than a Sonic clone.  For me, that makes it fantastic, and well worth playing.

It's pretty much what Sonic The Hedgehog 4 SHOULD have been! Solid gameplay highly influenced by the early Sonic games, with many characters, a sense of humor and a story to tie everything together. Great graphics, great animation, great sound, great music, great level design, boss design, character design, geat gameplay. It's got everything. My only gripe is the dialoge volume and quality differs rather severely from character to character, as does the acting, but it's not enough to ruin the experience.\n\nIt goes on sale fairly often, but is probably worth the asking price if you're a fan of the early Sonic the Hedgehog games.","March 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And this review is what i've played thus far. Also, this review has spoilers.\n\nPlaying as Lilac, I noticed she was a very balanced character, matching 2fast4me speed with awesome combat maneuvers (and that was just in my first LP video of the game). Carol seems to be more focused on speed and parkour, having a wall jump ability. I also noticed that some of Carol's sections have red things that enable you to jump from wall/floor/cieling to wall/florr/ceiling, a la Sonic '06.\n\nThe game's humor is phenominal. I couldn't help but laugh at the +5 GLORY and 5% OFF text after the robo-lion battle.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay... let's just say I wish SEGA used Freedom Planet as a reference point when making Sonic Boom.\n\nBuy this, without the shadow of a doubt. Don't you dare hesitate clicking that "purchase" button, this game will never fail to disappoint you and can't stop making you laugh. Also, a sequel should be done. that would be cool. Or maybe DLC that allows you to play as the characters in the Dark Side? Like, Sonic Adventure 2-style Light & Dark stories?

Past that, the game gets extremely difficult very quickly. Actually completing the game on normal difficulty requires a high level of skill.\n\nIf you're a strong platform gamer you'll probably still manage to complete it, but it will absolutely test your skills. Even if you do complete the game, you will likely feel frustrated, as the difficulty comes unexpectedly.\n\nThere are segments you will not complete on your first try, simply because you can't anticipate the danger. "Gotcha!" moments are way too common in the late game.\n\nThis can be very discouraging at times!\n\nIf Freedom Planet called normal mode "hard mode," and hard mode "very hard mode," that be an improvement. It'd at least give the player an honest idea of what to expect.\n\nI really, really enjoyed Freedom Planet, but it is absolutely not a game I can recommend to everyone.\n\nAt the very least, I'd advice anyone who isn't confident in their platformer skills to play on Easy difficulty first.","July 10, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over all, I think it's nice and a good buy.\n\nThe characters are fully voiced which is new to me in games like this, but I will say sometimes they don't sound like they're fully reaching the kind of emotion they are trying to convey but it's still pretty good voice acting in my opinion.\n\nI'm not one for graphics but this game looks like it tried to emulate Sonic's early days on the Dreamcast and Megadrive (I later heard that this was origonally a Sonic Fan Game so it's no wonder) and it does a fairly good job of doing that.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like a Sonic Game from the "Classic Era" especially when one plays as Lilac. As a result I keep trying to spindash when playing. However Lilac's ability that lets her bounce off the walls at high speeds is kind of hard to get a good sense on where you're going to go or even which direction you'll go as sometimes it seems like it doesn't matter.\n\nThe levels take me a fairly long time to beat but that's not nessicarily a bad thing, there's a fair amount of collectables I could go after if I so choosed and it's fairly liberal with it's checkpoints. Though I do wish there was a visual/audio cue letting me know that I hit a checkpoint, so that I don't have to worry about losing a signifigant amount of progress.\n\nThe boss battles are  immensely  fun. They are fast paced, straight forward, and give good visual cues when the boss is on it's last leg. However they are a tad unforgiving at times, the boss for Fortune Night has you dodging all many of lasers and explosives causing you to sometimes miss much needed health thrown to you by your allies. That being said I still enjoyed the battles greatly.\n\nThe music in the game is GREAT, I bought the soundtrack with this game and I'm glad I did. Each one is fitting for the area and tone of the level. As well as the boss music pumping you up for the battle at hand.\n\nTL;DR  Freedom Planet is a overall fun game that might seem rough around the edges in some areas but is a good buy during a sale.","June 17, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get on! There's no time to explain!" It then wisks you off to an alternate timeline where Gunstar Heroes, Ristar, and Sonic the Hedgehog were the top charting games of all time and the Sega Saturn somehow beat the Playstation and N64. This is the game that introduces you to that timeline. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this right now.\n\nPeople with No Context for that:\nNow that I'm done fanboying out, I'll tell you that if you played any of the Sonic games or any of the Mega Man games then Freedom Planet will feel familiar, but it's really its own thing. General controls and combat feel like a Mega Man game, but there's Sonic influences in that each level tends to have more than one path and there's a bit of emphasis on momentum, albeit not as much as in the actual Sonic games. There's a lot more margin of error, you have a health bar, and it isn't difficult to stop or change direction. You won't feel like you're controlling a pinball with legs so much as a very fast version of Mega Man who can cling to walls and run on ceilings.\n\nIn terms of production values, the game is influenced clearly from the best aspects of all of the above games, which all represent the finest platformers in the Sega Genesis catalogue. I mention the 32X because the presentation is a cut above those games, more in line with the 32-bit era of gaming than the 16-bit era, with more detail, more story, more color, voice acting, and a great soundtrack that goes beyond the indie chiptune status quo that you would expect from something like this.\n\nGameplay is a cut above the status quo as well. There's three playable characters with unique movesets and ways of navigating the environment. Each one is challenging and fun for different reasons and you'll have a blast taking apart enemies with their different blends of attacks. There are crazy-fun setpieces and tons of crazy-fun bosses galore. Every stage introduces unique enemies and obstacles, with very little being recycled between levels up until the end. Even then there's still new things being introduced as late as the last level. Everything sparkles, and EVERYTHING EXPLODES in the most satisfying way imaginable.\n\nI will say it isn't without its rough edges. The physics are a bit odd, sometimes it feels like the characters are approaching top speed without ever reaching it, and the threshold for being able to cling to a wall with your speed seems a bit low -- which makes momentum-based obstacles easy to overcome, but they do feel a bit weird. There's some places where you can tell the designers were still "feeling out" what's fun and what's a fair challenge, particularly with some boss and enemy designs. Something you need to get through your head in later levels is that you don't really get points for killing most enemies, so a lot of them are better left ignored or treated as stage obstacles rather than opponents.\n\nThese aren't really "bugs" or marks against the game's fun factor so much as what you'd expect from "first iteration" growing pains from a polished, finished, new product. It's comparable to what Ratchet and Clank 1 was like before its sequels refined its formula, and I'll be excited to see how Galaxy Trail improves on this base. Relative to the platforming world the experience stays fresh and satisfying for a good, long time, and relative to indie platformers this showcases by FAR a higher level of polish, effort, and variety than I'm used to seeing. There are established companies that don't make platformers this good.\n\nI rate this at four weird, alien animal mascot characters out of five.","June 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it during the 2015 summer sale last week for about $4, but if I knew how good it was I probably would've been willing to spend ten times that much on it.\n\nI was always more of a Nintendo kid than a Sega kid growing up, so I don't have too much nostalgia for the Genesis games that Freedom Planet tries to emulate. However, I did enjoy Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and I feel like I enjoyed this game just as much as those. Sonic is definitely the most obvious design inspiration (most obviously in the level structure), but Freedom Planet also takes a lot of ideas from other 16-bit games like Rocket Knight Adventures, Ristar, and Mega Man X. The bosses in particular are some of the best I've ever seen, and are just as good as anything in Gunstar Heroes.\n\nIt's clear that a lot of work went into making the 3 playable characters feel very dynamic and fun to play. They are all VERY different, and none of them truly play like Sonic as you might expect. The game is balanced around Lilac, who is sort of a hybrid of Sonic, Ristar, and Sparkster with some fighting game moves like an uppercut and a dive kick. However, I initially played through the entire game as Carol, who is much closer to Zero from Mega Man X4, with a fast combo-oriented claw attack and a wall jump. She also has a bizarrely awesome motorcycle that can double jump and drive straight up vertical walls. I'm impressed that the game still felt well designed and balanced despite playing with a character who works completely differently from Lilac.\n\nAfter around level 3, the bosses become extremely difficult, absurdly so relative to the stages themselves. And there are a lot of them, generally 2-3 per level. However, they are not truly unfair. Even with the notoriously difficult final boss, I was able to figure out his pattern enough to know how to beat him without taking a single hit... though I'm unable to play with enough skill to actually manage that. Fortunately, the game is generous with lives and checkpoints; I died 70 times throughout the entire game with Carol on Normal (20 of those deaths were on the final boss), but I never saw a game over. So the game is definitely hard, but it does encourage and reward skillful play.\n\nA lot of people don't like the story, but I found it somewhat charming, reminiscent of all those early 90s Saturday morning cartoons starring anthropomorphic animals that took themselves slightly too seriously. It is admittedly darker and more violent than those ever got, as you'll see during the introduction. However, the characters themselves keep things lighthearted 99% of the time. The voice acting is excellent (apart from the overly hammy king in the introduction, who gives a lousy first impression), and it's clear the actors had tons of fun during recording. Some of the cutscenes do go on far longer than they should; the worst offender is between levels 2 and 3. Fortunately, if you don't want to deal with cutscenes there is a specific option to play story mode without any of them.\n\nMy only other complaint is that the levels, while well designed, are probably longer than they should be. Not so much because they get boring, as the game introduces new mechanics and environments at a good pace, but because they can be exhausting. The game is generous with checkpoints, but saves only happen between levels, so you'll have to complete each of the 15-40 minute levels all in one session. I would have preferred that each level be cut in half, much like how Sonic's Zones have two Acts; the levels are clearly designed in halves, even with different music for each part, so I don't know why this wasn't done.\n\nIn summary, Freedom Planet is an excellent game, and I give it my highest recommendation. This and Shovel Knight should serve as examples of how to do retro gaming well, reaching a level of quality that stands shoulder to shoulder with the greatest games of the eras they seek to emulate.","June 23, 2015","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has interesting characters, levels, and a good story, and amazing voice actors. That's right this game is fully voice acted, and all of them are great. Every level has new enemy types so you'll rarely see them reused, the maps are just as diverse. There are three playable characters Lilac the Dragon, Carol the Wildcat, and Milla the Basset Hound. All of them play wildly different and have different levels specific to their particular character meaning that even on your third play through you'll still be seeing new content. That's not even counting the time trials or collectables.\n\nThe game loses point for being quite hard to play without a controler, not impossible, just hard. On the topic of hard the game is difficult but you always feel like it's your fault you died. The bosses are difficult and require you to learn their patterns to beat with any level of ease. You'll quickly find which character is your favourite and start ripping through the opposition... mostly.\n\nYou'll see a lot of people comparing this to Sonic games, as someone who has never played a Sonic game (aside from Sonic 06) this is exactly what I imagined Sonic games to be like. It's fun, it's fast, it's interesting, and it's full of content. I've played for 8 hours and I've only beat the game with one character, have next to none of the time trials done, and about 10% of the collectables.\n\nDo yourself a favour and buy this game. My friend introduced me to it, so play it, love it, and tell all your friends. If this game can become a series I'm certain it will eclipse Sonic games very soon. While Sonic is surely a great series I don't have to play it to know there hasn't been a good one in ages.\n\nIf I had to rate this game I'd give it a 9/10.

It's  one of the best indie platformers I've ever played .\n\nFirst of all, by just looking at the trailer or a screenshot, you can tell  this game looks gorgeous : it has one of the most detailed pixel art graphics I've ever seen and the music is amazing. I found the story interesting for a 2D game and playing as the different characters you get to see the story in their perspective ( slightly ). And the voice acting is pretty neat, again, for a 2D game.\n\nEverybody compares this to sonic but when you play it; you realize how different and unique this game is. There’s a variety of stages with creative gimmicks and  the characters have really original abilities  but you can try this by yourself by  playing the demo .\nUnlike sonic, the game tells you about the danger ahead,  enemies don’t damage you by touching them  only their attacks,  only 2 stages have bottomless pits , you can’t really get crushed so  there’s no cheap deaths here . The stages are long but they never feel boring and they contain a lot of secrets with their respective bosses and mid-bosses. It’s more combat-focused since every character has a big range of attacks; that’s why  the bosses and the action sequences are the best part of the game .\n\nI really don’t see any bad thing in this game , pointing out minor details would sound very forced. Maybe there’s a lack of information on the characters moves since it looks like the characters have an specific list of moves and attacks but they have much more than what you would think ( I guess it’s fun to find out by yourself ).\nAnyways, I would say this game is  epic  and that’s a word I rarely use.\n","June 26, 2015","true","73.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fast paced (without the same momentum that Sonic games have that kind of force you to keep moving), has a colorful pixel art style, a great soundtrack, and the story is exciting and packed with creative characters and a cute sense of humor. Plus, if you're not a fan of stories and just want the gameplay, you can play on classic mode. The gameplay is fun and challenging, with unique levels and boss fights, and there's a time attack mode if you are looking for an extra challenge. And each level has a lot of room for exploration, plus there are collectible cards in each level that will keep you playing over and over again.\n\nSeriously, Freedom Planet is an amazingly fun game with lots of replay value that I wish more people knew about. It is well worth the price, whether you get it on sale or decide to purchase it for the full price.","June 26, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design is brilliant for the different styles of gameplay with the various characters you can play, having each character able to tackle the level in different ways. It's a fresh feeling being able to blaze a level as Lilac and then play it again as Carol to take a slower but more action and explorative approach...Till you get the motorcycle and just rocket off having a blast. The Music is catchy and beautiful and I don't thing there was a single track I wouldn't just sit down and listen too. When I get a 1up and it plays a jingle, I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the jingle for cutting off the music cause it's so good...The same doesn't apply for the invinciblity tune, I wish that one would play forever...The last gem to me is the story, something I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. I enjoyed the character immensely as each felt unique with well fleshed out and likeable personalities...IN A PLATFORMER...Seriously back in the genesis and SNES days, what was Mario's character or personallity? Sonic had more personality, but what was his motivation. The old games were just BAM Here's the level off you go. As this game goes their motivations are done up very well as to why the villan needs to be stopped and the impact it has on the characters and the voice acting, though not the best, is rather engaging and gives it a great charm that further helps establish it's own identity.\n\nThe Bad...: The biggest draw back for most and most glaring is gonna be the lenghty cutscenes. If your not expecting it and aren't into long cutscenes it's gonna be a downer for you. They're skippable and if you want to avoid them completely you can play a classic mode to play the game just like the old Sonic and Mario games of yesteryear. Another problem is there's a bit of a difficulty curve when it comes to the later bosses. I breezed throught the first 3 levels or so without a single death but from then on bosses started unleashing heavy damaging attacks and not seeing them for the first time resulted in me unable to react fast enough and taking a ton of damage. It gets pretty bad at the end where the final boss killed me about 30 times before I finally figured out a strategy, but for oldschool gaming, higher difficulty could be a welcom challenge. Lives don't seem to be a big issue as even if you game over, you can continue pretty much where you left off...See dying to final boss 30 times. I continued 3 times and picked up right where I left off, didn't even need to fight the previous forms...So what was the point of lives? The most shocking aspect of the game was how DARK the story got at times, I mean the villan is cold blooded to the point I wonder how the hell this game is rated E...\n\nOver all I adored this game, I expected a quick little game to past by weekend off on and got a Gem I hadn't expected. I highly recommend it for any classic 90's gaming fans, sonic fans, or even just platformer fans.","July 28, 2014","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the concept of a platformer focussed around active movement and light combat, but the little things like the annoying life/ring system just killed it for me. Thankfully, Freedom Planet takes the concept of Sonic the Hedgehog and greatly improves upon it with slight adjustments and new ideas that make it a true spiritual succesor worth experiencing.\n\nGameplay: Basically what you would expect the gameplay is mostly composed of free-running, jumping and getting your hands dirty in a scrappy fight now and then. It's all easy to learn but somewhat difficult to master what with the different factors to keep in mind like the character's magic/stamina bar, the weaknesses of the enemies as well of the current surroundings. The main character: Lilac's style is best described as graceful and practical with attacks and moves that can compliment each other once you've practiced on the first level or two, and Carol is much more adept at fighting than she is running, making her motorcycle power-up all the more entertaining and special once you get one. With their own slight strengths and weaknesses, Freedom Planet is one of the few platformer games with multiple characters in which the characters are noticeably different without one being easier to use. The only complaint I have with the overall gameplay is that you don't really get informed of the character's lesser known abilities. It was longer than I'm proud to admit before I found out that Carol can wall-jump or that Lilac can do her "cyclone" while running on the ground. But even this set-back is nothing considering that learning by doing and experimenting is always greatly preferred to the alternative of annoying tutorials and the like.\n\nStory: Without wanting to spoil too much, the story starts out small with a hectic "political conundrum" and later builds up to a world-threatening catastrophe. Each character has their own personality with fair imperfections that become more noticeable as time goes on. I was surprised at how much subtle emotion was depicted from even the secondary characters who hardly had any screen time. It makes for an interesting set-up and gives just enough context to motivate you to keep moving forward in case the option to just skip the story isn't preferred. The worst things to say about the story is that if you decide to skip even one cutscene then you'll probably feel a bit lost when you get to the next one since a lot tends to happen in such little time, and also that the main characters in the story are so friendly and innocent that it's more than understandable why an older player might get turned away.\n\nAnything else: All in all, this is an amazing platformer and an incredible game. It's overflowing with pure entertainment, and I find myself coming back to it more than I ever would've ever guessed when I first made my purchase. I think if anything, my favorite thing about this game is that it has more replay value than 90% of other newly released games. There isn't any doubt in my mind that I'll still be revisiting these wonderful levels five years from now.","June 3, 2015","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'll explain.\n\nWhile level design is par for the classic sonic style this games "springs and physics dictate that speed is ether cinematic or earned with skill. There are times where the loop-de-loops and hill sides so to make way for a platforming section you could swear you've seen in the Beta for Mighty No 9. Which isn't a bad thing.

It's not. But if I had to choose between Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and going another round with this game, I'd have to say Freedom Planet would own my afternoon.\n\nAt first, I was leary of this game. The graphics didn't look all too impressive from a glance at the screenshots, and $15 seemed a little steep for me to take a risk. But for whatever reason, I did. And after playing through the first few levels, I deeply regret ever doubting the quality of this game. The levels, characters, and just EVERYTHING were all lovingly crafted by the developers, and it shows. And while the game hosts a number of obvious similarities to the blue hedgehog's glory days games, I daresay that Freedom Planet does it all far better, right down to the core mechanics of the game. Even if you didn't really enjoy any Sonic games, I'd still recommend this game, because it is something else altogether.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't care terribly for the difficulty curve. Because while the difficulty raises over time throughout the course of the game, it fluxuates wildly within the level, ranging from a gentle summer breeze to DEAR CHRIST IN HEAVEN SPARE ME THIS TRIBULATION. You also accumulate lives way too easily. If it were my decision, I would abolish lives altogether, and rather start the player off at the beginning of the current board whenever you die. But I suppose it's a little late to be going back and making such colossal redesigns as that. Also, the game has VOICE ACTING! And it's not atrocious! It's nothing amazing, but it's still good. And that's pretty damn impressive.\n\nDifficulty aside, it's a great game that I would easily recommend for any fan of the action-platformer genre.","August 14, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played all of them (Sonic 1-3), but find them too frustrating, especially when losing all those rings I painstakingly gathered for those special stages from one hit. I know it all comes down to skill in the end, but still...\n\nSo I was surprised when I bought Freedom Planet and have found myself coming back to play it over and over again.\n\nFreedom Planet is unquestionably inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog. It even started out as a fan game but evolved into its own unique experience. I saw this game through a review on YouTube and was really curious from the start, downloading the demo and later buying the full thing. I spoiled nothing save for looking at one stage not included in the demo, but that was it. Everything was a complete blank until I began playing.\n\nSo with that said, is this game worth the price tag it comes along with? Absolutely!! If you are a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, then you will most likely enjoy this game. Don't mistake it for a clone, because it is not. Freedom Planet is it's own unique game, adopting sonic mechanics such as high-speed platforming while adding combat, intense boss fights that will have your reflexes tested throughout, and unique play styles that, while subtlety different, don't change your overall experience of the game. The story is fun in my personal opinion, but plays a lot with its tone and pacing, so keep that in mind when you choose story mode. The graphics are really pretty to look at, and the music beautifully captures the atmosphere of the stage you are in.\n\nFreedom Planet is definitely a game worth picking up if you are into the 2D platformers, especially if you are a Sonic fan.\n\nAlso, motorbikes that defy physics altogether.

It's good, but not as good as the classic Sonics. The story and plot are ok; not great, but WAY better than what passes for Sonic now-a-days (and you can turn off the story if you want).\n\nSome of the levels are very clear homages to Sonic levels, with matching music. The music is so-so, not as good as Sonic 2 or 3. Turn off music in the settings and play an OC Remix Sonic album and you'll have a really good time.\n\nThe characters are all rendered and written 2D (see what I did there?) but their move-sets are all very unique and even their play-styles are a bit different, especially with the third character.\n\n5/5 Would beat another 3 times.","May 10, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've always been a huge fan of the Sonic games, and while it would be accurate to say that this is inspired in some ways by classic Sonic (Sonic CD, to be more specific), it is SO much more than that, and it is a disservice to this game to say that it is a Sonic clone or knock-off.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is an amazing platformer with an enormous, beautifully realized world. The sprite work is the best and most detailed of any game I've seen, and there is a ridiculous amount of enemy variety. The physics of the game are pretty good, though I'm not a fan of the super-generous wall walking. You don't really need any speed at all to climb any slope, including going upside down.\n\nThe game is also hard as nails in spots, and while it doesn't always feel fair, you will never have to redo a full stage because a boss used up all your lives. Hell, even the final boss fight is generous enough that if you get a game over during the fight you start over at the beginning of the phase you were just on.\n\nThe voice acting is a bit spotty, which should come as no surprise, since this is the first role of most of the cast. The writing can be a bit campy, but it's never so bad that it becomes unbearable.\n\nAlso, there's a ton of replay value. Time Trial mode, classic mode (no cutscenes, just action), hundreds of collectible pieces of art and music, and three playable characters all with drastically different play styles.\n\nIf you're only interested in the classic mode, or plan to skip through the cutscenes, it can be a little short... might want to wait for a sale. If you're looking for a fun game with a cute story that isn't afraid of getting dark, then you can't go wrong with Freedom Planet.","June 3, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The admittedly simple controls, and quick-play action with the low quality almost classic Genesis type graphics allows for nice easy play style with little to no lag on any computer.

It is said to be a combination of Sonic, Rocket Knight, Ristar and Gunstar Heroes (none of which I've actually played, to be honest).\n\nBeing a Sonic fangame in the very beginning, Freedom Planet obviously resembles it the most, but mind you, this is not some kind of knock off. Its mechanics mix the elements of speed, combat and exploration in such a way, that you are free to be a runner, fighter or explorer and change your style at your heart's desire.\n\nIn the core mechanics we have a traditional health system, an actual combat system with a variety of moves and some very forgiving physics that does not aim to hinder your progress, so that you are able to climb any wall as long as your speed is not below walking. Sometimes physics behave really weird to the point that you might think that it is glitching (I'm looking at you, girder see-saw!), but such occurences are very rare and do not lead to anything harmful.\n\nThe level design offers wide stages, often with multiple paths, and without areas that force you to halt your movement for long. Almost every stage introduces some new element that adds enough diversity to make it feel fresh but not totally different. Graphics is colorful and very well made.\nIt is very worth noting, that the game has no such "pleasant" things as random bottomoless pits and wide rows of instakill spikes. Seeing an instakill contraption occurs as often as holidays, and the rare presence of pits is absolutely justified, plus the latter can be easily avoided if you apply just a little common sense and careness. So death here never feels cheap.\n\nAnother thing deserving mentioning is the lack of yet another traditional staple of running and platforming games - the contact damage. Enemies need to actively attack you to harm you (unless they are covered with spikes or fire). The resulting effect greatly helps the flow, no need to fear that you'll stop dead after colliding with some baddie - they won't stop your running.\n\nMovement and combat feel very fluid and responsive, platforming does not induces frustration, and the boss fights - with lots of shapes and sizes, Treasure style - are sure to make your heart beating. Currently there are 3 charming playable characters (with 2 more coming at the end of summer with a free DLC), and all of them are so different, that the only thing they have in common is physics. But you'll have to find out their controls on your own, so if you feel like your character is missing something (How do I Wild Claw?) don't be ashamed to look in one of the guides.\n\nSo, the game also has a story and full voice acting. Story mode tells the plot mostly through cutscenes between levels. I don't mind these, but for a lot of people they might break the pace (the longest cutscene racks up to 12 minutes). Naturally, not everyone will like these. If you are going for it, then I'd suggest you to relax and follow it like a cartoon of some sorts. Keep in mind, that with these cheesy dialogs and cute and pretty looks, the story is not all sunshine and bunnies, you might be surprised how fast things can get a downer turn. And I'm very pleased to see a dangerous villain that does not f**k around for once. Also, the narrative is mostly focused on your selected character, so you'll miss some plot points on your first playthrough.\n\nVoice acting is fairly competent, considering that a sizeable part of the cast are either amateurs or do VA as a hobby. I find the voices mostly fitting, not inducing cringe or annoyance. To each their own though. If you do not want to see any dialogue or story stuff, there is a Classic mode, that skips it altogether. The sounds feel just right, and the music perfectly fits this kind of genre.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the extra little things, that are not necessary, even excessive, but present. From collectibles, to some level elements that you suprisingly can interact with, to the unique animations for hidden blooper dialogs! These all show how developers love their game.\n\nIf you feel interested after reading this, then you can check the demo available on the dev's site here[galaxytrail.com] (some sprites and sound are obsolete and old bugs may be present).\n\nOverall, Freedom Planet feels like a hidden gem, sadly unnoticed or dismissed for various reasons. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it and give it all of my "YES!". And if you are looking for a fun high-speed platforming game (or even if you are missing those early days of Sonic), then have a look at this game - it NEEDS your attention.","June 5, 2015","true","153.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is this a fair justification?  Yes, and only if you're willing to admit that there are people who make better Sonic games than Sega.  There are two ways to play Freedom Planet.  Story mode, complete with cutscenes, fantastic voice acting, and of course the gameplay, and arcade mode which plays like any 2D Adventure game from the Sega Genesis days.  So just what makes this game so damn fun?\n\nFirst of all, it controls well.  If you're going to have characters platform and do it quickly, they need to be able to control well.  The only thing to say about this is.....NAILED IT.  Yup, the multiple(did I mention that yet?) characters each control very well and navigate through the levels very well.  Taking a nod back to the classic sonic games, each character has their own quirk if you will that will allow them to traverse the level differently, which can lead to different encounters, and more importantly different gameplay mechanics leading to a ridiculously high replay value. Furthermore, the game switches nicely between speed segments, platforming, lite puzzle solving, and combat to keep you interested the whole time.  On top of all this cake, we have the icing, which is very well done boss battles.\n\nI am giving this game a lot of praise because I haven't had this much fun with a 2D platformer like this since Sonic 3 & Knuckles.  So, it's been a while.  I love this game and want nothing more than to share with you one of the finest creations this decade.  Freedom Planet gets nothng less than a perfect score.\n\n10+/10                 Replay Value: Obnoxiously High","June 7, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At least for me, this games art style, story, enjoyable characters all with good voice acting, combat done well, enemy variety, story, music, atmosphere, setting, humor, and overall emotional investment the adventure mode allows the player to have with the characters all come together to make a very fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThere is some cheesiness in some of the dialogue and story, but in a funny, well placed way. Beyond that, I feel like some of the different moves that can be pulled off can be a little awkward, but it depends on the control setup I suppose. All controls are easily rebindable, as is joystick sensitivity, so I might need to tweak that more, as some of the mild floatiness and jumping precision were probbly on my end, as everything else felt very tight.\n\nOne of the most fun aspects of the game for me was how much the overall style of presentation encourages a very "go get 'em" attitude. The characters can take quite a number of hits before dying, and coupled with the kinds of scenarios that the characters encounter, often the best way to approach a situation is to just dive in and tackle it head on. One of the main themes in this game is the idea of believing in ones self, and not only is this conveyed through the story, but also in the very nature of the gameplay. Many times the character will be dropped into a situation with many enemies closing in on them in a very impromptu way, and though it might seem like a bad situation, if the player believes they can come out of it, and make use of the skills they have, they generally will. It was a very good use of theming through gameplay, and gives the the player a much more meaningful connection to the story in the adventure mode and the characters.\n\nThe main story isn't that long, but it's well suited for multiple playtroughs, and with different characters to pick from. There are also time attack and training levels to hone one's skills. A single playtrhough can be done in one sitting, especially if the 'classic' mode is chosen without the story. And with that, the adventure mode is just long enough to say what it needs to without overstaying it's welcome.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a great game, especially for it's price. I can easily see myself coming back to this game over and over when I feel like a good action platformer, especially since most of the levels can be played as a fast paced speed clear, or a more elaborate maze. It's a great value, and one that I would recommend highly to anyone that like action, adventure, and/or 2D platformer games.","June 9, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed them, then I highly recommend this game! While it is obviously inspired by Sonic, it still plays differently enough to have its own identity. There are three different characters that all play differently. All females, and the main character Lilac really looks like a character that could be from Sonic series. She totally looks like a hedgehog (well, as much as Sonic does), apparently it says she's a dragon.\n\nThere is a story mode with full voice acting, something I did not expect from a game that uses 16-bit art style, so that's pretty nice. I have to give my respect for the developers and voice actors, for actually making a quite lenghty cutscenes for a retro platformer. For those who don't care about the story there is Classic Mode, which removes all story and cutscenes.\n\nBut the main thing is that the gameplay is good and fun. Pixel graphics are well done and the music is nice too. Stages are mostly good, but it kinda makes me wish there would be even more possibilites for going fast. Boss fights are mostly good too.\n\nOne thing that I this game shouldn't have is lives. Shovel Knight was another retro style platformer, and it understood that lives are an outdated system.\n\nThe worst part? The lives are totally meaningless! You still start from the checkpoint when you get a game over. During the stages you collect a huge amount of little blue crystals and I think every time you get 200, you get a life. You think that collecting them is rewarding now?\n\n"Collect enough of these little items and you get an extra life" is a classic system that almost every mascot platformer had back in the days, but it's one thing that never was rewarding for me in the first place.\n\nOkay, I'm getting a little off track here. The bottom line is that it's a well made retro platformer, and all platformer fans should try it.","June 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that isnt a bad thuing. The Early sonic games were brilliant, and im my oppinion should have stayed 2D, but thats a whole different discusion. This Game however brings back that enjoyment i used to get, and more so. The game play is slower than a sonic game, but thankfully doesnt do any cheap tricks like sticking spikes at the end of holding right for 5 minutes. This game is also has a lot more platforming, so you arent alwasy running one direction.\n\n2. The music and visuals are lovely. You can see where the inspiration for the characters comes from, but thats okay, beacasue they are there own charcters, not straight up genderbent clones. As you prgress through the game you find cards that unlock the stages music, so you can enjoy that sweet Relic Runes 2 music to your hearts content, Or you can even get the soundtrqack, surely that shows its a commendable factor. The voice acting is suprisingly good too, a pleasent suprise as i wasnt expecting any.\n\nC. The game play is solid, with minimal controls. This doesnt stop each character feling different however. I would recommend a controller if possible, but really isnt necessary, As previsouly mentioned it is slower then sonic games, which i think is a good thing. The only downside to this is that you can basically stick to walls, walking verticle at a casual stroll pace. This seems jenky at first, but if you can accept it, then its all good in da hood.\n\nI would reccomend this game. At full price. But as steam sales are a thing apprently, not sure if you guys know about them, When this goes on sale i would say its a definate purchase. I would be very very suprised if you didnt get your moneys worth and more in enjoyment from this brilliant title. I look forward to possibly more in the series.","March 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At two years old it was the first game i remember playing, and it's always firmly been my favourite series of games. I will forever praise it as being a technological marvel  with top notch gameplay that holds up to this very day. Nothing will ever replace that 70% of my heart that is owned by Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Nothing. But even after all this -\n\nFreedom Planet is better. And it sure as hell ain't a Sonic clone.\n\nIt's an absolute gem of a game that needs far more recognition than it currently has. The story, characters, visuals and music are all very reminiscent of a saturday morning cartoon. It's the first thing that sprang to mind with it's cheesy dialogue, narrator and it's typical bad guy trying to take over the universe storyline. You just need to watch the trailer to understand what i'm taking about, it's dripping with the stuff you most likely loved as a kid. I've heard people complain that the dialogue is awful but i don't think they quite understand the design choice here. The story plays a far larger part of the game here than in most 2D platformers. There are cutscenes and even dialogue during some levels, and it's all really fantastic to watch IMO, but if that's not your thing and you want to get straight into the action you can play on Classic mode, which removes all cutscenes and leaves you with a typical 2D platformer level after level progression.\n\nThe soundtrack is the best i've heard since Shovel Knight, it fits perectly with the world and the games pace. I would recommend searching 'Fortune Night Act 2' on Youtube (my personal favourite, because guitars). It doesn't loop for some reason in the game though, which is kinda weird.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=LkggMLlR2RU\n\nThe visuals in the game are fanastic, incredibly detailed pixel art. The world is beautifully designed and every area feels very different from the last. It keeps you interested throughout and doesn't feel stale. You won't always be playing the same levels though. There are three different story routes you can take, one for each character, and some of the levels are unique to certain characters, which brings me on to the most important part; THE GAMEPLAY.\n\nAs i mentioned there are multiple characters you can play as, and they all play rather differently. You've got the love child of Sonic and Rocketknight, 'Lilac the Dragon', who will probably be most peoples favourite. Her gameplay is more focused on speed, using a Rocketknight style boost mechanic to allow nice fluid action. You've got 'Carol the Wildcat' who can climb on walls and ride a motorbike. The motor bike allows her to rival Lilacs speed but is only available as a pickup. And finally there's 'Milla the...ummm, psychic dog?'. Not quite sure,of that one. She has the slowest gameplay and her levels are more about puzzle solving. I've not played much of her story yet so i can't fully comment. All characters have fast and intense gameplay, just some more than others. Combat is incredibly fun as well, you dont' jump on enemies heads, you have a number of attacks unique to each character. Lilac can boost into enemies, spin around in a flurry or perform punch and kick combos. Carol is more focus on her punch and kick combos being a martial artist, and can also use her motorbike to flatten enemies. Milla can shoot blasts of psychic energy at her foes making her gameplay more Megaman-esque. There is a lot of replayability here when it comes to trying different characters. The bosses are also incredibly tough to beat, even once you've figured out their patterns. They are very well designed, fast paced and so challenging that beating them feels like such an achievement. They will kill you a lot but it never feels cheap, there is always a pattern to learn.\n\nSo i've praised this game to the high heavens, but it of course has its flaws, which mainly come in the category of level design and physics. You see, these levels are huge. So incredibly big that you can imagine a lot of the art assets are reused over and over, so a lot of the time it's very difficult to know exactly where you are in a level, even after playing it numerous times. Now this wouldn't be a problem at all, it's great that every time you play it you could find a different route that you don't recognise, but they've done something that just doesn't work harmoniously with this mish-mashy level design, and that's collectible hunting. Now this in no way ruins the game itself, it's completely optional and mainly for the achievement i reckon, but that's another thing that makes it a bit flimsy, "it's mainly for an achievement". The player has to find 10 hidden cards throughout each level and as you can imagine when there are huge levels with kinda similar looking areas this is going to be no easy feat. It's a minor gripe though since it's completely optional. As for the physics, they're a little bit broken, but not in any way that will ruin your game experience. Example being if you jump upwards towards a sloped ceiling you'll automatically start running on it, which is kinda weird. Also in a similar fashion to Sonic 4 you can just walk up vertical walls and don't have to be going at full speed. I also find it far too easy to lose momentum. It doesn't take long running up a vertical slope before you start lightly jogging, no matter how fast you approach it. Also on the subject of momentum, hitting a wall spring that sends you in the opposite direction feels like more of a hindrance than anything. This is because after hitting a spring there is no window where control is taken from you by the game. If you don't immediately push the analog stick to run in the opposite direction then you'll come to a grinding halt. It really is a pain that could be easily sorted by not allowing player input to affect the character after hitting a spring, even just for a seond so the player has time to get to grips with the changed direction. Finally the lives system is utterly useless and i don't understand why it's there. As far as i can see if you lose all your lives you aren't penalised in any way, you're not even thrown back to the start of the level, you still start at the last checkpoint. This also renders a lot of other things useless, like the incentive to actually get lives and the need to win them in the bonus rounds. It's an incredibly weird design choice, but again doesn't ruin the overall experience.\n\nOther than those three things there's nothing really bad i can say about this game. I would say it's exactly what i needed to play amidst the flood of goat simulation, bread simulation, breathing simulation, simulation simulation and Amnesia clones that are being mass produced in the PewDieBait factory. A lot of love has been put into this game, similarly to Shovel Knight, and it really is the most essential ingredient in game design from my perspective. You can tell that making money is secondary to the devs. It's a game that's completely from the heart, made with 70% heart i'd say, and it's that 70% that makes these games turn out so wonderfully.\n\nTHANK YOU, GALAXYTRAIL!","January 5, 2015","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bookieman/recommended/248310/","bookieman","Bookie Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bookieman/","153 products in account","Ill get it out of the way, this game is very “Sonic” In character design and level design. That’s where the similarities end though, Freedom Planet is a very different beast and really deserves to be judged on its own merits. Freedom Planet is more a action game then a speedy platformer. Sure there are parts where you will be booking it through loop-de-loops but it blends combat in with it seamlessly and the levels lend themselves well to it. See most enemies don’t hurt you on contact, so you have two options. Blaze through the level and hit the occasional enemy on the way or stick around and fight it out. Both options are fine and both have there rewards and the game gives you everything you need to do it.\n\nFrom the offset the game has three characters to play and all of them play drastically different. There’s Lilac who is more well rounded and great for first time players, Carol who can really kick ♥♥♥ with skillful play and Milla who is meant to be played slowly and more carefully and is really built for exploring the levels and finding shiny things. All of these characters are viable in all the different levels and they even each have there own levels unique to them. Each character is like playing a different game and most of the levels are balanced so every character has there own way of getting around them. There are even areas that only certain characters can access. It can be very difficult to build levels with multiple characters in mind and they have done a great job of it.\n\nI will say some of the bosses can take a while to really get a bead on however the game pretty much lets you try again as much as you want until you finally get it right and that moment when you do can really be satisfying. The game does use a lives system but with how the continues work its really just kind of window dressing which is a bit of a oversight but it didn’t bother me too much. Though that makes going for the games main collectible Crystals kind of moot since all it really does is give you lives unless you care about high scores or bragging rights. I do really wish they could have reworked it cause the idea of doing away with lives period wouldn’t hurt me in the slightest. The reason I stuck with it til the end was because I DIDN’T have to start a level over, I actually had a chance to learn instead of drop the game out of frustration. Lives are a product of the times, when the games were all about eating quarters. I feel like lives are a outdated relic of the past and its just not good game design anymore, hardcore gamers be damned, but really its just a small nitpick on a otherwise great game.\n\nI do want to end on a positive note though. I’m proud this game opted to have not one, not two but THREE female protagonists who are fun and interesting. I will say that while the story itself is pretty good its not super spectacular, But I do like how you get different pieces of the story depending on who you play and it does add good replay value. The characters are what really saved it for me. The writing is fun and the voice acting is also well done for having a lot of unknown actors. Having three female protagonists is really a breath of fresh air in a game industry ruled by scruffy white guys.\n\nI highly recommend Freedom Planet especially if you’ve been craving a Sonic styled platformer like the good old days that feels like a long lost Saturn game. They plan on adding more content for free later including 2 new characters with there own parts of the story to play which frankly im very excited for. Give this game a look.","July 30, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of those games that are better on the second run lel. So this is a 2d platformer heavily inspired by alot of classic 90's games. If youre good, the game play will be fast and fun. It borrows alot of level design that make the old sonic games great and improve some that dont, but they built the game so it doesnt play just like a sonic game. If you are at all interested in this game, i recommend playing carol first. However, the story is outright worthless due to a meh plot and meh voice acting. But thats okay, just choose classic mode, dont feel bad about missing out on the story theres not much to grieve about. The art style has well done pixel art with incredible detail all while the amazing level design makes the game a joy to play.\n\nIf i had to complain about the gameplay, there are some moments where you are just waiting for your special bar to fill and it breaks the flow (especially with lilac, play carol first. Lilac is fun, but only once you get used to things because its not a sonic game). I also think levels were too long for my tastes, levels go on for about 10 minutes on your first time through but not once you get good. I think theres an unbalance in difficulty: levels are easy and straight forward, but the bosses are tough. once you figure out the attack patterns theyre not impossible but you will lose plenty of lives just trying to figure them out (but theres no punishment for death at all so atleast they dont make you rage quit).\n\nIts a fun game that kinda grew on me because its better the second time you play it IMO.

A must-buy if you're old enough to have fond Sonic memories.\n\nThe three playable characters also play radically differently - Lilac has a Sparkster-style charge attack that lets her cover big distances of open space quickly and a double jump that doubles as a slow descent AND an attack, her cat sidekick can climb walls indefinitely and has a strong attack that's easy to aim, making her the most conventional character and the easiest to get into altough she can't enter all alternate routes. Finally, Milla the rabbit can conjure blocks, reflect enemy attacks and fly, but has half the health of the other two girls, making her an advanced character that is really tricky to master but potentially the best to speedrun with.\n\nI'm just at the 3rd stage so far, but I can recommend this game considerably - it might just be as good as Shovel Knight if it keeps this up!","November 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At least for me, this games art style, story, enjoyable characters all with good voice acting, combat done well, enemy variety, story, music, atmosphere, setting, humor, and overall emotional investment the adventure mode allows the player to have with the characters all come together to make a very fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThere is some cheesiness in some of the dialogue and story, but in a funny, well placed way. Beyond that, I feel like some of the different moves that can be pulled off can be a little awkward, but it depends on the control setup I suppose. All controls are easily rebindable, as is joystick sensitivity, so I might need to tweak that more, as some of the mild floatiness and jumping precision were probbly on my end, as everything else felt very tight.\n\nOne of the most fun aspects of the game for me was how much the overall style of presentation encourages a very "go get 'em" attitude. The characters can take quite a number of hits before dying, and coupled with the kinds of scenarios that the characters encounter, often the best way to approach a situation is to just dive in and tackle it head on. One of the main themes in this game is the idea of believing in ones self, and not only is this conveyed through the story, but also in the very nature of the gameplay. Many times the character will be dropped into a situation with many enemies closing in on them in a very impromptu way, and though it might seem like a bad situation, if the player believes they can come out of it, and make use of the skills they have, they generally will. It was a very good use of theming through gameplay, and gives the the player a much more meaningful connection to the story in the adventure mode and the characters.\n\nThe main story isn't that long, but it's well suited for multiple playtroughs, and with different characters to pick from. There are also time attack and training levels to hone one's skills. A single playtrhough can be done in one sitting, especially if the 'classic' mode is chosen without the story. And with that, the adventure mode is just long enough to say what it needs to without overstaying it's welcome.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a great game, especially for it's price. I can easily see myself coming back to this game over and over when I feel like a good action platformer, especially since most of the levels can be played as a fast paced speed clear, or a more elaborate maze. It's a great value, and one that I would recommend highly to anyone that like action, adventure, and/or 2D platformer games.","June 9, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fast and furious platforming with great boss sections. The voice acting is significantly better that what you get in a Sonic game, which is helarous considering the budget difference. The cut scenes are rather long and numerous, but also quite a bit of fun. The plot is a bit confusing and sometimes makes me wonder if I'm expected to have see some movie beforehand.\n\nOverall though, the gameplay is very tight and has some interesting and inventive platforming ideas. Is it like a Sonic game? Only in so much as they're both sidescolling platformers centered around speed, this game has evolved past being a simple clone and is much better for it. And as icing on the cake the animation of the sprites is very endearing.","June 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get on! There's no time to explain!" It then wisks you off to an alternate timeline where Gunstar Heroes, Ristar, and Sonic the Hedgehog were the top charting games of all time and the Sega Saturn somehow beat the Playstation and N64. This is the game that introduces you to that timeline. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this right now.\n\nPeople with No Context for that:\nNow that I'm done fanboying out, I'll tell you that if you played any of the Sonic games or any of the Mega Man games then Freedom Planet will feel familiar, but it's really its own thing. General controls and combat feel like a Mega Man game, but there's Sonic influences in that each level tends to have more than one path and there's a bit of emphasis on momentum, albeit not as much as in the actual Sonic games. There's a lot more margin of error, you have a health bar, and it isn't difficult to stop or change direction. You won't feel like you're controlling a pinball with legs so much as a very fast version of Mega Man who can cling to walls and run on ceilings.\n\nIn terms of production values, the game is influenced clearly from the best aspects of all of the above games, which all represent the finest platformers in the Sega Genesis catalogue. I mention the 32X because the presentation is a cut above those games, more in line with the 32-bit era of gaming than the 16-bit era, with more detail, more story, more color, voice acting, and a great soundtrack that goes beyond the indie chiptune status quo that you would expect from something like this.\n\nGameplay is a cut above the status quo as well. There's three playable characters with unique movesets and ways of navigating the environment. Each one is challenging and fun for different reasons and you'll have a blast taking apart enemies with their different blends of attacks. There are crazy-fun setpieces and tons of crazy-fun bosses galore. Every stage introduces unique enemies and obstacles, with very little being recycled between levels up until the end. Even then there's still new things being introduced as late as the last level. Everything sparkles, and EVERYTHING EXPLODES in the most satisfying way imaginable.\n\nI will say it isn't without its rough edges. The physics are a bit odd, sometimes it feels like the characters are approaching top speed without ever reaching it, and the threshold for being able to cling to a wall with your speed seems a bit low -- which makes momentum-based obstacles easy to overcome, but they do feel a bit weird. There's some places where you can tell the designers were still "feeling out" what's fun and what's a fair challenge, particularly with some boss and enemy designs. Something you need to get through your head in later levels is that you don't really get points for killing most enemies, so a lot of them are better left ignored or treated as stage obstacles rather than opponents.\n\nThese aren't really "bugs" or marks against the game's fun factor so much as what you'd expect from "first iteration" growing pains from a polished, finished, new product. It's comparable to what Ratchet and Clank 1 was like before its sequels refined its formula, and I'll be excited to see how Galaxy Trail improves on this base. Relative to the platforming world the experience stays fresh and satisfying for a good, long time, and relative to indie platformers this showcases by FAR a higher level of polish, effort, and variety than I'm used to seeing. There are established companies that don't make platformers this good.\n\nI rate this at four weird, alien animal mascot characters out of five.","June 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But here comes a game that reminds us that 8Bit are 8 to less! Pumped 16bit Genesis Action at its best!.\n\nThis game is highly Inspired by Genesis Classics like Sonic the Hedgehog, Rocket Night AKA Sparkster and much more (Which I haven't played so far but did you even play those two games? Those are Amazing!). I really love the giant Explosions which only are topped by Atari 2600 Explosions! I really love how the frame rate drops whenever you finish a boss! This Is Intentionally! It is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome because the same Happens with the Genesis AKA MegaDrive when you reach that point of explosion madness! Except you have an overclocked version maybe.\nI recommend to turn this game on hard, never tried easy because as you expect it is on hard like Sparkster on Easy or maybe Medium! Which I find okay but after all the Original 16bit Era wasn't crazy difficult like the 8Bit, it was fun, challenging but not sadistic fun!. Another Improvement is the level Length which is just insane, remember the small stages at Rocket Knight Adventures? Or Maybe at Sonic the Hedgehog, well Sonic 2 hat some big Levels but those are huge and multiply that by several parts for each stage. This is madness! This is Awesome!\n\nOne thing I have to say, this is the ♥♥♥♥ing strangest Character design I've ever seen! But they just look like that is what they would have done at Team Sonic only by adding a bit more cocain!. But at least they are three girls, I love girls, I love girls who are kicking ♥♥♥♥ and those just kick ♥♥♥♥ allot!.\n\nBuy this game, and enjoy if you ever had a Genesis this is a must have I only wish it was also available on the Genesis, maybe some crazy person will port it to like the sega cd.^^\n\nAnd Remember:\n\nGENESIS DOES WHAT NINTENDON'T!!!","June 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over all, I think it's nice and a good buy.\n\nThe characters are fully voiced which is new to me in games like this, but I will say sometimes they don't sound like they're fully reaching the kind of emotion they are trying to convey but it's still pretty good voice acting in my opinion.\n\nI'm not one for graphics but this game looks like it tried to emulate Sonic's early days on the Dreamcast and Megadrive (I later heard that this was origonally a Sonic Fan Game so it's no wonder) and it does a fairly good job of doing that.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like a Sonic Game from the "Classic Era" especially when one plays as Lilac. As a result I keep trying to spindash when playing. However Lilac's ability that lets her bounce off the walls at high speeds is kind of hard to get a good sense on where you're going to go or even which direction you'll go as sometimes it seems like it doesn't matter.\n\nThe levels take me a fairly long time to beat but that's not nessicarily a bad thing, there's a fair amount of collectables I could go after if I so choosed and it's fairly liberal with it's checkpoints. Though I do wish there was a visual/audio cue letting me know that I hit a checkpoint, so that I don't have to worry about losing a signifigant amount of progress.\n\nThe boss battles are  immensely  fun. They are fast paced, straight forward, and give good visual cues when the boss is on it's last leg. However they are a tad unforgiving at times, the boss for Fortune Night has you dodging all many of lasers and explosives causing you to sometimes miss much needed health thrown to you by your allies. That being said I still enjoyed the battles greatly.\n\nThe music in the game is GREAT, I bought the soundtrack with this game and I'm glad I did. Each one is fitting for the area and tone of the level. As well as the boss music pumping you up for the battle at hand.\n\nTL;DR  Freedom Planet is a overall fun game that might seem rough around the edges in some areas but is a good buy during a sale.","June 17, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, difficulty curve ramps up steadily from a sleepwalk to a brutal gauntlet. Take breaks or you'll get blisters.\n\nSurprisingly good voice acting. The writing is neither particularly strong nor particularly bad, but the voice acting is never the weak link.\n\nThere are three characters. Thus far I have played as two.

The gameplay reminds me a bit of Sonic, a little of Cave Story, but it's mostly unique(or then I don't have very extenive experience with platformers). Gameplay, music, graphics, story, everything is there to put this up among my favourite 2D platformers. Bonus points for very good technical execution: runs perfectly on Linux, and supports game controllers entirely without problems.\n\nThere are a couple of little things that leave this just behind perfect. The voice acting is slightly inconsistent(it sounds like they were recorded in different studios or something, which makes it sound just slightly odd). The music volume is set too loud by default, it's hard to hear the talking. Setting it to about 80-90% is the best IMO. The controls feel kind of aggressive and floaty, but no big deal.\n\nIf you're unsure, just watch the video in the store and go from there. It's very representative.","June 18, 2015","true","81.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over all, I think it's nice and a good buy.\n\nThe characters are fully voiced which is new to me in games like this, but I will say sometimes they don't sound like they're fully reaching the kind of emotion they are trying to convey but it's still pretty good voice acting in my opinion.\n\nI'm not one for graphics but this game looks like it tried to emulate Sonic's early days on the Dreamcast and Megadrive (I later heard that this was origonally a Sonic Fan Game so it's no wonder) and it does a fairly good job of doing that.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like a Sonic Game from the "Classic Era" especially when one plays as Lilac. As a result I keep trying to spindash when playing. However Lilac's ability that lets her bounce off the walls at high speeds is kind of hard to get a good sense on where you're going to go or even which direction you'll go as sometimes it seems like it doesn't matter.\n\nThe levels take me a fairly long time to beat but that's not nessicarily a bad thing, there's a fair amount of collectables I could go after if I so choosed and it's fairly liberal with it's checkpoints. Though I do wish there was a visual/audio cue letting me know that I hit a checkpoint, so that I don't have to worry about losing a signifigant amount of progress.\n\nThe boss battles are  immensely  fun. They are fast paced, straight forward, and give good visual cues when the boss is on it's last leg. However they are a tad unforgiving at times, the boss for Fortune Night has you dodging all many of lasers and explosives causing you to sometimes miss much needed health thrown to you by your allies. That being said I still enjoyed the battles greatly.\n\nThe music in the game is GREAT, I bought the soundtrack with this game and I'm glad I did. Each one is fitting for the area and tone of the level. As well as the boss music pumping you up for the battle at hand.\n\nTL;DR  Freedom Planet is a overall fun game that might seem rough around the edges in some areas but is a good buy during a sale.","June 17, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went into this expecting a Simple Sonic Clone, but it was on a good Steam Sale and the reviews looked promising so I figured, why not?  What I wasn't expecting was the fresh, original story, very balanced mechanics and tight gameplay that danced that line between challenging enough to feel something was at stake and loose enough to be fun as hell.\n\nIf you allow yourself to be immersed in the lore they make a little, you'll suddenly find even slaying a lowly baddie feels significant somehow, like it has meaning.  Nothing ever feels just "slapped in".   Unlike Sonic, that would have "Lava level becuase lets do one of those."  There's a lava themed level tied directly to an alien Foundry that you infiltrate, that was alluded to for its significance to the antagonists and had a reason to exisit beyond "Here is a Laval Level!".\n\nIt is obvious this story was lovingly tended to.  Even secondary characters had moments of significance that surprised me, or that spurned the tropey direction I had assumed they would go in the best way.  I knew they'd done something special when, even after the victory fist in the air at the end of the game I was going "But what about <redacted> character??  What happened to him?  What's the deal with this Council,  are there other people like Lialac who can literally tear apart sophisticated alien super-tech with their magic energy hair?"  I was both befuddled and hungry for more.\n\nYes it's a fantastical world, yes it leans very hard on some of the good staples of your old Sonic games, but in my opinion, it greatly improves on them too.  Not only is it its own world, but there are subtle moments where I went "I WISH Sonic games had done this!", such as the quasi-health bar instead of "lose all your rings, then die if hit again" flow-breaking mechanic of the Sonic Games.  Or the fact that, while Lilac can get up to speed, its never to seizure inducing, too fast and hard to follow motion, the pace can feel fast and light but, unlike even the best of Sonic games, at top speeds I can still keep track of ♥♥♥♥!\n\nThis is an indie game doing everything right, and had I payed the full 14 dollars for it, I still would have gotten my money's worth.  However, if you DO see this on sale, grab the soundtrack too, its bloody fantastic and it makes excellent workout/study music!  Nice added bonus there.\n\nIn conclusion:  Better than all your expectations, don't expect this to rest on the laurels of Sonic or just be a "Sonic Clone".  It's not,  its an excellent game fully deserving of its own clout and absolutely worth your time and money if you liked any of those old side-scroller style games.

I've always been attached to the platformer genre and this is one of my new favorites. I won't talk anything story or plot since you can find that in the game details, but I will talk about the good. Mechanically, it works, and it's solid, and that's a lot more than what games on steam have nowadays. This next opinion is disagreeable, but I found the VA and story to be extremely enticing, with Milla being one of my favorite all time characters. Most of the characters are actually rather memorable, with Brevon being presented as one of the best villains I've seen in a long time, almost Vaas or Handsome Jack levels. Believe me, by the end of the story mode, he's done more things to you and your friends to make the game take a seriously dark turn. And I loved every second of it. If you wish, you can play the stages sonic-style (classic mode), with just the levels and very minimal cutscene stuffs. Though I don't recommend classic, as you'll be missing the story.\n\nAlthough I make this game sound like a perfect game (no game is however), it does have it's flaws, as with most games. Some VA was superb and very well done, Brevon for example. On the other hand, some is... not great. Nothing dealbreaking though. There are few bugs thankfully, no serious fatal bugs that I've experienced. Slightly strange physics, there is a lack of momentum when running up walls, you can do it from almost a dead stop. I didn't really care all that much though.\n\nDo I recommend it? I do. I got it during the summer sale, but I've dropped enough time to say I would have payed full price for it. I also recommend the sound track. It was fantastic, absolutely amazing. Buying the game for it alone might be worth it.\n\nLate P.S.: Last I saw on the steam guides, there is an in-game mod to remove the voices from the cutscenes in the story mode. Huge plus for those that want the story but not the VA. Isn't it awesome to have options? Lastly, Devs are giving free content in the future. Supposed to drop sometime around the end of this summer.","July 18, 2015","true","71.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like the original Sonic games, it's a platformer that rewards high speed as well as precision.  Unlike Sonic, the characters in Freedom Planet have a reserve of life to absorb a little punishment, and special attacks beyond simply new ways to jump onto or roll into enemies (in fact, simply attempting to hop on an enemy's head won't generally hurt it).   The difficulty of the stages is very nice and ramps up over a nice curve, and while some of the bosses are fantastically brutal, they're mostly the ones towards the end of the game.  The game's pretty generous with unmarked checkpoints, too, and as far as I can tell you have unlimited continues.\n\nIt's not the world's longest game, but then neither was Sonic 2, and Freedom Planet features multiple characters and play modes to add in a little extra value.  What's more, there's actually quite a bit of story, and all of it is fully voice acted, and pretty well voice acted at that.  There's a ton of love and effort that went into this game, and it really shows with how they tell the story (which is, itself, is rather stylized but very good at being what it wants to be and in my opinion wholly enjoyable).","July 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well this game is a new spin on the classic genere. This linear game will put you on edge as you play thought the story. Much of what is enjoyable about this game is the very differences the two main charcters play as. One more of a magic girl sonic, the other like a mix of Megaman X's wall climb and Knuckles's dash. Highly enjoyable, very well constucted, little reuse of assests, great ramp in difficulty, and decently replayable.\nThe one down side is definatly the voice acting, but it is to be expected from the size and scope of the game.","June 20, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
