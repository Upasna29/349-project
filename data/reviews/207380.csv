To me, it's a combination of my old favorite vertical scrolling games like Touhou, Raiden, and Gradius (I know this ain't exactly vertical scrolling).  On the hardest mode ever, it is still pretty punishing for me, but there is a storyline as you fight through levels and I know I will be playing this game a lot when I have the time to.  If you are into the three games I mentioned above, this game is worth a try.\n\nBad parts of the game? Of course...\n-This game runs 30 fps but is intended to run 60! Running the game at 30 fps makes all the bullets move slowly... There are fixes to fix this issue permanently.  Players will have to find a fix and apply it to the game so the game runs with bullets as intended.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.

No longer do you have a choice to choose from three characters but instead you only play as one girl named Ria. Luckily Ria is a far better character to play as than any of the three prior ones. She is has an interesting power that completely changes the way the game is played as she can use both evil and holy magic. What that means is that if an enemy is firing red (evil) or blue (holy) projectiles at you, you can change to that color and absorb that projectile to charge up your ultimate attack. It is a very interesting mechanic that rewards risk as you will cause double damage to an enemy if your magic color is different than theirs so you can either play it safe and absorb their magic or change magic type for far more damage output but have the risk of getting hit.\n\nYou also have a special attack that destroys all projectiles of the different color that can harm you and releases a beam that causes heavy damage. Very useful to get out of a tight spot as it is far worse to lose a life than to use up your special attack. This game is far from easy though. You will constantly be attacked by both types of at the same time so learning when to switch your magic is key. Even if you are doing very well Exceed 2nd will take that as a challenge as it has a rather nice ranking feature. What that does is if you are doing too well, you will gain a rank which will raise the difficultly level higher and higher the better you are doing. Losing a life instantly loses you a rank so it keeps the game a challenge but if you start doing poorly it will but you back an easier level. I really liked this feature as I always felt the challenge to be perfect but it would be nice to have the option to turn it off, since you may just want to have fun on easy but end up being forced to hard after awhile.\n\nThere are four difficulty modes which are Easy, Normal, Hard and Exceed. Even easy can be quite a challenge until you learn the how the game is played and you get proficient at switching magic. That shouldn't take too long as the game is pretty short. Beating the whole game only takes about 30 minutes and the 7 levels are very short. Most of your time will be spent fighting bosses as the grunts will only keep you occupied for a bit before reaching the real fight, though getting cocky is fatal as one shot by them can still take you down. You have three continues at fives lives a piece but those can go by very fast if you are not careful. Gaining a lot of points nets you more lives and the best way to gain some is to fight the enemy with the opposite type of magic. Which is risky for novice players since they will most likely end up losing a life than gaining another one.\n\nEnvironments themselves are very bland and I can not recall any of the backgrounds even though I spent quite a while playing this game just today. I can see why they choose to do it that way though, as being able to tell the color of a projectile on the fly is very important  and minimal distractions help a lot. The music is pretty great, not on par with the original game but  they are very enjoyable blood pumping tunes nonetheless. This time around us non Japanese speaking folks can understand what is going on in the story since this game does feature English subtitles unlike the original. It isn't the best story or even a good one but it is interesting as both of the fighting sides are neither good nor evil. We are on the side of the Vampires performing a last ditch attempt to destroy the human army since they are carrying out genocides against the undead. Which naturally means we will eventually be fighting against the three protagonists of the last game and boy, is it satisfying shooting each of them in the face for starring in the terrible first game.\n\nNot all is perfect sadly. Entering fullscreen breaks the subtitles somehow and you will see no text during dialogue. I normally wouldn't really care but having the line “ Cutscene-driven story-telling” as a selling point for the game and having those same cutscenes broken when not in windowed mode makes it more of a deal in my opinion. Another problem that keeps popping up in most bullet hells is that the escape key exits the whole game instead of pausing which is such a annoying mistake to make. Controller support is not listed but it works perfectly and you can rebind keys. You can not use the dpad though annoyingly enough. Those are literally the only complaints I have. This is a much better PC port than that broken pile of disappointment that was the first game.\n\nIf you don't want breaks in the action you can turn off dialogue which is nice when playing through the game multiple times and don't want to hear anymore squeaky anime voices. There is also a level select feature that lets you choose whichever stage you want but there will be no dialogue so if you want to know the ending you actually have to whole 30 minute game in one go. Assuming you are on windowed mode and can actually see the subtitles that is. It may be a short game but it is a lot of fun to improve your skills and being able to hold your own on a higher difficulty, though there are no unlocks or anything like that if you need a reason to replay a game other than fun. Exceed 2nd Vampire Rex turned out to be an insane improvement over the original in every way and is one of the best bullet hells available on Steam surprisingly enough. Do not be fooled by the anime artstyle of the game, this is a title highly recommended to any fan of the bullet hell genre.","June 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Shoot-em-ups, bullet hell games, space shooters... One of the most beloved and hated video game genres of all time. For me shoot-em-ups have been quite close to my heart since they were pretty much the only games my old Pentium II PC could run. I still remember the insane amounts of enemy projectiles, enemies that were bullet sponges and... flying anime chicks?\n\nFor Touhou fans flying anime chicks may not be a thing they'd be weirded about. For others it may seem a bit weird and might send off potential buyers away. Do not let the anime theme push you away from this game though. eXceed 2nd - Vampire REX is a fun, fast, easy to learn bullet hell/shoot-em-up game that is very, oh so very, similar to Ikaruga. A lot of western people liked Ikaruga so you might give this one a try. Right?\n\nYes. I personally liked the game even though I'm not really a fan of anime nor manga. The main gameplay element was enough to keep me interested, not really the graphical style or the extremely generic anime voice acting. It's not about the theme. It's about the gameplay. eXceed 2nd borrows the gameplay from Ikaruga which is about shooting enemies and dodging bullets as well as touching them. Yes. You heard me right. You have two modes, light and dark, which will make you spew out different colored bullets and also let you absord the projectiles that are the same color as you have chosen at time. This is the main element of the game which makes it stand out from other bullet hell games in a nice fresh way. The game will build up more and more challenge the more you advance which will make the mechanics feel fresh in every new playthrough.\n\nWhat I do have to mention about the game are the very bland graphics and short lenght. The graphics are very repetitive which makes the game a little less pleasant to the eye. If you can get over the voice acting, bland graphics and the very short, yet really challenging "Story Mode" you are in treat for a very fun and smooth bullet hell game.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 9","true","2.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

All bullets/enemies come in two colors, and you can switch your own color to absorb same colored bullets (which recharges your invulnerable laser) while being vulnerable to opposite colored bullets. You also do more damage to opposite colored enemies, though it's often riskier to do so.\n\nExceed 2nd is more of a traditional twitch/reflex game than the puzzle shooter Ikaruga though. You can still apply strategy to the stages and bullet patterns to get better at them, but it has a lot more flexibility and room for improvisation.\n\nThe game also has a lot of aggression. You're encouraged to get close to enemies to melee them, and use your laser as soon as it recharges to kill bosses faster. It gives a great sense of risk/reward to the boss fights, since you can choose whether to try and kill them as soon as possible, or save your laser to protect you later. Combine this with how you damage bosses faster by staying close with the opposite color, and you have a very aggressive, up-close-and-personal game.\n\nThe level designs and bullet patterns are really solid, though maybe not as intricate or perfect as a Cave shooter. But they are fast paced and have a lot of intense moments. Overall the game is really, really fun, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys shmups. It's the best Exceed game imo, and probably one of the best shmups on Steam if not the best as of this writing.\n","November 26, 2013","true","81.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You play as Ria File, a half-human, half-vampire (aka a deviant bloodline). She has the ability to shift polarity: switch elements to absorb bullets of the same element while the other type becomes fatal. This is a mechanic that shouldn't be unknown to Ikaruga players. The game also has a dynamic difficulty implemented, whereas long survival and scoring gets you in a higher difficulty while playing, and dying reduces the difficulty. The overal difficulty of the game is okay. It might be tricky at first for newer people, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.\n\nAlthough there isn't much to the story in most danmaku shooters, this one had a story i liked. The game references characters from the previous game as well. Just like the previous game, the characters have voicing in Japanese, and unlike Gun Bullet Children, this one has an official translation in the game.\n\nThe soundtrack was made by Saitama Saishu Heiki and Shibayan, well known names in the doujin world, and this soundtrack delivers, just like their other works. The boss music fits rather well with the bosses' personalities or significance in the story, whereas the stage music either takes it a bit easier or just gets really tense to prepare you for your next big challenge.\n\nThis game is just fantastic and is among my favourite danmaku shooters now. They really outdid Gun Bullet children by far. You can get it for 6 EUR, but i'd be willing to pay double price for this game.\n\nAlso, i didn't find the OST on Steam, but you can purchase it from the tennen-sozai site[tennen-sozai.bandcamp.com].","February 20, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What makes this game "unique" is its mechanic of swapping polarities to absorb either blue or red bullets. If this sounds familiar that's because it is - this is the same mechanic that Ikaruga used famously to great effect. The series as a whole was created by a dōjin circle, similar to the Touhou project and, while not as good in my oppinion, eXceed is still a lot of fun and definitely gets your heart pounding. I beat the first game, but it was pretty generic and I would not recommend it; however, the second - Vampire REX - is a lot of fun and worth playing if you like these types of games. While Ikaruga is hands down the better game, Vampire REX is short, fast, fun, and really scratches the bullet-hell itch I've had for awhile. It doesn't have a lot of fancy options like leaderboard support but it does have minimal controller support, replays, high scores, and an arcade mode to skip dialogue. The story isn't very good, but that's to be expected, and the all important soundtrack is enjoyable and varies from Gothic choir music to hard techno - each boss even has its own theme. It was pretty easy after you figure out the mechanics of the game: collect one type of bullet to build your "bomb" and dodge the other color, you do double damage to the unit opposite your current polarity (the difficulty also increases while you play if you're doing well, which was cool), and while not the be-all-end all of bullet-hell shooters, eXceed is a worthwhile series to play and you're not going to find much like it on Steam, so I recommend this title, but not the first. We'll see if the third is as enjoyable as Vampire REX.\n\nPros:\n\nBullet-hell action!\nSwapping polarities (see Ikaruga)\nReplay support\nSolid mechanics\nGreat soundtrack\nController support\nDifficulty increases while you play if you don't die\n\nCons:\n\nShort\nNot much to unlock, only trying to beat your old high-score\n\nThis is a pretty "pure" shooter, it's fun, challenging, and short. Great for pick-up-and-play action, but not very deep. I'd recommend it over the first in the series as it's a little more polished and the polarity swapping mechanic is a lot of fun to play with. It's not the best shooter and is more of a niche title since it's a bullet-hell dōjin game, but if you like this style then you're hard pressed to find something like it on Steam.

I mean come on... that would be an amazing game no matter what! But enough about my fantasies lets talk about the second eXceed game.\n\nVampire REX is the second eXceed game and compared to the first one it is amazing, this time around eXceed is taking cue from Ikaruga, meaning the bullets that are fired in this Bullet Hell are colored red and blue, and you are able to switch between the two colors as well allowing you to absorb the bullets to charge your cannon attack and chain together combos. The better you do at the game the higher the difficulty gets, thus letting the game dynamically changed based on how you are doing.\n\nWhile the game still doesn't do anything unique, and trust me I know it is hard to do something unique in a Bullet Hell these days, this game is vastly superior to the first in just about every way, the music is better, the art is better, and the overall game is a lot more well designed.\n\nIf I had to knock it for something I would say that it is not as replayable as it could be as you are only able to play as one character with no weapon powerups and there are just eight stages, and while the story is better that is not saying much, it is still insane and nonsensical though that comes with the territory for these games.

First, you’re a half vampire trying to prevent your kind from being wiped out by humanity.  Second, it’s good instead of being terrible.  Finally, they spent the hour or so to use Google translate to localize the subtitles so I can understand the story (I still don't understand the story.  I guess I should've read the comic book... I'm sorry Manga.)\n\nThe graphics are vastly improved and the soundtrack is still solid.  The player’s sprite and enemy bosses have some pretty good looking animation.  The bullets are no longer monochromatic blobs.  The backgrounds look nice.  The run of the mill enemies are still pretty bland, though.  Overall it’s a huge improvement from eXceed 1.\n\nThe game play is what really stands out.  The enemies’ attacks are either light or dark.  The player has a ‘polarity’, which means you can absorb one type of bullet to power up while you are vulnerable to the other.  The game play is tough without feeling cheap and the difficulty curve is well balanced.  Most importantly, you can move diagonally with your gamepads analog stick.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is as good as the first one was bad.  If you’re only going to play one game in the series (which is what I’d recommend) this is the one.","December 1, 2013","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Additionally, the game has difficulty scaling (the difficulty changes according to the player's skill) and chaining which grants bonus points and that's very useful for quickly getting extra lives.\n\nThe boss fights are very good because of the (mostly) epic music and the voice acting (most bosses say something according to your progress in the fight), which made the fights really cool at times.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect because the songs are fitting for the given situation and they are top-notch.\n\nMy favorite part of the game would be the 7th stage because it's fun and it gets better towards the end.\n\nI would recommend this game for those who are interested in shmups.","April 28, 2014","true","34.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

This makes for some almost puzzle like battles and requires a heck of a lot of concentration, swapping your polarity at just the right moment.

In this case it's pretty much trying to be 'Ikaruga-like'. Dual-polarity is the name of the game here, having to switch in and out off the 'Human' and 'Vampire' modes, asorbing bullets of the same kind, and dealing extra damage towards the other. The action and bullet patterns are far more faster and creative then the last game to boot, leaving it feeling like a more fun package, and unlike the other game, offers a 'level system' that has the game get harder and harder as you start doing better and better to keep the pressure on you, but if you start screwing up, it'll start to tone it down as well, but then higher diffcultys = more score, and that means more extends that you'll need to acually beat the base 7 stages, and PERHAPS if you're skilled enough, get that 'true final fight'.\n\nHonestly it's a decent shmup, and it's soundtrack's been remastered a tad for this steam release to boot. If you are new towards shmup's, it's going to be hard, otherwise those into the type of gameplay it offers should enjoy the experance fully.","August 20, 2013","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It fixes a lot of the mistakes from the first game.\n\nUnlike the first eXceed game, the text is in english, so you can understand the story, but this game doesn't have much of a story. After playing once or twice, you'll probably turn the dialogue off.\n\nIf you haven't played Ikaruga, it may bean adjustment to get used to the mechanics of this game. It is impossible to dodge every bullet, so you have to train your eyes to focus on bullets that are the opposite color if you don't want to get overwhelmed. Sometimes, a seemeingly impossible bullet pattern becomes simple when you recall that you can change your color and absorb the wall of bullets coming your way.\n\n\nCons: Unlike the first game, you don't get to choose from different characters. Your character and bullet pattern is always the same.\n\nAlso, the game scales the difficulty automatically, which could be a good idea, but I feel like it scales too quickly. I can start the game on easy, and be scaled to the hardest difficulty by the end of the first stage. It doesn't really increase the difficulty gradually. Suddenly, you do well enough to activate the next difficulty, and a lot more bullets start coming your way.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game, though I don't think I'd pay $6 for it. It's a pretty good deal if you can catch it on sale.","December 5, 2013","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaSHODN/recommended/207380/","metaSHODN","Banana Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaSHODN/","688 products in account","The difference between this title and it's predecessor is astonishing.\n\nWhere eXceed 1st barely functioned, and was subpar even when it did, eXceed 2nd... EXCEEDS it in every way!\n\nIn all seriousness though, after the terror of the first game, I expected this one to be similarly terrible, but my fears were quickly quelled.  For starters, eXceed 2nd actually has some resolution options and can be played windowed.  Granted - it doesn't feature as great a breadth of options as I would have liked, but there is actually some choice this time around.  The game also doesn't immediately crash when minimized, so it has that going on for it too.\n\nThe story is still incoherantly silly - but at least it's actually translated this time, and I sure hope you're not playing a shmup for it's gripping narrative anyways.  The visuals are still nothing to write home about, but they've been significantly upgraded - especially in the character sprite department.  Another big upgrade goes to the soundtrack.  While I probably won't listen to it outside of the game, it's a much, much better offering than the looped samples of the first title.\n\nAs for the only truly important part of a shmup - how it plays.  I'm pleased to say that eXceed 2nd is a fantastic bullet hell game.  It uses the Ikaruga system where you can switch between two colors and absorb same-colored dots, but die to opposite colored dots.  While Ikaruga is much more visually striking, I'd go so far as to argue that eXceed 2nd has far more interesting bullet patterns and is overall a more challenging and enjoyable experience.  This title also features a dynamic difficulty system - the longer you survive the higher it goes, and the more points you earn, but after dying you lose a skill level.\n\nI would even go so far as to say this game is fantastically balanced difficulty wise.  It's entirely possible for a complete novice to get through the levels using stage select on easy mode, yet it will be a monumental challenge for someone to 1-life the game - especially while keeping it on the higher difficulty settings.\n\nAll in all I heavily recommend this title to anyone who is a fan of shmups, or wants to try to sink their teeth into a more "core" title.  It's also super cheap, goes on discount, and has steam trading cards..!","February 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything else is of about the same low quality of the first game. The developers also ripped off the main color changing mechanic from Ikaruga. The characters now have voice acting in Japanese, and for this game it means that you will hear five year old girls screaming or squirming at each other for dialogue. The bullets are still just balls and arrows. Half of them are black and the other half are red. The enemy designs continue not making any sense and can't be described as anything useful or interesting. The nonsensical story is pointless and its protagonists are stereotypical and redundant.\n\nWhy would anyone pay and play this ridiculously low quality Ikaruga clone when they could be playing Ikaruga itself? There is absolutely nothing redeeming or of value in this game. Capcom associating themselves with something this lame baffles me.\n\neXceed 2nd - Vampire REX is awful.","January 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The game is translated, has controller support, dialog can be turned off and you can choose settings like resolution. You can still only select 1600x900 as highest resolution, but you can choose to play it windowed.\n\nNew is the polarity mechanic it borrows from Ikaruga. Only bullets of an opposite polarity can kill the player. Same-color bullets are absorbed and converted into energy for special weapon. Switching the polarity also changes the color of your bullets, and shooting an enemy using opposite-polarity bullets will cause double damage. The game only forgets to tell you that it uses this system.\n\nFor a bullethell shmup it's quite oke. Main issue that puts me off is the anime art style and setting. I'm just not a fan of that and prefer I'm something like a ship in shmups. I already find bullethell shmups a genre hard to enjoy and this makes it even harder.

The art style is unpleasant, not simply because of its anime roots, but because it's just bland. The story is awful, though, thankfully, it can be disabled (and has to be every time you start a new game). The bullet patterns are pretty average Doujin shmup fair. The polarity mechanic accomplishes nothing but to distract you from the standard practice of dodging, because the stage design isn't tight enough and, frankly, doesn't really do anything interesting with it. Honestly, for not a lot more, you can pick up Ikaruga, which is a classic for a reason.

It's not an easy game, but then again these never are so if you're looking to buy it you probably knew this. The game has a nice system of switching between two states, red or white, to become invulnerable to one bullet colour (the one you are) but you then are vulnerable to the opposite colour. Whilst you are one colour you do more damage to opposing coloured enemies, however this comes at a great risk as this usually puts you in the line of fire of the bullets you are vulnerable to.\n\nAbsorb your current colour to powerup your charge meter, and then blast out an almighty blast, so to speak.\n\nThere is a rank system where, provided you survive for long enough without taking a giant glowing ball to that pretty anime face of yours, you level up to the next difficulty for killing enemies. It's a good system and a feature but personally I do not enjoy it.\n\nProsVery good gameplay system of changing states, adds a new depth to gameplay.\nSmooth, enjoyable, fun gameplay! Controls nicely!\nHigh-levels of difficulty, as you'd expect.\nGorgeous BGM that's really damn catchy.\nConsThe story, whilst enjoyable, is not really too well written.\n(PERSONAL) Difficulty Levelling. I know some people may find this as a feature, and it certainly is, but I personally do not enjoy this as playing on Hard I already have enough trouble, but when I survive for a while it levels me up to Exceed, well I just get destroyed.\n(DEBATABLE) I've noticed people complaining about FPS issues and, although I've not seen it myself, it's fair to put this here as a warning in case it occurs for you! Apparently it's fixable though, although I'm not sure how but a quick look into the discussions/a quick Google search will help there.\nJudgementIt's a well made, enjoyable danmaku.

The main idea is that there are 2 colors: neon-magenta and white-blue. You can switch between the two modes and you absorb all bullets of the same color (but are hit by the opposing color). Absorbing bullets builds special meter and when the special meter is full you can unleash it, clearing the screen of harmful bullets and dealing a good amount of damage. Clear waves of regular enemies and you'll reach the boss fight at the end of the level. Boss fights feel pretty nice because you can absorb a lot of special meter while avoiding their attacks so you can use the special a lot.\n\nAs for story, you play against the characters/faction of the first game. The first game requires an outside patch for english (which I didn't do) so it wasn't really interesting to me, just another anime game story.\n\nWhat's nice in this game (and not in 1 or 3) is that boss fights show life meters (with more bars for more phases). However, unlike 3, there's no dot marker on your character to see exactly what part of your character needs to dodge the bullets.\n\nI'm not really into bullet hells, but I played this on easy and had a fun enough time playing through. There are patterns you can memorize and progress further by changing up your tactics. In my opinion, I liked 2 the best, 3 a little less (only because 2 has the polarity mechanic), and 1 leagues behind.

Don't get me wrong, Ikaruga is pretty great, but playing it, it sometimes feels like the switching mechanic was enough for them and they never really got super crazy with the patterns.  It also feels a bit slow, to me.  This game takes that stuff, and then runs with it.  It's got nice/pretty/nasty patterns, dynamic difficulty, and the graphics and sound are pretty damn good for a doujin shmup.  Worth picking up!","July 5, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is unpleasant, not simply because of its anime roots, but because it's just bland. The story is awful, though, thankfully, it can be disabled (and has to be every time you start a new game). The bullet patterns are pretty average Doujin shmup fair. The polarity mechanic accomplishes nothing but to distract you from the standard practice of dodging, because the stage design isn't tight enough and, frankly, doesn't really do anything interesting with it. Honestly, for not a lot more, you can pick up Ikaruga, which is a classic for a reason. This game is just really rough around the edges, which I personally don't think works for a shmup with this many bullets on-screen at once.","June 28, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
