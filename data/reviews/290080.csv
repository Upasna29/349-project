"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheumgal/recommended/290080/","sheumgal","cheeks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheumgal/","150 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA lot of people have been asking my opinion on LiF- so I figured I'd go ahead and write a lengthy review on this game and lay down (what I think) you should consider if you're going to drop the $40 for this game in its current alpha state.\n\nFirst off, if you are someone who expects to be slaying dragons, fighting other people fully decked out in plate armor with a war horse and a golden lance within 30 minutes, and destorying them in 8 seconds with Mount and Blade style combat- do not even remotely consider this game.\n\nAt the exact time of this review I have sunk about 7 hours into this game (and of course plan on playing much more) and have managed to JUST NOW build myself a small shack and obtain a little iron to POSSIBLY create into tools. Mind you this was done with the help of around 6-7 other people who were working in extreme cooperation with one another. Just to give you a little sense of how "hardcore" this game really is when it comes to progression. (I was also playing on a server with hardly any skill multiplier, there are servers where you can level things much faster and thus progress with greater speed if you're looking for a more solo experience)\n\nNow down to picking out the major aspects of the game people wish to know about:\n\n1. Combat: Being someone who loves the fighting aspects of games, I will admit that Life is Feudal's alpha combat is nothing to write home about. 3/4s of your swings WILL miss until you get the range of your weapon (which is different for each weapon) and once you've actually got the combat down you will still have difficulty hitting. It is /not/ Mount and Blade combat. Is it close? Yes- but it is not M&B. Trust me. However, there is only alpha and it will likely get MUCH better and I can certainly see a fantastic combat system coming out of this. All in all, the combat at the moment is basically an unpolished combat of what can make a great system. 6/10\n\n2. Crafting: Crafting is definetly one of the stronger aspects of this game. It is rich and complex, certainly has massive potenial to be added onto. Even in its current state there is quite a lot to do. However I have been met with some pretty strange bugs that cause me to crash (which is totally to be expected in the alpha testing phase, but I am after all reviewing the alpha) and some recipes are implemented but do not even work, for example the bow and torch. Overall, crafting is going to be very good when it is refined and expanded on, and even in its current state it is very useable. 7/10\n\n3. UI: I am bunching UI and Mechanics together due to the fact that there isn't much to talk about regarding them. The User interface is clearly in an early stage, but much like the crafting, very useable. There is a bit of a learning curve when you first get into the game (trying to figure out how the hell to do anything basically) but once you over come this, you should be able to experiment and figure out everything else on your own. Don't expect this game to spoon feed you, and honestly after 7 hours, I'm sure there is stuff that even I haven't figured out yet. 6/10\n\n4. Skills and Mechanics: The skills system is still very much a work in progress, I'd say about 1/4(?) of the skills have still yet to be implemented. However, that doesn't detract from the complexity and potential that the skill system has. From plant gathering to cutting down trees, to using a sickle effectively as a weapon under "milita service", the skill system is impressive. One of the coolest in my opinion is the formation skills when in a unit, I'd write more about it but it is something easier looked up. As of right now I have only encountered one bug with the skills and that is when you pray it actually respawns you (for some odd reason). The skills system is definetly going to be something to enjoy once it is fully completed. 8/10\n\nNow my final thoughts on whether you should drop the $40 or not: As you can see in a lot of what I said, these systems will be great "once they're complete" and take that exactly how it's said. This is without a doubt an alpha, and if you can't get past the crashes, bugs, and imperfect systems- do not spend your money. If this was around... $20 I would say you should still give it a go, but this price tage is a bit steep. However- if you wish to support the development process and you can get past the grime thats covering the shine, you're going to enjoy the living hell out of this game and I would highly recommend it.\n\nHopefully this helps some people make their decisions.\n\n","September 20, 2014","true","13.5"," 2,150 of 2,335 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","150","2","5","20"

In this community heavy RP is enforced and any event done otherwise is punishable.\nDay 1: I have finally made my way into the realm from a nearby beach, it has been a while since I have visited the Isle of Maldath. I gather berries and herbs and begin to train myself in the ways of the gatherer. Day 2: I have located a nearby settlement surrounded by tall oaks and green grasses known to the natives as Woodhurst. Upon signaling the guardsman at the towering iron front gate, to my surprise, I am greeted by an old friend of mine, Arnaas of Valencia. We reminisce for a moment and I am soon offered a position among their people as an herbalist in training. Of course I accept, and then am put on a trial period to prove my loyalty.Day 3: Whilst gathering in the nearby cattle-fields of Woodhurst I notice two men approaching the front gate of the town, one in what seemed to be a religious robe and the other in sturdy plate armour. I am urgent about greeting them, in hopes that I can make a few friends. The two outsiders reveal themselves to be "Solith" a priest of the Blood God and "Korn," a fellow mercenary. They are spreading word that the southern faction known as Dominion has fallen and is being rebuilt by their cult. Once again, I am offered a position. Strucken by promises of gold and power... I am torn.Day 8: After days of training, I have begun to mix potions for Woodhurst as they have accepted me as their full time alchemist. I covertly keep in touch with Solith as I am still partially swayed by his tempting offers. I am introduced to the town bank as I am now added to the pay roll.Day 12: A raid has taken place on the nearby settlement of Mercia in which the pope of Woodhurst was slain by no other than Korn and Solith's Cult. General Felipo of the Woodhurst army immediately drafts me into their military as a recruit and I undergo extreme combat training. My specialty being Pole-Axes and Scale Armour. Day 20: Serving for Woodhurst has now become grueling work with little pay. One night at my post, I decide to leave the town in search of Solith's lair, hoping that his offer still stands. I am greeted by their cult and am offered training and safe haven if I leave Woodhurst forever. I state that I must go back to fetch my items. As I am leaving, a squadron of Woodhurst soldiers stops  and sees me conversing with the cult. I am immediately interrogated and claim to be seeking revenge for our pope. General Felipo decides to take matters into his own hands and challenges Solith's mercenary, Korn to a duel. Korn is decapitated. I make an effort to ride back to Woodhurst.Day 30: My quarters have been under lockdown and I have been suspended for suspicion of treason. One night I successfully subdue my guard and make my way into the inner town square. I make my way for the bank. The blackmith's, the queen's, carpenter's, everyones payroll now mine. I have stolen a horse and made my way back to Solith's lair. I am now wanted.Day 31: The combined forces of Woodhurst and her allies have surrounded Solith's Lair and are demanding that I be handed over for execution. We wait them out after exchanging some volleys of spears etc.Day 34: The heat has cooled off and I leave the lair in search of a plot of land to buy for my own, one that is away from all this conflict. As I make my way to a nearby village, I make my way into the town inn and have a long conversation with the bartender. A long enough conversation in order for their messenger to send word to Woodhurst of my location. I hear a farmiliar voice call my name. As I turn, I immediately draw my weapon. Then as I see all the other farmiliar faces start appearing, I dash for my life. I make it just in time to grab my horse and ride all the way across the island evading every single horse archer and lanceman they sent after me. I am now forever an outcast among these lands.\nConclusion:\n\nI'm going to let you all in on a little secret about this game.  Like many others of its kind, this game and its famous hard-core RPG elements, are very closely tied to the servers you play on. This is because to be a "Grandmaster Hunter" or even a "Famous Axe-Man" means nothing unless you have a community that depends on you. So what I'm trying to say is, don't jump into this game by yourself or even with a few friends on a private server because most of you will not get your money's worth. You don't want yourself to end up like everyone else in the negative reviews section who got sick of digging holes and grinding for levels. Instead, find a meaningful server. One that cherishes heavy RP, constant PVP, or even both. That being said, I highly recommend RPCLIF as your server of choice for the adventures to come.","December 28, 2015","true","360.1"," 803 of 885 people (91%) found this review helpful 152 people found this review funny","91","803","885","152","41"

I am on a non PVP server and we are usually close to full every evening. I was unsure about the game the first hour or so. I'm used to Rpg's where you wander around killing stuff to level up and craft when you get tired of leveling. This game is completely different. It's all about building and crafting. It'a about wandering around a beautiful country looking for the things you need to make food, tools, armor, houses, keeps, weapons...basically anything and everything.\nOn our server we have like three separate communities or villages. Since PVP isn't an option on this server, we are friendly to one another. On my second day of playing I had made a crapload of mortar and pestles so I shouted out that if anyone wanted some of them for free, just come to my village at the base of the smallest mountain in the northeast by the sea. (There are no roads yet, although they can be built with certain skills so we use landmarks like lakes and mountains to guide people to where we are). So some stranger shouts back asking me why don't I put my stuff in a chest and I respond that i don't have one or the skills to make one. So he yells back that he'll make me one and he lugs this huge chest on his back all the way to my village just to be neighborly! This is the kind of community I like to play in and the majority of the players on my server are like this! Then the guy sticks around a bit and gives me tips on crafting and makes me a blacksmith hammer when I ask him what skill is needed to make one.\nThe crafting is what makes this game fun for me. Gathering my materials and skilling up to make better items is simply a blast once you figure out the mechanics which aren't very hard. Right now, I'm enjoying making tools. Yesterday I tried out hunting. Low level hunting was fun as heck. You're too weak to kill big game, but the game makes it enjoyable in a very unique way for newbies. A noob hunter has a couple od fun skills One is a crafting option to make small animal snares and the other is called small animal tracking. When you activate tracking, an animal's footprints appear and you can see where he likes to travel. Follow his trail and place the snares you make out of materials along the way ( plant fiber, a tree branch and an apple) which are all easy to find, then come back in an hour or so and empty your traps. I got chickens and hares and I put them in a coop in my village and they laid eggs and had babies...totally awesome. You can also track aggressive animals once you learn to defend yourself. I've seen bears and wolves. There are no monsters yet and I'm okay with that...it feels real. Supposedly they will be added in the future. Bear in mind this is alpha.\nThere are PVP servers if that is your thing, but I can't comment on that aspect of the game because I don't like pvp.\nIf you choose non pvp, the game is about building a community. In my village everyone chats, they ask other for items and sometimes we trade stuff or even just give it away. Today a new person logged on and asked us how to get a house, so we told him to join our village and everyone helped to build him one. Since I was too low to actually help build, I helped gather wood. I felt good about it and it was fun to see everyone helping a complete stranger. I've played MMO's for many years and frankly outside of guilds, you meet so many rude obnoxious people in MMO's anymore but so far it hasn't been like that here.\nI'm really excited. I found it difficult to even take time away from the game to write this post, but I wanted to get the word out. I've got big plans. I'm raising my healing skills and making my own plate mail so i can kill bears, and I'm learning to fish. I'm even going to build a keep which takes 15000x rocks and 4000 shaped stone among other things. It will take months and it will be so much fun to watch it grow into a fortress for me and my friends.\nLet me be clear on one thing. if you're looking for action packed adventure, the non pvp server aspect of this game is NOT for you. This is laid back...serene music in the background, birds twittering in the trees, the sound of your neighbor chopping wood, a hike up the biggest mountain on the island to watch the sunset and get back home before the wolves come out. It's about meeting people who don't yell, "I PWNED YOU!", but instead say things like, "Hey, we just killed a bear and we're cooking it up in our new village...everyone's invited!" or "Hey, I'm a prospector and I have a ton of copper...wanna trade me some of your logs for some of it?" or "Hi everyone...I'm new here...can anyone help me?" and hearing 6 people shouting back for him to come join their village. There are a few bugs...this is alpha after all. In the morning, chicks are born, trees blossom, and everything updates and there's usually a few minutes lag. Once my targetting button wouldnt work and I logged out  and then back on and it solved that glitch. This is early alpha after all, so glitches happen, but so far nothing game breaking. What I really like is it doesn't feel like some madcap rush to endgame...like omg I have to level up to keep up with everyone. It's not like that at all. Even the lowliest noob can help on stuff because gathering is a HUGE part of this game.  It's slow paced, but entertaining as hell. There's such a satisfaction when you gain a skill where you can make a new tool or piece of furniture or armor and actually use it and see a big difference. And since each village is essnetially a guild with houses, there's sense of community, of being neighbors. It's not some strange guy ridng up on his horse, hurrying to unload the gear he got in a dungeon and racing off without a backward glance or a hello. It's about your neigbor looking over at you and saying, "I feel like mining today. What are you going to do?" I look off in the distance at some mountain and reply," I'm going to go over to that mountain over there and terraform the top so I can build me a little shack at the top with a view of the ocean on one side and this village on the other." My neighbor looks at me and says, "It's going to take you awhile to flatten the land on the top of that mountain. That's a lot of digging!" I smile and reply, "That's okay! I like the view and I've got lots of time!"\nI love this game!\n\nMore impressions! New impressions after a week. I'm so tired....last night I did not go to bed because I simply cannot quit playing. So much has happened. The lag comtinues to glitch the game at times and kicks  you occasionally but I'm willing to tolerate that due to early access...it's expected. My first server grew unstable in no small part due to my older computer so I've switched twice since then. A FANTASTIC experience both times! My first was another PVE server since I'm terrible at PVP and I met the most wonderful group 2 minutes into getting their and joined their village. Had a wonderful time helping them build and getting to know them. we decided to go for a village surrounded by castle walls and it was cool. Now here's the thing...a lot of these guys had experience by now like me and the town was already coming along great without me, so I decided to take up herbalism because none of them seemed to like the grind of this skill. They make this skill like a mini game. Evetry herb has three hidden qualities and there are 66 herbs. Your challenge is to find them (easy and quick), mix them with a mortar and pestle (Easy again), and finally try to match them up to find which ones share familiar traits (not so easy). Heres the thing...you're looking for one particualar item in these herbs...flux. You cannot mix two of the same with similar traits or it creates an item and your herb disappears. You don't want that to happen on 99% of the items...however, if you get two items with flux characteristics, you DEFINITELY want to mix them because this is the most needed item for","December 27, 2014","true","040.0"," 485 of 525 people (92%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","92","485","525","23","66"

I know almost everything about it, currently. I have built everything that there is to build, been a king, a farmer, a warrior...  so when I write a review, know that it is quite balanced. I am no fan boi, and will let you know all the pro's and cons of this game.\n\nPros.\n1. You can tailor your characters skills to match what you wish to do in the game. Depending on the server skill cap, it can mean you can ONLY be a farmer and a bowman, or a smith and a swordsman, to being able to do everything.  Pick the server that best represents what you want. RP, pvp, rp/pvp, high skill cap (recommended for new players) or low skill cap.\n\n2. crafting system requires a lot of steps. You want to build a small house? Alright the you either have to have a supply of trees nearby, or have forestry to plant saplings and wait half a week in real life for trees to grow enough to harvest. Then once you get the timber, you or a friend better have herbalism to get enough flux to make steel for the locks and mortar needed for doors. Then you better know enough materials prep to make glass for windows... which requires carpentry as do the doors. Oh, and smithing to make the locks... while you make clay tiles. So, you need 1. forestry. 2. logging. 3 carpentry. 4. smithing. 5. materials prep. 6 gathering. 7 herbalism... just to make the smallest house in game.  On a low skill cap server, this will take the combined efforts of 3-4 people. Now imagine what a castle takes.\n\n3. harvesting is indepth. Need leather? Go hunt, make coops to harvest hares, and barns for animals... oh you need to actually trap those animals, or tame them.  Food is grown, and harvested... then a cook is needed ot make it into actual food. All raw resources need to be manufactured into goods.\n\n4. giant battles. I have participated in a 64 man judgement day battle. Took hours of non stop fighting, with trebuchets flinging rocks, bombs and arrows everywhere, people murdering eachother and sometimes friends on accident.\n\n5. Small battles. Nothing is more intense than a 2-3 man vs 2-3 man fight, where every person is needed to hold their own to win. Takes hours and hours of training to get decent, and I mean just decent, at pvp\n\n6. You literally create your own town from nothing. You scoop every bit of dirt, plant every tree, move the world to create a settlement that you can be proud of. You can make a hovel in a swamp, or a giant fortress in the mountains, it all depends on the time you invest.\n\n7. community and roleplaying can be a blast. Politics, intrigue, back biting... all fun.\n\nCons.\n\n1. server wipes. put 200 hours into your place, and its gone, instantly, start from scratch.\n\n2. lazy or no gms. LEaves you at the mercy of the griefers if the server you choose doesnt have active gms.\n\n3. SLOW DEVELOPMENT. And I mean SLOW. I have played for quite some time now... the ONLY thing added to the game since I have played (I played in beta) was advanced weather. That's it. Most people dont even use it as it can lag you. Oh and the dx11 graphic upgrade... which didnt actually add anything to the game. They have been promising horse drawn carts for MONTHS.\n\n4. broken features/bugs will drive you crazy. Wait till you die 20 times in a row, losing a ton of skill points that takes  hours to get because of a bug.\n\nYou can't play the game by yourself and expect to win. The fun is in groups. Dont buy this game if you dont want to join a group.","January 27","true","862.5"," 469 of 512 people (92%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","92","469","512","30","9"

Life is Feudal is that game. While it's still a work in progress, the game already offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and fun. Warning: this game is "hardcore" (with exceptions- keep reading).\n\nSynopsis of gameplay:\nIt's an open medieval sandbox world that's ready to be transformed by you and your fellow knights (FYI, to be successful, you'll typically need to play this game with quite a few friends or other players that you meet in game). You start in the wilderness, with hardly any clothes, and gather edible food to stay alive, along with plant fiber and sticks to create primitive tools. With these tools, you slowly become self-sufficient: building a house for yourself, farmland, crafting equipement, and digging a mine. Soon, you have a little village going! Maybe even build a palisade wall around it to help keep out hostile players! ;)\n\nMultiplayer:\nIt's very important that you play this game with other people because LIF revolves around having to use teamwork to succeed. One cannot learn all the skills, yet each skill supplments the other. So if you hope to eventually make a small village, don't expect to do it with just your hermit-self. You need a specialized blacksmith, farmer, miner, builder, and alchemist to get everything done! And hopefully multiples of each ;) IMPORTANT: Use in-game global chat to FIND other players, or search the LIF website forums for groups in need of more members! (don't just walk around aimlessly in-game).\n\n^There IS an exception: Private servers can be personalized by the admin to allow players larger skill caps (to obtain most available skills) as well as skill multipliers, which make work/leveling faster, potentially allowing you to play solo, or for shorter periods of time. But this is not the original "vanilla" version of the game.\n\nPros:\n-I've never had so much fun playing a game before. Give it adaquete time before you judge it.\n-Medieval realism, sandbox, open world, terraforming, no-target combat, full-loot PvP. Pinch me I'm dreaming.\n-Player-built and player-run world. No NPCs.\n\nCons (potential):\n-Very difficult learning curve. It's hard to familearize yourself with game mechanics.\n-The game is very hardcore (UNLESS you are playing on a severely customized server). If you're a Call of Duty fan, leave before it's too late!\n-You're going to need to put A LOT of time into this game if you want to build a completed settlement with your mates. The journey, while slow, is a fun one though. If you don't have the time, try waiting for the MMO version (where settlements will likely demand a smaller share of responsibility from you, and you can focus more on the social/RP/& fighting aspects).\n-Being in Alpha, some elements are naturally not working as well as they should be (ie. smoothness of combat, wild animals, occassional crashing). BUT the deveopment team is extremely active, and updates are always rolling out. This game is even exponentially better than it was a week ago (I was a pre-alpha tester for months outside steam).\n-This 64 player version (MMO info is below) does not prioritize combat. There is no clear mechanic that allows for competing groups of players to wage war against each other in order to destroy each other's settlements. (You can still fight for the sake of fighting though and kill each other). But if you are looking for soley a combat/fighting game, do not get this. It's design leans towards crafting and building the world around you.\n\nLong term goal:\nThis is the 64 player version of a larger MMO that they are trying to generate funding for. The MMO's success rides on the success of this smaller game. Both have the same gameplay mechanics, so development of one equally benefits the other. (FYI: Sieging/large-scale combat will be more prevalent in the MMO).","September 19, 2014","true","34.5"," 958 of 1,100 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","958","1","0","46"

Real feudal life. Hard, unkind, and taking effort to eke out a living. You get to experience struggle. But then, that's where the dream goes horribly wrong. I understand that they had to make concessions with the interface becaue they wanted to keep the servers from getting loaded with crap on the ground and have it crash. But the methods they came up with to deal with that aspect are painful to work around. Please note that *my friend and I played* this game with the server set on default settings. I wasn't solo.\n\nLet's go from the experience of making a house. The first little hut that you can make at the begining. So how would you make a house/hut in real life? Well, first you'd get some tools. Then you'd use the tools to gather the resources. Then you'd use the same tools or other tools to refine said resources. Then finally you'd assemble said refined resources in some fashion to construct the final product. Also I should include the reality of dealing with the terrain by preparing it. This is both an acceptable convention and a logical one. However, the developers of LiF:YO have decided that they wanted to do it their way.\n\nThe LiF:YO way. First you start off by gathering the tool components. I'm with them at this point. You grab some branches, flint, and plant fiber and away you go with your tools. But here's where it gets convoluted. You don't now get to walk up to a tree, small or otherwise, and start smacking it. You have to "know" how to cut this tree down. So start learning. So grab some branches off a tree and other things to learn. Ok, you now know how to cut the tree down, but not all trees, because an axe on hardwood works differently than on softwood. Ok, fair enough, there's something there I won't argue with. But now I want to refine the wood into the construction materials. I have the tools, but again, I don't know how to cut a log into planks or construction posts. So to learn this, I pull more branches off trees and grab saplings and peel bark and cut down more trees. So finally I know how to make a log and planks and I get the materials I need to make the house. So I can make the hut right? Wrong. Now I need to go dig a hole in the ground, over and over and over... Why, you ask? Because I need to learn how to construct a house. The skill required to construct this house is called Construction Material Preparation and you need it to a pretty high level. So appearently digging a hole in the ground and dropping the dirt over and over again teach you something about building a hut. But the digging part is only for the prerequisite skill. Once that is high enough, you start digging rocks. But this does not get you the skill you need directly. You must "refine" this rock into smooth stone to learn the art of building. Eventually you finally get the skills required to build said hut and can relax with a Mojito on the porch looking into the forest you just razed to build it.\n\nMy other complaint is that what do you do with all the rock and stone and wood that you didn't use up in this endeavor? You can't put it in storage, because that would require nails and stuff that requires iron ore that requires... Ok, I could go on, but the point is, this game requires you to do things that make absolutely no sense to level up without connections to other things that make sense. One last thing. I can respect the fact they don't want a pile of dirt to fit inside a sack that you drop on the ground as your only means of storage early game. But they already broke that convention with the planks and smooth stone and trees that you can stuff in the sack unrealistically. So make up your mind. You can't have it both ways. It's annoying as hell to have to walk away from your work just to dump dirt and rock on the ground while the capenter has filled his sack to the brim with a forest of goodies. Which by the way, if I wanted to give my buddy a rock to make a cooking pot, it can't happen early game. He has to dig his own rock, which also takes grinding a skill.\n\nI should further note that the majority of people currently enjoying this game are bypassing this entire process by using Admin commands. Doing things like creating resource piles of infinite resources because the mining is still broken. This hardly makes the game as epic and good as they are letting on. If you aren't willing to play the game the way it was meant to be played, at least have the decency to note that in a review. Also, if you are bypassing all the "broken" content with changed server settings. What does that really say about this game?\n\nTL:DR I feel like in the end, if I play this game I feel I'd make a better use of my time making an actual hut in my backyard out of the same material this game uses in far less time. I also wouldn't have to learn how to swing an axe for each type of tree I want to cut down. I'd like to know how this character made it to adulthood not knowing how to dig holes and catch food. If this is the direction they want to go for the final product, there's no way I can say "Well done." Please rethink the skill tree and material aquisition aspect of this game and I will revisit your fine work. But untill then, I'll be in my backyard finishing my castle.","March 26, 2015","false","10.0"," 724 of 848 people (85%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","85","724","848","175","25"

Building your own medieval town is really such a wonderful idea and I was eyeing this game for ages.\n\nBut as a single player (and this game is being marketed for single players as well as multiple), this game has been nothing but a disappointment.\n\n- For solo players, the grind is really the only thing there is. There's no danger and no purpose really to play: any wildlife that may attack you is easily avoidable. There are no other mobs. I had read before purchase of intentions to create quests and mobs, but it seems that those ideas have been abandoned in favour of keeping LiF:YO as a game that relies entirely on PvP for non-crafting content.\n\n- The grind is real. It took me over thirty RL hours to flatten the land and collect the mats I needed to build a small shack. This was after tweaking settings so I could have a chance in hell of creating anything on my own. As much as I love crafting, it's going to take absurd amount of time -- hundreds and hundreds of hours -- to build anything. But with no danger present in the world, there's no purpose to build other than aesthetics.\n\n- Some of the cool features in the LiF video are -only available for the MMO-. This is not the MMO. There are no crafting games here. The island you get is small and not likely to get bigger. No quests planned. The only thing in the world is you. And the tedious grind of creation.\n\n- Speaking of the MMO, that's where the devs are focused. Buying LiF: YO isn't giving you a version of the MMO: it's giving you the redheaded stepchild of the family. It's sickly, underdeveloped, and simply not getting any of the attention that they are lavishing on its brother. Reading the official forums makes it clear that this isn't likely to change. (Seriously. Go look at the list about the differences between YO and the MMO. You may find that the feature you're purchasing this for doesn't exist in the YO version.)\n\nDon't get me wrong. I really want to like this game. I'll keep my eyes on it and see if maybe the devs have a change of heart about the PVP-only content. But LiF is too much effort for very little pay off. Even if you are a solo player -- especially, even -- I'd highly suggest you wait for the MMO when it comes out.\n\nIf it comes out.","December 1, 2014","false","34.6"," 1,001 of 1,224 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","001","1","0","59"

I waited until they announced it was being released as I want to be able to play the game rather than constantly reporting bugs, however this game is nowhere near in a releasable state. Frankly it is still an Alpha game and every single play session I have entered into leads to yet more bugs and issues that quite frankly leave me frsutrated and enfuriated. Saxxon, the companies modrator on the steam forums, replies to complaints in snarkiness and with sarcasm and constantly compares this "release" to that of Fallout 4 because "that game has bugs too!" when the fact is that Fallout 4 does have bugs but is still more than playable with minimal stress or concerns whereas I am unable to get through 20 mins of Life is feudal without finding something else which is either broken or was simply half ♥♥♥♥♥ in development. This game's "release" in no way compare's to Fallout 4, and for that matter I wouldn't compare it to Arkham Knight either which in istelf had a nightmare launch. Frankly, the release of this game is by far the worse PC release I have ever been a part of and what really pains me about that is that the concept of the game in itself is a very good one.\n\nFrankly I am disgusted that the company went straight from Alpha state into "release" completely bypassing the bug detecting beta phase and that they then have the ignorance to have someone like Saxxon treat new players concerns with derision because "well it's not that bad". They made a business decision to say that this game was finished and releasable and so with that there comes higher expectations as to the actual standard of the game and quality of the gameplay. At the moment this game fails on both fronts simply due to constantly encountering game-breaking bugs when trying to do the most basic of tasks. Do not be fooled into thinking that this game is as polished as other games as it really is not, and even now you are paying to participate in an Alpha even if they have removed that from the description. Be prepared to encounter lots of graphical and gameplay issues and also be prepared to submit a lot of bug reports.\n\nThe real sad thing is that most of the bugs I (and my girlfriend) have encountered are things that should have been fixed in early alpha stages and so it disheartens me a lot to think that the developer now believes the game is adequate for release. It points to the fact that either the Developer is not actually taking note of issues and fixing them, or that the majority of players who particpated in the original Alpha didnt actually start over from scratch and build things for themselves and instead joined ready built servers. I have read a lot of forum posts from players who quite clearly just joined a pre-existing server where things were already built and so they skipped the majority of the grass routes "find this and build this" content early on. There really isn't any other explanation for why some of these bugs are still in the game at release.\n\nThere is also a hell of a lot of mis-information on the internet about the actual workings of the game. The Life is Feudal Wiki being one of the main sources as it seems to be rediculously out of date when you try and look things up. This leads you to look for things that it says you need only to later find that you actually don't and that the process has now changed or become more complicated in some fashion. This is very concenring too considering that the company believes that the game was releaseable and yet they can't even be bothered to update their online information source when they make major changes to the game.\n\nI am extremely frustrated and dissapointed by this game simply because the concept in itself is great. I WANT to like this game and I have been forcing myself to play it and to fight through bug after bug to submit the reports to hopefully get them eventually fixed. The problem is that I simply can not morally support a company who force out a turd and then try and tell you that it is chocolate and that it tastes good because someone else's tastes worse. I have read a lot of forum posts in the last week and Saxxon's demeanor has led me to write this honest review. When a company charges people to play an Alpha version of a game, they damn sure need to listen to the feedback they are given and they need to listen to it with a smile as far as I am concerned. We are playing it more to help at this point than for any real enjoyment of our own and so when you read someone dismissing legitimate concerns simply because they can't be bothered to face the reality, it really frustrates me.\n\nRight now in it's current state I do not recommend this game at it's full listing price. If you see it at 50-60% off again (as it was on its launch week) then by all means buy it but do not expect to play it every day unless you are mentally prepared to encounter a lot of bugs. This game is not worth the full price which is a real shame.\n\nI do have hope that eventually they will get the game in a good and playable condition but I am not expecting that to be anytime sooner than 6 months or so from now, maybe even longer. This leaves me very dissapointed that they have considered "releasing" the game as they have. I will edit this review as and when issues become fixed and the game becomes playable and enjoyable but for now I would say save your money and wait for a sale. I still have hope that this game has a good future, but right now that future seems far off and my hope is not as high as it once was.\n\nEDIT 1:- Well my initial review was written at approx the 40 hours of game time mark, and now since I have doubled that and am at approx 85 hours, I figured i'd update my review to show if anything has changed. Sadly, It hasn't. The more I play the more I see issues which should have been fixed months ago. The in game systems such as Herbalism or Animal Taming are rediculously bloated and make the game a tedious grind more so than any other game I have played, and to make matters worse because the developers have relied heavily on Random Number Generators for everything in game it actually leads players to argue at how easy/hard things are to complete. What people forget is that because the game randomly assigns all recipes to you in something like Herbology, what works for you will not work for anyone else and so if you find it easy it is because the game has made it so the most common herbs are the important ones where as for everyone else the important herbs are the most rare. There is no definitive "the game is easy or hard because" simply because the RNG decides that every time you click create character. The RNG's seem to be everywhere too, such as in taming an animal. I have had one boar that would tame after 5 apples, but then another takes over 50. When you are playing the game as a single or co-op player that is a ton of resources to lose just for a single animal, but the problem is that you have no idea how many you will use until you have used them. Animal taming has many other flaws too such as the idea that you have to chase the animal until it tires itself out which again seems to rely on an RNG as to how long you will have to chase it for. Just today myself and my girlfriend had to chase a horse from dusk one day until the following morning in game and at no point did the horse tire out. It just ran and ran and never stopped. Another major issue is the fact that the animals can run straight through anything that would stop you, so they will literally pass through a tree trunk, stone wall or garden fence whilst you have to run around them. For a game that is supposed to be realistic, more and more I see issues that are simply unrealistic.\n\nMore notes can be found in comments section","November 22, 2015","false","145.9"," 744 of 911 people (82%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","82","744","911","39","124"

It has a fleshed out crafting/skill system and on that side of things, it's going in the right direction. But i bought this game and played 600+ hours because i read their website Game Info under   LiF is Like... [lifeisfeudal.com] which STATES:\n\n"LiF is... like Mount&Blade Series in terms of melee, ranged and mounted targetless physics based combat"\n\nSo I've spent a lot of time in this game waiting for the combat to be polished/worked on to actually even have a proper parry/blocking system like they promised. However, after an official reply from the moderators a couple of days ago in the official forums to outcries of people wanting a parry system to be implemented, this is what was stated by the moderator:\n\n"2. We want to go our own way. We want to WEAKEN player reaction and player ping component, by removing directional parrying."\n\nSo basically, if you're a big M&B fan, or even Chivalry/WotR/WotV - you will cringe at the combat in this game like i did. It is only 60% complete which is fine, but their intention is to let this game be a slash-fest using combo's and the first person to lose all their health dies. Does that sound like M&B to you? They have no intention of ever allowing "skilled twitch fighting" to be a part of this game because, and again i quote\n\n"we want to do something new, not just blindly copy some cookie cutting mechanics that some of players got used to and trying to push"\n\nWell i wish they had said that on their website instead of misleading the public.

I woke up on the shore of an island and soon found my place in the world with a small tribe that will one day be called the Southern Veil. We become allies with the neighboring town of the Sweetcottons before we are even able to erect a palisade wall. Soon after we gain these close allies we are rode upon by members of a place called Killian's Keep. They tell us that we must pay them a tax of straw. We refuse and militarize ourselves.\n\nNot soon after the taxes are imposed we erect a wall around our small settlement. I become the town blacksmith and I am known as one of the most skilled blacksmiths of the land. We then begin construction of a wooden keep surrounded by stone walls. Once these walls are complete we are invaded by the Huns. They used our wooden walls as cover from the arrows fired from our stone walls and soon created a ladder over our wall and slaughtered us. This was not the end.\n\nWe grew larger, gained another close ally known as Ciderwood, and began to raid them back. We first struck Killian's Keep, coming in through a weak point in their wall and killing masses of them, then we come back again and again and we successfully slaughter them every time.

This happened twice, until i went with the default character with the name "ILBAsdbasd askdjsjjs" of which the game was much happier to allow.\n\nAnyway; I walked around, there were several frame rate drops that were temporary but nothing bad. A lot of effort has indeed been put into the aesthetic with a much more streamlined UI.\n\nI managed to squeeze in another 5 minutes before:\n"Life is Feudal encountered an error and needs to close down"\n\nMy breif edit and response to Saxxon is as follows.\n\nI was highly surprised before even starting the game that you made the decision to leave Early Access. The game runs smoother, i did notice.. However i was able to play even LESS of your game than i was back in June.\nRegarding the comment about my issues being with the servers and "not the game itself".\nI can't understand how that salvages anything. The game is only accessible through these servers, especially for new players.\nHowever you are correct and many of the issues i originally encountered have been fixed.\nBut if i bought this game now, in "release version" and was unable to play due to the crash i wouldn't really give a flying **** about mining a tunnel.\n\n************************************\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nAfter spending nearly 40 hours trying to get myself started on this game (over the course of 2015) i've just had to give up!\n\nHere's one example. To build a warehouse to store anything, you need a ton of metal ingots. To get ingots, you need to mine. However, after joining many servers hoping to find a stable playing environment (some servers don't load, others you get kicked for not speaking their native language) i was banned for simply mining.\nTurns out mining for metal causes lag for the rest of the server, who knew? So after finally finding another stable server, speaking my native language, i asked what the 'work-around' was for gathering metal. The response was "An admin needs to build an 'infinite pile' for you". However, the admin of this server was sick and wouldn't be on for a month, poor guy. You won't be able to continue with your mining skill progression either, unless an admin cheats this for you.\n\nEventually, i got my "infinite pile" of resources and my mining skill was boosted for me. At this point, i felt like i had cheated the game. The last few hours of my time with Life is Feudal felt cheap, cheesed.. And upon rejoining the server after a little over a day, everything i'd built was on fire. This was due to the decay system that's been introduced to remove trash. I had spent hours trying to build my house and a warehouse, which was now defined by the game as 'trash'.\n\nAll in all, if you are very lucky and find a stable server and don't mind cheating the game for resources, then you'll probably enjoy it. Just be aware about inviting a friend to purchase the game too, as they might not even be able to join the same servers as you.\n\nFor me, i won't be revisiting Life is Feudal until these game breaking flaws are resolved.\n\n\n----------------\nOn a side note "This Early Access game is not complete and [may or may not change further]"\nShouldn't this be illegal? I mean, everyone knows early access is a big cash cow for most devs, as well as Steam..\nYet a good analogy would be to pay for a 3 course meal at a restaurant, sit down & receive your starter but nothing else.\n\nMaybe i'm just hungry.","June 7, 2015","false","42.6"," 639 of 798 people (80%) found this review helpful 105 people found this review funny","80","639","798","105","35"

The game promised group oriented combat and large group vs large group sieges to claim land and castles of such grand scale that it truly did blow everything else out of the water, including the Persistent World mod for Mount and Blade.\n\nAfter the game's EA release here on steam it was clear that they were completely derailing from their original intent of the MMO, and sought to make some extra cash. That's wonderful and all, but the simple fact that they openly said, " We're looking to fund LiF:MMO with all the money we earn from LiF:YO..." makes this game dangle ever so slightly over the toilet that snaps at it with hungry jaws.\n\nThe marketing idea is flawed, fine, maybe the game is good enough to overcompensate.\n\nLet's look at some of the keystones for the game:\n\nBuilt with Torque 3D ( HEAVILY modified)- While this engine looks decent enough, it's not even capable of handing a 16 player server with minimal terraforming, the rigging is so clunky that most of the hit boxes actually twist with the character's movement, which translates into mangled hitboxes that are impossible to land hits on when you can clearly see the head of your hammer or the blade of your sword going through the body of the other player.\n\nBi Weekly Updates- While the updates seem frequent enough, the content that is updated is more of a "hotfix" nature and not an actual Update to the game or its content.\n\nDeveloper presence- The presence of the Devs is definetly felt, they seem to be making a good bit of appearances on the forums both in Steam and in their own bug tracker. This could be both bad and good, as the more time they spent scrolling through the forums.. the less time they spent fixing the heavily modified game engine that requires a lot of love due to the fact that the engine is not designed for such a game, even with modding... it's limitations are clearly visible.\n\nTerraforming- The trailer made it look sweet right? Well... unless you dig a tunnel in a straight line then you need to expect gapping holes in the world that will cause you to fall beneath the playerworld and into a vast underground sea. The other side of terraforming, which doesn't involve mining, is almost a death sentence to the server. Get a group of friends to terraform your lands so you can properly build your kingdom and you'll increase the time it takes to load into a server by 10-30 minutes. The more you change, the longer it takes for the server to give you the files as it seems to be replacing ALL the local files with modded files from the server.\n\nBuilding- You can't do it alone unless you crank up the skill cap and become the God of All Skills. The only way to enjoy the game is to do so with atleast 3+ friends on a server that has skillcap/harvesting/growthtime all cranked up, and even then it will take days to complete small projects.\n\nOnline play- I can only consider this an option if I'm part of a private server, as the game does little to nothing to stop griefing. Between folks digging unrepairable tunnels throughout your village, to people deconstructing your homes and putting unremoveable campfires in their wake. This game's Troll factor reaches that of RUST, minus the hacking... they did a good job of preventing that by keeping ALL files server sided.\n\nServers- So, this is the fun part. Even a high end server can barely run this game without hourly spikes of lag that have been dubbed, " Morning lag" due to the obsurb amount of trees and plant growth that all require 2-4 calls to the database before updating. Each time you change a value, the client requests information from the database and the database requests information from the client... multiple times for the same change.\n\nInventory- If you have OCD, step away. The inventory bags are nothing more than visual vomit. You COULD take an hour to organize the herbalist bag of yours... but your friend will still see visual vomit when he opens it, due to all inventory placement being clientsided.\n\n\n\nThere are countless other issues that arise when you talk about the keystone features of the game, and I understand it's an embryotic alpha, damn near a tech demo, BUT.... the icing on this wonderful cake is the fact that the game doesn't properly used your video drivers as NONE of the video display adapter profiles are implemented into the game yet... want some more sweetness? a 16gb rig still gets  "Out of Memory" errors from playing the game for less than 5 minutes.\n\n\n\nLast but not least, the bug tracker for this game is a mile and a half long, and seems to be at a stand still.\n\n\nOverall, 2/10 but 7/10 when played with friends.\nWould not recommend.\nThis is my first review, enjoy.","November 2, 2014","false","133.7"," 452 of 564 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","452","564","0","22"

I started by spawning near a lake, I found a person fishing by the lake fishing, I asked him whether I could help, so he got food and I started making tools and gathering some logs to cut. 2 days later we now have a small village with 10 or so people contributing in different professions, we have armour and weapons on the way, a general, mayor and we still have so much more to do. This game is honestly amazing, you could see it at a first person age of empires from the villager’s perspective? Or even a Minecraft / mount and blade sandbox. Honestly, it's worth the buy the alpha is steady & this game is proving more and more amazing for the future.\n\n","September 22, 2014","true","49.8"," 284 of 342 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","284","342","0","7"

They play games like ARK, DayZ, 7 days to die and Minecraft, and expect a 'medieval survival/builder sandbox' game to be comparable.  What they don't realize, is that they're idiots.\n\nRecent review I read:  "I logged in for 2 minutes, saw the game sucks and got refunded".\n\nThis is the mindset for why this game has mixed reviews, NOT because the game deserves mixed reviews.\n\nLife is Feudal is a 'realistic' survival builder, which is something these kids don't understand, because none of their games are realistic.  To them, realism is finding a brand new machine gun in a box, or building a base in 30 minutes, or punching a dinosaur unconscious so they can tame it with berries, and that my friends is the grotesque standard these dumb kids are comparing this game to.  Don't listen.\n\nThis game is it's own genre, and it can't be compared to anything else.  Everything takes time in this game.  It will take you days to build your first house, and weeks to build a settlement.  And THAT is why this game has the GREATEST community I have ever seen in an online game.  This game is all about teamwork... not the solo game experience.\n\nAnd just so people know what this game is being developed for... this version of the game is the groundwork for an MMO version, where a much larger world will be occupied by thousands of players.  This is by far the greatest survival/builder game I have ever played, with the best community I've ever played with.  Thank you 'Life is Feudal' developement team for creating a game for adults that scares off those with attention deficits.","October 6, 2015","true","366.8"," 475 of 596 people (80%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","80","475","596","60","35"

The community fixed lot of the optimization problems within days (or maybe even hours), when game was released for early-access.

For those of you that remember it, it's VERY akin to the old Star Wars Galaxies (pre NGE)\n\nPro's:\n-Complex Crafting system.\n-Fantastic system to socialize, as it is impossible to pick up every skill\n-Complex skil system that allows you to try new things, grow into new skills, and forget them if you don't like them.\n-Fantastic challenge rating for skills: Easy to pick up, time consuming to master. You can grow, loot, and craft high quality materials.\n-Great graphics. Really nice visuals on higher settings.\n-Terraforming: Push over minecraft, you can literally level landscapes, dig siege tunnels, and build ramps. Or just flatten terrain so you can build a city!\n-City building: Akin to SWG, you can drop down pre-generated structures, tools, build roads, claim ownership.\n-Nothing is worth doing that doesn't take time to do: This whole game takes time. It's not a fast paced, get your guns in a day and rule the world. BUT... it is fantastic, and well conceptually well designed.\n\nPro&Con:\n-This is an MMO Sandbox. It is what you, and others make out of it. If you want to be a trader or bar keep, you can actually craft resources, make food, sell high quality foods, trade for better resources, and even pray for absolution from your sins. However, for every peaceful choice you make, someone out there will want to be a rampaging psychopath that will run into your shop and wreak everything...\n\nCons:\n-Right-click-simulator: The game is fantastically in-deptch, but in order to make it EASY to manage, it uses a right-click system. Where you end up openning that menu... A LOT.\n-It doesn't like it when you alt+tab. Seems to work better on windows 10.\n\nTLDR:\nThis game is a fantastic open world complex to the likes of SWG Original Release. It's got a deep crafting system and really encourages social play. So build your character, find new people, and start carving up your plot of land! Because this IS the sandbox game you've been looking for!","November 17, 2015","true","702.7"," 262 of 319 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","262","319","19","7"

Deleting ANY forum thread on steam that remotely mentions their overpriced early release game, Or, The fact that they delete any thread that draws attention to a negative point about the game should be a red flag.\n\nNotice the 10/10 review from HotRise here on metacritic?\n\nGo check out the life is feudal website and notice how similar their 'selling points' are.\nHotRise's review has no ACTUAL cons. This is a typical market tactic. Look constructive and modest, yet, have no ACTUAL downside.\n\nThe developers aren't well known. And while this DOES NOT mean they shouldn't be trusted, it DOES mean to be careful.\nHow do we do this?\nBy monitoring their "First impression practises"\n\nI have seen a video from AffectiveGamers/DecryptedGaming on steam that he did himself that sums them up very well if you want to see this video click the link http://encryptgames.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/too-much-power-for-steam-developers/\n\nWhat are they?\n-Overpriced $40 early-release (very unfinished) game. (When compared to Rust and DayZ both having big names behind them, lots of trust, and a less expensive early release product)\n\n-Lack of professionalism Re: not being able to take consumer criticism, and instead deleting any sign of it. (This is propaganda)\n\n-The developers don't seem to have a decent grasp on marketing and sales.\nAnd think about this.\nIt is a scary thought that a bunch of people who may or may not be able to create a game will pull out random figures of "we need $200,000 for making the game" without being able to tell you where the money will be spent and why.\n\nA bunch of people who don't understand market trends and values and will charge twice what other more well-established companies charge for an Early Release game without understanding that as an upstart company, where there has been no established trust, that they need to charge less to sell more.\n\nAnd this will potentially create more revenue, but, DEFINITELY generate a larger "copies sold" statistic. Which in of itself, creates more trusted statistics for further backing/sponsorship/sales.\n\nThis game may be great. But right now, the developers seem to be a bunch of guys who haven't much idea about business.\nMaybe they can design a game. But it takes more than that to be successful.\n\nToo scared to pay $40 and watch the company shut-down so I could just make a few people rich. As has happened with 'companies' in the past.\nWhen and if the "company" starts acting more professional and less shady/disrespectful to their consumer-base, I will re-do my review.\n\nUntil then, I will have a close eye on them. And also warn others to not throw $40 down the tube to a company who's LEAD DESIGNER has doubts about the probability of success.\n\n\nEdit:\nTo the people that are saying that I am wrong I may be BUT these are my 2 cents I am tentively watching this game as I LOVE the idea. Ever since I started gaming I drempt of this game. To the developers I hope you guys keep with the development of this game, you guys are definetly on too something here! Also as the Lead developer stated in the comments he has gained faith with all those that have bought this game for the generous fee of 40 dollars, this is reassuring and I am glad he stated that.\n\nAll in all I am excited to see where this goes and ill be happily playing every update while updating this review.\n\nThere is nothing "butthurt" about my review I am just warning people what I have seen and observed. When someone makes a game you dont critique the game you critique them in a way. That is THEIR hard work and artwork. I like to review the developers of games because you can really see their motives and if they have a true passion for the game because when it comes down to it its not about the money when your making a game (it does help dont get me wrong) but you have to be intrested in the game also it is just like studying in college for your major. If you dont like the subject you dont want to study.\n\nI hope you guys understand I am not "butthurt" about the game or the developers. I am excited for the game but in its current state it is a bit scary for "investors" to slap down 40 dollars for a game that may not live up to 40 dollars that is all.\n\nAll in all again I am excited to see where this game goes and I wish everyone the best.\n\n-Tanker","September 21, 2014","false","16.6"," 1,005 of 1,332 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","005","1","0","99"

But this one I owe a review to.\n\nFirst off, most of all the negative reviews are from players that have not put in the time that is required to enjoy this game. It's really sad that a lot of the negative reviews have given this game a Mixed review status. I have seen one review 0.4 hours invested and they said the controls are broken....\n\nSo before you start playing this game, please go to youtube and search for LiF Basics 101. You will learn A LOT of invaluable information. There is a learning curve to this game and you really never stop learning simply because there are a TON of details about what's going on that you will discover. This will make you more valuable to the community of players which is I believe what this game is about. Playing with others!\n\nWith that out of the way, this game is amazing. They have come along way since the beginning. The graphics are fantastic. (When you start the game is automatically on low settings you need to adjust it!) Sure, just like every single game out there, room for improvement, is a valid complaint. But in the end, this is one of the best sandbox games out right now.\n\nHard work pays off in this game. It will take some time to gather, build, level your way to what you envision. The reward is great once your done. Do not come into this game thinking that you can just gather a ton of stuff and instantly build stuff. It will not happen. (Unless you take the time to find a server that has high leveling etc.) You most likely WILL need help to do things. It is the way this game is supposed to be played, get it in your head. Sure you could play solo.... But it's going to be a long road.\n\nTLDR:\n\nGritty, grindy, sandbox that will have you showing off what you build and accomplish to your community and friends. Excellent graphics, skill system, crafting and just plain fun if you put in the time. Highly recommended if you like the huge reward behind the grind!","August 23, 2015","true","960.7"," 114 of 132 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","114","132","2","7"

First of it all: It's still an alpha, but the most developed one I've ever played. Combine Minecraft with War of the Roses, and you got your game. The game is, although some mechanics are highly repetetive, very addicting. It's not a game for a few hours a month and without the necessary endurance you will give up soon. If you like crafting, fighting and role-playing with other human beings, then get it and check it out. Otherwise: Don't.\n\nOn the positive side you got very good graphics, a great variety of armor and weapons you can choose from and a crafting system that highly supports team gaming. You got a lot of different building, the map is large enough for 64 players and every 2-3 weeks comes an update. The sound is ok, as long as you don't put tanning tubs aside your house..\nThe skill system is fair and interesting, because on most servers you can only skill 1-2 skilltrees to the max, and it is possible to deskill every time. It is like in Skyrim: With doing certain things, you get better at doing so and with rising skill level there are some other options you unlock. The fighting system is a bit sloppy, but also very detailed. For example: The damage you get from an opponent is the result of the weapon you use, the skill of your weapon, the armorskill of your enemy, the location of the hitbox where you hit and if your enemy is defending with a shield or not. Conclusion: Good mechanics, very high potential overall.\n\nOn the bad side you have no game-goals, quests or whatever. Your experience with the game will highly depend on the server you play on, considering if your serveradmins are fair or not and how other players fashion their role on the server. The first time, of course, you will be motivated by building your town with others and learn how to work, but after your village or castle is built, you have no other option then to fight and roleplay.\n\nConsidering this, there are also some broken mechanics that must be fixed soon: Since every digged tunnel on the server delays the login time of the players, it is impossible to run a 64 player server over a long time without getting a slow server. Some players on my server have login times beyond 6 or 7 minutes, and when you come to that point it will be extremly hard to get new players to join your server. Others may quit due to this and.. you get the idea, over a longer time your server will get more and more abandoned. There are some fixes to this, but nothing official is implemented yet, a server wipe is in most cases the only solution to get a fresh and playable server.\n\nAnother problem is the erasing of buildings: Once built, you cannot deconstruct anything without admin help. This is also highly annoying, because you have to plan really good before building your own town.\n\nSo, my conclusion: Don't start this game alone, pick one or two of your friends, start an own server to test things until you feel ready to play on a bigger server. Try to get to a server with active and friendly admins. You may wait until the tunnel-digging is fixed, but if you like crafting & boxing bears, then give it a try.","January 15, 2015","true","437.6"," 96 of 108 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","96","108","4","0"

For now it's all it is though. I just wish there was a middle thumb for "Buy at your own risk." But there isn't. For now I wouldn't recommend it it's still in early access and even if it's supposed to come out this year... I doubt it. there's really too much work to be done in optimization and content.\n\nDepending on the server you choose, you will be able to top your level in either a day or a month. Same goes for construction, some servers make it easy and fast, on other you will definetly feel the grind. Personally, i prefer the later it makes it more realistic, you're actually gonna need workers to build a basic town. Combat is... Well hard to explain. Skill based ? Compared to other similar titles it fairs pretty well but you're probably just gonna get an arrow between your eyes before you even know you're in a fight. Crafting is mediocre just grind grind grind and manage your stuff in a very messy inventory. Stuff just goes everywhere in there, if you're gathering for a while you open your inventory and it looks like someone took your bag and just smashed it against a couple of rocks before giving it back.\n\nSo... If you're looking for a medieval fighting melee arena look elsewhere because this game is SLOW and the fighting is a really small part unless you're a thief (And usually you have a lot of rules to follow or else you will get kicked from the server) If you're looking for an historical medieval life simulator... With all the work and hardships, you're probably at the right place. I wouldn't recommend to buy it for now. I know devs need money to develop the game but at this state it's not worth 1/2 the asking price...","June 4, 2015","false","115.0"," 284 of 376 people (76%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","76","284","376","18","3"

A very interesting game but...\n\nKeeping in mind that it is just a pre Alpha and very buggy I will limit my comments to gameplay and not stability and such.\n\nThe world is detailed and beautiful.  The crafting system is deep and satisfying.  As many others have said it can be a bit grindy but not in a bad way.  I felt a real sense of accomplishment when I built my first shack and began setting up my first base of operations.\n\nJust as I felt I was getting somewhere a 12 year old punk ran up to me, called my mother a bad name and smacked me with a shovel knocking me out and taking all of my hard won stuff.\n\nI tried three different servers over a few weeks and the results were the same.  Just when you feel you are getting somewhere some  rag wearing peasants show up, kill you for sport and take all your stuff, over and over.  Currently, there is no way to protect yourself from being completed looted until you can build a warehouse which takes a significant amount of skill accumulation and materials.  If you don't log in to the server for a few days even those locked items can be freely looted by anyone.\n\nThe mantra is "Life is Feudal it is supposed to be tough." Well, feudal life was not full of phsycopathic 12 year olds that kill and loot you for sport with no repercussions.  At the moment the 'penalties' for kiling players are largely ineffective and once you acquire something worth having you can expect to be killed/robbed every few hours of gameplay.\n\nIf you can get on a server when it first starts you will have a huge technology advantage over anyone that comes later and if you can make friends and work together you will be alright.  If you are a latecomer then God help you.  You will be farmed over and over.  The player turnover on every server I have played is very high and the servers quickly become full of empty shacks and half built structures.  No wonder most the servers are dead or go through frequent wipes.\n\nI really want to love this game.  There is a ton going for it  but the constant ganking/zerging/ glitching (its in alpha, lots of glitches) make the game very frustrating.    I give the game a  MAYBE because it could be great but it is not at the moment.  And $40 to play test an unfinished game is more than a little too pricey.","February 2, 2015","true","219.6"," 102 of 117 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","102","117","12","0"

I watched some review videos, and LIF caught my eye as something I would be into –after all, who doesn’t want to be a peasant and eek out an existence in a bleak wilderness setting? As long as my aspirations of Knighthood remained viable, there should be reason for optimism…or so I told myself.\n\nI hit the server with my buddy, Drek Stonebrow, and after several futile attempts to find each other, we finally hooked up –two disheveled figures in rags, hugging each other atop a bluff as night settled in. We marched to a location Drek had noticed on his way to me, and we settled in under the stars with our newly fashioned sleeping mats.\n\nOn the first day we spent several (Real) hours crafting primitive tools and experimenting with them. Yup this new shovel will lower and raise the terrain…oh wow, did I just spend 2 hours digging a ditch for the fun of it? Yes. That only took the crafting of five shovels.  Hey, how about this axe? It does chop down trees…oops, broke that too. Oh well no worries, I’ll quickly break off a few branches from this nearby oak, rustle up some plant fibers, tie it all in to this shapely piece of flint I discovered, and voila, I’ll have a new axe to play with.\n\nAnd although I know these activities aren’t for everyone, I found it thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nOver the next few days we hammered out several long sessions where we:\n1. Learned to fish and hunt\n2.  Built ourselves peasant hovels\n3. Gathered stone to pave a small road\n4. Raided our neighbors for their goods at night\n5. Whistled peasant tunes and looked at our feet as a Knight in full plate came to stare down upon us from his mount and enquired about recent robberies\n6. Created a guild and managed to talk three other friends into purchasing the game so that we could keep the Knight off our backs (Shout out to: Thulgar, Moe Poon, and Fung U)\n7. Booted one of our friends from our guild for turning on us -he now has his own property. We don’t ask how he keeps the Knight away, and we don’t want to know …on a side note we should have been suspicious with a name like Fung U\n8. Chopped wood, dragged wood , and piled wood for 20hrs (real …agonizing…hours). The pain of this was offset by the discovery of each craftable item we produced. Oh the look of pride on Drek’s face when he finally had his forge up and running.\n\nAnd then it all came to a crash two days ago with the release of a new update. For whatever reason, the server we were playing on hasn’t been online since. Fung and I tried to entertain ourselves by creating new characters and raiding on several other servers, but after numerous bans, we are left scratching our heads and feeling like we have been ousted from our homeland.\n\nWith nothing to do but start on a new server (Or create our own) we are left with the impression that Life is indeed futile. Despite the somewhat bad taste in our mouths, Drek remains optimistic as he claps me on the back and says:  “Damned if I am giving up. Somewhere out there, a knight is looking for a peasant to bully.”\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nWe made our own server.

Woah.\nEdit: 300+ hours in.  Still great.\n\nI'm writing this review because some negative reviews led to me almost not buying it.  I am sincerely glad that I did.  This is the game that I've always wanted.\n\nLet me tell you about my first night on LiF.  I logged into an RP server and was almost  instantly greeted by experienced players who were not only willing to help me with every question that I had - but also fillled me in on all the political happenings that were revelant to that evening.  the community, if nothing else, makes this game worth playing.\n\nBefore I knew it, they outfitted me with a basic sling and some sling ammo and I was marching off to battle.  We arrived through the woods to a small fort in the north which seemed relatively empty - I was disappointed at first: This was it?  Little did we know that the enemy was crouching behind their walls equipped with heavy plated armor and bowmen galore.  After about 20 minutes, two concussions, an arrow through the chest, and general astoundment that I was still alive - I heard that the enemy king was knocked unconscious and his nobles lay dead around him.  Opposed to killing the enemy king, our king inisisted that we let him regain consciousness so he could role play his reaction to the embarassing defeat.\n\nWhile waiting patiently around him, celebrating our clear victory, we were ambushed by almost a dozen of the fallen king's allies from the west.  They streamed in behind us and we fled with our tails behind our legs.  By the time we hobbled back home, bloodied and broken, we had only lost one ally - a clear victory if you ask me!\n\nSince then, peace has been negotiated and I've decided to make a pacifist character. - dedicating  my time to building a religious school on top of a mountain.  That's the best part of this game, you can literally do whatever you want.  Want to be a cook? Someone needs you in their guild.  Want to be a warrior? Someone wants you for their realm.  Want to dedicate your time to stacking wood, mining deep into a mountain, watching wheat grow? Well, you're probably going to have to do it anyway.\n\nAdmittedly, I've only been playing LiF for 15 hours (and that is not much for this game!) but i felt like it was my duty to defend it at least a little bit.\n\nYes this game is still in development, yes there are many features that haven't been implemented yet.  But I promise you that if you connect with the right people in-game then its not something you will regret contributing to.  There's a steep learning curve but once you get a hang of it everythings really intuitive and well thought out.  I can't wait for final release.","June 11, 2015","true","838.1"," 100 of 116 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","100","116","9","0"

It's a nice medieval game full of crafting and adventuring, although, here's where you'll have to be patient: You could work on getting all of your stuff built and grown for 100 hours and some random people could come over, do something stupid, and then all of a sudden BAM. You're back at hour 1 again. The server could restart too, and BAM. You're literally at hour 1 again. You can't just spend 30 minutes to build stones walls and gates around your little village, no no... It can take about 10 hours to finish of none stop gathering. Oh and is there a little clift that you need to expand to get more land? No problem, as long as you got a couple of weeks of nonstop playing, then you'll get about a couple feet of land out of it for sure! And then there's the fact that you'll most likely be told that the server will restart in a month or so right after you're done. So if you got a lot of time on your hands and you have the patience to start all over again, even if you spent 300 hours on it, then here's a game for you!\n\n(sorry, I tried to write it positive, but I wrote this right after a rage quit so.. All I'm saying is that you should maybe wait until the game's finished so there aren't as many server restarts.

( need a nice gpu tho... I have gtx 980ti )\nMusic is very medievally.\nCombat is slow paced which is a good thing ( meaning people dont warp around and it aint a mad crazy swinging fit of spinning forward and backward not knowing if your hitting ur enemy i.e )\nCrafting is well thought out. A nice balance of grind/reward ( IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU SELECT THE RIGHT SERVER FOR YOUR TASTES. Certain servers will have skill gains faster)\nIts a great medieval Simulation.\n\nCons\nSTEEP LEARNING CURVE ( YOUR FIRST ACT SHOULD BE WATCHING YOUTUBE TUTORIALS and the INGAME HELP MENU)\nA big buggy still\nSkill gain and crafting can be and will be a bit tedius. Thats why i recommend a server of AT LEAST 5.0x skill gain. And at least 1000 skills points so you dont have to locate 10 other people to help you build items. ( just my preference , some people might like having to haggle and deal with people all the time)\nSometimes the game CTDs.\n\nOverall ... I love the game.

This game is one of the very few honest to god hardcore games I have ever played (You can attribute this to a lot of the negative reviews).  Playing solo is possible on modded servers, but if you want the REAL LiF experience by playing on vanilla, you WILL need a group of people.  This is boderline non-negotionable, this is where a lot of new players make a mistake and thus ruin the experience for themselves.\n\nNow to get on to actually reviewing it...Let me start off by critiquing it.  The game does have some honest issues.  Animations are stiff and unnatural (Which normally wouldn't be a huge issue, but this effects combat so I have to point it out), game does have some performance issues, and can be VERY tedius.\n\nBut onto why I recommend the game, even though the game has it's own set of problems and isn't exactly perfect I still have to give this game a big thumbs up on it's core design philosophy.  If you enjoy a game that punishes you, a game that is unforgiving, but pays out when you work your ♥♥♥ off to achieve something....This game feeds this desire better than no other in my experience.  End game isn't achieved with ease.  It takes the combined efforts of you and your group working hard to achieve your goals, which gives you a sense of satisfaction I have never felt in a game before.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you are the type of player who can't and won't dedicate all their free time to a game, a player who wants things handed to them on a silver platter, or a player who just might not have the time in their lives to play this game.....Please don't buy this game, the game wasn't made for you to begin with.  But if you are like me, someone who enjoys the feeling of putting in hours of work and grinding into a game to accomplish things other players don't have the stomach for, this game is meant for you.","December 26, 2015","true","68.4"," 91 of 106 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","91","106","11","4"

This is not pre-alpha software, this is in the developer unit testing stage.   In a few months of hard development I think this game could be something pretty awesome but at this stage I wouldn't recommend spending your money to assist the deveopers testing their code.\n\nThe user interface is clunky at best, the game is completely unforgiving but also gives no assistance to the player, the crafting lines, although intricate, make no sense and EVERYTHING takes way too long.   I continually get a deadlock error that crashes the game and then when I trie to restart it tells me to wait for the game to close.  It takes 5 minutes for the game to close so I can go back in and find I lost my last few actions.\n\nMyself, I can't sit and play a game that tries to mask frustration as entertainment.  For example, wolves that are nearly unkillable to a brand new player, but spawn in your chosen settlement area, When you die you loose everything plus stats and skills.  To top that off you spawn in one of several points around the island and you have to start all over again, trying to make it back to your grave.  When you arrive there you are killed again by the same wolf.\n\nI don't necessarily disagree with the concept of requiring multiple player/crafters to progress.  But to be able to make a steel sickle to harvest (yes i know you can use a flint one) you must have a prospector/miner/smelter/forger of appropriate level.  But you also need to have flux to make steel and to make flux you have to have an alchemist.  But for the alchemist to have a better chance of finding herbs they have to have ... you guessed it ... a steel sickle.\n\nFrustrations like this make the game feel like the developers making it are figuring things out as they go.   I don't believe it is unreasonable to expect a developer to have figured out how to fill in a tunnel while they were figuring out how to dig one.\n\nI don't recommend this game at this point, however, in 6 to 9 months it might be playable.","October 17, 2014","false","96.7"," 126 of 162 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","126","162","0","2"

You will notice that most of the negative reviews have less than 100 hours in game. Many of which hardly spent more than 10 hours. A lot of the sudden negativity came since the game when on sale and all the kids bought it.\n\nI am not going to lie, to truly unlock the fun in this game you will need to be dedicated. This isn't a game that you play a few hours and be done with it. You also need to make friends or have friends play with you, as this game was not designed to be played solo.\n\nMake sure that if you intend to purchase this game that you have a decent computer. It is graphic and so it takes a lot of power.\n\nThe devs have been very active in releasing updates at least once a month. Sometimes with a minor patch in between because of some new bugs that suddenly appeared. In each update, they keep releasing new features.\n\nAs to the price of early access. To be honest I have seen a lot of early access games that aren't nearly as playable at this game. In fact I would dare to call this game LATE ALPHA as it has a lot of features already implemented and the devs do a pretty good job at testing before releasing so running into game breaking bugs is rare. I did purchase this game when it was on sale, however now knowing what I know and having played it a lot. I wouldnn't have mind paying $40 for this game.\n\nAS I STATED BEFORE. This game isn't for everyone. If you plan to play solo? Don't get it. If you don't plan to be dedicated? Don't get it. If you don't like Medieval time settings?

You'll be able to build villages, farms, castles, craft armor and weapons. And not to mention - kill people with those crafted weapons. There's an arsenal of weapons waiting to be crafted, both ranged and melee, but not all of them are implemented yet.\n\nThe game is still in alpha but you can already get a feeling of what the released game will become. It can sort of be described as a mix between Wurm Online in gameplay, and Rust with it's graphics. There's a couple crucial bugs at this point (for example the server browser freeze) and the servers go down alot, but once you get on a server and start playing there's hardly any bugs bothering you - which is pretty impressive for a alpha build these days.\n\nOne thing that's important to mention though, is that this is not really a singleplayer/solo game, you would want to gather your friends or join someone else in-game when you set out to build those small, big and gigantic settlements. And you and your friends will need alot of patience in the process of building your land and skills. The world is available for you to shape and form as you like, but like the real world it's going to take lots of time to shape it.\n\nI would definetly recommend buying the game for the sandbox fans out there, but there's no rush in doing so.

The game has a very steep learning curve. Much of it does not make sense at the outset. It is not intuitive and you will not enjoy the time you lose learning hard lessons - for example, that you need to figure out how to make a primitive hammer in order to make a blacksmiths hammer to make other things - oh, and that same hammer is sitting next to the forge thingee but that's just stickering, you can't use it.. Oh - and you can't even use the forge until you learn how to mine, etc.\n\nLooking at the negative reviews, it looks like most of those people did not get past this point. If you want fun and whimsical out of the box then stop reading now. If you're looking for something gritty and unique, keep reading.\n\nOnce you are past the learning curve and get confident with the interface, it really opens up. There's no AI enemies. Just people. People will be friend or foe based on how you treat them and how you respond to their treatment. People will lie and cheat, People will steal from you and take your hard work. People will break or ignore the rules to shortcut themselves at others expense. People will bully you and exploit weakness.\n\nPeople will also believe in you. You will meet people. You will trust them and in turn they will trust you. You will build bonds and with those bonds grind out amazing things that you never thought possible. You will be there for them and they will be there for you.\n\nYou will get addicted. You will find yourself staying up way too late or getting up way to early to care for what you've made in some foolish video game you almost didn't figure out.\n\nYou will be afraid. Someone you do not know will suddenly approach you and your heart will race as you struggle to figure out what to do. Those that make is this far are all experts - skill counts for little advantage and all that will matter is how you've treated friend and foe.\n\nIt's just like life; it's what you make it.

We waited until release, hoping for a reasonably finished game, just to get an alpha. Anyone who played their "alpha" says that what was released, is NOT what they had been playing for over a year. The game feels, and plays, like an alpha because it was never tested by players, not in it's current state. We are all now effectively forced alpha testers for this build.\n\nI was really excited to get to play from what I saw pre launch, and I am doing my best to be patient and hope they fix things, but it is very frustrating being in an alpha, and having to do numerous bug reports a day, when you were expecting a finished game where you could just play. It is a great concept, and something I have wanted in a game for years, but I am struggling to love it.\n\nEDIT: More than 200 hours in now, 150+ since my first review, and nothing is looking any better. I spend a ton of time submitting bug reports, most of which just get closed with no response. Those they haven't closed, they ask a question, I answer, and then nothing.\n\nEdit: More than 300 hours testing now. game still crashes constantly. Not a single update for weeks, despite numerous bug reports a day. Most bug reports are just closed, no explanation. Testing continues as I have yet to even get around to making more than 6 buildings in 300 hours of play, and one of them, the sawmill, still does nothing in the game. I will continue to test, bug report, and update this review. I am hoping things will get better.\n\nEdit: 375 hours of play. Finally a 124 mb update. I was hoping for big fixes, but it appears all they did was some UI changes and fixed what was causing the crashes. Animals still run through buildings, and suicide in the water. The sawmill still does nothing. There are still rifts opening up in the map. Things built by one player, often can't be seen by others. Items built still turn back into signs and become unusable until you relog. When mining the camera still looks through walls and ceilings. The list goes on and on. All of my bug reports have just been closed, so I am giving up on even doing them anymore. I just stopped playing until this update came out, played a few days to test (25 hours), and now I guess I will just wait for the next one.\n\nEdit: 3/14/2016 After 3 months of not playing, waiting for them to fix things, I decided to play again. None of my saved worlds would work, so I have had to start completely over. I will update once I have some time to test. So far, I have noticed that instead of fixing the sawmill, they seem to have removed it entirely, as I couldn't find it to build and test.\n\nEdit: 3/16/16 Well, with having to start from scratch again, testing is going slow. Doing anything solo takes hours. I have only managed to get anywhere in GM mode. I hate playing in GM mode, but for the sake of testing in a resonable amout if time, it is required.\n\nWhile crashes seem to have been fixed, and many "graphical and decorative" things have been added and improved, I have yet to see much else. Due to the fact that grass still comes up through floors if you just level the ground, I have to lay 2 layers of rock down to get rid of the grass before I even build. This is one of many things that makes building take forever. I am trying to get buildings down so I can test taming and such. I have discovered that praying still spawns you up in the air above your house and drops you on it, You slide down and hit the ground and have to wait for your toon to stand back up.\n\nEdit : 3/17/16 After 5 hours of work, I have gotten my character done with finding and sorting all the herbs. I ended up with 11 possible flux plants, much better then the 8 max I had before. Thanks to the addition of herb gardens, once you know what herbs you can use for flux, you can grow more, instead of having to spend hours searching for them. While flux is still used in insane quantities, and for unrealistic things, like mortar, at least now you can grow the herbs you need to make it. It use to take days to get enough flux for one building, now it takes a reasonable amount of time.\n\nOne major bug that is still there, even after all these months, is that items you have built, like chests and wagons, will randomly turn back into signs. Only way to fix it is to restart the server. Restarting the server also causes your herbs to stop growing and you have to restart them. Testing continues.\n\nEdit: 3/22/16 Well I still can't figure out the weather/seasons/day and night schedule in this game. 2 days ago it was spring, blooms on the apple trees and all. I log in today and it is night, and there is snow everywhere. Now 3 hours after I logged in, it is still pitch black night (no way to sleep through the night either) and now I can hear the sound of rain. I had to mess with video setting to actually be able to see the rain (it doesn't show on low, medium, or ultra, only high). The rain doesn't look very good, looks more like elongated snow, but sounds cool. It's not melting the snow I can see, so not sure if it is actually suppose to be snow? I have no idea when daylight will happen so I can see if the trees are still in bloom. I am just stumbling around in the dark, trying to get some stuff built, hoping to see daylight at some point.\n\nAfter playing for 7 hours today, I am giving up on the game again for a while. I am tired of having to log out and reload, which can take qrite a while, because things I have built turn back into signs and become unusable.Trying to tame is still a pain. Animals can still run through solid objects as you are trying to tame, or run from them. Sows, if anywhere near water, run straigt to it and suicide. It is stupid that they die in the water, as pigs can swim in real life. If the water gets slightly over the head of anything in the game, it dies, including players.\n\nI had 3 wolves randomly spawn right next to where I have been leveling to build. They spawned nearly on top of me. I ran for my house and got in and closed the door. The wolves just came through the wall, and kiled me. I respwned and used the pray skill to get back to my house, and the wolves just killed me again. I was respawned on a little island, and died again trying to get to the mainland because the water went over my head. I was respwned again and worked my way back across the map to see if the wolves were still in my house and they were. I guess now I have to hope they despawn, or make a new settlement elsewhere. I am just going to wait for more updates I guess, and hope they fix some of the issues, and that this time I can use my current world for more testing later.","November 22, 2015","false","423.9"," 140 of 190 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","140","190","8","4"

I dont see anybody that just sort of plays this game here and there for fun. This game simply does not work that way. However, I will dissagree with other reviews in regards to playing alone. I play alone, and have my own little medieval farm tucked away surrounded by forest. It took me many many hours to get to that point, and the server does not skill cap anything, so people can level up as much as they want. Those types of servers, one can go solo and thrive.\n\nWith that little background, the game is for the most part realistic. Almost everything in this game is time consuming, and Im not going to lie... perhaps a little too time consuming. I have a small hut, back yard garden with wattle fence surrounding it, and that literally took me three days to build. However, during the time of construction, I had to stop and go looking for food because the last thing you want to do in this game is die.\n\nSo what is the goal of this game? What ever you want it to be. My goal was to simulate a nice little medieval farm, tend to it, improve it... etc. I am very pround of what I have built, and this game has some lasting rewards. Some may strive for control, the amount of weapons and possibilites in this game is ridiculously huge thus allowing them to control by force is neccessary. However, you will not really find players like Reign of Kings, just running around killing people. You dont do that in this game because their is just too much to lose, too much progress, and too much hard work being put in by people. With that being said, the community is awesome, very mature, and helpful.\n\nBuy this game if you......\n\n1. Want realistic medival simulator\n2. Are a dedicated player\n3. Willing to actually learn the game, because the learning curve is huge!\n\nDo not buy this game if you...\n1. Are a casual PC gamer\n2. Think progress in Rust, or Reign of Kings is too slow\n3.

Sadly what has been delivered so far is a grind intensive RNG experience in frustration. While I have quite a few criticisms about this early acces game, in this review I will cover my initial thoughts, focus on my attempt at making a torch, and present my conclusion for the game in its current form.\n\nThe player starts off with a small amount of food and some clothes resembling a cloth sack. From there it is up to you to start living your life any way you want. I was initially surprised by the depth of options presented in the tool tips. I could prospect the ground for ore, strip the bark from a tree, collect sticks, search for edible food on the ground, and much more. I could already picture the village I would build in my mind, bustling with life and promise. How wrong I was.\n\nMost actions in Life is Feudal are painfully slow or based on random chance. Each time you search the ground for food the action takes a significant period of time and often turns out no results. If you don’t find food you don’t skill up. If you do find food you gain a skill up, yet seemingly don’t increase your chances of being successful in future searches. My friend and I tried with default settings and with skill gains set to high with the only benefit being additional skills unlocking faster. The only things in the game that are close to realistic are extremely frustrating. Digging a tunnel  or terraforming takes a very long time and requires you to go drop all your dirt in a different location after every 5 or so digging actions.\n\nOne of the most pointless grinds I have experienced is trying to create a torch. Torches are often one of the first items crafted in a sandbox game and usually one of the most simple. This is not the case in LiF:YO even though only two materials are required. The first material, a stick, is easily gathered from a tree. The second, naptha, is synthesised from herbs. The process is as follows:\n\n- Create a sickle,\n- Search for herbs\n- Gather the herbs\n- Discover their properties by combining random herbs\n- Gather more of the herbs that have the correct properties\n- Create the naptha\n\nWhile this initially doesn’t sound too difficult it is important to note that all the herbs look the same. You are given a random herb each time you gather so you cannot focus on collecting a certain type. Each herb was taking around 10 seconds to pick up and there are also a lot of different herb types which makes the odds of geting a specific one a lot worse. Due to poor inventory management/UI it takes a long time to combine herbs to discover what properties they have. After devoting more than half an hour to nothing but gathering and combining herbs I had not found the correct ones to make torches. In comparison It was far easier to build a house.\n\nTo conclude, my biggest problem with LiF:YO is that the developers seem to equate realism with random chance. If the game were more realistic a player would be able to identify herbs by sight before gathering them. Players would be able to locate berries and mushrooms visually instead of having to click on a tile hoping for the RNG gods to award them something to eat. While the idea of the game has merit and the future of the game does not look entirely grim it is my hope that the developers shift a focus more towards something that is more user friendly and gives rewards based on work and skill rather than random chance.","April 8, 2015","false","20.7"," 155 of 214 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","155","214","10","7"

I initially opted to start solo on my own locked instance; just to learn the ropes, learn the UI and the crafting. I figured that would allow me to survive more easily when I moved to a PVP server. I expected it to be a learning experience, not a fun one. Actually it turned out to be so much fun that I got all carried away in the crafting and forgot to check out the multiplayer experience.\n\nI've now restarted anew 3 times, as the server I settled on recently migrated. And one of my favorite things about this game is the leveling system. For one thing it makes it easy to start anew; no more spending an entire month of long grinding hours just to get back to level x at which you can finally do fun stuff. Nope, in this game you can train the basic combat skills in minutes and start to have fun. You can train your crafting skills in a couple days and hit the ground running on building. That is just great.\n\nThe game is barely half way done and already it offers and amazingly rich, deep and compelling experience. It sucks you in, but in the same time it allows short gaming sessions (which few MMOs do). So even if you only have 30 minutes to play you always have something you can do.\n\nThe Devs are very passionate about the game and are very active; they offer regular updates and even provide a public roadmap showing their progress on upcoming features.\n\nI've fallen head over heels for this game, it has destroyed my Battlefield 4 career. :D","May 1, 2015","true","984.5"," 80 of 100 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","80","100","8","0"

Development is too focused on the MMO that is being built from this funding project.\n\nMultiplayer/Co-op Players - Game is still overpriced, but somewhat enjoyable with the right server and players.\n\n\n:: The LONG Version ::\n\nAfter a little more than 50 hours of playing this game, I have to honestly reject recommending this game. The videos and screenshots look great and I could not help but be very hopeful about this game. While that hope is still there for the potental of Life is Feudal and most of it's features, it has dwindled very rapidly. The fact that this game makes you work for everything, instead of just handing you everything like Minecraft, is the strongest reason why I was so interested in playing. With that said, this game feels more like an unenjoyable job than an enjoyable game at the time of this review.\n\nLife is Feudal: Your Own gives the impression of being the fantastic single-player little brother to the anticpated MMO version to be released later. I bought into the dream, and watched it crumble as soon as I tore into the wrapper. There is no single player experience to this game.\n\nEr, wait, what? Yes, you heard that correctly. The only way a person can play this game and enjoy it, or progress, is by using boosted server settings (skill rate, tunnelling rate, skill point limit) and GM commands. I tried this route, and the game had no enjoyment for me because I didn't feel that I had accomplished anything on my own, regardless of having a house and some walls. I started a second server, to play solo, with all default settings and found no enjoyment for a multitude of reasons.\n\nLife is Feudal: Your Own has no NPCs, other than wildlife. For a solo player, this makes building walls and gates for your settlements pointless. And while there are the combat skills, they are pointless against wildlife. I found myself killed by a boar several times because I was lacking any combat skills to be able to land a hit on them with melee or ranged weapons. Utilizing the GM commands, I gave myself some armor and boosted my skills, only to still die after just a few hits (usually 3-4). If there is no difference is survivability with armor, and no increased chance to hit with better skills, then what is the reason for attempting combat with wildlife? I guess the only thing left is to just be a Lumberjack and a Farmer, right? I will say that the Lumberjack role is about the only role that seemed to work for me. You can strip trees of their branches and bark, and even a few saplings. Sure you can cut down those trees, and even turn them into boards and building logs. However, you can't do anything with it without the supporting crafting skills. Most everything requires some form of metal component to build, so you also need those supporting skills. Suddenly, the skill cap is looking smaller and smaller. Farming is a mixed bag of ideas. The system to find random plants (crops) works to help you find food that you can cook on a campfire to keep you alive or plant to start your crops. That part of the farming skill system works great, but also leads into my issues with the server side of the game.\n\nThe problems that do not work for me as a solo player, is the fact that the server has to run almost 24-hours of real time before you are able to harvest those crops that you have planted. Planted trees also require the server to run for an extremely long time period of real time before they have grown enough to be of any real use for the player. The server side is a mixed bag of confusion. The systems used to determine decay and time of day (in-game) will progress between the time a server is shutdown to when it is restarted. This takes place even if the server settings for decay are set to 0 (disabled). A person that is not able to play everyday, like myself, will find this to be quite annoying. Monuments that are used to protect your items from decaying, are not able to be managed while they are damaged. (See Update Note 1) If the monument reaches the end of it's hitpoints before the server is restarted, then it will be deleted upon server restart. This is the same with any other items (dropped items, campfires, snares, etc.) that are not protected or held by the player. Systems such as the growth of crops and the growth of tamed animals will not progress or update while the server is offline. It must be ran non-stop for these to progress. The slightest amount of items will overburden your character to the point you can not pick up anything, or even swap equipment. While there are storage options in the game, the storage limitations on the smaller, yet easier to craft items make them almost pointless. The larger storage options are impossible to obtain for a solo player, due to their increased material requirements, skill levels to craft, and the rate of decay for the numerous dropped items while collecting the other components. This basically adds up to the single player being a lot of the "let the game run, while I go play something else" type of scenerio. For these reasons, I have to warn all players looking for a single player experience to avoid this title at this time. Especially for the overpriced tag of $40 USD.\n\nI found the multiplayer side of this game to be just as much work, with a lot more frustrations. I tried several public servers and found the combat against other players to be just as annoying and unbalanced as my single player experience against boars. There is also the inability to progress on public servers (in my experience) because you are constantly being murdered and robbed for usually crappy primative tools, or the log on your back. Talking to other players, I was bothered by the need to have scheduled shifts between players to guard their settlements from being attacked while others were offline.\n\nOverall, this game made me feel like an over-worked, under-appreciated, non-paid employee that wished I had never even tried. If there was an option of getting my money back on this game, then I would love to use it. WIth the experience that I've had with this game so far, I don't think I will ever re-consider Life is Feudal: YO or the MMO in the future.\n\nUPDATE NOTE 1:\n--- Update 0.3.2.6 added craftable repair kits that can be used to repair damage cause by players and decay.","March 16, 2015","false","99.9"," 141 of 196 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","141","196","8","0"

It's fun, deep, immersive, has great RP value, and has great potential to be my personal favorite game.  It has one major drawback though, the server providers for this game are not very versed in how to fix database issues, at all.  The official servers lack GMs (which is necessary because the game is still buggy) and have very low multipliers so very little to no player base on them.  All of the other servers are ran by regular players.  So while the game has some great potential for the MMO (if they get all the bugs ironed out) playing on a privately owned server means you are left to whichever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you choose to follow.\n\nOut of 11 different servers now, we ran into griefing all day every day, ban happy GMs that ban over cutting a loud fart, GMs that didn't play at all, server rules changing every day...  All in all, that wasn't a very good experience.  So my group and I tried our hand at running our own server.  We eventually had a server through every provider listed on the LiF website except for PlugPayPlay.  What we found, was that none of the server providers really offered anything in the way of DDOS protection aside from a low end firewall.  Only Bluefang had prompt response times. (I'll give them an A+ for response time)  All our other providers ended up taking forever to get back with us, we had two tickets with Gameservers.com that ended up timing out on their own after 48 hours with no response.  NONE of the providers seemed to know how to handle technical issues, it was all just "oh reinstall the server and start from scratch".  Also, none of the providers offered automatic backup setups.  Long story short, LiF all your providers (aside from the mystery one that I wasn't about to spend more money on) suck.\n\nThe game itself is great though.  The core mechanics of the game are very engaging and if you are into these kind of games, will keep you engaged for a very long time.  I would recommend it to players that like hardcore survival and building games as long as they don't care about GM abuse.  Also, some servers you can buy items on, heck I even found one that you can buy a castle on if you give the GM $50 lol.  That has it's own ups and downs in itself.  Don't worry though, servers crash and wipe all the time, so there is always a "fresh wipe xx/xx/xx" to play on.  If you want to keep your progress for any length of time, there's really only one server that's very stable, and that's because the devs take a personal interest in it and the server owners are well versed in coding it, Kingdom of Arkhaya.  Good luck Life is Feudal, this is a great game, but a waste of time until the MMO comes out.  I'll see you guys then.","January 10","false","962.2"," 188 of 275 people (68%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","68","188","275","22","23"

It relies on teamwork to go beyond having a small hutt in a forest. You need a cook, a miner, a blacksmith, lumberjack, farmer, etc. You can't be all at once, so you actually need to be a part of a group to get anywhere.

For example, if you want to build something, you need to first begin with forestry. To get your forestry levelled up you need to inspect trees/take bark/branches from them (which you can use along with stone you gather from terraforming to make tools) and then when your forestry is high enough you unlock logging which allows you to begin on chopping down trees. This leads to carpentry which of course allows you then to begin preparing the logs properly for contructing your buildings by sawing out the necessary boards of different sizes. You or someone else is also required to have the knowledge of forging which is about the 5th skill in the mining skill set, so that you can make nails.\n\nAnd as for terraforming, this is no minecraft "punch punch punch" goodbye dirt. No siree, this requires effort and time, and a lot of trips back to the edge of your mine shaft to dump countless amounts of dirt from your inventory weighing you down onto a pile, just as you would if you were digging in real life.\n\nWhile it is complex and a grind, it's a fun grind that feels realistic and is actually very fun and addictive, unlike the typical sandbox builders where you just gather 200 wood for a basic shack and build it in no time at all. What makes it even better is how difficult it is to construct the needed weapons to destroy these buildings. So all in all a very balanced game thus far.\n\nAs for combat, for those of you who know war of the roses/mount and blade, this is very similar, directional attacks with realistic physics (body swinging into attacks to make them do more damage) and different kinds of damage given/taken by different weapons/armor (piercing, blunt, slashing etc)\n\nThis is only the testing game too, and only small occassional updates are coming through as the developers are working on the main mmo coming out next year that will feature many more things including a karma/alignment system for your actions.

There are too many design issues that get in the way of playability.  For example, I tired to fight a wolf twice.  a dialog appears and puts me in cursor mode and I die before I can clear the dialog and get back to the fighting the wolf.  In fact a  lot of actions seem to drop the player into a cursor mode which is a pain and complicates even the most menial task in the game.  And this game is full of menial tasks.  Raise and lower the ground at a snails pace.  After 10 swings of trying to dig a tunnel and seeing no tunnel I gave up.  You have to raise and lower a bunch to raise your skill to dig tunnels which allows you to finally get stone to make a simple cooking pot to cook anything.  You can't put rock, marble, or clay into a dropped items bag to clear out your inventory.  I've played for hours and can't even build a basic shelter yet.\n\nI like the premise fo the game and it has potential, but the game needs a lot of work in playability for me to continue playing.

And expecting otherwise and getting this game will be entirely on you, because it's very much said to be right off the bat :P\n\nNow, with that said, we can talk about the game itself. I think this game is at a great start for early development, and the potential is phenominal. I've easily no lifed this game (No really... I got the achievment and everything.) and am still looking forward to playing more. It mixes RPG and Sandbox surprisingly well, making them both interdependent on one another. You need to level skills to build, and you need to build to level skills. Then there's the fact that other than using prefab structures, you get to design everything else to your liking. You decide how big or small your settlement or even castle will be, given if you're willing to put the time and effort into finishing it. This game won't be for those who like to get right in on the action, and if that's your cup of tea, I don't advise expecting it to be so. Though I will still suggest it, because you never know. This game makes you feel like it's the simulator that it is.\n\nIf I could change anything about this game, it would be the green bar. But I'd change it to something they already plan to replace it with, metagames; something to keep you occupied and alert instead of staring blankly at a loading bar. There are a few bugs here and there, though I can't remember examples since I haven't played in a while, but I know there was. And that's to be expected, it's early alpha. VERY EARLY. It really is obnoxious to see how many kiddies whine about bugs or the fact that it's not done in some areas, because it's exactly that; early alpha development. It's like wanting a diamond out of graphite; It's not, but in time it can be. But I digress, this game is still fairly polished compared to other alphas, some even that are near beta.\n\nYou will also find this game is NOT to be played alone, for extended periods of time. While it can be done, it's soon apparent that you'll need friends to aide you in your endeavours. So, get your guild/steam group/clan ready and get to work!\n\nSo concluding my review, I'll rate it on categories:\nBugs(Expected to change as it's developed): (few crashes, nothing else that's game breaking) 7/10\n\nGraphics(doesnt effect overall rating, but some people play for graphics): 10/10 (If you have the rig to support the graphics on max)\n\nOptimization: 8/10\n\nReplayablility: 9/10\n\nNewUserFriendliness: (Not going to lie, this game requires out of game sources to actually get the ball rolling.) 5/10\n\nPotential: 10/10\n\nUpdate Frequency: 7/10\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10\n\n*EDIT: So I forgot to take into account the sheer price of the game. If this is your kind of game, it will be worth every penny spent. However, if you don't know what you're getting into and don't like it, then you may find you're out $40.","February 12, 2015","true","604.9"," 50 of 62 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","50","62","0","0"

You aren't grinding "XP points" or stupid tings like "pixie medals" to spend at vendors like in other RPG's. In fact, there are no vendors! EVERYTHING is player run and all work is done by hand. You want make 30 swords for your group of friends? Better invest in smithing related skills and buildings and go out and mine and/or barter for the metal ores. The map is 100% terraformable. Everything down to the grains of sand you walk on can be harvested and has a possible industrial use. The game is still in development, so combat is a bit wonky and it currently lacks critical things like horses and siege mechanics. But the player skirmishes and the building aspect are already a lot of fun.\n\nA few things that annoyed me:\n- Claims system: I won't go into detail here, but the forum is full of it. This mechanic needs a lot of work!\n- Terraforming: This is the least enjoyable part of the game. If you are a builder you will spend a lot of time leveling the ground. There is an observer mode, but this cannot be active during the actual digging. Also, mining leaves very ugly unrealistic "minecraft style" block shaped holes in the terrain and locks those cells for future terraforming. So digging tunnels is a perfect griefing tactic which permanently ruins someone's village/castle.\n- No NPC's other than wild animals. I wish we could let NPC's reduce some of the mindnumbing tasks like terraforming or to man the walls of your keep. What human player wants to spend their gametime playing guard on a watchtower? It would also make the villages feel a lot more alive.\n- Strange skill requirements: I understand the 600 skillpoint cap. Every society needs specialists if it wants to be more than a tribe of mud people. However what I don't understand is why I need to become a farmer and progress through several other professions in the same "line" before I can become a tailor. Especially when there are such harsh limits on the amount of skillpoints I'd like to have more precise control over how I invest them. I also don't understand why I need to train a skill to even equip a sword I looted off a corpse. Why can't I just be far less effective at using said sword  without formal training?

Features are missing and the ones that exist are not even that fully fledged out. That being said. This game is great at what it is now. Honestly if the devs ended up fixing just the bugs and crashes and for some reason abandoned the game. I would feel as though I got my moneys worth. However there are certain things you should know before purchasing this game to make sure you do get your moneys worth.\n1. Have friends. This game will not be nearly as much fun alone and if you play on a multiplayer server. You need friends. Or atleast find some other players to join\n2. This game is Hard not like oh its a challenege I mean like you will spend an hour hitting a rock with a pickaxe trying to create a tunnel to mine from. You need to be willing to invest time and to learn the crafting system.\n\nIf you can deal with these two things you should be fine. Another thing I noticed is people complaining about the combat. The hit detection is actually amazing if you miss its because you suck. That being said the swing direction registering is not nearly as good as M&B IMO\n\n","September 25, 2014","true","64.7"," 51 of 65 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","51","65","0","0"

I have never enjoyed a crafting/survival game more than this particular gem, to include all of the Rust/Reign of Kings clones out there (which are fun as well in short spurts). The learning curve can be relatively steep, and the time investment required to get a fully functioning village or even a sword can be tremendous, but it's an utter blast if you don't mind the challenge.\n\nMind you, the developers did a weird turn and released a somewhat different version of the game than what we had been testing throughout Alpha, so some repetitive glitches have been reintroduced. I'd say overall the Devs made a really poor decision by calling this a "released" product, and I fear that the hopes of their MMO and sales will suffer as a result. Nevertheless they're chipping away at the bugs currently, and I cannot recommend this game enough for the older generations out there that want a gritty, realistic experience.\n\nKids should probably stay away.

Not because the game rewards it, but because the game allows it.

Work.  You work at getting raw materials.  You work at building structures.  You live.  In a medieval setting and as someone who has done medieval re-enactment I can say LIF isn't terribly far off the mark duplicating life in that era.\n\nThe game itself is certainly picking up speed as the dev team seems to be working harder and harder on the game.  Updates are becoming more frequent and issues such as the blinking sky and invisible trees seem to be dealt with.  At least as of this date.  The graphics are excellent.  Even on my potato computer the visuals are lovely and my fps stays stable around the 20 mark.\n\nI know for many of you a game must be 60 fps but games in early access rarely come close to that mark.  ARK did not see an improvement in fps until late in its dev cycle.  Just as an example   Also, this is a very social game.  Playing it alone or on a dead server will bore you to death.   Unless you are truly dedicated.\n\nA few tips for new players:\n\n1. There is no rush to settle down.  You can live nomadically for quite some time living off of wild apples from apple trees.\n2. When you do decide to settle down look for an area that is fairly flat and is reasonably close to stone, clay, iron and water.\n3. While a variety of crops are nice, the two most important are wheat and flax.  Wheat for taming animals and flax to make clothing and rope with.\n4.

Thinking ahead, the MMO part due in 2016 will have a great potential in my point of view, allowing so much opportunity to roleplay.\n\nRight now you need to play on a good server with very active administrators as it will influence greatly on your experience, if you are new to the game, don't be a loner and ask for help from other players or at the least do consult YouTube videos and Guides as the learning curve is bar none the steepest I have ever encountered...\n\nI advise trying a server with 10x Experience acceleration at first in order to figure out many of the basics without having to spend tons of hours doing so, when you are comfortable, then, maybe switch to a more RP based server with more realistic restrictions.\n\nIn regards to the developers, from what I have seen in my 9 months of owning this title, they have respected the community, their roadmap is established and also followed. They are a small team but have done very good work in my opinion.\n\nThe price when not on sale might be a bit steep, encourage them and buy at full price if you can afford, otherwise wait for a sale at which point I think it becomes a great investment...\n\nAlpha rating: 8/10 (some bugs are still present, but that's normal)\nPotential Rating of MMO: 9/10 (to be released in 2016)","September 9, 2015","true","744.4"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","42","53","5","0"

Finding yourself washed ashore on an big island with nothing on your body except for something to eat and some rags, you have to create everything in the game from scratch. You build your own tools from branches and stones, find some roots to eat and create your first Tiny Shack. All this building, crafting and planning (terrain flattening alone is an art/skill) takes unbelievably long time, which may annoy some people. If you are extremely impatient just skip this game - it's nothing for you.\n\nOn the other hand it is extremely satisfying to create your own buildings. Until I had a forge (which is needed for nails, for example - so a rather basic building), I spent around 20 hours in the game. When the forge was finally done, I was just proud of myself.\n\nOne reason it takes so long to achieve process, is that many activities take a lot of time: snapping a branch from a tree? Around 2 seconds. You need 20 branches for a building? Click 20 times on the same tree and simply wait each time 2 seconds. This can be annoying with the time, so better get used to it and watch TV on a second screen.\n\nHaving friends that play with you is not only nice, but highly recommended. With on character you aren't able to succeed in the various skill trees (or if you try you end up as a bad jack-of-all-trades, who is able to some jobs a little, but nothing really good). The strange server structure (everyone can host a server) leads to a huge variety of servers, leaving the "public" servers rather deserted, so don't count on meeting many people around there.\n\nAs already mentioned, there are several skill trees, like Herbalism, Carpentry, Smithing, Hunting and so on. Each of them uses different mechanics, so it is fun to try them all out. Some of them are extremly fun (building, carpentry), some of them are okay/highly repetitive (mining takes literally hours...) and some of them are simply boring and stupid (especially herbalism). At a later point you need high level material (like steel and mortar) so called Flux which can only be gathered by Herbalism people, who have to search for hours one small area of herbs and then combine them in an annoying mini-game and hope for some luck.\n\nThe second rather bad mechanic is the whole fighting module. Right now you can hunt animals, some agressive like wolves or boars and some peaceful like sheep or deer. The AI of these animals is simply stupid, you have to shoot them with around 10-15 bullets of your sling to kill them. During this annoying process they do not move a bit (or run away like 5 squares then stay still again). Even the dangerous species try to attack you only once, after you land one successful shot, they stand still like all the others. Even achieving higher levels of weapons (you have to learn Throwing Weapons, then get hit with Leather Armor on, then learn Crossbows and THEN you are able to use Bows) does not significantly lower the time you need to hunt an animal. This is truely unsatisfying and outright bad right now. If the fighting against other players should feel the same like fighting against animals, this would be desastrous.\n\nTL,DR:\n++ Extremely satisfying to build structures\n+ Great when playing in small communities\n+ Different mechanics to learn with each job\n\n-- Huge effort of time neccessary to achieve something\n- Long waiting times during processes\n- Difficult to learn (Wiki helps a great deal)\n- Combat Module isn't any fun\n\nAll in all I can recommend this game if you are looking for a challenging medieval-crafting-simulation. If you are impatient or believe that this game is all about building forts and playing knight, go away. You will be disappointed. But if you like grinding for ressources and want to build a small village with your friends - this is your game (Early Access and all).","October 1, 2015","true","248.1"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","41","53","0","0"

The skill systems and crafting are wonderful.  But there are a few problems that have been present for extended periods and make the game nearly unplayable for extended periods.\n\nThe method the game uses for saving changes to the terrain is very inefficient, which makes it very difficult to maintain a server for extended periods of time.  And if you terraform below the elevation of the water anywhere on the entire map, it causes corruptions in the game database which results in ongoing lag.  Leaving tree stumps after cutting down trees also causes server lag, and so does having too many trees on the server.\n\nEach of these issues don't seem to be terribly important on their own, but they have all been present for an extended period and the game developers continue to add new features and have moved on to working on the MMO version fo the game rather than addressing existing bugs.  Until the developers give the game the attention it needs, this game is not worth playing.","January 19","false","257.4"," 59 of 85 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","59","85","3","0"

The mechanics of this game are easy to grasp and just as easy to master. The only thing that I could say is something of a drawback is that it becomes TOO realistic.

I decided it's not even worth changing because everything is pretty much still persistant as it was when I wrote it and also I noticed what I once thought was a 'fanboy' or maybe a server owner/admin is actually a DEVELOPER. So obviously they had people creating low level, private accounts to argue with critics about their game and to downvote negative reviews. This makes me question to validity of their postive reviews, which were a much higher precentage when the game was release on steam. Now the reviews are mixed and some light in finally being shed on these shoddy developers.. but too late as a lot of people have purchased this game due to bias.\n\nOne perpetrator 'Neolog' had battled my opinions of the game, trying to be underhanded.. unfortunately I deleted most the comments he made because of his attitude. He wasn't a Developer when he was doing this criticism.. so not only did I receive an official response from Saxxon.. he has his little henchmen going around and debating peoples reviews, be warned if you are looking at the upvotes/downvotes for reviews, as they are obviously manipulated.\n\nQuote from the comments of my review:\n\n"Neolog  [developer] Dec 9, 2014 @ 12:37am  Delete\nI dare to add my comment, hope you won't feel bad:\n\n-The graphics are pretty horrible (Think Asheron's Call with some realistic photo textures for SOME things, ick)\nWell, it's open world game with full terramorphing. You wouldn't say, that bad graphics is a CON of Minecraft, would you?\n\n-Many have problems getting it to load and be stable\n-A lot of strange lag and bugs\nAlpha, EA. You can copypast this comments to any EA game, and they'd still be true.\n\n-It's over 3 years old and still early access\nIt's been early access for couple of months. Development took almost 3 years, sooooo? It's indie, dude, they don't have 2000 developers to release a game per year.\n\n-Lack of end game content\nThe fact, that you're using "end-game content" for a sandbox game tells much about your understanding of a sandbox concept.\n\nI honestly don't understand why you bought this game in the first place, but given your quantity of bought games, it seems like you're just buying every game you see =)"\n\nEnd quote.\n\n..of course he isn't being blatantly rude or anything in this comment, though he is obviously trying to incite a response that will make me - the reviewer, seem less credible.. the other posts he made, which I had deleted spiraled downward into near trollism.\n\n\nMy orginal review:\n\nThis game has potential, yes, potential. It's an evil word that is thrown about and often the ones who spring forty dollars on a game are quick to adopt it.\n\nIt's fun to play, for sure, especially when there are more people working in sync to alleviate the artificial wait times. The wait times are a mix of a blessing and a curse, they give the feeling of accomplishment when you are finally able to see your hard work pay off, but this is all a ruse when you realize that there isn't really an end to a means since the endgame comes down to pvp which is still a work in progress and from my experience a long ways from being substantial. (I.E. Horses and almost all the weapon skills are not implemented.)\n\nThe real reason I am NOT recommending this game is the lack of updates. YES I KNOW THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. They have been working on this game for over THREE YEARS before it got greenlit, Do yourself a favor and research it yourself, their PR will gladly say that they are working diligently on the game, but the fact is there hasn't been any substatial updates for years. That is not a good track record, especially concerning the core mechanics of the game which are not even implemented.\n\nPROS\n-Combat is not like Mount and Blade\n-Crafting system is detailed and involving\n-Fun to work with others towards a common goal\n-Open charachter development\n-Open world development\n\nCONS\n-Combat is not like Mount and Blade (Yes, it's a pro and a con)\n-Artificial wait times\n-The graphics are pretty horrible (Think Asheron's Call with some realistic photo textures for SOME things, ick)\n-Many have problems getting it to load and be stable\n-A lot of strange lag and bugs\n-It's over 3 years old and still early access\n-Lack of end game content\n-Not much freedom when constructing things (Prefab building, etc)\n\n\nI suggest you read over their official website, especially concerning their progress before you purchase, I also recommend researching other games that are close in genre and half as expensive.\n\n5/10","November 10, 2014","false","35.5"," 158 of 258 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","158","258","0","15"

Odd reason to not recommend a game right! See the problem is... Enjoying it means obnoxious lenghts of time doing things. Oh want to make a farm, clear an area, teraform area, plow the ground, plant seeds, and harvest crops! Sounds easy, but each step is its own huge grind. On top of that, crops take (usually, but depending on server settings) a real life 24 hours to be able to harvest them. Worse yet if you arent online when they are harvestable, they wither.\nFighting is fun enough, its laggy and glitchy but fun. It feels like a bad connection mount and blade, but dumbed down extremely. The hit detection is off, but not too bad. Combat is absolutely just spam click, however some things like shield bash knock you over and stun you. You can chain this with multiple people. The combat needs a lot of work, its geared for bad players in droves.\nIts also not really a solo game, you must find a group. Now several people will argue this, but understand that these are adults who can commit 10+ hours a day to a video game. Are you able to do that? Exactly, me either because we arent shut ins. The game takes huge huge gaps of time, splitting the time load with other players is the only way to survive. Unless you play on a PvE server I guess, but I cant imagine doing that.\nIt was extremely fun for 4 or 5 days, playing with 3 RL buddies, then it kept getting more and more lame. Building weapons and armor takes REAL LIFE gaps if time. Like 24 hours for flax to grow, then 24 more hours to turn it into rope fibers... Oops not enough to make a full rope, 24 more hours to grow more, 24 more hours to turn that into rope fibers. I wish this was an exaggeration, but this will happen to you. You have outrageous time sinks to get skills to the level to do the next thing, like plant certain seeds, make rope or tan leather. All the while there is inevitably some huge 20 person group of euros who is pretending they are back in their countries hayday, griefing everyone mostly when they are offline.

If you can handle the grind, however, it has to be one of the most rewarding, fun, and interesting games out there. It puts other medieval survival games (looking at you, Reign of Kings) to shame. Still very unfinished but, in my opinion, it is definitely worth the money.\n\nPros:\n- The game is very rewarding later on. If you can get past the first difficult cliff then you'll be set for a while. It's not like Rust or Ark in that you can wake up one day with everything gone.\n- If you have a large group of friends it's a ton of fun. 10 friends in a group could create an entire empire if you work together.\n- Very in depth skills. You can level just about any skill you can think of.\n- Many, many paths to build your kingdom. If you want to build an underground kingdom, you can. If you'd rather a castle with massive, indestructible walls, you got it. There are infinite numbers of ways to play this game.\n- Roleplay potential is crazy. I don't mean roleplay like Skyrim where you level up skills and talk to NPCs. I mean roleplay like SAMP or Project Reality. If you want to get very immersed as the king you are, you certainly can. Check out Mr Moon on YouTube for good examples of Life is Feudal roleplay.\n\nNeutral\n- Takes a ton of time to get into. You can put 50 hours into the game without getting anywhere if you swap servers frequently. On games such as Rust, you can get a decent establishment up and running within a day. On Life is Feudal, you need a good 5-6 hours of gameplay for 5 days straight to get something resembling a base.\n\nCons\n- The combat is still pretty meh. It was significantly worse when the game was launched. It's not as good as other medieval combat in games such as Chivalry, but it gets the job done.\n- Weird protection systems. In order to protect your items you must make some kind of totem/idol thing and give it frequent sacrifices of herbs. It takes 1-1.5 hours of farming in the first place to make it however if you miss one day of sacrifices then it gets destroyed and your stuff is gone.\n- Playing solo is impossible. Well, not technically, but you can't expect to get anywhere in any reasonable amount of time if you dont have a few friends to help you out. Hell, at least one friend will make a huge different.\n\nPlease note that quite a few of my personal issues with the game (time investment, mainly) is made null by servers with increased farming rates.\n\nI will edit this review with more pros/cons as I play the game more.\n\nTL;DR - The game is very in depth, tons of fun, and very time consuming. Bring your friends. If you don't have a lot of free time play on an increased rates server. Over all, I'd give it a 8/10 based on my personal enjoyment.","May 4","true","14.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","28","36","2","0"

Have to say if you are interested in games where you need to work together with 3 or more people. Where you can feel the accomplishement of your campfire in the clearing becoming a pallisade box. Then the work and time to create your first stone keep. This game is for you. If you enjoy those things listed along with tedious skill up and horrible combat hitboxes and mechanics. Again this games for you. If you REALLY enjoy logging out after  a hard days grind to log in later and find out some asshat has put 3 logs floating in air to scale your walls and steal your stuff. This games for you. Catering to different playstyles and multitudes of servers with solo to group friendly skill rates and motifs, this games early access is actually worth it. The environment is nice. In general the players are not but you can make good friends none the less. Or worse comes to worse. Get killed by a naked bald man with a hatchet. The only drawback i get is 90% of the game at the moment is the levelling up of skills. Once you have the keep/warehouse/house/walls you are stuck to the grind. Or you can run out and cause mayhem with banditry or War. In general its a good start, and a novel concept.

This game maintains the same level of grind as Wurm, assuming a 1.0 skillgain multiplier, while making every last accomplishment feel wonderful. When I got my first tunnel dug to ore, it was a great feeling, and then smelting the ore, and so on.\n\nThe only agonies I face in this game really come from trying to play solo, terraforming (even with other people I imagine it's dreadful to flatten out a cliff face, as it really should be.) the occasional bug and probably loss of life and items from PvP encounters. I don't quite appreciate the way the skills work, with the prerequisite skills and all that, due to the fact that A: there's a(n) (adjustable) skillcap, and B: some of the sequencing doesn't make sense. IIRC, use of chainmail is restricted to after you reach level 30 in warhorse training, and other armor skills are thrown after other random combat skills. It just doesn't feel right. Lastly, if you're playing alone, just absolutely forget about making real progression with the skillcap at its default settings, because nearly every skill is required to make a nicely functioning settlement.\n\nIs this game worth the price tag? That's debatable. At this state, I'd personally say yeah, but I understand others that aren't as seasoned to the type of game this is might want to hold out for a sale or for more content to be ironed out and implemented. At the time of writing I've had ~40 hours in the past few days, and I've got to say, nothing feels more satisfying than seeing what all I've managed to accomplish on my own.","April 5, 2015","true","284.3"," 50 of 75 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","50","75","0","0"

They make it hard and tedious for characters that could be wiped in a game full of bugs\n\nThis game is WAY to slow to be fun.  idk why watching a green bar would be conidered fun ever...  You need tons of stupid things like branches and fiber to build simple items.  Also if you joing the wrong server your skills are slow as hell.\n\nThis is just a huge IMMATURITY and INSECURITY from the devs.  Trying to press people into playing grinds instead of why people joined this game in the first place.\n\nOne examples is making 4 traps (which take hours to get chickens, if you are lucky) takes 40 fiber to contruct (plus the apples \ branches).

It's set in a medieval environment, your character starts off in a woodland area, the land is a mix of untamed forests, grass and water. The buildings and tools represent this era very well, a lot of effort has gone into the background. I like the realism behind the crafting system too, like if you go to fish, you won't always catch a fish. It's relaxing as well when you're not getting attacked every five seconds by the wildlife, which gives you time to do things. The game starts off with you having to explore, forage and prospect the land to find and gather materials. From these materials you craft primitive items that allow you to fish, chop trees, dig for ore, and from then on you can choose what you want to specialise in as well. There is a limited number of points you can pour your points into, which means you will end up focusing on one or two skills more than the others. For example you may choose to build a farm, and learn to cook and tend to animals. Or maybe you want to learn how to build a house and design it with different architectural styles. Perhaps you want to create potions. Or learn to forge armour and weapons. So you choose to focus on the desired skill tree until you are able to make the higher end materials.\nThis is good because with each player specialising in an skill tree, it means there is more chance of cooperation happening, for players contributing to build a village or a working clan, rather than running around killing people straight away. You can adjust the max learning points from server to server, but limiting it persuades people to work together for the greater good.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is one of the things that lacks, and I feel the need to say it. The learning curve in my opinion is really hard, and it's difficult to get into the game if you don't have any friends that play it, who can help you to learn it. I liked the fact that the game requires you to be patient. It's not the kind of game where you can mindlessly run around and get everything you need in less than an hour. It's the kind of game that will require a lot of time for you to be able to get even some of the things you need. It's a slow paced game, but things are sped up when you do it with people - which means once again the game is encouraging cooperation.\n\nControls:\n\nThe controls are ok, but the main problem is that you need to tab for virtually everything, which gets pretty annoying. I would prefer the viewing and gathering to be different than needing to tab for it each time. The screen freezes with wherever you tabbed so there isn't much free roaming/observing. The movement of the character is good and quite smooth, but the rest is clunky.\n\nSound:\n\nI really liked the music in the game. The game is very slow paced, and the music fits in perfectly in the background, nice and relaxing for something that you will end up spending a lot of time on. It changes when you go into combat as well.\n\nLearning Curve:\n\nI think the learning curve is really hard, and this needs to be mentioned for players who may not have so much patience with this. There's a lot of things you need to do, with your inventory you need to point and click for everything, and each action takes time to process. With the character creation menu as well there is no explanation of the skills you'll be putting your points into, which is a shame because these will affect the outcome of what you do in the game. For example one of the skill trees just says "Forestry", but with no detail as to what this means. What will forestry allow you to do and craft and how you can do it within the game. This would benefit enormously from having a small description underneath for each skill and talent.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe game itself has a LOT of potential. The game is well detailed, and the crafting system is very in depth and gives you a lot of options. However the game will take a long time to learn - it isn't for anyone who doesn't have the patience to keep at something.\n\n6.5/10\nWhy 6.5? Because this game has potential, however it has not reached the potential I think it can. But then again that is what Early Access is for.\n\nWant moar?\nClick here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page!","September 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","27","35","2","0"

It takes time to do stuff in the game, which has this amazing rewarding feeling when you actually accomplish things. Games nowadays have lost that feel. The game has quite a steep learning curve, and to even be able to kill a creature for its meat and pelt, it might take fifteen to twenty minutes killing it. But when you finally hit your target with that last stone and it falls to its death, I caught myself in jumping up and down in my chair, singing random celebratory songs! Amazing feeling.\n\nMany people would dislike this game. It takes time, and it IS hard. You'd have to like challenges to like the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haladmer/recommended/290080/","haladmer","Haladmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haladmer/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLiF is one of the games I've been playing since starting my break from a different game earlier this year so I'd like to share my views on LiF as well.\n\nOverall:\nAs others have said, it will not be for everyone, and the MMO version (LiF) vs the private server version (LiF:YO) are two rather different beasts.  Having been in the alpha for LiF, the biggest difference between the MMO and personal server versions is simply the size of the map, the lack of the "claims" mechanic (think of this system as a combination deed and guild/nation mechanics in Wurm Online), and the server owner's ability to mod the server.  This includes going so far as to restructure the skill trees, the exp rates, recipe requirements, and even the animations/models, they just need to provide the modified client files for you to use.\n\nMap Size(s)\nLooking at map sizes, for the LiF:YO map, if you are familiar with Wurm Online, it is roughly the size of Cele and shaped like a mini-Indy (big mountain in the middle, various terrain types between the mountain and the waterline).  On the MMO map, the LiF:YO equates to about 1 map "grid" in size (map was something like 12-15 by the same if I remember correctly).\n\nSkill/Character Progression\nSkills are capped by server settings, which is an option the server owner can configure and can allow for your character to actually master all skills if the cap is set correctly.  There are a few servers with reduced skill gains very similar to Wurm's progression pacing, but again it is up to the server owner.\nLike UO, on servers with anything less than max skills set, you can choose to lock any skill you want to not progress/gain exp in that "line", you can choose to have a skill reduce if you hit cap.\nCrafting, "General", and Combat skills are all separate skill pools, so the cap applies to each pool separately.\nStats are their own pool and have their own "cap" applied\nCombat\nPVE and PVP use the same combat system\nAttacks are modified by skill, the weapon used, and target's armor\nYou can target specific areas for different outcomes\nEndurance matters, different weapons and attacks have different endurance costs, and the armor you're wearing adds to this cost.\nDifferent armors have different endurance costs, but also have strong/weak protection stats making a situational need/use for all armors (i.e. there is no best armor for every use where padding can be just as valuable as plate, sometimes more so, depending on who is using it and why)\nYou don't have to kill your opponent to defeat them and you still get to loot them\nDeath system applies a small skill loss upon death (not defeat), which can be a larger or smaller impact depending on the server settings\nTrade/Commerce\nIn the personal servers, since there are no kingdoms, there are no coin of the realm.  Each group is free to determine what they want to use as their basis of exchange.\nIn the MMO plans (as per the FAQ) each 1*1km kingdom will have a "pool" of coin introduced by way of the trader posts (think of the trader system in Wurm)\nBuilding/Construction/Structures\nGeneral housing/structures are templates (i.e. cookie cutter), but you can rotate the structure when placing it to provide at least some control on appearance\nCastles/Cities are modular and built item by item\nThe requirements for each structure vary greatly, and will require a player to learn/use a couple different skills to build even the smallest/easiest house\nMods\nI've actually been playing mostly on a modded server for the last few days, the admin/modder has been keeping in-step with the developer and releasing updates the same day as the official client files.  Currently there are only 3 truly modded servers (actually requiring modded client files) accessible to the public.  Custom server configurations for exp gains, number of animals, etc... do not require modded client files\n\n*Updated* After having played on modded servers since the initial review, I continue to find that the modding community is full of very talented people.  The core system is not for the faint of heart, and these people not only keep their modded server (and client) files up to date almost in-step with the dev team, they tend to share their knowledge with others to improve everyone's gameplay experience by adjusting those elements important to their server's players.\n\nPersonal Opinion(s)\nHonestly, I'm enjoying LiF about as much as I when I started playing Wurm full time a couple of years ago.  Like Wurm Online a few years ago, there are a lot of things that are still in the early development process, and more than a few things that are just fun when taken as part of the overall system.  To me, it really does feel like Wurm Online back when Golden Valley (GV) was the starter town and the mainland was premium only.\n\nThe two biggest things that I think players coming from games like Wurm Online specifically need to keep in mind is that in LiF:YO there is a built in need to interact with people unless the server has the skill cap set high enough (3000+ skill points), and there is a progression dependency to all skill progression.  If you want to build castles, you need to learn to terraform->refine construction materials->construction->masonry->architecture, you cannot simply jump into one skill to hit the next skill unlock and then forget about the base skill.\n\nAs with any other game, you'll either like it or you won't, but either way, it's a personal opinion/preference that only you can decide on.","November 8, 2014","true","384.8"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","42","62","0","0"

Things take far more time to build, the terraforming is different than most, getting things organized can take a great deal of effort. I wasn't really able to get into the game as much as I'd have liked to. The trailers showed off more of the late game functions than early game. You'll have a hard time trying to so much as construct a hut to start. Visually, it's delightful, conceptually, it's fantastic, the drawback is that it takes as long to cut down and carve out lumber in the real world as it does in Life is Feudal.

No. Not quite, will it be? Yes, without a doubt. This game is very addicting, it is so fun, you will wonder why you find it so fun; and consider that something may be wrong with you. Primarily because you stare at things for hours on end.\n\nFirst you look at grass, then trees, then ground that you flatten, then you look at ground you are digging into, then you look at ore you are mining, then the furnace you are smelting it in, then the leather crafting equipment, then the forge, and finally; you look at people running away from you, before you catch up to them and kill them with weapons and armor.\n\n11/10 Would fail to communicate with peasant thief because of Alpha Build, then kill him and take all his rocks, rags and apples.\n\nEDIT - There seems to be a LOT of confusion about combat in this game, rightfully so. People say it is broken because they attempt PVP VERY EARLY INTO THEIR PLAYTHROUGHS, and try to beat each other to death with tools mostly, iron and primitive.\n\nHowever, that is not true, you take a major penalty when fighting with tools that can be reduced (Although never fully) by leveling a skill called "Militia Service," which attaches to a penalty free weapon, the familiar pitchfork! The pitchfork is effective, as you are unarmored and agile, you can also outmaneuver them with your speed. A peasant not to be trifled with to say the least.\n\nAdditionally, "real" combat features a not visually impressive, but still very immersive and fun combat system. You will find yourself strategizing against your opponent, anticipating his moves and stamina, spotting weak points in his armor. You will want to duel your cohorts almost constantly, when facing Hank, the fully armored Zweihander ♥♥♥♥ victim in the comments. I found myself circling with him in a defensive posture and thinking, "First, he'll aim to parry, strike, backpedal and swing, then disengage and recover." You will feel A LOT of satisfaction when your opponent executes precisely as you anticipated before you press the attack. It will drive you to almost never want to make things in the game again, only steal and kill from those who do.","September 28, 2014","true","112.2"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","34","49","0","3"

Even though it's current content is limited, this game has absolutely AMAZING potential. The concept is truly awesome. However, there are some pretty serious issues with the game.\n\nAside from exploiters and trolls, the engine the game runs on is utterly terrible. The engine cannot currently support 64 people (or even 20 very active players) without a substantial amount of serverside lag. This isn't something that can be fixed. It has to do with a memory limitation of the 32 bit process that the engine uses. Until they remake the game on another engine, an MMO with 10,000 people per world will be entirely unplayable (no matter how much they break up the world into individual areas with their own server).\n\nSecondly, the combat system, while very interesting in concept, is horrible. I understand what the developers were going for, but what they designed is too clunky to be enjoyed.\n\nLastly, the developers are doing an excellent job smashing bugs and fixing other errors. Even if they can fix the exploits and remaining game-breaking bugs, it is still difficult to recommend LiF:YO for $40. The server and engine issues cannot be fixed without using a different engine. The only exception would be if someone has ten to twenty friends to play with and are willing to wait a few months for more content.","October 25, 2014","false","473.7"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","40","60","0","2"

Personally, it took me and a few friends a week or two to actually get into the "mid-game" of Life Is Feudal. Through lots of struggling and crashes we eventually became the strongest and best on the server, we were addicted. For new players, this game is extremely difficult but very immersive. I can not stress enough to new players to push through the beginning grind so they can experience the rest of the game. I feel as if more stuff should be added to the beginning of the game to make it more fun for newer players, however.\n\nThe skills tree is very well thought out, however it features some bottlenecks that must be overcome. I very rarely say this, but I enjoy how this game forces you to play with friends to make the game a little easier. In saying this, roles come into play. Whenever we play, we usually designate a farmer, blacksmith and builder, as these are the roles needed to quickly surpass the early game. I almost always play the farming role at the start as I enjoy seeing how a few seeds that you scraped up from the ground begin to become a vast farm that surrounds your town. Most of the other skill trees in the game also flourish in a similiar way, such as going from constructing chicken coops and shacks to beautiful multi-story houses and towering walls.\n\nDuring our time in Life Is Feudal, we rather quickly noticed the older aged community. We made many friends with people 20 or even 30 years older than us. The only major problem we had with the community was that some of the older folks (a lot, actually) disliked PvP and stuck to strictly PvE. This anti-PvP community here in Australia at least is quite worrying for the future of the game, as removing one of the main elements to a game like this makes it ever more boring. My group and I all enjoyed the threat of having some armed dudes try and take us down because they were worried that we would become powerful, and it would be great if one day we came across a server that didn't shun it. On the topic of PvP, the weapons and fighting in the game have come a far way, however I hope they do fix some little things in time for the MMO to avoid ♥♥♥♥♥ running about with no armor and bows just to get some easier kills.\n\nOverall I look forward to the MMO and would recommend that you buy this game when it goes on sale for the release, and remember, life is feudal..","November 13, 2015","true","700.5"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","6"

As a longtime fan of open sandbox games going back to MUDs I love hardcore sandbox action.  However good the idea though, don't think this one is going to be the next Ultima Online or EvE:online sans spaceships.\n\nYou can read alot about the gameplay and unfinished state, but really the developer is small and needs funds to make anything happen.  I won't knock that.  I for one was willing to invest a few dollars in the idea.\n\nHowever upon playing for quite a long time it’s my honest opinion the game is structurally flawed.  Read that as I do not think their current engine and code is capable of being ported to an MMO framework and from what I have seen so far, I'm skeptical that it will even be stable as a Minecraft style dedicated server game - EVER.\n\nMany others have detailed problems so far, but I can say that this game currently (NOV2014) does not support most video cards and you will spend around 5-10 minutes loading into most servers only to have no sound and quite probably crash within 1 minute of dropping in.  This has something to do with the terraforming and other stuff I know nothing about.\n\nThis is not the review I want to leave.  I love the idea.  Hope this company can make it happen, or another larger developer can buy it and make it what it should be.  There is a demand for hardcore sandbox action in this environment and as an MMO it can be profitable for decades, just look at the EVE:Online model that has thrived even with internet spaceships which turns alot of hardcore RPG'rs off.

About an hour and a half later we have successfully tunneled well into the ground, finally uncovering the prize: Iron ore. As we are rejoiceing about advancing into the iron age. We turn around and see that our tunnel has collapsed and we cant get out... So we try the pray abilty and it does not work, we try despretrly to mine our way out but we cant, there was no place to but the stuff we were mining out therefore there was no way to get out. We even try to call an admin to get us out but had no luck. About an hour later I decide that I will kill him and he will come back and mine me out. So I hack him to death and he respawns, but apprantly he spawned on the very south tip of the map... Seems legit. Even though we were in the north. So another 30 mins goes by and finally he arrives and then I think to myself "It would be pretty funny if I tryed prayed again and it spawned me home" BOOM I hit 7 and I spawned at my house.             10/10 would get stuck in tunnel with a harry Norsemen again.","December 17, 2015","true","119.4"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","70","30","43","28","1"

This makes coordinating a rendezvous with your friends much easier and drastically improves the multiplayer experience.\nAs you’ll find with other game’s of this type, the relationships with other players is a fascinating experience. For the most part other players typically pursue a Lord of the Flies mentality and will often exert their power over those that have a weak footing in the game’s hierarchy. However, when you encounter other players that are helpful it makes the game much easier to digest and enjoy.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLife is Feudal is very clunky and not polished at the moment. Menu and interface options aren’t intuitive and present themselves as overly complex.\nComplete lack of a tutorial, which is understandable for an “Early Access” title, but you should be aware none-the-less.\nSingle-player is difficult to swallow as most other players will just grief you over and over again. Playing with your friends is the only way to currently guarantee a good time.\nOutside of the medieval aspects, this game is more of the same if you’ve played Rust or DayZ. I would argue that the features are much deeper than what Rust has to offer and Rust is Life is Feudal’s closest likeness.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?\n\nDue to the nature of multiplayer shenanigans, I often had to play without my sound on. Other players are often rude and mean, which can lead to profane language and crude lingo. There is also combat and violence, but I felt as though the graphics weren’t grand enough to matter in that regard.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nAs a multiplayer game there is no completion per say. I did build a number of structures and survived for a number of hours.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a redlight.\n\nThe content that is currently offered is just not worth the asking price of $39.99. If you were a gamer that REALLY enjoyed Rust, then you will be getting your money’s worth in this title as the content is better. Outside of that demographic, I just don’t see the appeal of paying a large amount of money to experience a lesson in human nature (i.e. griefing) and confusing gameplay (lack of tutorial). This may change as the game updates, so please check back here for any changes in my preview.\n\nReviewer:\n\nMisterS42\n\nA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com","October 20, 2014","false","19.3"," 48 of 76 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","48","76","0","0"

I know that comparisation is overused, but in the case of Life is Feudal it's not too far away. I remember my friends and me talking about the "downsides" of Minecraft, and what we would want in a "Minecraft 2": More crafting, better engine, better graphics, some sort of a combat system other than LMB spam and again, more crafting.\n\nLife is Feudal pretty much is exactly that. It's not blocky at all and doesn't feat creepers, but that's it :P\n\nThe crafting variety is very large, the chains can be HUGE (Growing chickens to make dung to fertilize soil to grow flax to make fibres to make yarn to make ropes to make an arbalest etc). The price is high for an early access, but in my view it's worth it.\n\nHOWEVER the game is very slow paced, which actually is a good thing. Just keep this in mind when thinking about buying the game: If you only "casually play a little", LiF might be too time intensive for that.\nAlso you need some kind of technological expertise when trying to play on your own. If you dont have it you should play on another server. "Single player" works fine  for a week but then usually crashes, leaving your save corrupted and you unable to play without setting it all up again (21.02.15). I hope this is a priority issue because I'm really tired of all the database work just to avoid that my savegames are gone ;)\n\nThis kind of "big" issue still doesn't keep me from spending most of my time with this game, therefor I can only recommend it in all ways :P Not perfect, but going to be ;)","February 21, 2015","true","299.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","1"

This is something personal, but in my eyes it is the most promising indie game for all of 2014 and the first half of 2015.\n\nHowever, everyone who is thinking about purchasing this game should weigh pro's and con's and decide for himself/herself if he/she really wants to have this game, since the complexity of some game mechanics and the large amount of time you need to devote to achieve a decent understanding of the game, probably scare a lot of people off only after a few minutes of playing the game.\n\nFor those who absolutely adore games that need some time to get used to and to get started, this is for you. Unlike in a few other games, such as the infamous 'The Stomping Land', the building is not restricted to only a few buildings and objects, but it takes quite some time to reach the stage of actually constructing something big, so if you look for a game where you can build a castle within ten hours, then you are wrong with LiF:YO.\n\nI would also highly recommend only to play with a few friends, the more the better, as the unique skill system prevents one individual from learning all the skills that are out there, meaning that specializing on a skill tree (e.g. logging or terraforming), as the max cap of skill point will only be enough to absolutely maximize one skill tree.\n\nIn general this game is great fun when you are with other people, but it is only a glimpse at the size and massiveness that LiF:MMO will bring in the third quarter of 2015.","September 20, 2014","true","484.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","3"

By this, I simply mean that while at first not knowing/understanding much, I came across one person, then a couple more people, etc, until eventually (my favorite moments in the game) this group of ours had owned a small farming/fishing/trade village. Needless to say, the very first 6 hours or so of game-time was quite unfamiliar and I had a lot of help. But from that point on, I realize now that there are probably slim-to-none other games that can replicate what Life Is Feudal is about. What do I mean? How can I say that (with only just one review/little experience)?\n\nThis game boils down to having patience and having the ability to take in advice/learn from others. If you have no patience or have no interest in taking advice or learning from others, you won't enjoy this game to its fullest potential!\n\nThe grind can be offsetting, the in-depth complex skilltrees can be confusing, but the learning and level of detail put into this game... I have not found one in this similar era/style, to be better. And I am still looking till this day for one to top it.\n\nYou start off with basic character customization. Couple different race options, hair-styles, facial hair; you get the jist. From then, you either have no idea what to put what points into which stat/skill, or looked up a general guide and understand. If you didn't, which I didn't (at first), you'll then load into the game and be off to your new 'life'.\n\nThe very first thing I can say that differs from most games: the controls. The way in which you switch in and out of different modes. Then, the way in which you interact with your environment. Not sure since when, but luckily now, you can Mass Produce things, which makes (incoming tip) gathering something such as Plant Fiber, so much easier. Now, you can follow the Tutorial, which guides you to making Primitive Tools. There are a plethora of them, each correlating with different crafts/skills. Once you have the Primitive Tools, you start to attempt to build things. You need resources of different types, in order to construct certain things. So you branch out to other skilltrees. Long story short, there is so much to do in this game that you could sit for 12 hours straight on this and not realize how long it's been!\n\nWhat I will not do is list pros/cons. I feel this game has enough positives in its arsenal to warrant at least a try. Hell, I was on a certain server or two, got really far in my skilltrees, then said server or two either would wipe their servers, or would be inactive/shutdown for a bit of time. I just recently got my gaming-motivation back and not even a few days later, I reinstalled this game and might even log back in after completing this review.\n\nWill you enjoy it? I have no damn clue. I think if you have a reasonable amount of time, a reasonable amount of patience and learning skills.. I *think* this game deserves a shot on your computer. Try it. I would also suggest something else, in terms of how you can get the game, but I will not say on this review (message me 'G). What I do think, though, is that if you are a person who enjoys a challenge; maybe even possess a taste for Medieval Realism, then I am confident you will enjoy this game as much as I have for my not-so-lengthy time spending (60 hours, to me, is quite a bit >.<)...\n\nFeel free to add me on Steam if you need any advice or help, I'll gladly play as well if time permits.\n\nHope this review helped, even a little!

Fascinated by the history of feudal times and want to live it just a little?  Know the theories of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber and are interested in the sociological concepts of individualism and collectivism and want to try living in an age with a whole other mindset?  Or just love gearing up in metal stuff and hitting people with swords?  You will enjoy this game.\n\nNegatives:- This is where it gets hard.  Having played over 1000 hours before making this review.  just about all the things that I would have seen as a negative have improved or been fixed altogether.  The dev team has been brilliant, and if they keep delivering like they have, LiF:YO will go from being a great Alpha to a fantastic release.  Anyone who wrote a review not recommending the game essentially because it is Alpha should do the honest thing and try the game out again, then adjust their review if the problems they experienced have lessened or gone away.\n\nGameplay:-  The most important thing to get right playing this game is to play it with other people.  Seriously.  If I had a thin leather for every player I've seen try to solo this game, and after a day or three depart forever leaving nothing but a tiny plaster shack, a furnace, and some unfinished wattle fencing, I'd have enough to armor 100 novice archers.  Remember, life is feudal.  In feudal times the average serf lived within spitting distance of at least a dozen other average serfs.  "Ah!" I hear you say; "serfing isn't for me, I'll be a Lord or at least someone rich enough to own flanged mace!".  Sure, in which case you'll need to be around even more people.  Coz heres the thing ok, Life is Feudal is about feudal life.  You ain't going to build any legends or awesome stories on your own.  Join a community, build a community, invite your friends, make new ones, whatever it takes, play this game with as many other people as you can.\n\nWhat could be improved:-  We're still waiting on a number of important features to be added, but LiF developers have been consistent in delivering updates and have issued a time frame for key updates to come.  In terms of adding to gameplay, all I'd suggest is added variation to life events.  Given there is no specific end game, interest in the game comes through experiencing different things.  Therefore the game is improved through increased variation of features and of random events.  Weather could have more influence on a range of gameplay aspects, illness (and alchemical medicines) could be introduced, random OP animals, NPCs in distress, custom weapons crafting, random disasters, and above all anything that enhances group-oriented and co-dependent play.  Why is there no specific end game?  Because this is about life... is... feudal, remember?","February 15, 2015","true","067.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

The multiplayer is what really makes this game, the ability to group up with friends on your own personal server and to then start your own little village is really fun.\n\nThere are multiple professions for you to pick and choose from. The range from farming, to mining or to even hunting. If you can think of a profession that is vital to a Medieval village then, it is in there.\n\nThere are a few headscratching moments like having to learn how to wear leather armour before being able to use a bow. I don't really understand that to be perfectly honest. If it wasn't for one of my friends being a tanner then I'd never be able to become a Archer.\n\nOverall, the game has a long way to go before it meets it's goal but with buying this game in early access, you're supporting the devs in reaching that goal.","September 9, 2015","true","27.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I p[ayed if for a little bt in early alpha phase and decided that there were nough people involved that my opiniion wouldnt matter too much, as I dont have a ton of time t game ut all the time consistantly like some people. I think this version of Life is feudal is worth a buy just as much as the upcoming MMO. the reason why I like the Life is Feudal your own, is because most of the servers are Community run by players and its a very cool Experience. If you ike medievil Roleplay and really dont ike games that are too easy then get LIF YO its a good buy with hundereds of hours of gameplay and if you stream or love roleplay in general this game s for you, you can do so much you can be anything you like. you can be the sole provider of materials that everyone needs for there buildings the opprotuines are endless in my opinion and the first chance I get ill be streaming it again.

With a overall great community and interesting and engaging building/ crafting mechanics. Easy to learn and very hard to master. If you like medieval times, and working for what you get I recommend this game.\n\nIf you are the type of player that wants to run around killing people without putting any time in, I would recommend you look else were. Not to say your play style is not welcomed, but game mechanics make players wait days, and weeks before they can craft their first sword. After that you have to wait a few weeks before you can actually use any good gear. Simply put if you want things to be done instantaneous you will not enjoy this game. It is very slow paced, but personally I like that aspect.\n\nIf you enjoy making friends, and working together with other people, or to role-play heavily then I would recommend this game. The game mechanics forces players to work together to create any mid to end game buildings or gear. All skill trades intersect with each other, and all of them need each other's help. Because of this set up you will have to group up or trade if you want to create end game gear.\n\ndevs are very good about updates (even if they fall behind) and are constantly listening to feed back and improving the core mechanics. The game is a bit expensive but I believe that it is worth every dollar.","November 13, 2015","true","433.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

(In my experience people seldom have incentive to finish a project once they all ready have been paid).\n\nThe game is so boring that even when you log into a "pve" server sad bored players all run to kill you with a two handed sword...once you are killed you will respawn on a map that is so small that someone will kill you again before you even get your hotbar set up (you will be naked at this point and your skills will drop below the minimums because of the death penalty).\nThe game is not intellectual at all, those that say that it is must be the types that don't know milk comes from a cow.  It is very intuitive and typical of survival games.  However this is the most tedious one in history...it feels like the game makers are trying way too hard to keep players from progress because there is no content. I will discuss only two of the simple tasks made horrible.  Digging...digging is so slow and boring I could LITERALLY go outside and dig a larger hole in half the time it takes inside the game...(I am talking clay soil folks).  Eating...to make it feel oooohhhh scarrry you will have to eat 40 roots in a single day to keep your health up...A human can go 3 weeks without food in real life but for some reason game makers want to make you eat like a pregnant 10k lb Hippo (hungry hungry hippos).  Oh, did I mention it will take about an hour of your real life to collect 40 roots and you will have burned up about 5 roots doing this act LOL.\n\nIn Conclusion...if you have $40 burning a hole in your poket, have never played a survival game before, and don't mind someone boosing thier low self esteme by keeping you from even playing then you have found your game...otherwise wait two years and see if they even finish the project.","January 27, 2015","false","7.1"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","33","51","10","0"

As you continue to play the game it becomes apparent though. Most of the "survival" genre fanbase is looking for something they can call "realistic" without having to put in the effort this game requires. Most gamers these days are all about instant gratification with minimal effort. Everything in the game takes time to build and to become proficient at. Couple that with a fanbase where 1/2 or more of the players come from games like DayZ or Minecraft, where important items are found at random on the ground and crafting is simple, and it shouldnt come to anyone's surprise that there would be enough bad reviews on steam to turn heads.\n\nAll that being said, this game is a community effort that is made more enjoyable by either a small group of dedicated players or a larger one all pitching in for a specific goal. For me, its been a great experience with very few things to complain about. I have put a good chunk of time into it so far and plan to continue doing so. To be honest, it would be a disservice to the devs not to give them credit for what they have accomplished with this game, which is why i felt the need to write this in the first place.

Life Is Feudal is by far one of the BEST sandboxes ive ever played. Its got unique systems and mechanics for crafting, forging, cooking, alchemy and other things like terraforming and logging. ALL of which have their own skill sets and levelling so you won't progess skills the same way twice, or find the same items & ingredients in the same place which is a nice touch. Depending on which server you are on, there are also variable stat & skill caps this means that if you specialise in a certain skill it can determine how useful you will be in building settlments, and once reach the leveling limit of one skill, thats it Reach the stat and skill caps and leveling up will be a distant memory as they will become rare occurences. This means prople of different skills will have to work together and pool resources and skills, especially if a battle takes place in nearby settlements/towns and repairs have to be made quickly. For example, one person of your group/guild might be a master blacksmith, while another will be a master Logger, so choosing which skill to level completely is CRUCIAL.\n\nYou basically start the game with nothing but food scraps and rags for clothes, so your first instinct is to create primitive gear which can be done quite quicker than you would expect. As you start to meet random people in your travels, you will also start to learn of the surrondings more and where developments have been started. I remember one time where I spawned into the world and I basically turned right and saw an ENTIRE FORTRESS built far off into the distance on the other side of an island, and as I explored around there was the odd camp/shack then a small town where groups have formed a guild. It cleary shows the sheer scope of how important working with people is in this game.\n\nAnother strong point is the combat mechanics, if you have played the Mount & Blade games you will feel right at home here with the directional movements and there are even group formations to be used in a battle! Formations like shield walls, phalanx/wedge, and defensive circle formations can be applied and changed on the fly in mid battle, VERY useful for when 2 armies or more are battling it out.\n\nThe final thing you will notice (and the most notable when you start the game and spawn into a world) is the graphics. At the moment there are Direct x 7 and 9 graphics, DO NOT let the discussions and reviews fool you! This game is a visual master piece considering the DX7 and 9 graphics closely resemble TES4: Oblivion's graphics, but with the fast approaching release date the Direct x 11 graphics will make this one of the most beautiful medieval themed sandboxes ever made!\n\nOverall i give this game a 8.5/10 and thats just at an EARLY ACEESS point of veiw as Bitbox are at the moment of smoothing everything out for the release and beginning to implement future features upon post release. This has been one of the most comprehensive, immersive and challenging games ive played to date. Looking forwand to more!\n\n11/10 would recommend this game to those who have never played sandboxes or similar themed games like MMORPG's as it is worth the experience.","November 13, 2015","true","45.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

This is a very much scaled down version for continued development. You will have the ability to do many of the things coming to the MMO, some much sooner than later, some not for a bit of time yet.\nNo, I am not at liberty to share much info, being a humble test guy, I will say this.. this is going to be the 'must have' of Medieval style games. No magic, no orcs, no elves, just a pretty much true to life feudal world, where you can be literally anything by striving for it. The game has open PvP but with a price. If you feel the need to be a bandit then thats fine, but every action will mark you, killing an innocent will cost you until your a marked criminal with no coming back, and if you die, you lose massive skills, whereas being a highwayman and just robbing people will only mark you as a thug. Meanwhile fighting and being a hero in the warfare will gain you status, along with helping out folks. So its pretty much set like real life, you can be / do what you want, but actions have consequences. It also requires you realize your not alone in the world. You cant do it all. Everyone serves a role, from the butcher, the baker to the candlestick maker, even the village monk / priest, or gaurd. IE I am not a fighter myself, so I really rely on the combat guys, but they rely on others to cook for them. etc.\nThis is shaping up to be great!","September 20, 2014","true","272.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","1"

Firstly, something I must of course say, the game is early-access alpha. It is still in development and so I appreaciate this and will not comment on the large amount of bugs and other "early-access" esque issues that the game has.\n\nI think that the paramount issue with Life is Feudal: YO is the simple fact that the advertisement for the game is misleading. Not on purpose mind, I simply feel as though the developers struggled to catagorize the game they have begun to produce and so consumers who stumble across it are not entirely sure what they are purchasing. I myself am very much into the Mount & Blade franchise and when I stumbled across this game I (and friends from my gaming community) expected it to be like a much larger open world RPG version of the mod for Mount & Blade: Warband, Persisitent World. The game showed pictures of an adventurer moving throughout a completely player made land. This gave me and my friends the misconception that the game was a Skyrim meets Mount & Blade meets Runescape/LOTR Online - what sounded like a perfect compliation.\n\nIn actual fact the game is rust meets minecraft. It focuses on the survival aspect far more than the roleplaying rpg medieval aspect. This should be advertised FAR more clearly as survival game fans would appreciate it much more than Medieval role-play fans. Let me try to explain in a DayZ way, the server owners and their friends run around in full armour (like bandits/heroes) whilst everyone else hops from server to server with a few rags, they try to do something but every time they leave the server are forced to try again thanks to a lack of server favouriting implementation. This is fine, particularly in Alpha, but not what I thought when I was buying it.\n\nGood game for what it is in its current stage, but misleading in its advertisement and so that is forcing me to give it a negative review.\n\nBuy the game if you want a Rust esque survival, not a medieval RP RPG MMO sandbox game.","December 25, 2014","false","12.6"," 174 of 311 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","174","311","7","20"

The game is somewhat unoptimized and using a older game engine and because of this does not look really all that amazing. But visuals dont count as much as the amount of fun that you have while playing the game. I would recommend this title to anyone who likes a time consuming and indepth medieval life simulator.

(So yes it is a simulator but not to the level that we have previously known it, you get invested in your players as you roleplay out their lives and complete many, many tasks)\n\nAs a SP game it will be hard to manage your land and its needs along with other players in the MP realm...\nYou may choose to be a travelling tradesmen specialised in your skill trading for what you need or you might choose to join a group and move forward in leaps and bounds for the greater good of the group...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/290080/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat happens if you take a healthy chunk of Rust, add sprinkles of Wurm Online, flavour it with bits of Mount & Blade and top it all off with a mixture of Ultima, Darkfall and EVE Online? Whether your answer is "A flavourless, chunky paste" or "A gourmet masterpiece", both have relevance when it comes to BitBox Ltd.'s first major project Life is Feudal (LiF). Yet still, while combining the well-known aspects of games like those mentioned above, the devlopers claim that LiF is absolutely unique and are working on some features to set it apart from its main competitors.\n\nIn essence, LiF is a medieval themed sandbox online RPG, including all the survival and crafting mechanics the industry is so crazed about as of late. Familiarly, you are thrown into an immense world with nothing but some dirty clothes, provisions to last you a few days and your bare hands to help you survive. The now well honed instincts of a survival game expert should kick in immediately and drive you to forage for food, look for some basic resources to craft primitive tools with - you know the drill all too well. Where LiF differs is its skill system. Every character has a set of attributes and skills which will determine his ability to pretty much do anything, from a "Nature Lore" skill that will help you find more edibles on the ground to an array of crafting skills such as Carpentry, Masonry or Smelting. LiF is not intended to be played all by yourself and you will quickly find out why, as there is a skillcap in place, preventing you from being perfect at everything. Not long into the game you will have to decide which paths to go down and which ones to leave to other players. Eventually, your quaint community will should consist of a number of specialists working together. Building said community is one of the key features of LiF, as it offers every player total control over his environment. You can terraform the landscape, flatten out areas or dig up moats for your improvised stronghold, mine for minerals in underground tunnels (the world is voxel-based, much like Minecraft but with smooth edged) or build structures - watchtowers, shacks or entire castle towns, provided you have the resources for it and architects skilled enough to build something more complex than an axe made of a stick, plantfibre and flintstone. Another important skill-tree offers various combat skills, increasing your efficiency with certain weapons, armour or even horses and mounted combat (not yet implemented). This will help you fend off agressive animals or indeed other players, as LiF features full PvP and looting. While there are some penalties to going on a murder spree, it is an option and you will surely see more foe than friend. To help bring structure into this potentially chaotic environment, an upcoming feature will include land claims for individual players and for player-owned factions. These lands will be completely safe, but can be contested and captured in PvP faction vs faction wars. Three faction types are planned to exist: Bands/Orders, Fiefs and Kingdoms, the difference being size, influence over other factions and the amount of claimable land. This feature, however, will NOT be part of the game you see linked to this very review. LiF will effectively be released in two different versions: LiF: Your Own (reviewed, current build) and LiF: MMO. The latter will, according to the developers, feature a true massively multiplayer online persistent world with more than 10.000 players, a much bigger world and many features not available in LIF: Your Own, but is still well beyond our reach. LiF: Your Own meanwhile features dedicated serverplay with a maximum of 64 players playing on a 3x3km map.\n\n"Life is Feudal is a Unique Sandbox MMORPG." is the claim made by the developers. Does LiF live up to it? While the current Early Access release build is actually still in early alpha, it is plain to see the effort behind the project, as well as the sheer amount of features available now and the even bigger number of things "not yet implemented", but already planned (horses, deeper combat, even more crafting). "Life is Feudal" is furthermore not just the title of this game, but one of its main directives. Survival is hard, especially when you're on your own. Learning skills takes time and dedication. Death is best avoided. If all of this sounds appealing to you, giving this game a chance would definitely be recommended. Be warned, though, because the current build (20/9/14) is pretty much as early as Early Access gets, so you will run into bugs, balancing issues and many buttons with the "Not yet implemented"-stamp on them. Buying the game now means you are willing to help fund the further development of this title and be eligible to offer your own feedback.\n\nSo tighten your straps, pull up those pontaloons and train your swordarm, things are about to get medieval up in here!","September 20, 2014","true","178.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

(Just to give you an idea of my preferences.)\n\nThis game *does* have some bugs remaining. I had some sort of memory leak (or other compouning problem) and sound issues after playing for awhile. It became unbearable after something like 5 or 6 hours (but my system is pretty high-quality, so your mileage may vary). However, a simple restart of the game solved the problem and only took a minute. This is not game-breaking.\n\nI love this game... but it won't be for everyone.\n\nSome things to note:\nA) Most servers use conservative server settings that are pretty close to default.\nB) At default settings, things in this game can take a long time and a lot of effort to achieve. You'll have to earn it.\nC) With default settings, you almost cannot survive alone. (Farming/nature lore can both allow you to forage for food, but cooking requires multiple skill sets that will almost undoubtedly require multiple participants. If you plan on jumping into the game with no friends to help you and with no idea what you're doing... you will probably fail.\nD) Some servers have much more newb-friendly settings... look for high level/stat caps and high resource gather multipliers/exp multipliers.\nE) Part of the appeal of this game *IS* the fact that it takes so much effort to be successful... reaching a milestone can be very rewarding. I'm looking forward to getting my first shack built.\nF) There's a lot to learn about this game, the wiki is your friend.\nG) Something that I had to find out through experience and lots of looking online: Many abilities require advanced skills with a skill level of 0... but they must still be unlocked to be used, and many require lots of skill levels in a prerequisite skill to be unlocked. IE: cutting billets for cooking fuel requires lvl 0 carpentry, but carpentry doesn't unlock until lvl 60 logging.\nH) Working with terrain is tedious and very time consuming... don't plan on getting in here and levelling mountains like in minecraft... you'll be digging the rest of your life... it's just implausible.\nI) The skill system is very detailed and random events can occur. I cut my hand while trying to forage and it bled for like 10 minutes. Not life threatening... but interesting. This game feels kindof like Neverwinter or D&D meets ARK set in medieval times.\nJ) There's no magic (although prayer can have supernatural effects [including teleportation]).\n\nSo far this is just a description of the main points of the game as I see it at the moment.\nNow for the good and bad.\n\nGOOD:\n-Devs are pretty active.\n-Plenty of servers with a variety of settings.\n-Very playable, few bugs.\n-Very unique.\n-Highly replayable. (partly because of how limited you usually are in character development)\n-Very conducive to roleplay. (Though it's often not required/expected)\n-The music. (I love it, totally my own opinion)\n\nBAD:\n-A little expensive for an alpha game.\n-Graphics are very mix-n-match. (IE: character model looks amazing, but the hair models look atrocious... kinda weird)\n-I love the focus on team-play... however, there *needs* to be a single skill set that will allow you to survive in the wilderness on your own. Sure, you won't be eating cake... and it's likely you'll spend most of your time hunting/fishing/gathering to support yourself... but it seems unrealistic that you can't have a single survival skill that enables you to build a simple campfire, hunt/fish, and grill up a bit of dinner. This could also make for a new skill tree leading into "scouting" skills.\n\n","October 12, 2015","true","19.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","1"

It keep the toxic younger community away. Death is something that isn't taken lightly, punishing criminals (PKers) with much higher skill loses, in a game where skill can be very hard to earn.

However, there are flaws that I must state in the current version of the game.\n\nPro's:\n\nThe game is very community friendly. You don't have to worry about getting non-stop attacked or killed. Most servers don't allow random and no reason killing. Where as in games like DayZ, or Rust you have people who just constantly kill for no reason.\n\nThis game is very relaxing. Those nights you get off from work and don't feel like just running around and gunning people down in FPS games. This game is great as to where you can just sit, listen to the very relaxing and beautiful music, and build while maybe watching a movie or something.\n\nCan do and build what you want, and how you want. If you want to take a week or so to build a huge underground fort, you can. If you want to build a stronghold, you can. Or perhaps a beach farm, you can. You can pretty much do what ever you want in this game, if you have the time and patience.\n\nGreat and beautiful graphics. They are just stunning and beautiful to sit and stare at. Very fleshed out as well.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\nOptimization is not great. If you run it on medium or low, you can roughly get around 20-30 FPS with a mid tier PC. If you want to run anything above that, you'll need to have the most modern and updated gaming computer. Even then, there's no telling if you'll get anything above 30fps.\n\nWorlds are just dead, and rely too much on player to player interaction. The servers are not dead, just the world feels really empty. There's hardly any wildlife, and the map is so big, you'll rarely come across other players, even on 64 player servers filled. The building feature even revolves way too much on player interaction, because how many items you need to build certain things, and how long they take to aquire them.\n\nObtaining weapons take a very long time. You can almost immediatly get tools, and a sling with rocks, however if you want to use a bow, crossbow or sword it, takes a whole town to wield them, because first you have to build a smithy, which requires all these other objects that require skills, and the skill like contruction take a very long time to level up if you're by yourself.\n\nThe requirement for a friend/s to play with you. If you want to get anywhere without taking a few weeks to build a small town, you need atleast a friend or two. The length it takes to collect items from things like tree's, rocks, ores, and even food is so long, and most items you get is only 1 every 15-20 seconds, which is not a lot seeming as how you need around 10 things you may or may not get from searching for a simple fence.\n\nSome skills like fishing is very obsolete because of how they were implemented. I spent over 45 minutes trying to catch one fish, because somehow in 1,000BC fish are so rare. Then when you get a fish and cook it, your campfire somehow gets broken, and the fish only gives you about 20 hunger regen, when something like an apple which is pretty common and you collect around 23 in 5 seconds gives like 17-20 hunger regen.\n\nHunting is also pretty obsolete because of how hard/long it takes to get a bow and how little wildlife there is.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyhow my total ranking is, 7.5/10. There's a lot of potential here, and I hope we get more patches before the september release.","July 4, 2015","true","17.1"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","23","35","2","0"

Some people want to be barbarians, some want to be bandits, a lot more just want to coexist. In the end, your experiences depend on which you choose.\n\nBarbarians (people who run around naked screaming obscenities ad decapitating deer) tend to add a bit of comedic relief to the trying environment that is LiF, but may also come and burn your house down and steal your chickens.\n\nBandits come in two flavors. They either roleplay and hold you up much like a common highwayman, or run around in packs of 4+ and just kill some poor naked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ under the illusion that they have gear worth taking.\n\nCoexisting countrymen constantly care for each other like cousins. The core concept is to cooperate in a calculated campaign of carpentry, construction, calipers, and cooking. This competing collection of corroborative characters can, and commonly do, cause caustious- ok enough with the alliteration.\n\ntl;dr If you aren't a bard or bandit you typicaly form a group and make friends through helping each other build a small settlement. If you are like me, you tend to do this with around 15 other people, the majority of which are on Teamspeak. The few times you get attacked either end in everyone dying or some lone wannabe bandit getting chased off by a dozen angry, heavily-armed and armoured peasants weilding the fruits of their labor as weapons of death.\n\nTo be fair, i have had my troubles wanting to play this game but this is for personal reasons. I can not handle stress due to a medical condition I have. This being said, you will stress a lot in this game. (Is that naked man on a horse really a bandit with his armour deequipped to lull us into a false sense of security, or is he some scrub fresh spawn that got lucky and found a horse already?) These are the questions that can get people killed, or get people killed. It is very rare for most people to trust one another on a server with known bandits and barbarians as they recruit more as the server grows. In the end though, this game is a delight to have in my steam library and I'm happy to have spent $40 on it.\n\nPlease read the comments to get a more updated look at my experience with the game as it develops.","November 10, 2015","true","724.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","4"

While yes it is one of those "survival sandbox" games which has (until 4 days after this review) been in early access, it is also one of the most original and expansive of those on offer.\nThe game itself has managed a wonderful feeling of immersion in its own world/lore. When you play it you can be quite content with the feeling of actually being in the world your character is surrounded by. I will now break this review down into a few sections:\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game takes a long time. That is a key point, do not expect to have a massive medieval castle and town within 5 hours of playing the game. Large parts involve effectively grinding (!FLUX! - players will know) to find the resources you need to construct/create the buildings/items you want. However teamwork is amazingly useful because it reduces the time needed to perform many actions. Such that imagine 1 person takes 1 hour to perform an action, 2 people would then take less than half an hour to do the same action.\n\nAlso as this is a survival game you need to gather food to survive. This is relatively simple if you have found a few reliably good quality apple trees. You will also need to 'rest' your character occasionally if performing tough work such as terraforming or construction etc.\n\nThis leads me onto another important point regarding skill progression. The game is designed, as I've said previously and as you will hear through this review, for teamplay. A limitation imposed by this is such that you cannot be an expert at everything! You have a limited number of skill points to distribute around the various skills (which unlock in a skill-tree type fashion). As you perform actions these skill points will be added to your skill in that action up to your limit (you can 're-spec' by downgrading your skills if needed). Because of this you will need a group to play with unless you set your game/server to have custom (default is 800 I think) levels of skill points.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThis game has looked absolutely fine throughout its development but its looming DX11 release looks incredible from what we've seen thus far. Other than this I cannot comment much on this point other than it runs very well without many framerate dips etc. so seems quite optimised.\n\nMusic/Audio:\n\nThe sound quality is great with well recorded clips for all actions and a nice atmospheric background soundtrack, although if playing for many hours at a time it can get a little repetitive.\n\nI'm not used to writing reviews (this is my first so I know I will have missed a lot) so please don't hate :P","November 13, 2015","true","290.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It requires a lot of time however, and can be very grindy.\n\nYou start off with a small amount of food and some rag clothing. From there it is up to you to start developing your character how you want. You can prospect the ground for ore, get the bark off a tree, collect sticks, search for edible food on the ground, etc\n\nHowever, actions take quite a bit o f time and do not always increase your skill.\n\nHere's one example. When you search the ground for food the action takes some time and often turns out no results. Tha's because action success is based on random chance.  If your action is not succesful you don’t gain skill. If the actions is successful you do gain skill, but you don’t improve your chances of being successful in the future.\n\nI posted on the fourm that I wonder why games like this are so mundane when they could easily take place in a much more imaginitive world, and within 5 min the Dev banned me with no warning.\n\nHere's the post that got me banned: https://sites.google.com/site/thebannedpost/\n\nNOTE: This review got me perma-banned.

AWESOME.  This game is being designed to be effectively limitless in possibilities, realistic ones at that, and the current limits, considering it is still early access, are constantly being expanded.  Great appearance helps as well.  PvP is fun.\n\nThe one note that I will make is that this game is not for the weak of heart.  To be successful takes a LOT of time and effort as well as a group of friends.  It is incredibly difficult to setup a successful community with a cooperative group of 10 people, and even more difficult to do on your own, though it can be done.  This isn't the result of a game flaw, this is how the game is intended to be.  Forest disappears very quickly once you start constructing even small buildings, as the materials gained from harvesting things like trees is pretty realistic.  Unlike other games, new trees don't just sprout up in their place, you need to plant more.  Planting is easy, but even with ideal weather conditions it takes real life days (up to a week I think) for the trees to mature into a useful, harvestable material.  This is just one example.  This game is difficult, and it is meant to be.  One HUGE advantage from this is that there are far fewer ♥♥♥ hats that just run around abusing people for the sake of doing so, and most of the time if someone does that they are banned.  The rationale is that if you want your character to be a bandit and steal from others, that is fine.  But if you're just going to grief people, that drives players off, resulting in smaller/fewer groups building on a server which ends up in server death.  The requirement of cooperation really encourages players to respect one another.  Players are also less likely to risk losing things, such as weapons, attacking other people unless there is a good reason, as replacing them takes a significant amount of time, work, and help from other people.\n\nIf you truly enjoy survival this game is for you.  You can always setup a local game and adjust the difficulty to be easy to do on your own, but most servers do NOT do that.\n\nDefinitely a great game with a great future.","October 22, 2015","true","52.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Nothing could ever quite match up.\n\nI seriously think this might be the one. And that's a big statement for me. *fans self* I'm getting a little emotional here.\n\nWhat struck me about this game is that it is a challenge. I appreciate that in order to get somewhere in this game - to accomplish anything - you must really pay attention. You won't find random epic loot in chests. You won't get neat armor from killing a bear. Bears don't wear armor. It just makes sense.\n\nI also really love that you can spend your time doing whatever it is that floats your boat. You don't HAVE to do anything to have a fulfilling game. It's a true sandbox.\n\nRight now, I'm playing on a fairly small server. There are usually 3 - 5 people playing at a time. But already, there is community. I can imagine that it will only improve once there are more players coming in. Because there are SO many skills, and so many jobs to do, trading and building alliances actually has meaning.\n\nObviously because it is in alpha, there are some bugs and improvements to be made. I'm confident that they'll be coming in time.\n\nThere are some things that seem overly difficult, although it may vary from server to server. For example, on my particular server, apples never grow back. We must plant and replant. Food is quite difficult to come by. Foraging for edible plants almost never finds anything.  A disproportionate amount of time is spent trying to find it, and hunger levels grow quite rapidly. I spend alot of time catching my breath, and waiting to be able to play again. After all that mining and lumberjacking, I would have thought my character would be fit enough to run for 20 seconds! :P\n\nOverall though, I really highly recommend this game. After just a few hours, I was hooked. There is a steep learning curve, but there are many resources online that will answer your questions.I'm very optimistic about this game's future, and I will definitely be spending a very large chunk of my time playing it.

I have invested 300+ hours into playing this game, and am extremely in love with the concepts brought in by the actual developers. And I have to say, no one wants this game to succeed more than me.\n\nHowever, as a fellow gamer, and enthusiast I feel I must bring this to the attention of the uninformed. And I do not do it to dismantle or deface. I do it because these issues MUST BE FIXED.  That being said, I'd like to get started.\n\nLife is Feudal's development team is shady.\n\nNow, it's unclear as to exactly who is calling the shots, perhaps it's known, but I personally do not know.\n\nWhat do I mean "Shady"?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nThere is poor communication between LIF Development team and the community. Month long silences and lack of actual updates on what the company is trying to achieve, progress and just really anything in general really define a bad public relation.\n\nThink: You've just sold 10k copies of your game, and you haven't updated us on what you're doing?\n\nI've been part of Alphas and betas before, and this is possibly the worst Alpha phase I've ever been apart of.\n\nSee, when you ask for money NOW in order to develop your game. You're expected to keep your users updated. And updated on your main site for everyone to see. WE expect to know what is going on. We want to know upcoming content, we want to know what you're working on, we want to know what issues you're having, what preperations you're taking, interviews, insights SOMETHING ANYTHING.\n\nYou won't see that here.\n\nYou see, LIF actually USED to kept us updated, even with the smallest of details. And personally, that was important to me, it let me know that the Dev team was passionate and working hard, and fed me the information I needed to know. But after the game got Green Lit, COMPLETE RADIO SILENCE.\n\nAND THATS WHAT MAKES IT SO SHADDDDY\n\nJUST LOOK\n\nAfter Steam sales: http://i.imgur.com/Fq3uL2G.png\nNotice THE HUGE TIME GAPS\nBefore Steam sales: http://i.imgur.com/oMzj5bv.png\n\nIt feels like the Devs made the quota, and are just messing around, losing interest on development. And that's TERRIBLE.\n\nI MEAN, why else would the live streaming, and daily posts just stop?\n\nAbsolutely Shady, and unfortunately, that's not the end of it.\n\nThis next part of my review is so unsettling and anger inducing to me, I have no idea how I can present it to you guys.\n\nSee, if you thought that Alpha without any insight or progress reporting was pretty shady, this next part is going to shock you.\n\nLIF:YO DEVELOPMENT TEAM MANIPULATES INFORMATION\n\nWhat do I mean by that? I mean that every single element that does not favor them positivly IS REDACTED. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Is this F*** North Korea?\n\nTake a look: http://i.imgur.com/EkatQwy.png\n\nThis is a post that was quoted by a user, that was posted in reply to what "Bobik" posted on the discussion board. The original post was deleted, as well as the actual post that Mr Bigdad posted. I was actually around at the time and saw the content of the original post. However, I cannot recite it word for word, I can tell you exactly what Bobik posted in essence.\n\nEssentially Bobik admitted to not expecting development to be getting "far".\n\nA comment that would essentially hurt the publicity of the game no doubt. When development doesn't think it's going to make it, it's sounds like a pretty screwed project to me personally. Any sense in a company would immediately do some sort of damage control right?\n\nRather than going the safe way, explaining that things have changed and the future is looking much more brighter, extending a hand to the community.\n\nLIF Dev team would much rather DELETE EVERYTHING. DELETE THE ORIGINAL POST.\n\nDELETE COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMMENTS. DELETE DELETE.\n\nAND THENNNNNNNN~\n\nCOMPLETELY F**** LIE\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sqXoNT3.png\n\nAre you serious? It's like they have 0 respect for the community that they're expecting to pay the bills. Lying straight to our faces.\n\nThey literally apply this practice with EVERYTHING. Especially users who leave negative criticism. Oh yeah, leave any sort of negative feed-back on their forums and discussion boards and guess what? ITS DELETED.\n\nSERIOUSLY?!?!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/leewells2000/recommended/290080/\n\nI for one, am going to stop my support of this game, until BETTER CHARACTER IS DISPLAYED by this company. I want formal apologies to the community, and I want transparency of the development.\n\nUntil then, I cannot, in good concious reccomend this game to anyone. AND THAT PAINS ME.\n\nBy now I suspect alot of you have lost interest. And that's how it should be for any company who lies and cheats in order to maximize sales. Until these issues are resolved within management, STAY AWAY.\n\nNow if you guys want to know what the actual game is about, continue reading.\n\nSo what's this game about? Well, you create a character and assign it starting stats. You pick a faction out of 3 (I'm pretty sure this will determine building types later) and Name you Character. When you start, you spawn randomly in a world. (Currently one static map) and you are thrust into the role of someone who is new to the world. You'll need to find food and Shelter.\n\nThere's various skills that you can level up, by doing different things. And each skill branches off from base skills. For example, if you progress down Forestry eventually you'll get to Logging, and leveling logging will eventually get you into Carpentry. The system in which the game is laid out on, is extremely deep. The game gravitates everyone to work together, much like in actual old medieval times!\nThe game naturally pushes you to work and play together, and not artificially either. Interactions with other players are intense and require you to decide if you want to use diplomacy, or perhaps just all out go agressive. Life is Feudal offers so much deepness that you'll quickly realize, that you're actually role playing the trade of your character. No other game has immersed me so much that I would play out the role of my character.\n\nThe game is all about building up a community of real players, who all do things that contribute to the betterment of the settlement. One of my personal favorite things about the game, is the Quality mechanic that they've introduced to us through the game. It is a genius and extremely well thought out mechanic. Every item, every building, every weapon, and every tool has to be crafted. And the only way to craft them, is by collecting the materials from the world. Every single resource, every rock, every Tree, every plant has a quality value. And those qualities help determine how well they perform when you craft something. It is a very welcoming mechanic, and adds a new level of deepness and involvement to the game.\n\nOverall, the game offers refreshing and mechanic rich gameplay that pulls you in and doesn't let go. At it's current form, it offers 40 Hours + of deep grabbing content. And while the graphics and interface are not up to par, we must remember that it is in it's Alpha Phase. And if one is being held back from experiencing this Gem of a game because of pricing, one can find solice that it is worth every penny.\n\nThat being said, due to the issues in management, and the absolute S***ty public relations, I cannot reccomend this game to you. As a company as reckless and so willing to censor and lie directly to our faces comes with a stigma.\n\nThis company needs to get it's s*** together and prove it can handle a single cent of yours. And sadly, it is not currently.\n\nAnd while the game itself may actually be addicting, it's completely USELESS if the company running it are unable to respect the gaming community.\n\nThanks for your time.","October 21, 2014","false","336.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","9"

The crafting system is very nicely done and the building system too but I think It could be improved. There is so much you can do it the game that playing alone isnt the best idea. Im playing with a firend for about 4 days and we only built one small wooden house. Although the progression is slow it dose feel more realistic and it can be fun once you complete something togheter with others. The game still feels like It isnt finished but the developers are still working on it and improving it every month so that's nice.

The bad reviews of this game are for two reasons: 1-on alpha the game had some bugs, low fps and low graphics; 2- (most of that bad reviews) - people who dont like games that you have to work on it to get something.\n\nThere are two types of games: games like CSGO,Battlefield,COD,etc  (games where you start with all of your weapons and you just have to play it) and games like this one ( games where you have to work hard to have your stuff).\n\nThis game is for the people who loves medieval era, roleplaying, pvp, and work like maniac! Dont get me wrong this game is amazing and with a lot of potencial, but for you to have sucess you have to have a lot of time invested in this game and playing with your friend help a lot too.\n\nSo what you need to know. . . When you creat a character, you can choose what you want it to be (stats, professions, looks), when you log in to the game you dont have any tools just cloth and some food but you can get tools from the nature arround you and then starting to craft and raise up your stats and professions.\n\nCrafting system: very complete i must say, you have a lot of things that you can create but you need to have the skill to do it.\n\nCombat system: is kind of diferent that you should expect, it takes a little of pratice but for this game it works pretty fine. When you are try to do some damage every things counts, lenght of your weapon, quality and combos that you use.\n\nPros of the game: really hardcore miedeval simulator, roleplay, community, crafting and combat system, graphics are most better then the alpha version.\n\nCons of the game: Optimization, the devs are still working on this subject. If you want to run this game on ultra... well you can dream about it xD You need a really good graphics card for that, but in medium that what i use and i have a gtx760 i run the game at 130 fps +/- depend on the server, so its getting better.\n\nI advice you to see some youtube videos, tutorials, streams and studd, if like what you saw, buy this game, its a really good game. Is that type of game that i was looking for so many years.\n\nTip: 1- If you can wait for some sales and buy this game always save some money;\n2- Buy the game before MMO is realease, because when it realese the game porbably will be more expensive and if you have bought this game before mmo realease you got one character slot for free on mmo.\n","February 4","true","277.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","11","14","3","0"

For me this is bad! Specially when the devs give them the right to change a lot.\nThe servers colapse a lot couse its too much or dont load......Alpha or not, its anoying\n- You can create a server with 100 multiplier on skill gain....What? Maybe de devs didint wanna have the label\nof grinders in their game, but a sandbox should have some.... You shouldnt max out your forestry skill in 1 hour.\nI tried to create the server myself...no luck........hours on end waiting....but it might be the day or the flux of ppls.\nBTW I choose the default which is 1 multiplier for skill gain and thats it.....No one would join me but I dont care.

I have over 400 hours for a reason and likely to put on a lot more.\n\nThings to remember: its early access and not the finished game, you play on player owned servers currently and all have their own sets of guidlines and rules, also different rates and maximum skill leveling abilities. The game is very craft centric so expect some aspects to be a long grind.\n\nSo far the game is very craft centric. You can blacksmith, build homes and castles, farm, tame animals, mine and log, if you can think up a craft in a fuedal era more then likely you can do it in game. To do this you need to collect resources or work out a deal to have others collect them for you. All of this and every aspect takes time. You will spend a lot of time building up to the point you envision your character to be. This is very grindy and definetely not for everyone. If the thought of spending a day or so moving dirt to level off an area to build your cabin makes you ill then you should move along. I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I do. I some how find the game very relaxing.\n\nI am not sure how I feel about combat. I havent done much PvP and have not leveled up those skills significantly. It however feels a little floaty to me at the moment. It however has a more urgent feel to it then other games, as death or unconsiousness bring permanent penalties, whether its just loss of property or loss of skill and attributes, you wont want to make defeat a hobby. I know seige warfare is coming if not already out and that sounds very fun.\n\nClaiming property is relatively new. It protects your land from intruders by making it so that tresspasers can be punished without any of the negative affects associated with murdering neighbours occur to the land owner. Also gives some penalties to the tresspasser. Its a nice touch.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, yet not otimized. I expect further improvement with that as it gets closer to a release. Some animations and sounds still require work, however the game still does an excellent job at being immersive and mostly natural.\n\nAll in All this games is very good and definetly deserves a positive rating.\n\n","September 12, 2015","true","446.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

One of them would be that this game is not everyones cup of tea, with that said this review will be for those that actualy like these kinds of games and don't mind the grindy and hard aspect of it.\n\nThe game is mostly relying on teamwork.\nIt doesn't mean you cant play it alone, you can and its loads of fun but to a point.\nThat point being that the game is designed in such a way that makes you feel like you are a part of a medieval town or village or even a big castle. You can only feel that if you have people with you playing.\nAnother design of the game is to seperate the work load of those pve jobs from geting food to just about anything.\nThe PvE aspect if you will, as in roleplaying and village developement to farming/hunting, making armor, tools or anything a medieval village needs is very imersive and very versitile and complex.\nThere are alot of videos and guides out there to help people with the learning curve since its a bit steep.\nPvP aspect is very harsh at first glance, BUT its actualy very fun and very fair if you know what you are doing and have allys. The combat system in the game is somewhat similar to some games but not the same.\nThere are siedges that work quite well and all that.\nOne problem with the game atm is that you can somewhat leave a few things like choped logs or boxes or other movable things bit floating in the air. With that said, some abuse it to get over walls or other things, BUT still with a decent guild you wont fear any invasion specialy those "abusers" since they are allways few in numbers.\nThe community is different from  server to server, but there are a few guilds out there including Vanir's Krigsmen wich im from and some other allys of ours that have been playing the game since the early alpha and are still strong. So my opinion is don't let those bad servers or bad people bring you down keep searching for a group you will fit in.","March 5","true","971.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Almost.  If you plan to play, I suggest a 10x skill server until the game releases, 10x will take a skill from level 1 to level 70 within 2 hours, from level 70-90 within 2 hours, 90-100 within 2 hours. 10x might feel like you are progressing too fast but the truth is that it's only unlocking things you can do. You can only progress as fast as the crop and item crafting timings take.\n\nWhen they say 100% sandbox, they are not joking. Currently there are a few irritating things such as tunnelling but for the most part, the sandbox aspect is pristine.\n\nCombat as of now sucks, if you're looking for pvp then this game isnt for you " At The Moment ". Once the combat is fixed, this pvp system will be the least OP system I've ever seen. If you can click a mouse you'll be pretty good but that's not all there is to it, swinging the curser back and forth will actually make your character swing accordingly.\n\nBuildings are at a wide variety as of now, but I really really hope they add more due to the fact that on 1x speed the construction skill will take days to skill up to be able to build simple buildings.... Please please please DEVs, add a WIDE variety of buildings to destroy the grind of building ovens and destroying them to waste 1000s of clay. I don't even want to mention the Wattle-Fence-Grind\n\nAnimals are endangered species as of now.\n\nSkills seem to be at a high amount but in all honesty there really arn't many trees to go through if this is to be an MMO, the only professions as of now are Blacksmith, Herbalist, Architect, Farmer, and Hunter. Might as well not even count the Hunter because if everyone goes a pure, each profession could be a master Hunter as well.\n\nRate 7/10\n","November 7, 2014","true","696.1"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","26","43","0","2"

It is mostly grind. You will grind to get resources, you will grind to move resources and you will grind to build. Pretty much most of your time will be grinding. If you don't play this game with other people, then you probably will be burnt out.\n\nI would say that if you enjoy Minecraft and working with other people, then you'll most likely enjoy this game as well. The sense of accomplishment from building a castle or large keep is pretty great. If you say, "I did this." Then people will realize how awesome you are, because of the many months you put in to build that castle or keep.\n\n\nWhat I don't like about the game?\nTakes forever to build end game buildings.\n\nEverything has a timer. Digging has a timer, mining has a timer, gathering resources has a timer. You can pretty much calculate how long you will spend to gather resource or calculate how long someone else spent building.\n\nIf you are just starting out, gaining levels is mostly grind. Joining someone else's establishment and using their tools and equipment allows you to level up fairly quickly compared to that initial player.\n\nThere is no automated way of moving resources and trader carts for moving resources is slow.\n\nLoading times and lag. For some servers, I can take a shower and come back and just be entering the world.\n\nGame can feel like a second or third job as you are cleaning the barns, stables and coops.\nWhat I like about the game?\nI like to dig. I dug in Minecraft. I dig in Life is Feudal: Your Own. I'd probably dig in the MMO if I was going to play it.\n\nThere is something about the game mechanics when playing with other people that give a better sense of community. You are sweating and crying together and that gives a bit of comradery.\n\nGriefers can't currently destroy your buildings. They have to work at doing anything too destructive, for the most part.\n\nThe role play is what you make of it. There are some pretty good role players.","February 20, 2015","true","230.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

So much fun. Although in early development it's still an amazing game. Some people are giving mixed reviews and I don't think they understand what an early access game means. From when I bought this game the devs have added so much content and consistently fix issues and I will say there are not many issues to begin with. Also a lot of people complain about not having access to features shown in the game. It is as simple as the devs 1. Havent put content in yet, because as stated above it's EARLY ACCESS and 2. they request feedback on the potential adding of said features from individuals in the beta.\n\nIn conclusion, ignore the ignorant gamers who fail to understand the simple concept of Early Access and knock an in-develpment game on simple things as a bug that they refuse to report to the devs but expect them to magically fix without knowledge of it.","October 1, 2015","true","155.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

And it's occasionally buggy and not well optimised. But hey, they're not hiding the fact it's not finished. It's playable, that's the most important thing.\n\nIf you can't handle a crash once in awhile, don't buy it.\nI haven't had much issues, but some friends have had it worse than me.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI personally love it. But if you're an impatient man, do not buy this game. Doing things takes time.\nIn most survival games you have a full fledged base in maybe a week or even less.\n\nHere 1 weeks worth is having a small house and furnace (if you play alone) or a village with wooden palisades (if playing in group).\n\nNow this game is not meant to be played solo. Many server have the recommended level cap.\nThis effectively limits you when you play alone, as you can't have all stats maxed. You can do everything decently, but not perfectly.\nThere are server where the cap's been increased, so you could technically be a one man powerhouse.\nBut more often than not, expect there to be roles. Towns tend to have a dedicated blacksmith, carpenter, tanner, etc...\n\nThis game takes time, especially being a bloody herbalist..... there's just so many freaking herbs.\n\n\nIf you don't have patience, don't buy it.\nIf you like a community and working in group building up a medieval society, go ahead.

It takes a while to build things and level up which is great for longevity. My only problem with this game is the MMO aspect. Everyone on here bangs on about how great it will be when there are thousands of players running around. Umm ... great ... so all my hard work will be undone in the style of Rust. Can't wait. I've heard there will be more things to do if you want to play solo, but I'll see how and if that pans out. I can't not recommend this game - it doesn't have dragons or spells which is refreshing. Don't get me wrong I play solo which is still great as I love all things medieval. Only issue is they've made a fantastic game but without singleplayer, which seems to be the norm these days. I'm sure it's great with a team of you but not everyone wants that. I just wish there were more games like this but in singleplayer. But this is the best so buy it and go solo - and hope more NPCish aspects get added. The rendering on the buildings look wonderful and the cities people have built look amazing. I'd quite happily spend days or weeks or months building it all on my own - just wish there were a few (just a few) NPCs to say "hello" to. At least there are animals to kill I guess.","November 5, 2015","true","28.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

In my experiences Since purchase i have played across many servers . Raided , constructed , terraformed, farmed, hunted alongside many players who have had alot, if not the same playability concerns . though once you work a few bugs out. this game is awesome in its open ended gameplay. Which encourages players to work together. Ive found most of the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and whining to come from players with high expectations who are expecting a polished out of the box RTR version, or players who are generally not up to a hard grind type game to achieve anything and just want to troll around killing and not working towards anything.\nOf the playability problems this game has a few, and most of those problems vary from player to player .  most can be sorted with a little bit of fiddling with settings and such. What else can you expect of an alpha.. well worth the $40 i spent. but be prepared to put in some hours to enjoy this game to its full potential.. you wont be running around decked out to the max overnight . or even in a week for that matter . you need to play the game for what it is to enjoy.\nive since started a server of my own and we are setting up community's and infastructure etc . planned events on a scale we havent been able to achieve before .. currently the only server that isnt dead from what i gather from feedback from players. goodluck i hope you purchase and would like to see you in game . if you are from australia .. all the best","November 4, 2014","true","677.4"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","0"

It's got nice interface, comprehensive tutorial and decent engine, and as an old 'M&B' fan I felt myself almost at home here right away.. until I tried game hunting. Man, all the animations are so clunky it's painful to see in 2016! I've been playing 'M&B' since almost 10 years ago (alfa) and now I don't see any substantial progress in that respect. Stupid horses and then that elk.. I feel pity for them. Ok, I'll take a deep breath and tell you how it was.\n\nThe tutorial said I should select a patch of soil and choose 'search for peaceful animal tracks'. There was nothing. Being a city dweller I still surmised to look at a nearby lake's shore. I found tracks of cloven hoof, they appeared at the ground as highlighted texture spots leading to the forest. I followed that curved line and it seemed funny how it passed right through some large trees, that's where I started to feel suspitious about the software. After a while I spotted a couple of horses.. which should be odd-toed. Eh, who needs that foolish botany anyway? I closed on them, they just lied down before me. I thought it will be an easy task, maybe a part of tutorial.\n\nMy axe hit the nearest one in the head for no visible effect, it jumped up and ran away, but not far. I started chasing it to the lake, then to the mountain, it went through trees not noticing them and ploughed into uneven ground. On our way we also spooked an elk and some geese. I switched to chasing the elk. I managed to make a slingshot while it waited for me nearby. The animals also lacked animations, as well as the brains, they seemed to follow just one algorythm - kept some distance. After I had hit the mammal for the 20th time with a stone it turned on me and horned me till I fell unconscious.. without any animation.\n\nThe game is not finished, it's totally unpolished, crude as a stone axe, and it's technological basis already feels outdated! All in all, if you are very patient I strongly advise you to go build yourself a real house in the woods instead of playing this. For others there are much more cheerful middle-age lifestyle simulators on the market.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nВ основе своей это ваш симулятор колхоза, многопользовательская "Бешеная ферма" про управление временем, обогащенная чем-то типа боевой системы "Седла и клинка"/"Войны роз". Тут приятный интерфейс, понятное обучение и неплохой движок, и как старый фанат "СиК" я почувствовал себя сразу почти как дома... пока не попробовал охотиться на дичь. Боже, анимация так груба, что больно смотреть в 2016 году! Я начинал играть в "СиК" почти 10 лет назад (с альфы), и вот я не вижу серьезного прогресса в этом отношении. Глупые лошади, и потом этот лось... мне жалко их. Ладно, давайте я сделаю вдох и расскажу по порядку.\n\nВ обучении сказали выделить клочок земли и выбрать "поиск следов мирного животного". Ничего не было. Будучи гордским жителем, я все же сообразил поискать на берегу ближайшего озера. Нашел следы раздвоенных копыт, они появились на земле в виде подсвеченных текстурных пятен и вели в лес. Последовав по этой извилистой линии, я порадовался тому, как она проходила прямо сквозь большие деревья, тут я начал что-то подозревать об этой программе. Потом я заметил впереди пару лошадей... которые по идее непарнокопытные. Э, да кому нужна эта дурацкая ботаника? Я приблизился к ним, они просто улеглись передо мной. Я подумал, что это будет легко, как этап обучения.\n\nТопор ударил ближайшую в голову без видимых последствий, она вскочила и убежала, но не далеко. Я за ней к озеру, потом на гору, она неслась сквозь деревья и тонула в неровностях почвы. По дороге вспугнули лося и гусей. Я переключился на лося. Умудрился смастерить пращу, пока он меня ждал неподалеку. Животным не хватало анимаций, равно как и мозга, похоже, у них был единственный алгоритм - держать некоторое расстояние. Когда я попал в эту тушу камнем в двадцатый раз, он развернулся и бросился меня бодать без всякой анимации, я упал в обиорок.\n\nИгра не закончена, совершенно не доведена до ума, груба как каменный топор, а ее техническая база уже смотрится устаревшей! В общем, если вы очень терпеливы, настоятельно вам советую построить себе настоящий домик в лесу вместо этой игры. Для прочих на рынке представлены гораздо более веселые симуляторы средневековой житухи.","March 9","false","7.0"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","22","36","4","5"

It's richly detailed, and the graphics (for a game of this Minecraft-esque premise) are very good. To say it's even in "alpha" stages, however, strikes me as a gross exaggeration--even in spite of the "early access" label. Basically, all you can do is perform the same limited set of functions over and over, and write bug reports--something that used to earn minimum wage, plus all the coffee you could ever want. Before you shell out $40 for this game, bear in mind that "playing" it constitutes what used to be called a "job" at this point in time. It's very, *very* incomplete, riddled with bugs in every function, undersupported by its help functionality, and exceptionally confusing. In my personal opinion, while--again--it shows every sign of becoming a great game in the future, it's not very entertaining at all as-is, and doesn't merit a price tag at the present time: the developers, if they can't pay someone to play it or handle the playtesting themselves, should be farming it out to family and friends for assistance, or trying to crowdsource additional development/playtesting funds, or doing *something* other than saying "Hey, this is worth $39.99 right now."","September 26, 2014","false","2.2"," 43 of 76 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","43","76","0","3"

It certainly does NOT deserve the negative reviews it has and if anything it simply has a learning curve that seems to turn some people away.","September 16, 2015","true","197.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I love the building aspects of it and the whole farming/cooking/hunting/fishing bits (which is what I played in game) but even when playing with others for a short while, I found the Role Play to be kind of non-existent, as if people thought it was silly to actually play the characters they created.\n\nI also didn't like how, get the wrong mod, and all of your progress could be wiped the moment THEY had a screw up but I guess that could happen in any game such as this.\n\nI'm currently getting hip to Wurm Unlimited, which I think is where LiF got a lot of its inspiration from and I find it to be a bit more enjoyable as of now. Sure the graphics aren't as pretty but there's much more to do, including getting down on an Adventure server so you're not so dependent on PCs to provide content.\n\nI'll probably end up playing LiF again though. Like I said, it does have its fun attached to it and I'm sure if I found the right server with the right players I'd truly enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of the roleplay aspects. Sometimes I wonder if its just difficult for some PC gamers to switch to a "table top" mentality.

Also, I had issues with running the game in stand-alone mode. The server stopped working even after several reboots, re-installations, reading forums about how to fix etc. I ended up setting up a separate dedicated server to resolve the issue.

The rich crafting system surpasses anything I've personally played or seen, and I've played a lot of survival games.\n\nPlanting crops, raising livestock, cooking complex meals with many ingredients, tailoring your own clothes, forging weapons and armour and becoming proficient at all of this and more will be essential if you choose a solitary lifestyle. Very reminiscient of what early settlers would need to have had in their skillset, or if you wish to be a part of an existing group you can specialise in what skills you require to make a thriving community.\n\nPros:\n\nRich crafting,\nProtected homebase (build your monument early)\nMature player base (Rarely encounter KOS players)\nImmersive, you need to earn your results.\n\nCons:\n\nSteep learning curve (especially the menu system, you will need to use the wiki and youtube           tutorials unless someone takes you under their wing)\nCHOOSE YOUR SERVER WISELY (your skills won't follow your character so if a servers           skill cap is below 3000 you will not be able to learn every skill and will have to specialise.            There is a lot of work involved in this game so starting another character is a BIG DEAL)\nHerbalism is essential and herb effects should be linked to steam account.\nEarly Access (still a lot of work to be done but extremely playable already, 211hrs in so far)\n\n\n\ntldr: Not for kiddies or trolls, they will drop the game very quickly and hit the refund button.

It does indeed have survival elements but the focal point of the game is PVP and a very in depth and lucrative crafting system. While you may wonder why the game has some mixed reviews, it's mostly because it is a very hardcore game that fits with only certain personalities. Also a lot of the negative reviews were from a while ago when the game was riddled with bugs and people were upset. That's changed a lot and is now a mostly polished experience.\n\nSolo play can make the game difficult, and jumping into the world with no friends or unable to find people can make you feel extremely overwhelmed. Most servers have a very awesome RP community with it and if you find one with good rule sets you have ample opportunity to grow your character into something special. Having a group though even if just a few people is a MUST. I cannot stress enough solo play is highly discouraged.\n\nYou want to focus on a certain few professions to specialize in as you can be a "jack of all trades" but to get the maximum reward you want to specialize.\n\nPVE content is sparse besides game animals there isn't anything else other than starvation that can be PVE, so if you're looking for ONLY PVE this IS NOT the game for you. Understand that PVP drives the game, but crafting is really the most important and time consuming aspect.\n\nAs I said before it's more of a simulation, giving you the ability to immerse yourself in that middle age time period and reap in rewards. Crafting is top notch and is extremely gratifying just doing something as simple as terraforming to plant some trees or dig a tunnel system to mine some ore.\n\nIt isn't for everyone, it is a game that requires patience, time for your effort to reward you but once you get into the world you will be hooked. I've loved every minute and the RP I've had is just so fantastic. Once this game turns into the MMO it will be even better.\n\nThe game is not without bugs, however none are game breaking, the inventory system isn't very friendly and the UI can take some getting used to but there are tutorials and a very good wiki to assist you throughout.\n\nWhile the price tag on this game is a bit high, you can justify it by the fact you will get a game that isn't like all the other survival games out there that end up being a waste of money and get abandoned.\n\nCombat is physics based and if you've played Chivalry it's very similar to that so it should be familiar..\n\nI rate LiF:YO a solid 7.5/10. If you love crafting, survival, RP, PVP and medieval times this is a must have to your steam library.","January 20","true","117.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

There is a hunger system that is not too exigent, if you eat good food you'll be statisfied for a while.\n\nYou can craft TONS of different types of armor/tools/weapons, deblocking the skills to craft and use them with practice and work.\n\nThe learning curve is steep, you'll have to spend a few hours to understand how to do relatively complex things. Harvesting/collecting materials can be a little bit grindy at some points, especially when you want to build a huge house or big castle walls but it's a guaranteed fun time.\n\nAs of now, the game is not finished, it's in early access so there's a lot more that the devs are planning to add but still, it got a lot of content for an "unfinished" game.\n\nYou can be an archer, a knight, a crossbowmen, a bandit or claim yourself as the king of the land, it all depends on your ambitions and your skills. Depending on the server you choose, you might not be able to specialize in every crafting abilities so, if you got some friends you can always talk with them when you start and choose a "job" you would like to do in your clan, may it be blacksmith, tailorer, herbalist, farmer or many more, so your group can be polivalent and craft goods without having to risk trading with other factions.\n\nAs of now, while i'm writing this, this game is on sale. My best advice would be to buy it on the go, before it releases into an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me with big servers, it's cheaper now but no one knows what the price will be when they finish developing it.\n\nWith all that said, I hope to see you in-game and...\n\nLife IS Feudal!","June 4, 2015","true","372.0"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","29","50","2","0"

But have no fear because once you get the basics of the game it really starts to open up, the best thing to do if you want to get in to LiF is to go here and give this page a look over https://lifeisfeudal.com/billing/tutorials.php doing so will get you to the point where you can "play" the game instead of running about like a headless chicken. You done that ? no ? yes ?....... ok good moving on.\n\nSo LiF is not an easy game, if what you were looking for is a game where you jump in and are a Badass from the start then no sorry this isn't for you, if you want a Single Player experience with AI and a story then no sorry this isn't for you, If you want a community centered game then YES this game is for you, there are no Shops, no Guards, no Doctors/Healers, not even a building in sight, this is not Skyrim or Mount and blade, if you want any of that then the players have to Be/make that. And it takes time for that to happen, i've played this game for 7 hours straight and all i got done was chop some trees down, catch some fish, make the ground flat, mined for iron and found nothing and smacked a wolf with a shovel. But during all that time not once did i think "oh this is crap, this is boring, i'm going on another game." you know why ? because it's all new, it was fun not having a clue what i was doing and i still don't. One thing i will say though is try and band together, don't just wander out in to the wild and try to make a house because you'll be at it for days and i mean IRL days.","September 20, 2014","true","31.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

This is a rather my experience than a Review.\n\nSo. You came here to build a house? Okay lets start by learning the TERRAFORMING skill. Thats needed in order to become a CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS PREPERATOR.... (whatever the hell that is). When achieved a sufficient level (60 in most cases), by digging up ground for HOURS,  you begin preparing  construction materials, needed for your later home. Again, you do this FOREVER, till you achieved rank 60 in that skill. When you made it that for it allows you to learn the construction skill.... With lvl 30 in that you made it. after 8 hours of boring skill lvling, you think you achieved a point of mastery where you can finaly build a home, no, HOMES for many! But no. Lvl 30 in construction allows you to build WOODEN objects only. Well... okay. Lets start cutting down some trees you say? NO. FIRST LEARN FORRESTING (planting trees, examining trees, and getting branches from them), WHICH IS NEEDED FOR LOGGING. So, note that youve spent about 10 hours of gameplay just for achieving the necessary skills to build a house on that 1 particular server. Okay finally you can start cutting down those stupid trees you examined 50 times each. Well, some of them. THe hard wood trees are to tough for you with your logging lvl 30. After you cut down your first tree and wondered "Eh what the heck do I do with that log now." You realize that you have to learn ANOTHER SKILL, to make something out of logs. Yea Logging lvled to 60, CARPENTRY ACQUIRED. you start sawing those 1000 logs into the most beautiful boards mankind has ever seen and look at all the work youve done.... Preparing to FINALLY start building your home sweet home. You begin building your little wood shed... but whats this... nails needed?! FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\n\nOkay you already learned Terraforming so, no big deal. Lets beginn with learning PROSPECTING. TO LVL 60, to be able to prospect for iron. After that you learn MINING, again to lvl 60, to be able to get the precious Iron ore you lust for and to be able to SMELT the Iron.... YOU NEED TO SMELT TONS OF IT, but only skill smelting to lvl 31 this time, because the next skill you have to learn, Smithing can be kept at lvl 1. Thats a present from the game designers to you, nails can be forged with a Smithing skill of lvl 1.\n\n15 hours later, just after finishing a shaggy wood hut, the server crashes, disappears forever.\n\nGG, 0/10\n\nTry/buy the game when it became a MMO.","September 28, 2014","false","5.4"," 53 of 96 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","53","96","0","9"

If you are a right player type for this game you may spend even hundreds or thousands of hours.\nYes it is a niche game - really hardcore one, meant for elite groups of dedicated players.\nSome will not like it for been to in-depth and too grindy at a times, but this is what it takes to feel the significance of your achievement. You invest time and feel yourself proud when something is finished. This make you don’t want to lose what you achieved, because usually it will take far more than a day to restore. This together with so called “alignment system” makes players behave themselves in-game and in general  community is far better than in other sandboxes.\nSome say there are bugs and visual glitches... well they were, but devs are quite fast - 2 patches in a first 2 days after release and they were fixed, at least for me. Performancewise not that bad actually. Taking that I’m playing on rather old gtx 680 on PC and not so fast 850m on laptop - avarage of 30 FPS on medium to high settings make me feel comfortable.\nAnd the last but not least - this is not for a singleplayer mode. It is possible to start a server for yourself and tune its settings to play with decent comfort, but it is absolutely no fun at all. The point of this game is communication between people, friends or foes does not matter it will be fun in both ways!\n\nSo I highly recommend this game.

One company does server hosting but you don't get the full game experience with your own server.\n-The controlls are really clunky.\n-There is hardly any wildlife or things that move it's extremely lonely.\n-It's like Dayz without zombies and you can craft but you need friends to help you but finding friends is a hastle.","September 21, 2014","false","183.4"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","1"

I obtained this game just recently and i have to say that the game came a long way since it was first released. Everything is designed to give the person playing a "life like" experience. You literally feel as if youre in the game yourself as there is so much to do, hunt, build, and etc. Making or joining a community can be great and very interesting for the most part , as this game is completely community based as your gameplay goes on. For these reasons and a perhaps a few others, i say that this is a really great game to check out.\n\nThere is a negative side to things though, but in this review im going to focus on the character creation. The game does not really follow the aspects of its own title...well the "YOUR OWN" part. I believe the idea of the game was to in a sense, self insert yourself into the game; put yourself in the open world to fend and make the most of yourself. But i see that really difficult when there's only 3 races you can possibly pick in the game. Knowing the intention for their game, why did they decide to give the player no variety on races? It beats me. But i think this is something that should be thought of in the near future.\n\nEveryone who plays this game will not be white or asian (hence the 3 races are basically White, white, and asian). So from my perspective and probably others, the lack of variety makes it somewhat hard to have that "self insert" vibe when playing. I see it as a major factor  that if took into consideration (as in adding races that resemble the african american, spanish, or indian race and so on) this will enhance a persons enjoyment and experience in the game when they can make a character  that represents themselves and possibly their culture in RP.\n\nOther than that, as i said, i would highly consider to try this game, because overall, you will not be dissappointed. Just know there's A LOT TO LEARN. But it will all be understood in due time.\n\nThanks for reading ! :) <3","December 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It says release, but it's more of a beta, as planned features are yet to come and some in-game features are still a bit buggy. It's also yet to be optimized and suffers from crashes and memory leaks. Definitely not a game for everyone, as the learning curve is steep without joining an established guild and the chances of surviving alone are slim. Also has a lengthy skill leveling system that will make some impatient players unhappy.\n\nBefore you buy, I highly recommend looking this up on YouTube and getting an idea of what you're getting into. It's an excellent game if one can overlook the current issues - which the devs are actively working on. But, with all its cons, the medieval life you will lead in LiF:YO is extremely satisying, especially when you build your first house or complete the walls around your lands.","December 24, 2015","true","561.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorK/recommended/290080/","IgorK","Gary Dozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorK/","557 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary: While this game is pretending to be everything it fails to become anything in the foreseeable future.\n\n\nYes, the game has absolutely no future except being an early access title until its distant demise. Yes, it will be early access for very long time. Take a couple of years.\n\nIt is ridiculous how with such large gameplay scope developers fail to design even basic features and mechanics. It's not even interesting to study the design of the game as it is usual with other early access games.\n\nThere are several very obvious evidences that the game is designed very poorly. What is bad about design flaws? Design flaw is much worse than even a hudred bugs. You just can't fix it without destroying some part of the game. And one design decision is always connected to the others. Redesign is a chain reaction that involves most part of the game to be reconsidered and recoded.\n\nAs it is usual happens with independent developers they pay very little attention to a game design. They jump to start coding and modelling. Well it's good if you're designing another simple puzzle or arcade game - they tend to have very short development cycles. On the other hand - games with such gameplay scope as LiF have very long development cycle - about a year. It means time needed to code a tech demo after design revision.\n\nThis development cycle we have now is already wasted. Next development cycle will be wasted too. Not just because developers are bad or something. But because the game system will be so complex that there will be unexpected results.\n\nTo prove my point, here's some design flaws.\n\n1. Terraforming.\nTerraforming system is purely artificial and is a subject to heavy changes in the future. Right now terraforming consists of too artificially combined systems: landscape terraforming and tunneling. It is very easy to see that tunneling artificially blocks landscape terraforming in its vicinity. That's just because developers have no idea how these two systems should interact.\nTerraforming lies in the basis of the game so any changes to that system will result in a redesign of the whole game.\nThere are so many questions that needs to be addressed here. Will there be a cave-ins? Can you build a house inside a mine? Maybe a farm? Do I need light inside? What if I will dig upward to the surface?\n\n2. Skills.\nRight now there are too many skills in the game with very little logic behind them.\nLet's say you want to be a hunter. Track animals and kill them to get hides and meat. Not so fast. It seems you have to learn how to plow ground first and grow crops. And only then you will be able to dry a deer's hide. That logic.\nSame problem with terraforming, prospecting and mining skills.\nThere is no obvious way to choose some simple role. Skills are divided and interconnected in some weird and unexpected way. Obviously skill system will be revised very soon. It's just awful.\n\n3. Skill cap.\nWell, I bet developers are very proud they have "invented" a such an original way to milk LiF MMO players for money. Of course you will have to buy character slots. Why else this skill cap is even implemented? You won't be able to create anything in the game without 3-4 different characters involved. That's the only reason.\n\nThe worst of design flaws are those which was made to make us spend money. Because you can't fix them and they ruin the game the most.\n\n4. Hunger.\nIt is the best example of a system that haven't even been thought about. It's a typical placeholder. And yet it's the most important system. It is one of the reasons to make players settle in some place. Some place where they have created a food production chain. If you won't be able to make them settle - they will be roaming around freely to kill and destroy. Because it's the natural pastime of human beings.\nRight now you don't have to hunt, fish or grow crops. You only need to make weapons and armor to kill someone.\n\nWell, I'll just name few more problematic mechanics which have to be designed yet.\n\n5. Quality migration.\n6. Private property.\n7. Claiming lands.\n8. Criminal acts.\n9. Water travel.\n10. Howling-transporting goods.\n11. Deconstruction.\n12. Siege.\n13. Off-line characters.\n14. Tracking down criminals.\n15. Trading.\n\n... and much much more.\n\nIt's sad to say that developers doesn't even bothered to study some references. Like Haven & Hearth, for example. It's obvious they have played it. Yet they haven't analyzed it's design decisions and flaws. And they already trying to invent something "new". While they only will end up reinventing the weel.\n\nEdit: Fixed mistake about skinning a deer. It was about drying hides, not skinning.","September 28, 2014","false","29.2"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","39","70","0","2"

Game lags and crashes at times yes this does make me rage, but only cause I enjoy this game greatly.\n\nI have said the bad above now on to the good, the game is designed to create a community, a fraction, a guild not a stand alone warrior. You will need other people to rely on to make you tools while you tend the land or have you back while being raided. Had good laugh with my clan The Mountain Men as we marched in full plate armour around the island demanding tribute or defending trade allies.\n\nPeople have made some great villages and towns, fortified and locked up tight with archers posted on the walls, you start to get concerned for you trade goods as you approch, even more concerned as you walk away after the deal is done.\n\nWhat is annoying is a lot of negative comments are done by people with low hours of game time, I was still learning at 100hrs. People complaining its only to fund/test the MMO, its the same game/code essentially, so kinda but not  the reasons they say.\n\nIs it worth the $40? for me yes, very much and I am looking forward to the MMO.\nIf you are a little worried bout the alpha issue, wait easy as that.\n\nThanks\n\nBourbonated\n","November 15, 2014","true","508.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

So here goes..\n\nLife Is Feudal definitel has potential, and I have very much enjoyed it for upwards of 90% of my time playing. The other 10% I was getting mugged by a boar, arguing with in-server badmins, or moving dirt.. Otherwise, it's amazing. The realism is unrivaled by any other game I've played (except maybe Star Citizen. We'll see how that turns out). There is a very tight learning curve when you finally learn how to smack a tree with the rock you tied to a stick.\n\nWith friends, it get's interesting as you argue over who will be the miner, who's gonna be the lumberjack, and who's gonna be the lazy chef who sits around until someone builds a fire. Nevertheless, whatever job you get stuck with, there's always going to be at least one small part of your job that you love, whether it be playing Human Bowling with logs, digging pits in the middle of camp, or bringing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-off boar through a group of people.\n\nWithout friends, you will make new ones so long as you have a mic. Typing in this sort of game has always been a hassle for me... Actually, ANY game for that matter... Either way, it gets interesting when you have no idea who the other person is, and with that disconnect you actually start believing they are their character, which only helps the immersion.\n\nAs far as actual gamplay goes, it's really quite relaxing. There's no real rush to get a mountain of materials, so as long as you remember where your camp is, it's nice to just take a walk through the forest and have a look of your surrroundings. Anyone playing this game for long enough realizes it's anything BUT a good-looking Minecraft. You just have to take your time and "learn" how to do things. Personally, I've never gotten further than a hut for me and each of my four buddies, but give it enough time and it becomes feasable to build a decent fort..\n\nLong story short, I have nothing that I truly love or hate about the game.. It's all more just put together in such a way that I can't help but feel relaxed. The music is nice and fits the mood of the game really well (it's basically like the old-timey ambience that Skyrim or Lord Of The Rings has). The graphics aren't perfect, but for open world, that's quite a big challenge, so I can only appreciate the good effort they put into it looking as good as it does.\n\nI would recommend this game to others, as long as they have friends to play with and/or a headset with a microphone.\nAnyone interested in playing together, feel free to send me a friend request. I don't care if you just bought the game or you have several hundred hours into the game. It's all the same to me.\n\n\nP.S. From what I can see, anything I don't especially enjoy about the game (that I feel it's missing) looks like it's going to be added in the MMO variant. What I mean specifically is one open, procedural world with up to 10,000 people on any single dedicated regional server. The general lack of people in any current server is the only reason I don't have a ton of hours into this game. I can't do everything needed to survive by myself, and it actually get's kinda lonely alot of the time.\n\nI hope this review helps!","September 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Yes.\nDo I recommend buying it? Not with a price tag of anything over $20.\nQuick Thoughts:\n-Building is satisfying\n-Community and team work is a must\n-You can solo, but you will suck... and you will die (make your own server for solo)\n-Combat is unpolished\n-Level of detail in materials needed for building is awesome\n-Too many materials needed for building with out a few people working together\n-Skill cap works if you have people to play with (without friends) find a server with a higher skill cap\n\nThis game is rewarding, challenging but grindy as the @%#$. To be honest though, it really works here.\nThere is a ton of buildings to build and it would be a shame if you could simply make them right off the bat. This game takes time, and patience and when you finally build your first home... it feels great. Although one might argue that it takes to long, that one should also understand that this game is a prequal to an MMO. So the grind is required.\n\nIf you don't like grinds, then simply make your own server with the click of a button and alter the skill cap and skill gain as well as plant growth rate, or animal feeding rate, ect. Now... about that skill cap. I personally love the idea of a person needing to specialize in something. The problem? If you pick the wrong class tree to go down... you waisted a lot of time, so go online and look up a tutorial, because none exists on game. However, as I like descovering things as I go, I ask around a lot and for the most part it's a good community.\n\nNow, about that combat! I am garbage at PvP so it always kinda sucks when someone raids my town (without walls) every day at the same time. And sure, while it may annoy me a little, i must say it adds a sense of realism to the world. The times back then sucked without or even with walls. Raiders bring it all together though and make the world feel alive. While I trade with one town, another is pumping out ♥♥♥ hats to attack me on sight. However, the combat itself kinda feels... like trash and quite unpolished. But then again, keep in mind I am not one for PvP so it could be that I suck. I guess there is only one way to find out.\n\nGathering is tedious and terrible but honestly very very important. You need it to make everything. I am not just talking about gathering sticks and stones... I am talking about gathering ore (which could take forever - This is not minecraft - move along) Or gathering 5 out of the (what seems like) 50 types of plants out there so you can make one item that is needed in ALL bigger buildings... Get an herbalist people... you need them... and they are playing the worst this game has to offer so you can makes walls and houses, and maybe one day even castles.\n\nAll in all this is an interesting game that is okay. Not great but certainly not bad. I would simply recomend getting this with a group of friends. But not so much if you are a solo player.","September 18, 2015","true","74.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The dev team has been really involved with the community and implemented many of the ideas we had to improve the game.  Even though the game is a "full" release now, it doesn't mean its not continuously being updated and improved.  The "full" release was done when they implemented the initial features they said they would from the kickstart backed campaign they ran.  This game is just a small nuget of what the eventual end product will be for LiF.  This game is a very good world suvival/simulator and has exponential possibility. Really happy with how far this game has come from where it started.","March 17","true","308.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Let's just get the summary out of the way so you don't have to read a wall of text if you don't wish to do so.  I will detail everything later.\n\nThe Summary:\n\nLIF:YO is a stand alone game that is being developed completely separate from another project the devs are working on (MMO).  The price tag is a bit rich for an Early Access game, in my honest opinion, but that $40 was well worth it simply due to the fact that have on record almost as many hours as many of my “fully polished” titles in my library.  There is plenty to do but at the same time, it is very possible to hit a brick wall until other features are added or tweaked.  Overall, if you like a game that simply takes time and effort to create something very cool and organic, this game is for you.\n\nThe Deets:\n\nYou start off with nothing more than the rags on your back.  It is up to you to find a suitable area to sustain and survive.  Is the game possible to play single player?  Absolutely with some tweaking of settings or multiple characters.  Is the game more fun to play multi-player?  By far!  Either set up your own server or join one to play with more people and make the game really exciting.  Build up your defenses, barter with your “neighbors,” master a skill set that no one else in the area has mastered to make yourself a more valuable asset to the community.  All of these things take time and effort to accomplish, but the reward is that you have built something to truly take pride in.  Fixing a broken down wall isn't as simple as replacing a couple blocks.  It takes mining materials and the skills of multiple trades to raise the wall again.\n\nResources are diverse enough to offer quite a bit of exploration and travel to various locations.  Are they a bit too sparse?  Maybe.  But for what the game is now, it feels appropriate.  Use the materials you have to refine your skills and make higher quality items for trade or protection.  The possibilities are numerous!\n\nThere are quite a few bugs... there's no denying that, but the devs seem to be on top of things as long as they reported accordingly.  There are some balance issues within the game that make it falter.  Again, the devs will surely address these before the game is finalized (hopefully by Q3 of next year as they plan).  The UI and combat can definitely feel clunky and unresolved, but over time, it will get more and more optimized to better suit the needs of the game.\n\nEssentially, what you have to remember is that this is an Early Access game and there are going to be bugs.  But if you can past those bugs, horrible optimization, crashes, etc. and realize that the game offers far more positive ideals and possibilities, you enjoy the crap out of it.","November 29, 2014","true","328.7"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","29","51","0","1"

For example: They DID update the game to where the FPS is more smooth. But for a game that isn't even near done, it could have a lower price.  Luckily, I got this as a gift but I experienced buying something that is way more than it really should be.  I really think they could also smooth out combat and make the graphics a little more enhanced.  I do recommend this for the people who enjoy this type of stuff, but for the people that just want a game to play and get really into without having any problems, then this isn't the game for you.","November 15, 2014","true","90.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

It was OK, I guess...\n\n\nIn all seriousness though, I've been taking a break due to school and what-not for about five months, but I used to play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, hence the 1500 hours. It's an incredible game. I remember the first month it was out, the sense of exploration, real people trading with others, people owning bustling shops, real landlords with real slaves and farmers, real crafting specialists, it's all player-driven, no NPC's.\n\nIt just got better and better, exploring new things, no developed Wiki to guide you through, and after a year it evolved into what it is now. They have built upon an epic, moldable foundation and the game has so much content to work with.\n\nYes, it can get incredibly repetitive, but that is if you deny the way it is supposed to be played, and that is with others. In feudal times, you would have to rely on other to assist you in survival, it's not supposed to cater towards people who want to bolster all skills and survive on their own. A house needs glass, for that you need a smithing craftsman, It needs lumber, so that needs a carpenter. And then finally, you need an architect to design the house. You cannot adorn all these skills alone, so it forces you to rely on others which is something really cool.\n\nBustling player-built cities, large-scale battles on open fields, struggles for resources and power influence, the things that happen in this game are endless.\n\nRight now, they are 64-slot servers... imagine everything I said above on a 10000 slot server, which is what is planned for the near future...

With its early access. Its still fun. Sure there is no tutorial for how to craft stuff. But the fun is going online and finding out how. You dont want to know how to do everything in one way how. You could be know the craftings of only a Blacksmith or how to build or make food and not know anything else. Thats the main fun. The other fun thing is how the guilds work. They arent like a regular MMO medival guild. Its Realistic. Come home from work, hop on the game. Say hi to your buddies and tell the new people where you from. I met a guy today from Kentucky. He helped me skin a bear. And then, after that you do your job. And do the same. The other people who play for 9 hours guard or are the Owners of the faction. The System is great, and the people are very very nice. Greatest community I have ever met. Another thing that happened today, it took 3 guys with Scale armour to kill a bear\ntwo went unconious the other fired like 16 arrows into the bear. They said it was dangerous for me because I had Leather.\nAnd so I went out, I found a bear and they warned me, I got knocked down sure and retreated to the water. I then slinged it and retreated. Slinged it and retreated. About 50 Slings and it ran away but I slinged it about 4 more times. It sat down and it got tired. Finally it died after 8 more slings. I got the Black guy to come, Everybody was amazed at what I had done and I felt like this was the best game I had played this year. I am waiting for more to come\n\nREALISM\nThis game is trying to be realistic also. With the way the AI act to how long crafting and growing trees are. I would love it if there would be guids with huge factions with Neighborhoods with about 6 people in each house and a Kingdom with about 50 people. Men and Woman (Woman that are Girls irl would be alot realistic then Fake woman) filled in the houses. It would also be great if there was random AI bandits. the AI bandits for the Wolves and Bears are great! Sneaking upon there prey. I stalked upon a Wolf and followed it upon Miles until it turned around and tried to eat me. It ran after it saw my buddies chase upon it. That was also a great feeling! It acts like real AI! Bandits or enemy humans would be a great addon with own tents and also expanding and also coming from the Ocean sailing with ships.\n\nONLINE: PLAYERS AND THE COMMUNITY\n\nThe players are friendly and feel like your talking to real friends irl. They are helpful and its unlike the true internet that insults with or on your Iphone with all kinds of Drama. I only have seen a admin have to ban a player for Sexually assaulting sombody and then trying to kill him. But I then heard he was a new player as his friend joined. The new players can also be very nice. This may be my first day but this is my experince. Diffrent then any other game I played. Sometimes the Younger players that are 12-15 would do somthing like hit you but as long as you know them well and you die close to a house that you spawn at. Best is not to scream at them unless your teamates do. A man named Jacob kept killing us in our own guild. But it was fun, we all hid in a barn and Jettman the owner moved and he found us all... But we were all having fun because we all worked hard on our skills and getting Resources so what else do we do? Going raiding is fun sure but I mean real fun.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe Graphics are good. Includeing the Sun going down looked realistic not just going down instantly. It took time. I played on all Settings High and the game didnt lag or give me a bad Framerate either. Only a couple lag spikes. But I would give the Graphics a 9/10. I heard alot of people say the Graphics are good.\n\nOVERALL\n\nI think this game is well done and not rushed. I never wrote this big of a review besides Arma 3. But this review means more then any other of my Reviews. I think the Dev's did a great job on this. They even reply to complaints. A review complaint was a guy that was banned because he said the game was boring in Early alpha. He later was unbanned because of his Review which changed. Other Developers dont do this. Other games ignore peoples bad reviews and ban them thinking it solves it until they ban half of there game. Everybody is nice. Give this game a try. Watch broacasts also to help.\n\n","September 4, 2015","true","15.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I have put a lot of time into this game. If you go to the wiki to find tutorial videos, mine are the ones that are posted there. I think it is pretty fair to say I know this game. The reason why this game has a mixed reveiw status is because it can take A LOT of time to get into this game. I understand why some people are put off.\n\nIf you are a gamer who doesnt like to put more than an hour or so in to a game to get good at it, then yes, this game is not for you. Yet if you are looking for a rish and deep imursive enviroment to spend hours in, that rewards you for doing your research and working hard, then this is your game.\n\nThis game hits the nail on the head so hard when it comes to medival construction that it may feel tedious at points. I really do recomend getting a few friends together who all want a great experience so you can thrive, because just like in real life, you are not a one man army, and it takes a village, to build a village.","September 21, 2015","true","151.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Individual players have the opportunity to make their own choices in a (sometimes) violent world, so there is a balance between gaining followers through public image and power.\n\nThe 'Mixed' rating is because the game was put up for alpha in a state where most players experienced game-breaking bugs, this is no longer the case. The game is now about ready for release. It could take players directly from minecraft.\nOnce the game switches to being an MMO they will be re-submitting it to the store, so the rating will be reset without the hindrances and I'm expecting positive reviews.","November 30, 2015","true","503.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I admit, it isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy more slow paced, realistic, sandbox type games, this hits that sweet spot. Yes, it takes a lot of time to accomplish things, and yes you will need at least one or two other people to play with in order progress very far, but what results is a far more relaxed and social approach to the online survival/crafting sandbox genre.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand and can be very difficult to learn how accomplish anything at all, but once you do figure it out, everything feels like a massive accomplishment, which is rare in games these days. As a result, the time you spend in game feels far more rewarding than other games of this type and is well worth the investment to learn it properly.\n\nAs I said before, it isn't for everyone, hence the mixed reviews, but if anything I mentioned above sounds appealing, then it is certainly worth a try.","February 28","true","67.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

Por lo que he podido probar hasta ahora, os puedo decir, que el juego aunqu está verde, es funcioanl y puede uno hacerse una idea de lo que será el juego final cuando lo acaben.\n\nNo compres este juego si piensas jugar sólo:\nLife is feudal, se puede considerar como un verdadero simulador de vida Feudal. Empiezas sin nada y tienes que crear todo de cero, pero no experes una experiencia acelerada como ocurre en otros juegos. Si bien hay servidores en los que la progresión está acelerada y puedes aumentar tus estadisticas y habilidades rapidamente, la versión final del juego pretende ser un simulador de la vida Feudal y bajo mi punto de vista bastante realista. Tendrás que crear herramientas primitivas que te permita recolectoar recursos para hacer otras herramientas más complejas y así poder obtener recuersos a su vez más complejos. Deberás crear tus estaciones de crafteo y hacerlo todo desde cero. Crear un horno, moldear la arcilla para hacer un molde donde más tarde verter los metales fundidos que te permitiran crear un yunque por ejemplo. Si piensas hacer todo esto tu sólo, posiblemente estés muerto antes de que puedas hacerte una choza donde estar a salvo.\n\nEs un juego de grupo, gestionar los recursos, esconder tus tesoros, hacer guardias. Nuestro personajes tiene un limite de capacidad. Lo que no puedas llevas encima, tendrás que esconderlo. Posiblemente debas hacer guardias con tus compañeros de juego para mantener vuestros progresos a buen recaudo. Necesitarás todo el espacio libre en vuestra mochila para poder hacer las labores y trabajos que tendrás que desempeñar si quieres que tu grupo progrese y se haga fuerte dominando estas medievales tierras.\n\nDebereis trabajar muy duro, debereis organizaros, hay muchas cosas que hacer. Hay que procurar comida para el grupo, recursos para avanzar y dar protección a todos los que estan trabajando en vuestro asentamiento.\n\nLa politica será fundamental. Vuestra supervivencia se basará posiblemente, no sólo en el numero de hombres que seais, si no también en saber ser diplomáticos. Hacer alianzas cuando es necesario o dejar claro al resto quien manda en el territorios que estás trabajando.\n\nTodos querrán hacer su aldea y progresar, tener una fortaleza, un castillo y hacerse grande. Pero habrá muchos que no puedan conseguirlo y se dediquen a saquear al resto. Life is feudar es un mundo libre, no hay roles predefinidos. Se lo que quieras ser. Puedes crear tu imperio. Puedes vivir robandole a los ricos y repartirlo entre los tuyos. Quizas prefieras ser un mercenario y prestar tus servicios a un guild a cambio de un suculento botin, o simplemente explotar los recursos del mundo y proveer a otros reinos. O por el contrario, quizas quieras hacer de intermediario. Comprar los excedentes a unos y venderselos a los otros. Puedes ser un señor de la guerra y dedicarte a fabricar armas con las que comerciar con los reinos en guerra....\n\nLas posibilidades son infinitas, porque las reglas las pone la comunidad. Y este puede ser el peligro y punto debil del juego. Es un juego que depende de una comunidad activa de jugadores y ahí estará el exito o no del juego.\n\nLo cierto es que es un juego no apto para todos los publicos. Es un juego hardcore, no apto para cryer. Deseamos mucha suerte a los desarrolladores y esperamos que sean capaces de sacar el juego de forma sólida y sin dar oportunidad a los hackers para joder este juego.\n\nYo por mi parte, lo he comprado para dar el apoyo al proyecto. Como juego a día de hoy es entretenido si juegas con varios amigos y una gran oportunidad para ir aprendiendo la dinamica del juego que es bastante más compleja y extensa de lo que a priori parece.\n\nEn resumen, un autentico Sandbox simulador puro y duro de lo que sería vivir y progresar en un mundo medieval.\n\nDisfrutadlo.\n\nIMPORTANTE: No lo compreis si esperais encontrar un juego terminado y sin bugs. Muchas de los arboles de habilidades y progresiones aún no están implantados. Está todo en fase de desarrollo y aunque es jugable, no hay servidores estables y son reseteables. Tu personajes y su progreso así como los cambios que hagas en el juego están sujetos a que el server sea reseteado (y con ello la perdida de todo el progreso en ese server), cosa que ocurrirá más a menudo de lo que os gustaría.","September 21, 2014","true","40.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thevaultdwellinggamer/recommended/290080/","Thevaultdwellinggamer","Thevaultdwellinggamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thevaultdwellinggamer/","30 products in account","This  game? This game is special. This isn't your typical mmo where you have  to use your rotate your skills or spam to until a Mob dies, nor you can  grind for hours on end, just to achieve max level. You don't have to  worry about end game, you don't have to worry about a gear treadmill.  All you need to do is interact with other players and make the world as lively as possible.\n\nAfter seeing runescape turn into a wow clone in terms of combat, At first, I enjoyed it. Then I start to realize how boring the combat is. All I was  doing is going from one skill to another, just to maximize my dps. At that point, my mmo heart has turned hollow. Looking for a new mmo to fill that void. I tried countless other mmo that has the same uniqueness to runescape pre eoc. I can't. It's all the same. Every single one of them. The boring quest grinding, that even runecape didn't have that problem, The daunting gear treadmill. I just couldn't do it. Gw 2 was  pretty decent and it held me up for a while with it's more simpler combat system. The same with Eso. (Seriously, Voice acting during questing is a god send.) But this game? It has sparked my love for mmos in general  and embraced it wholeheartedly.\n\nWhen I first start, I didn't know what to do, or where to go. I was kinda lost honestly. So I wandered aimlessly, not knowing what to do, or how this game worked. It was so different from any other mmos out there.  Yet, I kept going, learning new things such as making tools such as an  axe to get me started. Then I met some people building a fort. They  helped me level the skills needed to build a fort and that was where the  fun really begins. Whenever I'm with people, I always have this feeling that I was a part of something. Even if they're strangers, I think of  them of my own. And when I help them with stuff like getting wood, I felt like I was contributing something big.\n\nAnd  that's what I realized how socially active this game made me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a very shy person, but it is rare for a game to make me come out of my shell like that. I want to continue being social, I want to hang out with other people in this game. And I can do that, because the game devs gave me the freedom to do so.\n\nI  can be whoever I want. I can be a merc who help fight a war. I can be a wanderer, going from town to town. Heck, even some sort of adventuer doing something crazy. The choice is all mine, and I love it for that.\n\nAm  I saying this is going to be this "WOW KILLER?" No, but it doesn't have to be. I might not played this game for over 100 hours (I don't want to be burned out. :( ) but I can tell you that if you buy this game, for whatever reason. I promise you, this trip will be like no other.  (Warning to all solo players. This game is designed to interact with other players. You can solo the game, obviously. But you'll get more enjoymeant out of playing with others.)\n","January 11","true","18.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jairone8/recommended/290080/","jairone8","rjmann8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jairone8/","14 products in account","Life is Feudal is not for everyone.  If you are completely unwilling to play with open world PvP (despite probably one of the best anti-grief systems around,) want quick action on a constant basis, want to gank people without any resulting issues, find the idea of needing other people to do much troublesome, or just don't like a slower pace where building and crafting your community is big goal... then you likely won't enjoy this game.  *Note:  you can play it by yourself and use GM commands, so if you just want to craft away slowly and enjoy the island in the :YO version... then much of this doesn't apply!*\n\nFirst, the game is very crafting heavy.  In the Your Own version this can be worked around with GMs.  However, that all depends upon server rules for multiplayer.  In the MMO, crafting will likely be a large part of your content.  Crafting requires other professions, and has a little more complexity than your standard MMO fare.  It isn't something that will leave you guessing, though, like many other systems do.\n\nSecond, the game has systems for wounds, decaying gear, building decay, etc.  All these things need to be taken care of, along with food and possibly thirst.  Additionally, your character can become exhausted and need to rest.  You will have concerns other than just what to hit next.\n\nThird, the game uses a physics based combat system.  You must aim and time with ranged attacks.  You must aim and time with melee attacks.  If the damaging part of your weapon does not make impact you won't see much for results.  This will be something some like, and others do not like.\n\nFourth, the game is not finalized in many ways.  It is released for this version, but more work and improvements are still being done (just the focus is now on the MMO.)\n\nFifth, the game uses a time basis for a number of things (trees and plants, growing herbs in the garden, raising your alignment *which relates to the anti-griefing system,* etc.)  Darkness is dark (unless you gamma adjust... which I wish was not the case but oh well.)  Dealing with good time management will get you more than working without it (although you can get around that in this version.)\n\nThe Developers are consistently on their forums, and interact with the community.  They take a lot of the feedback we provide and work on making the game better.  I highly recommend anyone with an interest in the game to look at some of how the game plays, to ask questions of the community and developers (they are on various social media as well as here,) and to consider what you want out of gameplay.  If you are looking for a long term game with social ties, building a community, and dealing with the various other aspects as talked about this may be a game you really enjoy.  If not, you may wish to pass.  The game is not for everyone, but for those who would enjoy such things I do heartily recommend it.","April 15","true","294.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you are in active server with active gm-s and events/rules you are going to have fun time. Game itself has only basic elements (combat, crafting, building), server administrator/moderator or guild has to decide how the gameplay should be.\nFor example: Players build trading area and make rule, that this area is no combat zone (written rule). There is no function in game to make it safe area, but gm-s can enforce that rule with kicks and bans.\n\nThe skilltree got it own pros and cons. I like how you first have to too level up skill A to get access to skill B and you cant level up everything cause skill point amount is limited and because of that you need to coop with other people to get mats from skills that you dont have. What I dont like is that if you want to level up archery you have to have leather armor, to get that you need to have farming, to do farming you have have construction, to do construction you have to have mining and so on. Ofc you can skip all that if you find someone who can craft leather armor and is willing to trade you.\n\nWhen it comes to trading, game got no currency. So trading is done items-for-items and because there is no currency you never know what is valuable for others. You can ask in global chat, but lot of server got rule - No trading in global. In my opinion having currency would boost quality of gameplay a lot.\n\nBuilding houses and other stuff is something that everyone prolly like to do. Building is very time consuming escpecialy when you are alone. Building basic constructions that you might need like furnace or anvil can be easily done alone, but building fortress or complex housing needs time and having right skills.\n\nI recommend not because "it got potential" or what it going to be in futured. I recommend it cause I had more than 50 hours of fun and if you are into building, co-op and roleplay you are going to have more than 50h of joy. Also the development keeps moving on. I have heard that they are trying to turn this into MMO, with bigger map. So I ques they use this game as test out functions that they are going to have in MMO version.\nWhen it comes to bugs, I did not encounter any gamebreaking for me, but I also have not tryed all out like sieges and large scale battles. Biggest bug or glitch I had was wolf falling trough mining sealing and attacked me.

I cringed at the price, but knew that i was not only getting this game, but getting a slot in the MMO RPG version as well: which made me feel less nervous about  the price. Finally it downloaded, and i jumped right in with a few friends.\n\n\nIt was hard in the beginning because we had absolutely no idea how to play. But we got along nicely. We found a very nice European server where we joined up with the locals in making a town. I was incredibly surprised to find that i had no lag though my ping was 200. Once we got the rhythem of things, we began to enjoy it alot more.\n\nWe set up a little village in a valley where it would be easy to make a living. Farms surrounded our village, mines were started on the outskirts, and the village flourished...kinda. I will point out that it is very hard to start a village, let alone maintain it. But we did!\n\nAt this moment our village still sits in that little valley, where we live in peace and hope to one day become a flourishing city...\n\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis game is a very ambitious one: the amount of things you can do is outstanding!\n\nEverything from mining and crafting to cooking and farming: this game offers a spot for every person's interest.\n\n\nThere are bugs of course, but they are being resolved quickly, The developers have proven to me that they are dedicated, and show that through the patches that are put into the game, however small they may be.\n\nThe bugs i've noticed are more server side and game crashes than actual in-game bugs. In all honesty, the game as Early Access is coming along quite nicely.\n\nHowever good the game may be, people still get turned off by the price.\n\nSo my advice to people thinking about buying the game is this: If you are interested in the game, by all means get it. But be warned that you may have some troubles along the way. But in the end you get two games out of it: Life is Feudal: Your Own edition, and the MMO RPG version when it comes out.\n\nMy advice to the developers is this: Please tone down the price. 40 dollars is not something you would expect from something labelled as Early Access, however far a long the development of the game may be. I understand that you are trying to fund the MMO RPG, but more people will buy it if the price is around 20 dollars. You will still make the same profit you are now because more people will buy it.\n\n\n\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","310.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

I've played it on different skill multipliers: x50, x10, x3 and x1. I played solo and in a group.\n\n\nI've found that when I started playing this game is not my type of game if you play solo. On certain servers you can get all the skills on one character and do everything yourself, however, leveling up a skill on a x3 and x1 is much more satisfactory and with a 600 skill cap this makes you work together, which in my humble opinion is what this game is all about.\n\nI've been playing with a group of people for quite a while now(just came back from holiday though) and it's really enjoyable. We even switched over to roleplaying which I like even more, but you can play the game either way. However, this game is not for people who only want to fight and not do the work, to achieve something you need to work for it and put time in it.","November 4, 2014","true","256.5"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","34","61","0","1"

I've played a lot of alpha's, beta's, and pre-orders. This is already become my idea of a great game. As with most gamers, in the back of our minds we all have a "dream game that one day I'll make." And at least for me as a strategy, simulation, and Sandbox Multiplayer type guy, this is great, and as close as anyone has come.\n\nIt's very much like the game Civilization, except you are the Settlers and Worker units you sent out to start a city. You build improvements as the Worker unit in and around your city. You clear trees. You farm the land. You build city improvements (Shops, Kitchen, Warehouse, Walls, Market (Trading Post).\nYou build Roads, often between cities, especially those within your kingdom.\n\nAnd combines that with a FPS, even though the models and actual combat are rather lackluster. Well, except for the armor models, the Heavy and Royal versions of all of them are pretty sweet. But eh, it's there. It will be improved.","December 1, 2014","true","057.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Now after it got released me and my girlfriend finally found the time to play it. And oh boy we just could not put it down. Even though it walks the line between tedious and rewarding with mixed success it has a certain appeal and ambition when it comes to it’s huge amount of crafting that has to be praised.\n\nIt is to minecraft what the arma3 is to call of duty. Everything requires time and planning. Everything is a bit more complicated but the smaller things are that much more rewarding. And did I mention time? From your primitive tool up to your crazy fortress requires a constant combining of skills and crafting to the point where undertaking huge projects must be tackled in a group. Unless you are truly insane and your rent is payed for 10 years in advanced.\n\nOn a sidenote make sure to join / create a server that has the right settings for you and or your group. Nothing worse than building a wall only to see it go up in flames a few days later because object decay was on or to high. You also might not want to grind your teeth every time you try to level up your skills. Server settings could make or break this game dependant on what kind of playstyle you prefer.

( you cant level rocks and they get in the wya of building ) Tunneling ^^ doesnt fix it either because you cant build where you mined.\n\n\nThings to think about... Do you have hours and hours to spend every night? no? then run away.. but if you do this game is so fun. Get a few friends or make a few friends to build settlements quickly. Remember how many points you get to spend is based on what the srver is set at.\n\nI have a hosted server [EST] Impulse Gaming, there is light RP on the server and we are working on building an arena for our pvp and tournaments with prizes ( in game prizes ) we have the skills cap set at max at 3,000 which is still FAR from what you would need to max everything. So plan ahead what you want to do.\n\nThere are guides and wikis all over for help !!\n\nMost important!!! ********* If you do not want a skill in something open the skills page ( L ) and change the skill to either hte lock to not level or the down arrow to downgrade levels.","February 28, 2015","true","257.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

This game is really one where you HAVE to work together, especially on servers where the settings are close to what the MMO will be (600-1000 skillcap, 0.5-2 multiplier). However, now that the guild claim system is implemented it can be very rewarding because everything within your guild monument's claim is protected.\n\nAs other people have said, it is a pretty slow paced game, which makes it realistic, but I find a lot of newbies don't seem to grasp that. You have to put in a lot of time and have patience in order to get a settlement going and get armor and weapons. And even then, if you're playing on a pvp server, you still need to put work and time in your settlement to improve your defenses or another guild is going to surpass you technologically and wipe you out.\n\nIf you're doing multiplayer (where most of the fun is to be had), I would highly recommend using teamspeak, mumble or the like for your group. Communication is essential in multi.\n\nAll in all, I've definitely got my money's worth out of this game. This style of game and the way the devs have implemented most things so far seems perfect. I can't wait for the MMO.\n\nEDIT: Jan 2016, since I've written this review (March 2015) this game has gotten so much better. Almost everything is implemented, graphics are improved, dx11 optimization kicked in, and with horses and siege weapons it just seems so much more complete. Definitly buy this game and join a settlement. In-game or out of game. Guilds are always looking for players who are smart and willing to contribute because it is a two-way street. Everyone benefits from having more crafters/gatherers/buildiers/warriors/specialists to help them and to help out.","March 20, 2015","true","807.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Just a bag you drag and drop your items wherever you please. The simple things like that reminded me of UO.

Please STOP... BEFORE you buy this game!!\n\nPlease READ this CAREFULLY.... BEFORE you spend your hard earned money on this game!!\n\nI remember watching the video before this game launched on early access, and thinking it looked EPIC AS HELL.\n\nSo then, the game came out, and almost every review was positive and full of great praise, and the game was a new #1 TOP SELLER on Steam!  WOW!\n\nSo I  worked hard to earn some money.  I sold a bunch of toys and my old bike at my folks yard sale that weekend.  I HAD to have this game!!\n\nAnd then Sunday evening, I finally convinced my father to buy it for me, even though I was still about $10 short.\n\nAnd as I played the game, my heart full of super expectations began to break slowly but surely.\n\nSee, I had been worried before the game launched that the game might not be complete enough or be a bug-infested mess.  That's not the problem at all actually.  In fact, the game feels solid, way more complete then so many other early access survival games of it's sort.\n\n...So, why was I disappointed?\n\nWell, watching the video ads for the game, and reading all the great reviews set me up to be disappointed.  This is NOT a survival game anything like Rust or DAYZ but just better because you can do more stuff and farm and make cooler houses.  I mean, I'm sure you can.  IF you have a group of friends all playing together and all agreeing not to pull your hair out in the insanely steep skill curve of the game.\n\nTo give you an idea, I spend three hours in the game.  I traversed a large path through the map, looking for anything or anybody on an existing server with players.  I found not a single animal to run from, attack, fight or even just watch run off.  I saw no other players either.  But I did start trying to harvest and learn the crafting system some.  And OMG.  Let's just be honest and agree that in a game like Rust, most players don't have the patience to harvest wood, ore, and other materials themselves, and instead just try to kill other players to collect their loot.  Okay, now that we understand that, imagine a resource collecting game that is about 1/100th of the speed of collecting reosurces in Rust.  Actually 1/100th might be too fast, it might be closer to 1/500th of the speed of collecting resoruces in Rust.  I mean everything just goes soooooo slow here.  It takes 20 seconds to snap a single branch off of a tree.  Then you need to spend 20 seconds to collect some plant fiber from a plant.  Then find some rock terrain and spend another 20 seconds searching for flint.  Now you can craft maybe a primitive shovel.  Another 20 seconds, and bam!  So you're thinking cool!  That's not so bad, right?  Uhhh yeah, but now this shovel and your skill at using are crappy as hell.  So even if you set your terraforming skill to max at the character creation screen, terraforming even a small square of land is going to take HOURS.  And then you repeat the process to make an primitive axe, and you start hacking some of the smaller trees down.  More time, for every single little log.  And you move slow as hell to move that log where you want it.  And seeing as how it looks to take about 1,000 logs to even make the most basic of houses, you're talking about a time sink of hours and hours and hours and hours just to make anything even half way decent.  Compare this to a game like Rust where you can find a single woodpile, harvest it in 20 seconds, and make a complete shelter three minutes into the game.  or collect a few woodpiles and you can make a nice 4x4 2 story house in 20 or 30 minutes tops.  And remember that in Rust, 90% of the players are too lazy to even do that, and instead just look for other players to killl and rob.\n\nSo sure, this game might be great when you get to the point of the videos on the store page, but after playing this game for a few hours, that it obviously so far away that it's honestly just not worth it.  I'm not going to spend 10,000 hours of grinding away in the game to get there.  And yes, I could get friends to buy the game and help me, and yay, then all of us only need to spend $40 each on the game, and spend only 2,500 hours of game time skilling up and getting to that point.  Ugh.  I hope you see my point.\n\nBefore you even think about responding yelling at how bad my review is, instead go to youtube and watch some random game play videos.  And in all of them, you'll see people doing the exact same thing I did in my first few hours.  Collecting twigs, and plant fiber and looking desperately for fun, but saying something about needing to find friends and learn more about the game.  What I mean is, people are going to be boring crap.  You're not gonna see people with awesome houses and cities and advanced armor and weapons and epic fights.  No, you'll see this same super grind of skills, collecting the most basics of resources and the videos will honestly be pretty boring to watch. Now, if all of the videos now for this game are boring to watch, imagine being in their shoes playing the game and advancing at such a super crawl in the game.  Oh boy!\n\nThe game is pretty solid, the graphics look plenty nice.  But honestly, I see about 98% of players being wayyyyyy too bored to continue to invest the time required to 'get to the good stuff' in this game.  I am a patient gamer, but playing this game made me want to break my arm to go play with the hackers in Rust instead.\n\nBuy it if you know what you are getting people.  This is not Rust.  The game might be deeper and better yes, but realize that you are going to be the most patient of all patient people to even get anywhere.  I mean in the upper like 1% of gamers.  For over 90% of gamers, even thouigh they might like the 'idea' of this game at first, they will soon find something with a much quicker speed of game play and advencement.  Not many people will want to spend 30 hours just searching for flint and twigs and plant fiber and then realize that OMG now they need to spend 90 more hours at the next most basic stage of character skill development.\n\nMost people complain of GRIND in mmorpg games.\n\nMagnify that grind by about 1,000 and you have 'Life is Feudal'.\n\nYou've been warned.  Buy at your own risk now.

PVP, PVE, Raiding, etc.\n\n- $40 is very expensive for a early access game.\n- Definitely got $40 worth of fun out of LiF\n- Right now the amount of fun you will have is heavily dependent on the server you are on.\n- There are servers with  house-rules and servers without rules.\n- The skill progression of the game is completely different for each server as well as several very important factors, all tweaked by that specific server's admin to test those settings.\n- You need to find a server that will play at the speed you want to play, with the amount of people you want to play with, with the rules want to abide by.\n- The PVP is not broken although you will find swinging with a wooden shovel is not very effective when compared to a claymore and the hitboxes are a little iffy.\n- There are currently some serious bottlenecks with how much you can do to a server before it starts to get bogged down.  Cutting down trees and leaving stumps, excessive mining and building are no nos\n- Remember this game is an Alpha, and as much as you want daily updates with groundbreaking new material you are basically signing up for a testing job\n- All this being said, actually creating stone walls, metal tools, suits of armor, etc from nothing but what you find and build is incredibly satisfying.  To go from a naked guy with a handfull of cookies to the proud owner of "The Vault", a walled in farm, and the highest quality producing iron mine on the server (all while being constantly harassed by raiders) provides a sense of achievment i've not found in many other games.\n- Soloing this game is tough but i find just one or two other people is all you need on any server with a skill cap of 1000 or above.  Large groups are very fun to play with but some people are picky about which job they want to do.\n- I wont be like the rest of the reviewers and pretend to know whats going on behind the scenes with the devs but as far as my experience goes they have been great, Bobik personall replied to a question i had.  LiF sees an update every week or two.\n\n\nI heavily reccomend this game, but at the price its at its tough to say go and buy it.  If you are into games with steep learning curves, coop gameplay, building/mining games, sword slashing, or just plain living Feudal, go for it!\n\n8/10\n\n","November 10, 2014","true","330.1"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","0"

As you run towards the nearby forest you see four men in leather rush up a nearby road with crossbows in hand. You decide against your better judgment to follow them up a mountain. You watch from behind a tree as they stealthily get into position below a larger force of heavily armed people. The scene before you begins to unravel; There is a vast mountain fortress with high walls and an impenetrable gate. The defenders are raining arrows and bolts down on top of the besiegers who have chopped down the trees and used them to erect palisade walls for cover. The group you followed is allied with the defenders, and just as they are about to open fire the attackers spot them. Swords are drawn and chaos ensues. Two attackers and three defenders are ultimately slaughtered, one taking a crossbow bolt to the back of the head, and the rest falling to melee combat. As the leather archers retreat to their own stronghold, the battle ends as the injured and exhausted attackers make their way back to their Viking kingdom to count their spoils and nurse their wounds. A protracted, two hour long siege on a mountain fortress, all taking place within your first in-game day. You run to some corpses and find gear, running off into the woods to begin your own adventure, and avoid the bloodthirsty feuds of warring nations.\n\nThis is Life, and it is Feudal. The above is an example of something which happened on the server I play on, and I am sure on many others as well. The game itself is something many people have been waiting for - a true role playing game where you take on the task of a builder, farmer, carpenter, blacksmith, miner, forester, healer, alchemist, and so on. Players must work together to survive, establishing settlements and hunting wildlife, mining deep tunnels and clear cutting entire forests. Everything you build, or grow, or cook, must be made from things gathered elsewhere, bringing a sense of true accomplishment to completed tasks, doing away with the instant gratification many games provide for us these days.\n\nWill you be a bandit? A Thane of a Viking keep? A humble farmer serving under a just and noble lord, or a wandering merchant selling his possibly ill-gotten goods to the highest bidder? The choice is yours in Life is Feudal, and for an early access Alpha game, it is arguably one of the best games to date in my opinion. Aside from the random crashing, and a few mechanics in game that one would expect to be completely possible but are not implemented yet, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who loves medieval times and role playing games.\n\n10/10 !","November 8, 2014","true","525.9"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","27","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jockstrapstrangler/recommended/290080/","jockstrapstrangler","Jockstrap Strangler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jockstrapstrangler/","353 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: You will put many hours into this game before you see any significant progress. The game does not instantly reward you. You will spend lots of time on the wiki and in forums getting answers to your questions. If you plan to play alone, you're choosing to make the experience much harder on yourself. To get full enjoyment of the game, join a village.\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing game with a deep crafting system, the ability to create any conceivable design for a village (within the limits of the game mechanics of course), a challenging yet rewarding gaming experience, then this game might be for you. I'd like to first address the reasons I believe people would not enjoy this game.\n\n1. You will not be instantly rewarded for your labors. It takes time to erect a clay hut, to construct a house, to build a wall. If you've played Rust, you're more familiar with the ability to simply gather a certain number of wood and clicking the structure you wish to build. In LiF, it's much more tedious.  The gathering process beforehand along with acquiring the skills necessary to even gather those materials are a discipline in and of itself. Once you do achieve the appropriate levels and gather all materials, you can finally build your structure, that is if it's on level ground. If the ground is not level, you must terraform. If you're not familiar with terraforming, this game is a perfect introduction. All it means is diggins out dirt and leveling out the terrain.\n\n2. Lack of NPCs. This, in my opinion, adds an interesting dynamic to the game. It forces players to cooperate in ways they may not have before or have always refused doing. However, the amount of time and effort it takes to gather certain ingredients makes it almost advisable to establish some form of trade contract with another player to help with your experience.\n\n3. Weak PVP system? Long story short, killing other players can be an immense challenge considering their abilities. For example, you can always run into a village in full armor and a two-handed sword and murder a player who's unarmed, and lacks armor with ease. Of course, this is assuming you have the appropriate levels to even wear armor which you have to craft and you can only craft that armor if you have the appropriate gathering levels to get those ingredients. This is why cooperation is stressed in LiF because you can have different players have various roles (blacksmith, carpenter, herbalist, etc) and you come together to build a flourishing experience. Anyway, I digress.\n\nAssuming both players are in a consenting battle, it won't be shortly won as the targeting system is physics based meaning wherever you swing is where you'll do damage. Since the game is in Alpha it's not always accurate. Of course you can move around and block and there are even crossbows to attack at range. And the game does not reward you for killing others. In fact, in a way it punishes you. You have a prayer skill which is measured by something called Alignment. Everytime you do damage to another player your alignment decreases. This means, if you die with low alignment, you will lose skill points and the lower your alignment the more points you lose. However, you do have the ability to invite a player into a "unit" which makes it so alignment is not lost during combat. You can begin to see how random death matches actually hinder the assailant and simply inconveniences the victim.\n\n4. Bugs. If you purchase the game in this current state, you will notice bugs here and there. They do not significantly impact your experience nor does it take away from the game. All the necessary components are in the game and you will be able to play it just fine.\n\n5. Intense graphics requirements. Many players including myself have to lower the graphics settings to lowest to avoid sluggish gameplay. But I have to say even with graphics set to lowest the game still looks great.\n\nIf you can get past these points and are still interested in playing the game, I just barely scratched the surface. I recommend giving this game a chance to lure you into its creative depths and challenge yourself with a very intricate game. You may not be instantly rewarded, but the rewards you do receive are damn good.","October 9, 2014","true","86.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The fact that they are all in early access for years turns me off. I followed this game since release because I liked the setting but only picked it up around March16 after they had upgraded the engine and ironed out alot of issues people complained about. I just had the itch to craft.\n\nShort and Sweet: Deep crafting systems, nice graphics, Long building times and skilling up can be a negative to some but it makes the accomplishment SOOOO sweet. Engine still seems to have issues and doesn't run great, concerning if they are using the same everything for the MMO. Worth it if you enjoy crafting games and don't mind that it takes awhile to craft things.\n\nNotes: I originally was turned off by the menu system, "why can't I just click a bunch of times to chop down a tree?" Well you can set an action to default click the menus are there because of all the options and how deep the game is compared to most open world/crafting games on the market.\n\nBottomline: I spent 70 hours on a server that had speed up on leveling up your skills as well as a higher cap, however things still went at a snails pace. This is a great crafting/openworld ONLY if you can deal with the slow pace. Example: If you need logs for a house? You have to carry a giant log on your back slowly to your work site. Not just chop it down and place 30 logs in your inventory.","June 2","true","92.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This people tried not to blame the dev's for the still early und unfinished state of a game that has a skitload of potential.\n\nThe current state of the game after 4 years of development showed that choosing the right engine "before" creating a game is crucial for success. Torque3D is not.\n\nThe development team should take care and finish the "base" of the game to allow a proper gameplay and maybe think about leaving this engine and make use of another more advanced plus involving the community in building it. Take ARK for one of the better examples.\n\nThe game map and assets look like its an multiplayer roleplay game from the late 90's. It would not be a problem if it would not destroy the gameplay itself when you get bug-stuck with your horse on flat surfaces and can run and jump down mountains like the game plays on the moon. Random placed trees floating in the air, pretty bad controls - even Dark Souls with mouse is more playable. Some of many little and bigger things i've seen during the weekend.\n\nCommunity:\nI heard of people joining the game..and leaving again after a couple of hours, never coming back. I also heard about forum stories were devs/moderators delete comments about the current state of the game. At this state and all of the rumors, i am not sure this game was worth 20 Euros. Can i expect ongoing development or beating a dead horse for money? I really don't know, but i hope they will understand what the community has on their heart - taking care of this game that could make a lot of fun in the future.\n\nMy tip:\n- involve community\n- change engine\n- let the community help building the game, from my experience building a strong community can help devs alot.\n\nI rate this game up, BUT its a 51/49 decision.\nIf you expect stable gameplay or proper graphics on an Early Access game thats 4 years in development, don't buy it.","September 6, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you're looking for a survival/crafting/sandbox/MMORPG that differs from the other bigger titles (in the sense of you really have to work towards your survival and nothing is handed to you or is easy) with medieval flare, this is definitely something I recommend strongly.  From hunting to carpentry, herbology, healing, weapon building, leather tanning, cooking, farming, fishing, war-horse training, animal taming/breeding etc. the list goes on and on and each of your skills open the door for another.  Spending the time to level them is key.  Reaching each goal is a huge accomplishment because you do numerous steps to get there.\n\nOf course it's alpha, and there are things still in the works/being added...but hey, that's alpha in any game.  Being a female gamer who usually refuses to play a male character, xD  the fact that I'm able to overlook this for the time being speaks volumes.  I highly anticipate/look forward to the female models being added.  If you can play  this with at least one other person, you are so set.  Each of you can specialize in your own set of skills, and work together to make mad progress.  So grab some friends, chase a boar around with a pitchfork, throw some rocks at a bear, and eat ♥♥♥♥ you find in the dirt to keep from starving!

I was sceptical about this game at first due to it being released to make money for their MMO, but this game is amazing. It so far hasn't had the issues of Rust and Dayz.  There isnt killing on sight due to most things you find on people are useless to you.  The skills you gain make the things usefull and things you need lots of like logs and such are too heavy to steal.\n\nYou MUST play this with others. Skill caps exist forcing people into professions with a few extra skills. Combat has a separate cap so you can be a farmer warrior without issue.  Finding other people isn't too hard and they could always use another alchemist due to their ingenious system with herbs.  Combat it difficult due to the extremely in depth combat system when you try to kill folks with stone sickles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlantisthief/recommended/290080/","atlantisthief","Dark_Atlantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlantisthief/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHello everyone, my nickname is Atlantis and in most cases I keep that name aswell,\nI had my own concerns when I heard the first time of this game. "Another Survival Game?" I thought, but the medieval theme catched me, so I bought it a few days later trying to figure out if I could trust the developer.\n\nAs a new player I was a little bit confused what to do, there is currently no tutorial or any help at all from the game itself. The current UI is working but aswell as confusing as some informations show up when you hit the right key on your keyboard, for example your skills (L), your character page (P) or simply your inventory (I). But luckily, the developer have added some helpfull entries on gamepedia.\n\nAfter my first steps and configurations I decided to jump straight into the multiplayer. Why? Because this game clearly is about teamplay! If you have read it by now or not, some server aswell as the planned MMO will have certain settings that will cause you to play with others to gain better weapons, a house or simply better tools. I will not go further into this as I am not writing a tutorial here ;)\n\nCurrently the server performance is quiet good, although some of my mates I play with reporteed multiple crashes since the latest patch, don't forget this is an ALPHA (some like to forget such things). I enjoy the moments of gathering materials to build a building, a wall or just weapons or armor. And you will have to gather a lot! This game is extremly slow if you compare it to something like Minecraft and you don't have the chance to build your houses on your own, rather then setting up predefined houses (check the wiki for more).\n\nCombat is quiet fun but not balanced right now, slashing weapons can do decent damage, but the bleed that can be applied to you is a death sentence, aswell as some heavy crossbow that kill you nearly in a single shot. This is something that hasn't been worked on since I joined the alpha, but I believe this will be looked at.\n\nGraphic and game performance are moderate, if you have a decent pc and you have some lags, it's because of some bad server maintenance or overload of objects on a map.\n\nThe sound ingame is as right now clearly nothing special. Sometimes a sound is bugging and playing in a loop until you finally decide to restart your game.\nYes restart, because reconnecting/disconnecting is not implemented yet!\n\nAll in all I recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of survival, teamplay, medieval and is ready to invest some time into a game and not expecting to have a big giant castle on day two.\n\nHere my personal opinion in a shorter version:\n\n+A lot of skills\n+A lot of crafting recipes\n+Teamplay needed\n+Patches every second week\n\n-Soundquality\n-Missing guild/friend system\n-Missing longer roadmap (I like to see a plan cause it shows some "organization")\n-Combat unbalanced\n-Some Crafting recipes needs to reworked\n-No horses :(\n\nThanks for reading, if you liked it please give me a thumb up :D","October 16, 2014","true","252.0"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

I've logged nearly 200 hours in only a few weeks, and it's been nothing but a blast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphaelDeFusco/recommended/290080/","RaphaelDeFusco","RaphaelDeFusco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphaelDeFusco/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is designed similar to the MMO Würm.\nTo those that don't already know what Würm is, it is a ultra realistic medieval simulator with tons of grinding and real life day efforts to accomplish greater deeds, Minecraft copied Würm and made it into a piece of cake for newbies ( Arcade )\nAnd today we have this game which is way more fast paced than Würm but also harder than Minecraft.\n\nThe concept so far is great and I expect lots of features/content to be added through the development periode of the next few months.\n\nPros:\n-Great Medieval Simulation.\n\n-Architectur / Terraforming is vital to be planned out ahead. ( No instant Minecraft houses )\n\n-Cooperative play is highly recommended as resources is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to collect on your own.\n\n-Bandits/PVP players gets punished by lossing more stats on death.\n\n-Great RPG elements shown through a very neat list of skill trees which unlocks upgrades along the paths you choose.\n\nCons:\n\n-Animals are almost impossible to kill since a moose can take like 150 hits with a stone axe to kill and a wolf will straight up pwn you as you will not be propper quipped for combat until late game.\n\n-Server crashing and slow server list made the game very frustrating, however a few days ago they patched some of bugs which have caused a relative stable version. ( I haven't crashed in awhile now )\n\n-Combat got an animation but compared how they wanted to make it like Mount and Blade hit detection, it is just a prototype as of now and it is more like throwing a dice with a very low chance of hitting.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall I would say this is a good investment, it shows lots of potential in its current shape and for medieval enthusiasts\nthat wants to experience a simulation of medieval life, this is the game there is so many skill trees to make you anything from a architect to a pope.\n\nI really recommend this game since it got patched against server crashing which allows you to play a sort of demo with limited animations but the gameplay is fluid :)\n\nHope you enjoyed my review, get in the game with some friends and start building!\n","October 2, 2014","true","46.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

A lot of people may trash one thing or another without realizing that this is not a complete product.  For an unfinished game, it's fantastic.  For a published game, it's got some work.\n\nThings to expect: Bugs bugs and more bugs.  Again, this is not a complete product.  So yes, there's bugs.  There's quite a few annoying ones.  HOWEVER since I have purchased this game a lot has been done to fix these bugs and to improve on the game.\n\nIf you like simulation type games/RPG based on crafting.  You'll love this game.  Very few games come close.   I would argue some of the skills don't make sense when it comes to unlocking certain skills..  Like Tailoring is unlocked through..  Cooking?  ..  wha..??  Procuration is also a requirement as well as farming..   ?!?!?!    I think that needs to be re-evaluated.  However, the way the skills work in terms of leveling them up is great.  There's basically a few "Teirs" to skills.   0-29, I would call this untrained.  You don't know completely what you're doing, you can't do very much with it, and whta you can do will result in terrible products.   30-59.  I would call this an apprentice.  you know some stuff and you can do some useful stuff, things you make or produce with this skill is not great but you're learning.  60-89, journeyman.  You can pretty much do what you need wit hthe skill and have descent items created from it.  it doesn't take too long to get to 60 in most skills.  Once you're there, you don't really NEEEEED to go any further unless you want to specialize in that skill.  Keep in mind you have a limited amount of skill points so you can't do everything in the game (unless you're on one of those servers who pretty much get rid of the skillcaps)  Getting to 90, which I would say is master, 100 being grandmaster, takes time.  so, skills are cool, the unlocking part needs work.\n\nCombat is gross right now.   plain and simple.   The idea behind it though is amazing.  If you get wounded, doesn't matter if a healer can heal you, tha'tll just keep you alive, you're done.  Unless your suicidal.  This makes for a fantastic combat system where player skill mixed with character skill could land a blow that takes someone out of the fight.  Killing also shouldn't be taken lightly as you will loose karma/alignment.  the lower alignment you have, the more skills you loose when you die.  ALSO if your alignment drops enough, anyone can kill you WITHOUT penalty.  So careful.  People do have the opporunity to yeild.  I would highly suggest letting them live.   Again, cool ideas with the combat system, can't wait till the kinks are worked out.\n\nCrafting and combat.   That's this game in a nutshell.  Some people RP which is cool.  Either way, if that's someting you like, this game, once it's complete should fill that need quite nicely.  For me it already does.  I am quite patient with bugs however, and some people are not.\n\nI reccoment this game to those who aren't always looking for action and like to craft and build.","February 7, 2015","true","148.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The reason is because it is very Alpha Build and not ready for a proper review - that being said; below is my story and hopefully it helps the community inform the Dev team of what needs to be fixed going into Beta.  Hopefully I can review it again in 6-12 months from now.\n\nSo my brother loves survival games and he set up a server and began playing it.  I purchased to play with him, but everytime we played - he did 10 times as much stuff as I did.\n\nI would spent 90 minutes just gathering plant fiber, stickers, and apples - in order to make 6-7 animal snares.  I turn around and my brother built a house and had 16 logs piled up.\n\nI would spent 90 minutes trying to level the ground to build something and I would turn around my brother has a giant blacksmith set up. WTF?\n\nWell it turns out my life was feudal because he unknowingly had GM powers, unlimited sack, and could build on unlevel ground - while I could only carrie 180 dirt each run, carry hardly anything, and breaking a branch takes 30 seconds.\n\nWe laugh about it now, but the proper way to play the game without GM powers is WAY TO SLOW!

This is definitely the first Online game that i enjoy. considering how much i dislike these types of games, this one gets past my dislike because of how it works, the negatives other players get if they attack you.\nthey can't just rip you off. well they can if you have a undefended village, but thats normal.\n\nNow this game is very much in alpha stage of development as of this review.\npersonally for me. i think the current cost of $39.99 is worth it.\nBut for a online game, i like it. very much.\n\n9/10 rating from me.\n\n\nIts alpha, don't buy it unless you wish to support the games development!!!!\n\nupdate 11/12/2014\n\nKeeping my review at recomend.\nSome new info after my time playing, since i wrote the review i had 100 hours into the game, and now about 430. took my time learning more about the game.\n\nSo let's go and see what i have found out.\n\n1. The game has bugs, but thats expected. most are of the annoying type and don't really cause any major issues in the game.\n\n2. Game lag. this is mostly due to the trees and it not being optimized. if you keep setting down like draw distance on trees the lag is manageable. plus the lag spikes but sometimes they are as manageable and sometimes not. again, somthing thats expected in a game this early in development.\n\n3. Servers i have played on a few private servers and had a blast. until they dropped with no warning. which sucks, lost all my and my teams hard work. I'm not normally a online player that gets onto servers so i don't know if thats normal or not.\n\n4. Updates. there has been a couple since i got the game, last one added ability to put furniture where i wanted it. like in the house i built. so that's a plus. and sounds like more animals will be in the next one. so thats another plus.\n\n5. Combat. crossbows suck. the range is ridiculously short and they come before bows. the simplest weapon, the bow should be first., after the sling that is.\n\n5.1 Combat, Swords. now this can be fun, though with the tree lag it can be problematic at times. but once you figure it out it works rather well. take s a bit of time to find that sweet spot. took me many wolves and mooses before i figured that one out.\n\n5.2 Combat Animals. The wolf, it brings a new fear as you run half naked across the sands or in the forests. you learn why humans feared this animal for eons and tried to eradicate it off the face of the planet. freaking things are deadly. until you get some good armour.. then they more of a nuisance. but if you goof, they can still be deadly. as i found out while wearing plate mail armour. wolf hit me in the head and knocked me silly, he then proceeded to chew my intestines like they was spaghetti.\n\n6. Herbalism, the 50,000,000 million combinations thats possible. now this is crucial because you need flux to build the advanced buildings and structures. and flux.. if you're doing it on your own or with just a couple people. can be tedious to get ahold of and time consuming. but the more people you get, the easier it becomes. and if you have other camps willing to trade. then it becomes super easy.\n\n6. Plant Fiber and coops and making of snares. this one i don't much care for in its current state. plant fiber is very time consuming to get. because you only get 1 from each swipe. even with a team of people working with you, its still a chore. especially since if you want to stock your coops to get dung. well you need a ton of snares, and making snares requires a massive, huge load of plant fiber. i think thats the one major issue i have with this game. that and that coops don't really work yet. and the amount of dung you get off it.. is tiny, and tiny dont work if you have a huge farm that requires it.\n\nthere is still a fair amount of content not added yet as of this updated review. but i still endorse this game. and i can see it just getting better and better.\n\n\nand a reminder.\nthis is a game in development, it has bugs and issues and on some peoples computer. it either won't run or lag so badly you can't really play it.\n\nRead the system requirements before buying!!\n\nif you're close to the min specs. your not gonna have a 60fps, more like 15fps or 5fps.\n\nuntil more content is added that is all for now with this updated review.","October 6, 2014","true","382.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This is an awesome game, it runs really fast with maximum settings on my pc -- my pc is a normal pc not even a gamer's. This game includes an ininite amount of hours of variated and fun content, and it looks awesome. It's awesome, like minecraft hugely realistic and with epic^1000 graphics. When crafting each type of item it's like a puzzle itself, in an awesome way. When you finish a building you really feel proud of yourself, like if you had built it in real life.  The 'grinding' it has, it's pretty fast and you end up with awesome results. Spent 2 days and built a huge stone wall, all by myself -- Finding stones, Choping trees, getting wooden boards out of them, digging clay. Even though you might think it takes long to built only a stone wall, it really feels like didn't, because you don't built the entire wall at once. You build each section at a time and rapidly feel the awesome results of it. And not only that, there are about 30 different types of 'Wall Sections' of each tier. (Wood, Stone, Castle) Some of those are: Wall, Diagonal wall, tower, diagonal tower, gatehouse, wall with stairs... This game is awesome ! It is hugely immersive and detailed. It is slow-paced but it feels like if it was fast-paced after playing a little. I hugely recommend this game, for people who like RPGs.\n\n"To play this game really feels like being in the medieval era" 9/10\n\nAwesome graphics, fun, interesting, entertaining.

This game has that with pvp aspects added in. It definitely has a long way to go but if you find a good server you can still get a very enjoyable experience even though everything is not fully implemented yet. The future for this game is very bright and even if you don't buy it to support it's development I would keep your eye on this game for when it hits MMO phase.\n\nPros: The variety of servers available really lets you choose your own play-style. If you want to go alone and keep it easy you can choose a server with high skill multiplier (you level up faster) and a higher skill cap (so you can do more things). While if you're looking for a challenge you can join a server with lower limits and slower leveling (such as Camelot). For me, I enjoy the challenge and I feel rewarded when I finally finish building that project I've been working on, or that I finally reached that level I've been training for. EVEN if this game was to stop being developed today I know that with the modding community the way it is, and the guys over at Camelot server, this game could still be enjoyable indefinitely. Being a part of community and being needed for your skills by that community is an amazing feeling and really promotes the social aspect of this game.\n\nCons: Unless skills are set to over 1500 max you'll need at least a few other people to play and build a community with. Some servers are poorly managed and it may be hard to find one that really suites your play style that is consistently up. The game is still lacking in may aspects, but it's in alpha and you are supporting development by buying the game like it is. If you're into playing solo or a lot of heavy action packed game-play you may not like this. If you don't like medieval settings or non-targeted combat (like chivalry or mount and blade) you may not like this game.\n\n\nMy Alpha review is 10/10\nSee you in game!","December 18, 2014","true","190.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There are bugs. There are things you will dislike. There are parts you mind find amazing, but sadly not yet implemented. All of this is present.\n\nBut besides that, I do honestly believe that if you have ever shown a liking towards the idea of being a medieval peasant, who can maybe work himself out to be a capable warrior, skilled farmer or perhaps a prized alchemist, this might rock your boat.\n\nLet us first summarize the pros. The game presents and open world with other players, but you must not worry about getting stabbed with a nearest stick as soon as you find another human being. Not only is this forbidden on most server, it also has negative consequences. As I mentioned above, there are several profession you can do, and freely combine if you for example want to do basic farming as well as basic smithing, though such merging will prevent you from being a master in either. The game requires you to play in groups of multiple people, which could be considered a downside, but I like this feature, since it can create a friendlier atmoshphere, forge possible friendships and makes it feel much more like a medieval town that you work towards. The various professions have quite a bit of depth in them and all are equally important to the community.\nVery importantly, I find the developers to be fairly active and helpful, despite some fearing an unknown studio will fail. The updates are surprisingly common and you can also track what they are up to from a number of videos on their channel.\n\nNow about the bad. It might be very easy for someone to find the game repetitive, as you are often required to amass a certain amount of resources before you can focus on something perhaps a bit more desirable. To add to the injury, you will see a lot of progress bars, which might be fast, but are frequent. The game is not the most optimized in the world, though it went up a lot lately, and is surprisingly stable. The combat system leaves a lot to be desired, mainly in precision. This will hopefully (and likely) be changed in a later update, yet as of now, it must be mentioned.\n\nThe recollection.\n\nThe game has an incredible atmosphere, bringing you to the harsh world of feudal times. If you ever wanted to be a medieval smith, hunter, farmer, alchemist or perhaps a builder, you will find this game quite pleasing. The long time it takes to complete various tasks such as building houses or creating complex tools can be infuriating, but if you manage to find a friendly group of people with whom to work on a village and get to speak with them on, say, teamspeak (which is very common, no worries), a lot of this boredom will dissipate, thanks in no small part thank to having people to talk with as you do your things. With all that, the game deserves your attention and perhaps further investigation.\n\nAnd that is my recommendation.","July 6, 2015","true","199.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

The developers are quite active in the forums and are good at fixing bugs quickly. The game had a bad release with lots of bugs, but they've fixed a lot of them in the first few days, with more patches to come, which helps to show their dedication to the game. The one MAJOR thing is to make sure you have a computer able to meet the system requirements, which are quite high, as this is the one game out of the almost 90 or so that i own that i cant play on my computer, due to the high requirements for the graphics card. I would personally wait for a week or two before buying, so that they can hopefully get all the bugs worked out. The game is not for people who aren't willing to spend the first 5-6 hours just getting the very basic tools and starting resource gathering. It is a game designed for co-op, which makes single player virtually impossible due to the huge amount of time needed to do anything. I would recomend checking on the forums to find a group to join if you dont have a few friends to play the game with, as there are lots of great guilds out there to play with.","November 21, 2015","true","7.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Running to work and don't have the time to tweak this - so here is raw.\n\n\nerh - don't support the game? so the patches are what? (the patch record sort of destroys your ‘argument’ about that) as for the game itself I have paid for 'finished' games that suck way more than this. That said I see a trend with companies releasing Alphas until ??? and using that as an excuse for never ending worthless game.  I do see improvements in this game on concerns I had and I do not get the vibe of being strung along.  Back to your rant about this game - I personally go by game play / enjoyment to dollar ratio.  $40 is high for an alpha but yet I feel I am well on my way to get my bang for a buck in game play.  The game has is quirks but again I have play 'blockbuster' finished games that suck way more and have given me less dollar value.\n\n\nThose reading this on the fence - please don't let the review above stop you from considering this game.

Despite the bugs and fairly frequent crashes, I can't seem to get enough. I bought this game expecting to play a bit to see where they were in development and really play when it was finished, but once I started... 130+ hours in about 4 days and a few groggy days at work later, I'm still hooked. Think 'The Sims', 'Skyrim', and 'Minecraft' rolled into one game..\n\nAs stated before, it's not finished, there's still alot of features disabled and many of the ones that aren't are buggy or obvious placeholders.  But the idea and style of the game are sound, and it is entertaining.\n\nMy biggest complaint so far is the server selection screen.  It is too basic. It needs filters and the option to save or identify servers you've been on.\n\nOverall, it's very promising.  I look forward to when it's finished.","October 11, 2014","true","386.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The mechanics of the game are good for it's state, the animal AI is good and the crafting is brilliant.\nMore on the crafting. The mining aspect of the game is realistic, not Minecraft like where you can dig a mineshaft 300 blocks long in the space of half an hour, in this it would take you weeks. Hell it would take you months.\nThe Buildings are realistic to every detail, they also take much longer compared to other crafting/building MMOs.\nI cant realy comment on the PvP as i've only fought a tree with an axe so far.\nThe skills are in-depth and have a promising future.\nAll in all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylkana/recommended/290080/","sylkana","Ngaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylkana/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is like the next Minecraft, but in 3D.  It's starting out just as funky and buggy and lacking, in my opinion, however I can see that it's turning into something darn great.  The only real issue I have so far is all the darn progress bars.  I don't really like them, I'd much rather have a minecraft-esque style of harvesting things.\n\nBy that I mean more live-action; if you held down left mouse button to harvest bark or search for things instead of just click and let a progress bar fill I feel it would be more engaging.  It could be something along the lines of every tick there's a %chance based on your skill and other variables that you get whatever item you're trying to get, be it flint, bark, etc.  And making it so there's little mini games for fishing and the like would be pretty great too, I feel.  Yet, honestly, that's really my only complaint.\n\nThere are a few issues with terrain generation, yet I'm sure they'll get that smoothed out.  I mean I saw seams in the terrain where there was nothing but void beneath them.  It was kinda amusing, actually.  Similarly I'm sure they'll get more tooltips into the game that explain more stuff.  While it's great to have it like Minecraft where very little is actually explained in the game, the fact that the simplicity of Minecraft isn't there makes it so that things like descriptive tooltips and the like are absolutely needed so I'm sure they'll work on that as they already have some good tooltips in the game.\n\nI've never liked the idea of having to go to an external site or having to watch video tutorials to get even the basics of a game, I've always found that to be clunky, especially when a simple pop-up tutorial on the basics would serve the player far better.  I'm not saying that everything needs to be explained, yet the basics should at least be pointed out so the player doesn't have to stumble through the first couple of days wondering where or how on earth to get flint or rock.\n\nOverall it's an excellent start to a truly extraordinary game, it's beautiful, it's entertaining, it's engaging, and for being in alpha it's already impressively well done.  If you're not interested in the bugs and troubleshooting but you still want to play a sandbox-builder game with surprisingly beautiful graphics and good gameplay then this is, without a doubt, a game you absolutely want to follow and keep your eyes on, there's great things coming from this, I'm sure.  If, however, you actually don't mind, or even like, being part of the testing process, random crashes, strange bugs, and all that jazz AND want to play a game like I just mentioned then this, right now, is completely for you.  You can be a part of gaming history and usher in a truly unique and amazing game!","October 19, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I clocked between 14-18 minutes to get INTO the game.\n\nTotally recommend this to players who like medieval themes, sandbox games, intricate and detailed skill levelling systems, laborious yet rewarding development of characters and their skill lines, have friends that like to co-op","January 19, 2015","true","355.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has been compared to Rust, DayZ, and Mount and Blade. To be honest, it does relate in different ways to all of these. You can build forever like Rust, the combat is very similar to Mount and Blade from what I have experienced so far, and you have to well...survive, like DayZ. Except no zombies.\n\nLife is Feudal seperates itself heavily from these in that you have to do every little thing. This can be tedious, but in my opinion makes everything worth it once it's all done. Building a simple shack is so rewarding and makes you feel like you've made serious progress. That's only just the beginning though. There is a slew of skills to learn, buildings to construct, and players to make relations with....for the better or worse. Every character in the game is a player, which makes the world either very community-like or very dangerous.\n\nYou won't be able to do everything on your own. You must either find friends online, or invite your friends to join you. Characters have a skill cap and you must master certain skills to reach the furthest depths of that skill set. You'll need friends to provide resources from other skill trees to balance everything you work on.\n\nAnyways, I've gone on long enough. I do love this game and absolutely cannot wait to see what the devs have in store for the MMO version of this. Oh, and to top everything off the game has only been out a couple of weeks and the devs have already released three patches. That's a good sign for the future.\n\n7/10. This is purely because of this game being in Alpha. There are definitely bugs and glitches, but the overall gameplay is not affected heavily by them.

Very realistic, brutal, exacting game. For hard core players who want a sense of satisfaction and achievment when they look at their fort and see all their hard work has paid off. However, this game is still in Alpha so very much of it doesnt work and is not implemented. Myself and three other good friends all played while on Skype for a week straight. We built a small keep, which is a monumental task as far as gathering the resources and aquiring the skill to do so. But upon completion of the keep, we found that we couldnt claim it, so the Keep provided no security and we were robbed of all our hard earned resources constantly. We then decided to seek saftey by building large stone walls around our compound, but the gate we built could not be claimed....foiled again. All the while our resources, flax, leather, iron, char coal, weapons, rope and tools were being stolen faster then we could build and/or gather them. So we built a large warehouse. We could claim that...but it got hacked and all the stuff in it was stolen. Our merchant carts kept ..."walking away" with other noob players helping them.... this game is a fantastic and engaging game. but its unplayable at the moment by hard core players....no one can expect to put any time in it if all their time keeps getting robbed.

My friend once described it like this - "Man, if I get hungry and want a sandwich I gotta start an epic quest chain just to make the mayo."  And its practically true.

However, it is definitely not for everyone.\n\nThis game is more akin to games like Shadowbane and UO: Online of old and the more recent Darkfall. I really feel like it catches the atmosphere of living in Feudal times. One must survive in a open, dynamic world that is completely controlled by players. One can choose to live their Feudal life as they see fit.\n\nA good deal of the game is crafting and building. Not only that but it takes a good deal of time to get anything done. For these reasons, I find that many are turned off by it. However, it is such a rewarding game for those who value creating one's own settlement and then getting involved in the world around them in whatever ways they see fit.\n\nThe combat system is quite good yet takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you get used to it, though, you will most likely really enjoy it. It takes a more realistic approach to combat, where one must learn the range of your weapon and must aim at body parts for maximum affect. It is definitely not an easy system to master and takes practice to get good at it.\n\nThe only drawback that it has is it is still developing and you will run into small bugs and issues that need resolving. I feel that it is a constant work in progress.\n\nThat being said, if you like the idea of an open, dynamic, Feudal world where you make your own way, and you don't mind having to put lots of time to accomplish it, then I can say look no further than this game!","January 11","true","167.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

YES!! I've been playing this game for a few days with a friend, so this is a review in progress. Let me start off by saying, this game, even in its current state.. is incredible. There's so much depth to it.. it's very expansive and there's endless possibilities. 9.5/10\n\n\nPros\n\n+It takes a very long time to gather resources and alter the terrain whilst building houses, and villages. That's a good thing. It makes it more immersive, realistic, and require teamwork. It also feels so rewarding when you complete a project you've been working on. So far, after 3 days.. me and my friend have managed to build 2 huts, a garden, fence, furnace, and blacksmithing station.. even though this seems extremely miniscule, I feel really proud.. like I accomplished something.. and we're planning on accomplishing much more. The more people you have in your group, the faster you can raise your village from the dirt. As long as everyone is working together of course. You'll never run out of things to do.\n\n+You also cannot specialize in all of the professions.. you can only specialize in 1 or 2.. maybe more depending on how you spend your points. So you will need to communicate with other players on what they are specializing in to fill that gap you need to efficently build your village.\n\n+It takes a LONG time to dig a tunnel\n\n+\- Combat? I'm a bit iffy on this one as I haven't had too many violent encounters. While the combat right now is in fact, buggy and the hitboxes are miles off, the concept is amazing and I think this is going to be improved. I got shot by a crossbow, in which I took off running and eventually collapsed from bleeding and then executed. This gave the combat many positive points in my book. As of right now, it will certainly suffice. But don't take my word for it, I've only beat a moose with a primitive axe and got shot with a bolt. I will update on this once I'm more experienced with the combat.\n\nHere are some of my nitpicks, or rather, suggestions on what it would take to make this game utterly perfect.\n\n-This is a big one. Currently, you need to specialize in certain equipment in order to actually use it. This is disappointing. You should be able to use any equipment, regardless of your expertise in it. Expertise should affect how well you use the equipment though. For example, a low level in Crossbow would make aiming shaky and inaccurate. A low level in Mail Armor would make your stamina drain faster. Ect. To not be able to use it at all is unrealistic.\n\n-When you die, a gravestone appears. This is immersion breaking.\n\nAnd here are some current alpha problems that are surely going to be smoothed out in time.\n\n-Crashing (a lot)\n-Lag\n-Bugs (of course)\n-Freezing\n-Stuttering\n\nThese are all to be expected. But don't let them stray you away from this awesome game. For these issues to be present while I simultaneously give the game a 9.5, that means this game is GOOD. I can't explain it. It's just amazing. MANY hours are going to be spent on this game. :)","October 2, 2014","true","31.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This is by far the game that I have been waiting for all along. It is still early access, but with the minor bugs and steep learning curve it is already by far the best game on the market for gamers. I have been playing around mostly on my own private server, learning the mechanics. Hats off to everyone involved in the development and testing of this game. This is the game changer in my opinion. I was with minecraft since launch and was waiting for something more polished. Upon making my first weapons I ventured out to hunt a boar. I had an epic battle, both of us falling unconcious at one point or another. One small gripe is when my enemy is passed out I would like the ability to do a kill shot. I had a pitchfork and could not get the stabby motion working properly. I wound up beating on him. The combat is reminiscent of Mount&Blade, another I have been with since launch & have 7 days to die. This combines the best of all of them into a rich and vivid world. Please make more LiF:YO maps. I already want snow and desert landscapes, 3kmx3km is perfect size though. Hurry up and finish the MMO....

At the time that I write this, the game is still in an Alpha release.  However, as it stands today, LiF is possibly one of the best games that I have played.   I have played over 30 hours of this game and still cannot equip armour or weapons of any sort (my skill is not high enough).  Many of you are probably wondering how this is a good thing.  It means that the game is rich in detail.  You cannot start off the game and go out lopping off heads; it doesn’t work that way.  Rather, when you first start, you try to get enough to eat, scrabble together enough resources to craft simple tools, and then slowly (very slowly) you start to expand your universe.  I have never played a game that has such depth in the crafting or skill trees.  Sure, there is some grinding that you have to endure, but it is very satisfying once you have completed it and move up higher in the ranks.\n\nLiF is one of the best games I have ever played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asukalian/recommended/290080/","asukalian","Pembokat X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asukalian/","159 products in account","So I bought this game on a whim because a friend of mine ask me to buy it too, and I did, and I did not regret.\n\nBeforehand, I read all the review that is people deemed most helpful, saw that it got a lot of bugs here and there, unplayable graphics, etc. And you know what? The first time I ran it on my laptop, it got shutdown my laptop right away when I'm loading the world from some server. Disappointed? Very. I could run Fallout 4 on my laptop albeit getting 20-28 fps so I wonder why can't I run this game? Simple, the optimization at release is quite poor. So I did what a someone with a brain will do, play it on my PC. And thankfully, it run greatly.\n\nNo gamebreaking graphic bug encountered, which seems to be the main complain of most reviews here, no crash at all from all of my time playing this game, and I can play this game flawlessly albeit it does hit 22 fps in dense forest.\n\nSo we have that out of the way, now what will you expect by buying this game? Firstly, one thing that you can expect is poor optimization, yes I admit the graphic is quite heavy even for my spec which could run witcher 60 fps with high 1080p setting, and fallout 4 flawlessly too. But it's understandable since almost everything can be interacted with, so the game is heavy because of that. And no, if you compare it to fallout 4, that game is still light in building things since you didn't interact with most of the game, just place things on the ground, while in LiFYO, YOU CAN TERRAFORM THE TERRAIN, my suspicion is that the game is heavy because of this, but let's leave it at that. So, heed that recommended spec before you buy it, does your computer spec meet or above the requirement? If yes, you don't have to worry a thing (possibly), if no, buy it at your own risk. Luckily though, the dev is quite fast on implementing fast hotfixes.\n\nSecondly, this is not a simple survival building crafting game, where all you need to do is know the recipe, have the material and then voila, it appears. Nope, you need to LEARN HOW TO DO IT FIRST. It got a complex skill tree where there're a few skill you need to learn first before you get to the skill you needed. Tedious? Very. Boring? Not so. Which is why having a group or making friends in-game is very valuable. You don't need to be a jack of all trades, you just need to focus on what you want to be, and ask for help for something that is outside your capability. You could learn how to do it, but it will take a lot of time, and don't forget about that skill you want too, it takes time too.\n\nWiki and youtube is your friend, seriously. They might be outdated but they are still relevant as much since it's still the same. The only problem I had with the wiki is, it's not very complete as I checked it a few days ago, some detailed bits are missing but the general explanation should suffice, if not, check the youtube, there's a lot of let's play and tutorial for life is feudal.\n\nThird, The UI in this game is simple enough. There's status bar, hotkey bar, general info, chat panel, etc. You can customize their position too with F10. Also the cursor and the movement mode can be switched with tab. Like the name imply, cursor mode is used to navigate to panels, while movement mode is used for camera while moving and interacting with the world. The interaction follows Ultima/Wurm online. Whereas right click to something brings up the context menu, and it doesn't take too long to familiarize with this system. Right click on the ground and it shows a square tile which show how big the area will be affected by terraforming or what we can do with that area. It's not everything has their keybinds, but each things have their context menu, and you can set the default action to do something to the left click, so all you need to do is point something and then left click.\n\nLastly, this game emphasis on player to player interaction, so roleplaying is what it is in this game. You want to roleplay a blacksmith? Go ahead, level up your blacksmith skill, then advertise your service to some guilds or tribes you found. If you're lucky, they'll accept you as their own or you get tricked or worse you could be killed right away, the choices is theirs to make.  I warn you there's no human NPC in this game, only animals and such, so there will be a lot of human interaction.\n\ntl;dr\ngreat game, very VERY time consuming, you have been warned,\nnot for someone who wants a quick/easy/simple/straight jump to the action-ish game,\nneeds time to learn the mechanic and enjoys the game,\nif you're familiar with ultima online/wurm online or the like of it, you'll feel very nostalgic,\nlots and lots of player to player interaction,\nheed the recommended spec,\nno gamebreaking bug which I encountered so far,\n\nbuy it if you like it and it's at your own risks","November 26, 2015","true","17.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Even in its alpha stage it has a load of content, and runs fairly well. That's saying something for me having an old laptop for a rig. The building is complex, you can sculpt every inch of the terrain, and there's more on the horizon. This version, "LiF: Your Own," is the small-scale version of the planned MMO.

With that said, it's in a pretty advanced state and a lot of fun already. But here are a few key things to keep in mind:\n\n- Some things are not yet implemented. Actually a lot of things, but there is still a ton to do in the game.\n\n- This is not a quick action crafting/building game like Minecraft.  It takes hours (real time) to build a small mine looking for metal ores.  As you mine out a tunnel, you collect the rocks, you have to take those rocks and dump them somewhere or craft them into shaped stones (which are just as heavy as the rocks) so you must store them somewhere, then you can go back to mining.  It's a slow process...not for those who lack patience. For me it is relaxing, but your results may vary.\n\n- In fact getting your skills up to the point where you can even mine takes a long time.  On the default settings, it takes hours of using your skills to raise them to the point where you learn new things.  The settings are customizable so each server can adjust them to speed things (even to the point of the rediculous).\n\n- Single Player: There is essentially no single player (at least not in the normal PvE sense).  You can start a local server, make it private and no one else can join, then experiment all you want, but it will be a big lonely world.  I've split my time between experimenting on a solo local server and playing public servers.  Both are fun for me...\n\n- Community: The server you join will make all the difference in terms of your enjoyment.  I've been servers where I was welcomed into a community, given a house, invited in to start working on my skills to be a productive member of that village.  And I've been on servers where people have been complete jerks.  There are hundreds of servers, find one that suits you.\n\nTL;DR: If you're patient and looking for a slow paced, realistic game that is still in development, then this may be your game.  If you're looking for something with wall-to-wall action, keep looking, this ain't it.","October 2, 2014","true","61.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The social aspect of this game is what makes the grind feel worthwile.\n\nThe grind can be partially mitigated by server customization as well. Servers with XP settings between 25-100x the default are common. The learning curve is a bit steep, and crafting can be complex.\n\nThis game has a significant PvP component, and allows players to beseige each others lands. This means potentially looting and burning weeks of work in one day, but creates real risk, and winning a battle feels significant.\nThe times and dates for this can be customized, and PvE servers exist as well for the feint of heart.\n\n\nIn all likelyhood you will either love this game or uninstall it in under 2 hours.\nMost of this depends on your choice to play alone or with others.\n","April 17","true","96.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Oh hellah yes\n\nAll I am trying to say is that it might be a good game one day and is fun in the short-term but until the developers actually buckle down on it and start having more and better updates and add some MAJOR patches to this thing and desperately needed content this wont be much more than just another regret.\n\nSimply put, dont bother logging hours in this game until it gets alot further along in development and actually gets polished out alot more to the point where it is playable beyond something of a trolls breeding ground.\n\nGuess it is true what they all say, Life is Feudal","February 17","false","173.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I would recommend this game to help support the developers as I really like the game and it looks as though is has a bright future with a lot of playablility, especially when enjoyed with a group of friends.\n\n\nA few people have asked for my opinions on this game, so here they are.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The visuals of the game are really nice. The whole thing looks atmospheric, deep forests, rich villages and nice vistas give the player a nice experience from just walking around. 8/10\n\n2. The Ideas that the game portrays are very good. There's a very in-depth crafting system and a good building placement system which have little floors but there could be a bit more done to liven them up a bit. 7/10\n\n3. The general gameplay is very nice. Being able to enjoy it with your friends is great and the contact currently in the game is brilliant! There's a lot of fun to be had here!\n\n\nThe bad:\n1. Performance. I run this game with a 3.4GHz i5 processor and a GTX780 NVIDIA graphics card. If I bump the settings up a bit from the defaults, maybe I increase the tree/terrain detail a bit, my FPS drops a large amount, heading down towards 20FPS. But the game is ENTIRELY playable on the default settings and still looks really good, I'm just not sure how it will run on lower processors/cards.\n\n2. Terrain interaction. The way that you interact with terrain/rocks/trees in this game is very bulky. You look at a tree/terrain segment and are faced with about a dozen options, which for a new player is quite overwhelming. Everything is based on: "Look down at terrain" -> "Click" -> "Select option" -> "Animation plays" -> "You get things". There is currently no real player interaction with the environment around you.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. The UI. Some elements of the UI, mainly linked with the terrain interaction above don't look or feel very nice. But this is an Alpha and that can change VERY easily.\n\n\nI will certainly be playing more of this game with a few friends of mine. If you think this game has a bright future like I do then grab a copy, test the bejeebus out of it and send those bug reports flying in!","September 27, 2014","true","1.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Making good friends and building a community that is devoted to the creation and development of this game. If your looking for a finnished product, then you need to learn what the word ALPHA means in game development terms. I say this cause all these negative reviews do not do this game justice.

The game does what it states to do. When I purchased I knew it was a testing platform for the MMO. There have been reasonably regular updates. I run a server and it is now extremely stable. The game, whilst not fully implemented, has enormous potential for an MMO as it has a depth to it that you don't often see in games. If you haven't played it for a while I would suggest giving it another go now that there have been some significant fixes.

So I would just like to remind those reading, that this game is still in very early access. With the engine the game uses, it's advancements, and everything the devs are trying to do, it will take time for full release, possibly even a year or 2. With that in mind, don't judge this game based on everything currently in it, things can and will change.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let me start by saying yes, this game is a grind (as of now). Why? Because this game was built for realism. Rome wasn't built in a day, nor will you build your small shack in one. This game is realistic in almost every aspect, between it's physics based combat system which doesn't require you to aim at someone, to its resource gathering, and construction system. Even its mining system requires you to use supports otherwise you risk a cave in. And while it may be a graphics hog, that's because it's still not very optimized, but as I have said it's only an alpha. However, you can't deny that the game looks really good. Can you guys imagine on the full release, with around 1000 people on one world, what the game will look like in a month? Think about it, you start in an area with nothing but trees and such, along with 999 other people. One month later, you have huge medieval cities with giant walls, lined with trebuchets and ballistas. Huge wars going on between player factions. We can literally recreate historical events in this game with how well it's been designed and planned.\n\nSo, if you're still reading, then you know this game is a very realistic game. So please, don't judge this game just because it's realistic. Judge it for it's aspects, judge it for it's gameplay. If you don't like realism, don't judge it at all. Besides, if you don't like realism, why would you be playing a game like this? What it all boils down to is if you like realism like I do, and billions of others do as well, then this game may just be for you. However that depends on what degree of realism you like. If you don't like the grind (which may or may not be fixed later on and shortened) then you may not like this.\n\nSo TL;DR, if you like realism, but don't like a grind, this isn't for you. If you like realism, it might be for you. This game is highly based on realism, so if you don't like realism at all, why are you here? It's still alpha, so don't judge based on how the game works now, base your reviews and judgements off of the actual gameplay.","December 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

If your having thoughts or feelings about this we strongly recommend speaking to someone you trust about these thoughts or feelings.\n\nThat sounds good. However, what really matters in this kind of game is resources and territory.\n\nYou want to have a real player driven world, with incentives both to conquer and to defend, giving value to virtual stuff and, eventually, making gameplay emerge ? Then you have to have a simulation of RL economics and resource management.\n\nA river, a strategic point, a source of easy income, etc… should be things to fight for, and not giving access to everything to everyone is what creates the need for player interaction, be it conquest, trading, theft, agreements…\n\nMost sandbox RPGs failed because they tried to focus on other aspects of gameplay before laying this groundwork, ultimately creating a giant with clay feet which would clumber as soon as the hype faded, or as soon as something came unbalancing the fragile balance of the more refined gameplay systems.\n\nOn the other hand, take the example of a successful sandboxe like EvE : it survived through to good and the bad versions, through the hard drive erasing patches, through the Goons (mad props), through the watergate-like revelations, etc… because everytime remained the incentive to play, to fight, to interact.\nIf you take player interaction from EvE, it’s a very boring game. And if you erase resource scarcity and territorial value, there’s no player interaction to that game.","July 16, 2015","true","71.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","12","21","9","9"

And I didnt like building - as u can build only buildings which is provided in menu - what mean u cant make ur own house design (like it is for example in 7 Days to die) . Of course this two games is not comparable as 7 Days to die is like kid game if compare with this - as you need learn skills to do simple things like cutting trees etc . Getting resources is long job - to build simple shack will take some while... My opinion - game is in wright direction but at the moment it is too early and not everyone will like this stile.

You can also chop n plant trees, regrow the land with crops n ave animal farms!\n\nMoving on from that the combat system has combo moves!!! providing which way your mouse is when u swing you can perform uppercuts, side punches n gut punches etc. With weapons you have the chance to do combo moves for example: Swing from Left, Right n finish with a hit to the head.\n\nSkill system has tons of options "focusing on professions" your able to select any/all the rolls in the game ranging from being a Blacksmith to Alchemist and all inbetween.

So many that I hesitate to buy them when they come out. Nether was a terrible mistake, and I paid 40 for it as well. I was telling my friend about it and he bought it for me. Bad ♥♥♥. I logged on and it was hard getting in the server, but what drew me right away was the music, very Celtic like, I like that a lot. So learning how to craft is hard, and trying to figure out the mechanics of the game was hard. But once I learned how to play, I was immediately hooked. This game is AWESOME. There is no zone in and get shot like in games like Rust, where the call of duty crowd come in and make it a shoot on sight game. I had people helping me, working together, making new friends right away. Because the crafting isn't "instant" like in a lot of these crafting games. You have to put work in. When I leveled my ground and built my first shack...it is amazing. There is so much more you can accomplish. I'm still living in the stone age right now, moving toward getting iron. This is worth every cent you pay. If you like crafting, open world sandbox, making new friends....and eventually enemies that have what you want you will love this game. Patience though is needed, I don't feel like this is a "casual game". You have to dedicate some time to build up.

It's up to you, maybe you will enjoy it.\n\nDid you play Mortal Online, The Forest, Rust? This is the same kind of product. Great on paper, not so great in reality. It never will be so polished like it should be. From what I did see right now, you can't even delete unused ingame items (thats very stupid). Also the cells system which is used for the land (you terafforming single cells) doesn't seems  like good sollution. It's not working on 100% and that cube mining holes looks really ugly.\n\nThere is single map for this first small realease and even this one single small map has lot of holes in textures. Realy its one small map, can't they put some love into it and give us world without possiblity to see beneath textures?? Shame on you devs! I did see ther only two animals, wolf and some deer and they alwasy stay on one place, side by side like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thas all what they do. Yeah, maybe wolf will attack if you want kiss his beloved deer, I did't try, because I saw video where two guys vere killing one deer like 30 mins. There are spots where the same sounds of wildernes are repeated every one second. So its for example never ending loop of eagle scream. It will force you to move from your already claimed property to somewhere else.\n\nIf those guys have technical skills like for example Trion or Funcom, that woudl be awesome, but what I did see right now, it's just another cheap looking, like hell bugging, forever in beta never really polished game. But part of pvp crowd would be satisfied for sure.\n\nAnd about "early access and beta" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. In todays language, that means realeased, money making game. So spare it for someone who cares.. When MO was in beta, people were excited like hell, is the same with this game. But I think this will do probably better then Mortal Online, it looks little bit better.\n\nI don't want refund, it was my decision to buy, am not in hate. I will check the huge map when they will release it. But am realy sad that it is always like this :( I would  say, that all these junior developers just use us like university of game making. They probably will one day join some real company and would do some reall games.","October 10, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also the map is the perfect size for early access and for only 64 players. with 64 players you will easily find a village and maybe join or steal from them. Players can almost be found everywhere, and the community that play this online are great people. I have yet to run into someone who kills for fun.

As I turned around a man was standing before me holding an axe. I backed off him and he spoke to me, he asked me to leave his camp as he did not trust strangers near his territory. I kindly agreed to give him distance and moved about my way.\n\nNot long after I met up with two other strangers who were looking for a place to settle. They were kind and friendly and we scoured the land for the perfect place to build our home. Once we found our ideal location we shaped the earth for hours, sowed the lands with crops and build our homes togeather. Three people, with no history of knowing each other dividing the labor of the land equally. It was a beautiful and magical friendship that was formed.\n\nAs night approached we built a campfire and lit it. We all stood around in envy of the beautiful flames and as we stared at eachother in awe of our accomplishments thats when the server crashed and kicked all of us off the game. I was never able to find these players again and honestly I am really dissapointed to lose such great companions.\n\nDo I think this game is worth $40? Yes, as long as you realize that this game is VERY buggy. The crashes happen often and it takes forever to load. I also found that pushing buttons in certain combinations will result in a crash.\n\nDespite all this, this game has amazing potential. It nothing like DayZ where you will get PK on sight. While I ran into a few sticky situations with other playesr I managed to fend them off or successful run away from my attackers. I found that a majority of players are willing to work with you rather than just kill you for all of your loot.\n\nI really cant wait until this game works out its glitches. Because when it finially does, I feel that it would be the perfect middle age simulator for anyone to enjoy.","September 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because this is an Alpha game. VERY EARLY. As of now, servers are a mess, putting up by yourself,*Unless you're a computer wiz* But that is no real problem, because there are plenty of servers open. If you're wondering, "Is this worth my money right now?" Then, I have to say yes, and no. No, because it's so new, and so buggy, you may get sick of it, and stop playing. Yes, because if you play now, and just roll with the bugs, you can learn the basics. It's already a beautiful game, with potential I've not seen is years. The crafting, is very, very, VERY in depth. You can create almost everything now. And it's in super early alpha. What else can, and will they add? Only they know. As of now, it may not be worth the price, but when this game is done, and running, it will rule all stores, for a long time. When this game is finally, where it ought be, I can place a very safe bet, that I'd GLADLY pay OVER 60 dollars, to play it. Sure, it's not perfect now, but once it's updated, and polished up.... Get ready for a real game.\n\nSide note, funniest thing that's happened to me. Combat is so silly right now I had a 20 minute long knife fight, that I barely won.

It to me right now is a building/farming/crafting sandbox type of game which I've never played which is why I find it so appealing. Lots to do, great to meet people and form a community, and there's always that looming PvP threat on servers to keep you from becoming complacent.

It's still in alpha [as of this writing] so there are a few things to keep in mind:  1) A number of things don't make sense on the skill tree (which isn't fully implemented yet) and additional tweaking is needed.  2) It hasn't been optimized for typical consumer PCs.  3) It also has the occasional freeze or crash to desktop.\n\nThankfully, alpha-isms aside, you can adjust a number of the world settings on the private server to let things progress at a rate suitable to your play style.  You'll probably need to fiddle with these to find conditions you like.  If you enjoy hard core PVP and are looking for more realism, you should certainly consider adding this game to your watch list.  If, however, you find PVP about as appealing as finger-painting with cat poop, fear not!  LiF:YO lets you enjoy the crafting and trade aspects on your own server with only the people you know.  That's not to say they won't betray you at some point, but you can ban them from the server if you want to go that far.\n\nOn a final note, I am hopeful that support and development for LiF:YO will continue after the MMO version is released since the MMO does not interest me in the least.","September 29, 2014","true","84.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

An open world sandbox MMORPG set in a a medeival setting. Then I noticed the steep price of £25 (or your regional equivalent). However after seeing the trailer and some streams of the game in action I was convinced.\n\nFor an alpha it runs quite well with the expected bug here and there but hey, its an alpha. Most the the games terraforming and building mechanics are pretty much to point but could do with some polishing. With frequent updates and bug fixes it gives me a good reason to trust the devs behind this game.\n\nAfter playing for hours alone I realised I needed to either find some friends to join me on my adventure though the world and increase chances of survival. Or find a friendly group of players who will accept me into their community. (Dont expect everyone to be friendly, this is the medeival ages). As I mentioned after hours of play with friends we finally have a little lake side village which is progressing nicely. A farm, some houses and soon to be a forge.\n\nWe hope to gain some weapons soon and either :\n\nTAX THE PEASANTS (other players)\nor\nHunt down criminals (Bad rep players)\n\nHowever.\nThe combat for ranged weapons is very clunky and can be unreliable.

The idea of having a town blacksmith that you need to go to for swords and armor, a logger to cut your trees, etc. is a lot of fun and not something a lot of games like to encourage. You're not a god, you can't do everything on your own.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Combat is promising and deep but not very satisfying at the moment.\n- Long server load times (seriously, be patient).\n- The engine needs optimization. This isn't up to the Life is Feudal dev team but it does affect their game.\n- Occasional bugs and some people experience frequent crashing.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIf the dev team can continue building on what they have without falling into the typical early access pitfalls then this game will be the next big thing. All it will need is a promotion from a YouTuber to blow up.\n","October 4, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can search the floor for food and eat what you can find but if you dont want to do that you can go the farming root and make carrots onions wheat and more.I have made my character more of a miner so i have not did much in farming.but the small part i took in was very easiy to understand. Construction is very easy to do collet a certain amount of items and build with the tools you need.I will state that this game if played with the standerd settings will take you around 5-6 hours just to build your first house.When you figure things out the game is much simpler and faster.I could go on for hours about this game but what i will leave here is my final score.\n\nI give this game a  8.5/10  -ArranGaming\n\n","October 4, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a great sandbox/terraform game. It has an awesome military mix in with it.\n\nPros-You can make the game more difficult or easier based on the skill leveling multiplier. You can also change how fast things grow, smelt etc. The terrain when terraforming has a great reaction based on a more real life scale. The weapons and armors are a harder thing to make so it takes a lot of time for a group of people to turn in to pvp maniacs.\n\nCons- The BIGGEST con right now is the launcher. It needs a lot of work. If I leave a server or want to change characters I actually consider not playing, because the launcher is incredibly slow and there are times it doesn't want to cooperate at all. I also have had a hard time hosting a server. There are some small bugs related to it being a new game, i.e. some terrain issues where you can see through the map or trees look like they hover.\n\nConclusion- I would give this game in total a 6.8/10. For a BRAND new game I would give it a 8.8/10. The game has GREAT potential! I would highly recommend giving it a try, right now I think its worth the $40 and with the reaction we have seen fromt he developers I think in a couple months it would be worth more!","September 24, 2014","true","85.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A lot of skills/build trees remain broken at the moment by some odd choices in the order things were implemented, but if you're willing to have a generally fun (if simple) experience of "Rust with Swords", this is a decent buy.\n\nLiF has an incredible amount of promise. For an early alpha build, I'd call the game nearly feature-complete. A great deal of the crafting is already in the game and ready to go. There's no lack of things to do right now, and the steady progression from shoeless caveman to hardscrabble dirt farmer comes at an engaging pace.\n\nThe main problem (and the reason I am not recommending it) is that while they have done a lot of work on the crafting system and modelling, even the most basic functionality of the game itself is missing. It's highly unstable, the game crashes frequently, and getting the game to load at all can be a challenge. At the moment, there are a number of quality of life features missing that make the game seem to actively resist being played. You cannot disconnect from servers, you must exit the game entirely to connect to another one, and the favorites/history tab does not work, meaning you can lose hours of work if you get disconnected (something that happens quite often) and are unable to find your server again.\n\nIt's interesting to see an early access title have the opposite problem that most have (big on features, low on basic functions), but I really can't recommend it at the moment. Future builds may improve stability and quality of life, but right now it's simply not worth the 40 dollars.","October 1, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The trick is finding another person to help you out and set up a decent area to manufacture goods and such to trade/use with/on other players. the terraforming is amazing because when you drop the rock or iron it shows immediately on the ground and changes the actual texture. if you dig in that area again, you get some of what you dropped back, the terraforming takes a loooong time to flatten areas but its worth it once you get set up.

After purchase you find the graphic quality and overall smoothness is horrible, and it takes a huge toll on your computers performance even at low graphic settings..., and the overall direction of going about game life is confusing and tedious.  At the games current state, it is almost pointless to play due to servers going up and down on a constant basis, so you lose all of your production on a daily basis and have to start over.  For the hefty price tag, and mis-leading state of the game, I currently cannot recommend this game to my fellow steam-mates.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter a few months I decided to give Life is Feudal a try again to see if any improvments have been made.  And to my surprise this was in fact the case.  The game runs very smooth now even with the graphics quality turned up to max.  I have enjoyed playing the last few days and frankly have become somewhat addicted to its game play.  I think it would do some good if they implimented a better beginers tutorial though, as it get can confusing on how and what to start doing, but with thier online wiki things are manage-able and can be figured out.

I personally love the sandbox high-realism gameplay and the slow pacing of everything makes the game a real marathon to achieve what you want, but it's extremely fun to see all the progress you've made as you build your first shack and then an actual home and tools.\n\nThis game, like most in this style, really depends on outside sources to learn the mechanics.

This is a role playing paradise. I've sunken thirty hours into this game and I already have the reputation of Okravaaz Draaf the revolutionist. Wow... Off to the review :D!\n====================================================================================\nGameplay: The gameplay is not molded by the developers but rather the community. My most memorable moments were of course not staring at a green bar, but they were about meeting new people and speaking to old friends. I even started a revolution against the almighty leader of the server. That was fun. (4/4)\nGraphics: The game doesn't look very pleasing, but it isn't terrible either. (2/4)\nPreformance: The game preforms almost horrible. I guess it is playable, but it certaintly isn't pleasing on the eyes. (1/4)\nRealism: The description of this game basicaly sums it up. The most god damn realistic mmo I have ever seen. While its graphics may not be good and it may not preform great, the game is so realistic I think I've been blinded. The game basicaly reflects on what it would ACTUALY be like in the wilderness. I would say you would need the help of five or ten people just to get new CLOTHING. (4/4)\nThis game scored a total of 55%. I know you think that's a terrible score, because it is, but the only real downsides to this are its graphics and preformance. So as long as you have relatively strong eyes and a decent computer, you should be able to enjoy this game.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTES\n*The game is relatively slow moving, and you're going to want a day or two of free time to actualy enjoy the game.\n-SharkTurd, C.E.O.

The combat seems alot like Mortal Online except the hit detection and character movement is much better. It feels like a polished version of MO in alot of ways though the game is in its early alpha. With an inventory system like Darkfall, some of the stuff I've read makes it sound like seiges will be an event similiar to Darkfall (This guess comes from reading the skills under Piety).\n\nWould I recommend buying this game?

At this time the game suffers from many issues.\n\nThe first and foremost is the bugs. Mines cause lag, every in game morning the game lags, crashes are constant during fights, and in all progression can be a tad weird.\n\nAnother thing to note is the combat plays like a buggy mount and blade. Blocking doesnt stop an attack only mitigates it, and that only works a part of the time itself. Shields are difficult to use and most of their features are planned or promised. Armors seem useless with weapons like the warsythe that can kill you in one hit through armor.\n\nIf you have the excess money I guess you could buy this game but I would suggest waiting for more features to be implemented and bugs to be worked out.

It's up to you, maybe you will enjoy it.\n\nDid you play Mortal Online, The Forest, Rust? This is the same kind of product. Great on paper, not so great in reality. It never will be so polished like it should be. From what I did see right now, you can't even delete unused ingame items (thats very stupid). Also the cells system which is used for the land (you terafforming single cells) doesn't seems  like good sollution. It's not working on 100% and that cube mining holes looks really ugly.\n\nThere is single map for this first small realease and even this one single small map has lot of holes in textures. Realy its one small map, can't they put some love into it and give us world without possiblity to see beneath textures?? Shame on you devs! I did see ther only two animals, wolf and some deer and they alwasy stay on one place, side by side like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thas all what they do. Yeah, maybe wolf will attack if you want kiss his beloved deer, I did't try, because I saw video where two guys vere killing one deer like 30 mins. There are spots where the same sounds of wildernes are repeated every one second. So its for example never ending loop of eagle scream. It will force you to move from your already claimed property to somewhere else.\n\nIf those guys have technical skills like for example Trion or Funcom, that woudl be awesome, but what I did see right now, it's just another cheap looking, like hell bugging, forever in beta never really polished game. But part of pvp crowd would be satisfied for sure.\n\nAnd about "early access and beta" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. In todays language, that means realeased, money making game. So spare it for someone who cares.. When MO was in beta, people were excited like hell, is the same with this game. But I think this will do probably better then Mortal Online, it looks little bit better.\n\nI don't want refund, it was my decision to buy, am not in hate. I will check the huge map when they will release it. But am realy sad that it is always like this :( I would  say, that all these junior developers just use us like university of game making.

So many that I hesitate to buy them when they come out. Nether was a terrible mistake, and I paid 40 for it as well. I was telling my friend about it and he bought it for me. Bad ♥♥♥. I logged on and it was hard getting in the server, but what drew me right away was the music, very Celtic like, I like that a lot. So learning how to craft is hard, and trying to figure out the mechanics of the game was hard. But once I learned how to play, I was immediately hooked. This game is AWESOME. There is no zone in and get shot like in games like Rust, where the call of duty crowd come in and make it a shoot on sight game. I had people helping me, working together, making new friends right away. Because the crafting isn't "instant" like in a lot of these crafting games. You have to put work in. When I leveled my ground and built my first shack...it is amazing. There is so much more you can accomplish. I'm still living in the stone age right now, moving toward getting iron. This is worth every cent you pay. If you like crafting, open world sandbox, making new friends....and eventually enemies that have what you want you will love this game.

I had reservations about buying it at first, given it was A: Early access, B: Several concerning reviews about how dry and monotonous it was and C: Sporadic updates in the news section (though Elite Dangerous might be spoiling me in that regard).\n\nBut I genuinely have been enjoying myself. It is a very complex game, requiring a lot of patience and a willingness to ask questions and learn. It's not something you just jump into to waste an afternoon like WoW, CoD, or even Minecraft might be. Additionally, when you start playing, look for a server that has recently gone through a wipe, or look for a group of players that are just starting their base. Do not try this game solo when you start out, find a group.\n\nLet me say that again, do not play this game solo. No. Don't.\n\n"But Valo, I prefer to play alone." If that's the case, don't buy this game. Don't even bother, because this is a game for groups. After you get used to the game you can certainly make a living out in the wild on your own, but being ready and willing to work for or trade with larger groups for needed supplies is a must.\n\nSo, the game is awesome, very intricate, and I am enjoying myself immensely. I highly recommend it for the "right sort of player." However, be aware that playing this game is largely a team effort, even a community effort. Be prepared to play ball with other people (or you can be a bandit and hurl the ball in their face and make off with their stuff). As an introvert, I understand this is hard sometimes (all the time), but it's worth it, it really is.","February 27, 2015","true","174.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, this one is a bit conditional, i can't just say "Yes or No."\n\nOk, do you like rust style gameplay?\nDo you like combat similar-ish to Chivalry/Mount&Blade?\nDo you have a lot of free time?\nDo you have at LEAST two other people to play with, or are you willing to join a random group on a server? (3 other people or more recommended)\n\nIf you answered YES to at elast three out of the four questions, you'll love it. Just like I did. Sadly my group got bored and i sort of ell off. You CAN NOT solo this game. You can not be a jack of all trades. Think of it as medieval rust, but much more serious feeling; more realistic, more time consuming, etc. Again, in rust you find a blueprint, and you can build it. In LiF, you have all the blueprints, but you need the skills to use them.\n\nYou chop trees, you become a better lumber jack. You cut wood, you become a better carpenter. You mold stone, you become a better mason. You CAN NOT be a jack of all trades. The more you specialize, the better, but you have to fill all roles to prosper. So, the beauty of other players comes in. If you have a person for each role, you can all fully excel - OR you can spread yourselves among two or three trades, lowering your specialization and skill in each, but making up for the lack of people. In other words, the main limiting factor is the number of people you need. if a few people get bored, its over for all of you unless you can replace them.\n\nSo, if you can get a group of people you trust to commit, or if you can join a server and are willing to ask in chat to join someone long term (wouldnt recommend, the early game was my favorite, watching your mud huts evolve to cabins, to outposts, to pallisades, to castles is an amazing thing and joining late game when they're fully militarized robs you of that joy... however it is useful for learning the ropes.)\n\nBut as much as the intensive human cost is a con, it is also a pro for the game. Playing with friends in it is amazing, as you're all working together for a common long term goal. the interactions are great, and there's a nice social aspect.\n\nSpeaking of such, i would love to get back into the game.

Life is Feudal is a really wonderful game.\n\nIt is not an EASY game by any means. I do not reccomend playing it alone. Get four or five good friends to play with you or join a server. Life is Feudal is a cooperative game. You can scrape by on your own, sure, but you won't advance past the Stone Age. If you think you can log on, build a castle in two hours, and log off, you've got another thing coming. LiF doesn't hand you goodies on a silver platter.\n\nIf you've got a hardworking team of people, though, you can accomplish some really awesome stuff. For example: my boyfriend and I joined a server and started working toward building a house of our own. We felt insanely accomplished when we managed to build two hovels and kill a stag. It was an enormous rush! LiF makes you work for every single thing you get. As a result, the rewards matter a lot more. We eventually joined up with a bigger town and became Master Armorsmiths. It was amazing to see our hard work pay off. It gave me a sense of accomplishment unlike any other game I've played.\n\nLiF is hard and can be pretty punishing. But the difficulty makes your rewards that much more awesome.

So, this one is a bit conditional, i can't just say "Yes or No."\n\nOk, do you like rust style gameplay?\nDo you like combat similar-ish to Chivalry/Mount&Blade?\nDo you have a lot of free time?\nDo you have at LEAST two other people to play with, or are you willing to join a random group on a server? (3 other people or more recommended)\n\nIf you answered YES to at elast three out of the four questions, you'll love it. Just like I did. Sadly my group got bored and i sort of ell off. You CAN NOT solo this game. You can not be a jack of all trades. Think of it as medieval rust, but much more serious feeling; more realistic, more time consuming, etc. Again, in rust you find a blueprint, and you can build it. In LiF, you have all the blueprints, but you need the skills to use them.\n\nYou chop trees, you become a better lumber jack. You cut wood, you become a better carpenter. You mold stone, you become a better mason. You CAN NOT be a jack of all trades. The more you specialize, the better, but you have to fill all roles to prosper. So, the beauty of other players comes in. If you have a person for each role, you can all fully excel - OR you can spread yourselves among two or three trades, lowering your specialization and skill in each, but making up for the lack of people. In other words, the main limiting factor is the number of people you need. if a few people get bored, its over for all of you unless you can replace them.\n\nSo, if you can get a group of people you trust to commit, or if you can join a server and are willing to ask in chat to join someone long term (wouldnt recommend, the early game was my favorite, watching your mud huts evolve to cabins, to outposts, to pallisades, to castles is an amazing thing and joining late game when they're fully militarized robs you of that joy... however it is useful for learning the ropes.)\n\nBut as much as the intensive human cost is a con, it is also a pro for the game. Playing with friends in it is amazing, as you're all working together for a common long term goal. the interactions are great, and there's a nice social aspect.\n\nSpeaking of such, i would love to get back into the game. If a group of people needs an extra sword at your side, feel free to message me, be you a group of friends jsut getting the game, or just people that need to replace someone or expand.","January 17","true","37.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At the time, I had serious trouble figuring out the interface, how to build anything more than a campfire, let alone how to find food. I refrained from writing a bad review, because it was still in heavy development, and I really wanted to see where the game would go.\n\nOver a year later, with the help of some \"let’s play\" starter videos, I got back into LiF. I gotta say, they have come very far in a year! While the interface was still tricky to get accustomed to, I quickly got over it and began to build my first items and structures. While grinding away on an official server is very tedious, starting a local game with max advancement settings can really help a novice player get into the game.\n\nWith all the improvements, I can really make a serious recommendation for this game. It has a lot to offer, especially if you have some friends that you can play with. With a private server geared towards PVE, you have a good chance to get started towards joining a public server for some good, long-term PVP or clan vs clan action. (plus, the high potential for some Monty Python jokes)\n\nThere are still some cons about the game, which include lots of grinding on some servers, and some features are till \"incomplete\". The game is technically still in development, and with the future \"MMO\" game being developed on the same engine/base-game, lots of features are still being added and completed.\n\nThere is a bright future for this game, and it\'s in a \"play ready\" state.

If you want to know more then please read the full review below.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nI was really on the fence about buying this game and have had it sitting in my "wish list" on Steam for over a month now.  Unable to bare it any longer I did some searching and found a bundle site that had this game available for a little over half price, so I picked it up.  I'm not going to post a link to that bundle, as it's expired, so just keep your eyes open if you're in the same boat as I was.  Now, on to my first impressions...\n\nI had a pretty rough time getting started with Life is Feudal, and when I say that I'm not just talking about the lack of any real tutorial.  I mean I actually had to try 5 times to get a game started.  I believe it has to do with the fact that when you play single player you're not actually playing single player.  You're starting up a local multiplayer server and blocking everyone else from joining it.  That, to me, is a serious waste of resources in a game that's already a huge resource hog.  When you run single player it should just run the game, not have to start up it's own private multiplayer server.  It's signs of lazy development, and it didn't stop there.\n\nOnce I was in the game I literally had no clue what I was doing.  Pressing F1 got me some basic knowledge of the keys to use but everything else was as confusing as hell.  5 minute tutorial, or tooltip popups when you first open a window, would have been a godsend but sadly the developers didn't bother to program that into the game.  Lazy!\n\nThe music in the game was absolutely wonderful, how be it a little repetative after a few hours of playing.  There didn't seem to be enough musical tracks to keep you from noticing the eventual loop.  After a while I simply muted it and fired up Media player with my own music.  Not unheard of with other games, so I'll let it slide with a simple "nothing special" comment.\n\nSound on the other hand was completely rediculous.  While I enjoied the occasional sound of wind blowing through the trees, or a bird chirping in the distance, the actual action sounds were apauling.  Eating was, by far, the worse.  Sounded like they put the microphone up to a cow's mouth while it was chewing on straw.  Gathering used the same 5-second audio clip and looped it.  Normally using 1 gathering sound wouldn't be much of a problem, if it made it throught the entire gathering cycle without looping.  But no, every time you gather something it took about 12 seconds, so with a 5 second audio clip you got to hear it almost 2 and a half times.  And trust me, it's noticable.  Partly because it too is one of the most annoying sounds you could have possibly used for gathering.\n\nThe graphics in this game were kind of a mixed bag.  Up close everything was nice and crisp, looked great.  The farther things got away from you, however, the worse they looked.  There was a clear visual line of where the "detail" shut off and left you with just basic forms.  Then, to try to cover it up, it looks like the developer blurred things the farther they got from you.  It kinda looks really sloppy.  Mind you, this is still an Alpha so I'm not going to harp much more than that about it.  One graphical thing that really bothered me was the fact that when you selected to strip bark from a tree the tree had no visible appearance change.  Even when you got to a point where it said there was no more bark to strip, the tree looked the same!  After stripping 20 chunks of bark off a tree it shouldn't look the same!  Lazy!\n\nAnimations in the game weren't much better.  "Praying" was the same animation played over and over again unti the progress bar finished.  When you put on ANY equipment it looked like you were patting yourself down.  Gathering plant fiber (grass) resulted in you physically punching the ground.  Gathering rock, bark, or sticks used the same animation which was nothing more than bending down a bit and twiddling your fingers in the air.  Examining an object had virtually no animation, you just stood there while the bar filled up.  Seriously, it's lazy work AGAIN!\n\nCrafting in this game is the absolute highpoint, and why this game is getting so much attention.  Yes, you can build an entire medieval city from scratch including walls, buildings, houses, keeps, etc...  That said, don't expect to do it any time early in the game.  Unlike other crafting games, in this game you have to grind skills to unlock higher skills.  Hell, I had to click on a tree 190 times just to realize I had to punch the ground another 78 times, before I could craft a log into a nicer log.  Crafting skills take FOREVER to train, although you CAN adjust the learning speed if you like.  That was a smart move on the developers part, because after all that training (at default speeds) I have to admit I was getting REALLY bored.\n\nSpeaking of the skill trees, they're quite a mess as well.  I can understand having to practice tilling soil before being able to successfully plant crops but I'm pretty sure once you've learned how to chop down a tree you can just do it to any tree.  Not in Life is Feudal!  You start out by only being able to cut down 2 types of trees, and then you have to grind those in order to learn how to chop down another 2 types of trees.  We're not talking about crazy differences here.  I'm pretty sure if you can swing an axe skillfully at a pine tree you can swing an axe with the same skill at an oak tree.  But noooo, not in this game!\n\nOverall, yes, I am recommending this game.  Aside from it's quarks it is a fairly enjoyable crafting game.  HOWEVER, the developers are dreaming if they think this game is worth $40.  Even taking into account it's Alpha status I wouldn't value this game much over $25.  So unless you can get this game for 40% off, or as part of a really nicely priced bundle (like I did), DON'T BUY IT!  You'll regret ever spending that much money for this game.","October 19, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is a beautiful one, the graphics and the lighting do not fail to impress, which helps bring life to a vast world filled with trees, mountains, swamps, beaches and the ocean itself. Although at the time of writing the game is clearly an Early Access one with plenty of missing features, what's there is evidently plenty to hook people in.\n\nThe game gives you plenty of options on how you'd like to play it. You can set how fast or how slow your skills level up, from a glacial crawl to rocketing into masteries. You can set skill caps, either letting the player master every profession, or give them just enough to master one and dabble in one or two others. The latter adds an incredible amount of flavour, where you see farmers who are actual farmers, carpenters who are actual carpenters. They've specialized, they've mastered their trade, and although they may have the ability to help out here and there, they'll never become the town's second blacksmith. To some this may sound bad, but look at it this way: this is Life is Feudal. You're building a town, and in this town everyone, every player, has a purpose. They become gears in a grander machine, where everyone relies on everyone else.\n\nIn that kind of game, on that kind of server, you won't find that one guy that's a master blacksmith, carpenter, architect, herbalist, and so on. You won't find a massive castle built by a single person, vast and full of every imaginable thing, but equally lonely. During my play I was invited to join a town. A small one, admittedly, but immediately the community became evident and clear. You had farmers with their plots outside the walls. You had the blacksmith with his shop, a herbalist with another. I was lucky enough to be apprenticed as a carpenter, witnessing wood cutters at work, hauling timber to their newest farmhouse.\n\nThat doesn't mean it has to be though. If you're the kind of person that prefers the Minecraft approach, worry not! As I mentioned before, the skill rates are completely up to you. If you want to master the art of logging from peeling the bark off a tree, you can set those settings up and just jump in. You'll be able to master every skill and build your own little kingdom. This goes in multiplayer as well, meaning you can have a small group on a high skill rate server that'll be able to rival a low skill rate server's larger community.\n\nNothing is perfect however, and this goes doubly for early access. I don't fault the game for any of its bugs or glitches, but it helps that I honestly didn't run into many. The only thing that actually showed up was that sometimes items wouldn't load in and I had to restart the game. No crashes, no memory leaks, no massive frame drops out of nowhere. The frame rate, admittedly, was pretty awful even on the lowest settings, but that's par for the course during early development. It can only get better. Yet this doesn't leave me with a lot of complaints! The UI is a little clunky, but that tends to be cleaned up during development. Wolves are a bit deadly when you're starting off as well, making running into one early on a deadly affair -- and honestly, that's about it.\n\nThere's already a good selection of servers out there with a modest but dedicated population, too. For anyone who's been seeking a game like this, I find it easy to recommend. Just be warned; this may be a little too hardcore for a jump directly from Minecraft, at least for some players. For the rest, that's most definitely a good thing!","October 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a beautiful game, but after 9 hours I'm bored. Crafting system is in depth but the controls... THE CONTROLS! Want to build something? Don't look to anything in game to guide you through even the most simplistic of tasks. I chose the private server route as I wanted to see what the game has to offer without having to watch my back. That was fun to set up, you will need additional downloads if you run into the non responsive (private) server.\n\nI think 8 of my 9 hours I spent hacking away at trees, watching a crafting bar run it's meandering course, and alt-tabbing to try and find a user made youtube video while I ground my teeth in frustration. I wanted to do something that looks really cool in game and having no clue how to even start. I should add that I only knew something cool was there because of said walkthroughs.\n\nThe desolation was incredible as well, I felt like I should have run accross a few peasants on the road to harass, maybe a highway robber, but alas nothing was there to even make me worry about obtaining a decent weapon. I even cranked up the animal population to max and it took me a half hour (real time) to wander my lonely island till I found what appeared to be a deer and wolf grunting in the bushes doing god knows what. 4 slingshot projectiles later (after firing 20 shots at close range) I watched my preys back side dissapear into the woods, I gave chase but tripped on the wolf and was promptly devoured as I tried to switch my weapons (STUPID G DAM ANIMATION) because the sling takes one weapon slot and the shots sit in the other.\n\nPros: Sweet idea, excellent presentation, the game of my dreams. Controls are responsive.\n\nCons: Nothing to do, and the things you can do are too complicated and not really a big payoff after grinding for hours. Controls are confusing. The Island is disturbing and lonely in it's beauty. I'd rather be a part of a continent cut off by a mountain range, that would feel immersive.\n\nI could keep going, but this is an ALPHA build and I want to see it make it to completion.

It's a beautiful game, but after 9 hours I'm bored. Crafting system is in depth but the controls... THE CONTROLS! Want to build something? Don't look to anything in game to guide you through even the most simplistic of tasks. I chose the private server route as I wanted to see what the game has to offer without having to watch my back. That was fun to set up, you will need additional downloads if you run into the non responsive (private) server.\n\nI think 8 of my 9 hours I spent hacking away at trees, watching a crafting bar run it's meandering course, and alt-tabbing to try and find a user made youtube video while I ground my teeth in frustration. I wanted to do something that looks really cool in game and having no clue how to even start. I should add that I only knew something cool was there because of said walkthroughs.\n\nThe desolation was incredible as well, I felt like I should have run accross a few peasants on the road to harass, maybe a highway robber, but alas nothing was there to even make me worry about obtaining a decent weapon. I even cranked up the animal population to max and it took me a half hour (real time) to wander my lonely island till I found what appeared to be a deer and wolf grunting in the bushes doing god knows what. 4 slingshot projectiles later (after firing 20 shots at close range) I watched my preys back side dissapear into the woods, I gave chase but tripped on the wolf and was promptly devoured as I tried to switch my weapons (STUPID G DAM ANIMATION) because the sling takes one weapon slot and the shots sit in the other.\n\nPros: Sweet idea, excellent presentation, the game of my dreams. Controls are responsive.\n\nCons: Nothing to do, and the things you can do are too complicated and not really a big payoff after grinding for hours. Controls are confusing. The Island is disturbing and lonely in it's beauty. I'd rather be a part of a continent cut off by a mountain range, that would feel immersive.\n\nI could keep going, but this is an ALPHA build and I want to see it make it to completion. My recommendation is to support the Dev, maybe wait for it to go on sale if you can't drop the $40 (really? Why is it so much?) but I would at some point pick up this game because it looks like good things will be coming.","October 18, 2014","true","133.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waterlimon/recommended/290080/","waterlimon","waterlimon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waterlimon/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn the current state of the game, you can do some sandbox survivaley things (gather stuff, craft stuff, walk around, build stuff), however although the basics are there, the game lacks content and gets boring very quickly.\n\nWhat I mean is that:\n-The game world is uniform. Water, trees and rock at different elevations. Abandoned player villages with the same basic buildings in each. Random bags of loot of unknown origin laying all around.\n-The game world is static. It seems there IS weather and a day/night cycle of some kind, but their effects on the world are undetectable. It feels as if its a summer day 24/7. And no other kinds of events to drive the game of course.\n-The game world is too small, safe, scarcely populated and boring to make village building seem like there is a purpose. You can survive just fine without a village, so why build one? To make shinier weapons you dont need?\n\nBasically there is no incentive to do anything other than boredom. Needs more content, needs more dynamic world, needs more environmental pressure to survive. Something to force you to find or create shelter and keep advancing to stay ahead whatever threat there is.\n\nHowever, Im sure these problems will be addressed when all the basic game mechanisms are in place.\n\nThe sandbox survival crafting aspect is deep and clearly aims for realism (if we ignore alchemism...). Raw materials need to be gathered from different sources in different ways, possibly processed in certain ways and then products can be crafted out of them. Its not oversimplified but not confusing either. Craft an axe out of a stick, rock and some plantstuffs to tie them together, all easily collectable by right clicking the right things. Use axe to cut down trees and slash at people for 5 minutes without them dying and losing all their hard work no matter how hard you try.\n\nThe game seeks to simulate all aspects (resources and production, building and terraforming, fighting, nature...) in a reasonably realistic and interesting way, avoiding the use of oversimplified models for anything.\n\nThe graphics seem like they will look great with some polish (some gaps in terrain, grass isnt rendered very far which shows, buildings could be rendered further away using impostors or similar...)\n\nUI is fine, some lack of 'smoothness' with switching between free mouse and FPS mode. (since this switch needs to happen all the time for working with the menus and clicking on items). It just feels clumsy in a way.\n\nI cannot say I enjoy the game in the current state (since the lack of content and incentive to progress makes it get boring soon), but after theyve worked some more on the resource/crafting/building aspect, made the world more dangerous and overall more 'alive', it will be a great game.\n\nAn aspect I like particularly is that it seems more social than some other similar games. Success requires cooperation (building a village yourself is difficult), and PvP/dying have been made not so lethal (you are stunned before you die), unlike in other games where someone is likely die when two persons meet.\n\nI recommend the game not because it would be that fun to play in the current state for prolonged periods (if you play with friends it will probably be fun), but because it clearly has potential to become great and its halfway there already, and the devs seem like they know what theyre going for and seem to have been successful so far.\n\nPrice seems decent since the game is going forward at a steady pace so I dont see it as a 'risky investment' in any way.","September 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But those are minor in just how in depth and amazing this game is, and it's only in Early Access! Life is Feudal is a medieval sandbox game that likes to be like DayZ, but it does it so much better. Instead of mindlessly killing people (where you lose alignment and lose more skill points upon death), the game tries a more peaceful approach with the implementation of a yield command that gives all your stuff to the combatant, but you get to live on. This would be more like the Codes of Chivalry in being that you protect the honor of another knight.

Life is Short, especially in the medieval times. Also in modern times too. Currently, as I am writing this I have about 8 hours logged. About Two of those eight hours are actually playing time.\n\nRant aside, this game has super potential, and yes, I know, its in Alpha.\n\nWhat I will add to give the review some diffrence to other reviews is -\n-Mentioning that whenever you play on a diffrent server you have to restart. From scratch. (Try and stay on the same server)\n\n-There is NO offline mode (the Mines of Moria have better internet than myself) so you can play without server crashing then re-logging and losing another half hour of your life)\n\n-Primitive weapons are useless. I used my primitive axe  (Made from a snapped tree branch, some plant fiber from the ground and a piece of flint picked up from a rocky patch)  to attack a Wild Grouse, as my charecter was on the verge of starvation  (I had eaten all 5 of my free cookies, and apples only add 5 to your hunger bar, and the ground roots, once you find them, your pretty much back to the hunger you started on)  So, axe in hand, i approached from behind, axed raise expecting a kill... WHAM!... it survived. And fluttered off and nestled a few yards away. It carried on squaking. I ran up again after letting it settle in.. Whack!! It ran again. Two hits with an axe and it still lives? Hopefully theres no Dragons here. As it took 15 hits to eventually slay the mighty Grouse of Fedual times. Each hit registering 1.5 damage - 2.5 for a head shot.\nFinally i skin my pray. Collect the one feather from it. Carry it to my nearby camp fire like its some heavy tree trunk. But wait.. i cant do anything with this object. WHY??? IM STARVING HERE!!! Are my skills to low? What have I done wrong??\nSo i give up and gather more apples. Make a fishing rod.. and try to catch fish on an empty stomach. Where are the fish??? I fished for ten minuits... not a bite. More apples. Apples... Their driving me mad!!! Then.. You cant find any apple trees.. or have over harvested them.. So you revert to a dirt digger, looking for roots to eat. Its a negative frustrating cycle. Somewhat feudal.\n\n-When you meet someone new, they're likely new to the game too. They boast how they have made a primitive axe also. You made one half an hour ago. and thier bragging makes you want to show them your own axe up close to their face. Yet, you are a good patient person and give them a simple "well done" keeping your penalty bar neutral. (Penalty bar is a bar which kinda measures your deeds. Basically if it goes into the minus side, you will be a criminal and if you die, when you respawn itll make you loose more skill points than normal, so if you pray everyday, and be "Nice" youll be in the positive. Or stuck on neutral.)\n\n- Your new fround companions decide to build next to the large lake on the big island, or on the coast... you start logging trees. Not quiet sure what to do next.. plus you need to work on your construction skill, as you cna only build a furnace.. A furnace??? What use is that..??!! But wait, you gotta learn to walk before you can run. So to build a furnace, i need to collect water and clay and sticks... ok. I can find every thing, but cant pick up water?? ( I actually logged into another server and found a massive village - with no inhabitants. But there was a well. It would let me collect water and it had a container allready) so how do i get water??\n\nAs you can see, this game frustrates, soome times makes no sense. The wiki for the game isnt the best. You watch online you-tube videos and most people who make them, you can hear the frustration in their voice aswell.\nBut then again, thats part of the feudal life. You want to tame the wild beast. Make it your own.\n\nId give this 6/10. I would love to see a single player version with NPC's, raids by NPC etc. Or at least with an allready established town, where you can go up to established carpenter workshops and ask for work etc.\n\nAnyway, ill still keep logging in, wasting my time looking at "Conecting to server & Loading World" screens, just to see if there is progress because like I said earlier the potential... its amense. (Even though that can be said about a lot of alphas/betas) So stay tuned folks.","December 26, 2014","true","20.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
