I would have preferred some colorless puzzles in a more traditional style, but it works fine and they're enjoyable enough. One problem I did have is that while the game is perfect for weak computers and laptops, my laptop has one of those annoying all-in-one touchpads and sometimes I would misclick, causing me to accidentally make a mistake even when I knew what I was doing. If there were a mode that outright disabled error checking I would actually appreciate it. Plus the added challenge would be a benefit!","June 4","true","5.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

I actually only spent about 45 minutes playing this game, but i left it idling, so it shows more time, however, I dont think much more time would change my mind.\n\nI purchased the game too quickly.  I have a very limited games budget each month, and this took up a big portion.  I was so excited because I thought this was going to be like PAINT IT BACK.  It has so vague similarities, however, this game is much easier, you "solve" for the 4 colors of the image, and since the image is built up by each individual color, the "puzzle" portion is not as difficult.  I think that if you wanted to sit and play a relaxing puzzle type painting game, this may just be perfect.","June 4","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
