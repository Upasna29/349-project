Those tassels. 10/10\n\n\nFist of Awesome is a fun game but got kinda boring fast for me. It just didn't have much going for it besides the punching bears bit. The game isn't that long, a single playthrough can be done in one sitting. This isn't surprising as the game was originally a mobile (and Ouya) game. It's a very simplified version of a game like Streets of Rage with regenerating health and no pick-up items. You level up as you play and unlock stat points to powerup your Health, Power, Speed and Special. The Arena mode looks to be a survival mode where you get to play as any character in the game that you've faced off against and other special characters. It doesn't add much enjoyment to the game sadly. Overall the game is horribly repetitive and offers little to no "replayability."\n\nYou also fight velociraptors and deer alongside bears. I like the final choice, didn't see it coming.\n\nI'd recommend this game as a casual beat-em-up to play when you want a quick game. Although at full price it's not worth it really, but if you can get it at a discount it's a decent buy.\n\nFor the regular price of $7.99 or even the current sale price of $6.79 it isn't that good of a deal.\nYou can find the game cheaper on mobile platforms: $3.99 on iTunes and the Play Store and $1.99 on the android Amazon Store","July 4, 2014","false","1.5"," 259 of 288 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","259","288","0","5"

At first glance the game is pretty well built ( By this I mean it runs with absolutely no problems and have not experienced any lag issues at all ). I also was entertained by the game play for about 5-10 minutes and then grew bored of the combat system. The game seems kind of empty to me as there are very few enemy variations ( even different color pallettes could help with this ). The shortness of the game is not an issue to me because a beat-em-up shouldnt take longer than 1:30 to complete from start to finish. All in all I really wouldn't recommend buying this game even for $4 unless some improvements were made to the game.\n\nPossible things to improve (Each of these things should be done if possible)\n- More than one playable character for story mode (Unlocks after completing easy mode first)\n-Change the health regeneration system so theres actual health pick-ups (This helps to make the game feel less empty)\n-Breakable items that may or may not contain weapons and health pick-ups\n-Enemy Variation\n-Movesets of playable characters\n\nThe moveset of Tim Burr is pretty basic which caused me to become bored of the gameplay pretty quickly. If I had more than a few ways to deal with single and multiple enemies I wouldnt mind the amount of repetition you get in this game.\n\nLastly, comparing this game to streets of rage is truthfully an injustice...","August 3, 2014","false","6.2"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","32","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathcheesethewise/recommended/305070/","deathcheesethewise","Whaleshark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathcheesethewise/","90 products in account","This game made me physically mad.\nIt looked cool. It looked like a fun arcade fighter. But in reality its nothing but a pack of lies.\n\nLet's start with the enemies first.\nThe devs found it a great idea to create only two real enemy types: Bears, which are the level's boss enemies, and, also bears? I can't  tell if the second enemy type are bears since the bosses are clearly defined as bears but the common enemy looks more akin to a human-bear-squirrel freak of nature. And while there are several variations of this Humabearrel each one does the EXACT. SAME. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. THING. It feels as though I'm playing the same level over, and over, and over again. It goes like this: fight squirbearmen, fight actual bear, go to next level. The silly gimmicks of traveling through time don't change the enemies at all except for amount of health, which, while im on that little part, IS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING RIDICULOUS. You start off with the "bear"(don't get me started on how much they used this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pun) minimum of damage that youre able to cause and each enemy has health into the hundreds. Endlessly doing single digit damage on an enemy that you know will take forever to defeat is tedious as all hell and gets boring after all of ten seconds. And the enemies never end either. You all must know about how in a normal arcade beat 'em up how you fight maybe one or two enemies already waiting for you and then three or so more jump out and attack, correct? Well in this game I constantly found myself against hordes of freaky squirrelbear ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, wondering when, oh when, will I be able to move on? Combine that with their massive healthbars ad you see why it took me 2.2 hours to finish what should have been a mayyyyyybe 45 minute game. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing A, did i hate those endless, boring, tedious parts. Not to mention the bears send you flying on every hit and the manbearpig‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ers stand over your napping body to wail on you every time you get up. And by wail, I MEAN WAIL. Every hit from them stops you from moving and if you're trapped between them well gg no re to you cause you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed.\n\nAnd now they storyline. This has spoilers, so if you plan on buying this game (protip: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing don't its horrible) avoid this\narea.\nSo the story is youre Tim Mc‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•face, some random ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lumberjack guy (had to interpret this from his clothing) who ALL OF A SUDDEN gains a talking fist named, you certainly guessed it, Fist of Awesome. This fist's entire purpose is that it guides you in your quest, and even that wasn't explained all too well. In reality all it really does is help make ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• jokes and un-BEAR-able puns. Tim here and his mighty jerk-it hand suddenly arrive in an alternate reality where bears rule. So what's the first reasonable action you ask?\nThey punch deers.\nI don't know about you but this is flawless. 10/10. roll end credits.\nBut seriously,  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•'s bad man.\nSo anyway you realize bears are the true enemy and go on a long ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• adventure where you learn that somehow the bears have a time transport train that brings them back in time to breed with past bears and create new super bears and repeat. I could not be making this up. That is how it goes.\nSo you beat the time machine to explosive death and save your world, right?\nOf course not it's never that easy, because the bears have fixed the machine and made everything worse. Bow Bear-ba Fetts fight you as you make youre way to Bear-hatten and into a strip club called "Bare Bears" where you find OH HEY ITS FOA'S BROTHER WHO AS IT TURNS OUT STARTED ALL OF THIS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• AND KILLED HIS BROTHER WHO IS NOW YOUR HAND MAKES SENSE AMIRITE GUIYS????????????\nSo this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•er then transforms into a massive bear thing and you kick the crap out of him and you win. Fist of Awesome somehow stops possessing your hand and it turns out its now your wedding day. You then talk to some people and accidently walk into a guy who calls you lover and gives you a big sloppy kiss cause it turns out thats the gay ending. Literally.\n\nAll in all, 0/10 worst game ever.\nMuch bad.\nDo not buy for any amount of money.\nDon't even buy it for free.\nIt's that level of complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n0/10 game that runs on the 0/10 engine with 0/10 graphics 0/10 storyline and a 0/10 soul.\n‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\nTHIS\nGAME","October 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","70","32","46","14","1"

If you grew up playing Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Final Fight, TMNT arcade, etc, the controls are just really so clunky and un-satisfying. Same with killing normal mobs it just doesn't feel as visceral killing destroying them compared to games from over 25 years ago.\n\nThis may sound like an oxymoron givel that it's pixel art, but this game is a good example of developers that put graphics over gameplay, and it's a real shame given the game world's novelty potential.\n\nVerdict: even though I got the game as part of a bundle, I couldn't even slog through 10 minutes of it. Sorry devs, but you guys didn't do your homework. You've really got to raise the bar given the history of the medium. I've played free flash games that are more fun than this.

I appreciate the blending of Atari-ish graphics with some newer style effects. However, I think retro graphics are more the rule than the exception at this point and they don't necessarily fit the style of game. The same goes for the jokes; They're something I like, especially the puns, but the "fighting bears = manliness" line of joking is just beating a dead horse (or bear) nowadays. The mechanics are simple and functional, this isn't bad. What I don't like about the mechanics is the lack of combos and special moves. I'm willing to give that a pass given that this is a port of a mobile game.\n\nIn summary, I don't recommend the game at it's current retail price of $7.99.

Can you punch bears in this game? Yes, a lot.\nAnd here's a longer one. The reason I got the game in the first place is that I had a discount for it. And to be honest probably wouldn't have bought it if I didn't, however it won me over with its promise of flannel shirts, manly beards and a peculiar self-aware sense of humor. And that it delivered. The game has character. It has an appealing visual design, a great soudtrack to keep you motivated during the bear punching and a story probably written by H.G.Wells himself (probably not true).\nNow the 'punching' itself is not one of the game's strongest atributes. The problem lies in the lack of variety in combat, especially in the boss battles. You end up finding a single strategy that works for you and then using it for the entire game. That is partially mended by the Arena game mode, which has tons of challanges that force you to change and improve your play style.\nFinal vedict. I am probably in the minority here, by saying it's good. Not great, but good. True, the story mode is not all that challanging and is a bit too short, however if you ever wanted to punch a bear in the mouth, have ‚Ç¨ 6 to spend and a free afternoon, i say give this one a shot.","September 2, 2014","true","7.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Tim is empowered with the mighty Fist Of Awesome, a talking hand that guides his travels through the damaged timelines searching for the cause of the temporal disturbance. Along his journey Tim must face off against super advanced bears, deer and buffalo who due to the timeline alterations have risen to be the dominant power on Earth.\n\nFist Of Awesome's story is silly, but that is what I fight Bears was aiming for, and each funny one liner, pop culture reference or throw back to old school gaming is so perfectly delivered that the player will have a great time and laugh right through to the end. The fist play through of the story will take the average gamer no more than an hour to complete but with this in mind I was not disappointed by the playtime, and instead finished the game feeling that I had a great bit of fun getting there.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nFist Of Awesome's controls will be instantly familiar to anyone who has spent some time playing side scrolling fighting games and are easy to get the hang of. The combat is basic in concept but as enemies become more resilient in the higher levels a degree of strategy is required to progress. Each time zone Tim progresses through culminates in a boss fight which is started off with some funny dialogue and are a decent challenge to the player.\nTim gains points and levels up throughout the stages depending on the combos the player can land, and is able to allocate one point to life, strength, speed or special per level. I had a great time with the general game play and leveling system, with the only let down being that enemy types were a bit too samey, and didn‚Äôt use their type specific attacks often enough.\n\nVISUALS & MUSIC\nThe 8-bit art and music style of Fist Of Awesome is brilliant, and further enhances the comedy of the game. I found each level to be entertaining and beautiful in its own way, and enjoyed the well paced soundtrack throughout this crazy adventure.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","October 15, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vegastheBRAVE/recommended/305070/","vegastheBRAVE","Vegas | kickback.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vegastheBRAVE/","364 products in account","VGRS REVIEW:\nGood Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night everyone! :) I hope you all are having a good time, and let's start reviewing this game. In general, i recommend this game, because its simply awesome! :D It's not my genre, I don't usually play games like this but this one has earned my respect. And why? Let's find out below!\n\nPresentation: 5/5\n\nI gave five out of five to the game's presentation because the overall quality of the game is excellent. The menus are well laid out and easy to navigate, You can play with different characters, It's pixel graphics is nice, and the most important factor why i gave it five out of five is the atmosphere of the game. I found it very nice, and you can imagine yourself in the middle of a bear apocalypse, which is pretty funny :)\n\nVisuals: 4/5\n\nThis game is OK to look at, I can't really score this one, because this game aims for a specific style. It isn't bad or good, It's okay.\n\nGameplay: 3,5/5\n\nI couldn't really decide between 3 and 4, so i give it a 3,5. This game can be good to play sometimes, and can be boring sometimes. In this game, you have to box with bears, which is a nice entertainment factor, instead of those silly bandits in most of these fighting games. At the beginning it's really fun to play. But when you get into the later stages of the game, you find yourself repetitively pressing the same buttons against the same enemies. In this game, there are 2 kinds of enemies, a slim bear/fox mixture, and a real big bear. Every level consists of 3-4 waves of enemies, and then a big boss (the real big bear). Every single level is the same, but the enemies wear different clothes and the background changes. The game tries to hide it (and it does the hiding very well) , but it feels repetitive. I completed this game just by smashing the S button all the way :) But there are some interesting things in the gameplay, for example the skill system. You can level up in this game after every stage, and, i couldn't really get it how it works, you just go and level up. Without experience gaining to track your progress, This makes leveling pretty unpredictable. Sometimes you gain 2 levels, sometimes 1. Pretty random thing. But, when you level up you can choose which skill you want to improve. Every level up you gain 1 point which you can spend on increasing your Health, Power, Speed, and the Special Skill. I liked this part of the game.\n\nHumor: 5/5\n\nOHHH MY GOD! This game is so funny! I actually completed this game because of the high amount of sense of humor this game has. The creators must be comedians, or i don't know, but i was falling out of the chair all the time because of those jokes. For example the strip bar in the game, which is called "Bare Bears", and un-bear-able, and these silly jokes. I laughed my *ss off literally. This game is only good because of its humor, in my opinion. As i've said earlier, this is not my genre, but who wouldn't want to laugh?\n\nAudio: 4/5\n\nAudio isn't that bad either. The sound effects are good, there are some funny ones like the one at the jumping kicks (WOHOOOOOO or something like that), and the normal punch and kick sound effects. The Backgrounds musics are well done, i haven't got any problems with them. They always fitted the scene.\n\nPlot: 4/5\n\nThe plot is pretty dumb, but easy to understand and good! :) [SPOILER ALERT] The game starts with the protagonist's (Tim Burr) celebration, and then some noise comes and the screen flashes, and everything turns bad, his house is on fire, the forest is burning. Then suddenly from the middle of the nowhere, Tim Burr's hand(just one hand) changes into the Fist of Awesome, and it begins to talk to him, surprising Tim. Then they beat up lots of enemies, and so on, and they travel in time with Lorentzian Traversable Wormholes. They go back to Dinosaurs, to Medieval ages and other places. It's pretty interesting. The game even tricks us, when we destroy the time travel machine(near the end), the time travels back to the celebration, where we think that finally the game is over, The leader of the bears (The Fist of Awesome's brother) repairs the time machine and everything goes wrong again. And then we have to struggle 2 more levels to complete the game, at the end killing the Fist of Awesome's brother. And then, finally we get back to the celebration, where we find ourselves that this celebration is a marriage, and everyone congratulates our actions. And then at the very end, we have to choose who to marry, a stinky lumberjack or a girl, sadly, i didn't read the last texts just ran to the lumberjack and he kissed me, well, i was surprised a little bit. [SPOILER END] In summary, i liked it, it was fun.\n\nValue: 3/5\n\nThis game isn't really valuable, get it for sale when it's 1 euro or in a humble bundle pack, This is the kind of game which you play once, you complete the short story under 2 hours and just leave in your steam library to rest. But if it's 1 euro or under 1 euro, you should get it, you won't play it for more than 2 hours, but the laughing and everything will totally worth it! :D\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 28,5/35\n\nI liked playing this game especially, I don't think that i'll ever play it again, the minutes i spent playing this game wasn't wasted.\n\nThis is my first Game Review, i hope you liked it! :) Feel free to comment, i'll answer anything :)\n\nBye.\nVegas","February 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Just buy Castle Crashers instead of this, Castle Crashers that at least knows how to properly do a comedy beat'em'up and for the same price it also includes multiplayer and much more.

Thyme","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977434623/","612 products in account","Fist of Awesome has its fine features as well as its drawbacks. What you should know going in though is you should be getting it for about 70% story and 30% actual gameplay. Yes it's a side-scrolling beat-em-up, and yes we desperately need more good games along those lines. Fist of Awesome doesn't quite live up in my opinion.\n\nWell why the hell am I recommending it? Because for the price to entertainment value the game is totally worth it. It's funny, and it has a challenge mode that's actually kinda challenging. In general the fighting is pretty clunky, and it's not terribly hard to abuse the setup to win pretty much any fight if you're patient about it. Enemies will all fall for the same dumb tricks. If you're like me and as impatient as all get-out, then the game's challenge goes up a bit and it feels a little more rewarding to clear a stage. The graphics are that retro-throwback nostalgia-style that's so dominant in indie titles these days, but it's done well, and the writing is at the right level where sitting down with a beer, hooking up the gamepad, and playing through can make for a pleasant couple of hours.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks are the few I've mentioned: clunky fighting and not really challenging. The other big drawback is a lack of multiplayer. Even if it was just local co-op, I'd be happy. Side-scrollers are the kind of thing you want to get together with friends to grind your way through, laugh, and chew the fat over. While I can enjoy this kind of game on my own, I like the option of having a friend or two along for the ride. Comedies are always funnier when there's someone else in the room to laugh with.","September 29, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Part of what keeps a beatemup fresh is the diversity of the enemies and levels. While the locales change and the bears get different clothes, they never graduate out of the same tired move-sets and patterns. Let's use Streets of Rage 2 as an example. There could be jet-pack bears, bears with electric whips, ninja-bears, robot-bears, and so on. All of these enemies would require a different approach. Also the enemy life-bars get far too long. It's not like there is any real strategy. Punch the bear three times, kick them in the nuts, punch them three times, repeat until they die. It's sometimes necessary to move around, use back-attacks, and keep the bears "herded" for easy disposal. At least the developer got this aspect right.\n\nI'm not sure if it's an issue with the art-design or what, but beating enemies up, just isn't satisfying. It seems to me that there's not enough oomph. Wait. What the heck is "oomph"? When you're playing Final Fight 1 and Haggar picks up a thug and pile-drives him into the ground, there's this deep bass that is oomph as heck. When a fist the size of a basketball connects with an enemy's face, there has to be a high level of oomph-ness. Fist of Awesome feels like everyone is just play-fighting. Almost all of the sound-effects sound like they were made by some guy with a microphone. It's a cute idea, but it doesn't really work. The massive life-bars also represent a lack of oomph because you have to punch everyone 50 times. Something as simple as some different animations, better throws, or even a decent jump-kick would have done wonders.\n\nStill, Fist of Awesome isn't completely terrible. The music is great, the arena is interesting (you have to use specific moves or you'll run out of time), and the mechanics are functional. I've played a number of horrendous beatemups on Steam, so I'm thrilled when even the most basic aspects of the game actually work.\n\nNot nearly thrilled enough to recommend this game though. There are literally hundreds of better options if you're looking for a beatemup.","January 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I didn't go in expecting much but was overall satisfied with what I got.\n\nBottom line: It's a good beat em up "quick fix" to kill some time while listening to great music.

Is that bear really in the game, or real life? What is the exact scenario that would happen if I was to fight a bear under incredibly realistic circumstances? Fist of Awesome has answered, and this is the best bear fighting simulator I have seen all year.\n\nAnd the story is incredibly deep, too. Never have I ever cried, or been so touched by the Tim Burr's struggle for humanity, and the fights he faces with his own demons, with whom he must also fight alongside. The supporting characters play an astounding plot-central role that no other written genius could ever deliver, on paper, movie, or game.

You walk your character down a street/road and beat your way through enemies.  When you get knocked down, it takes a moment to get back up, When you do a jump-kick, enemies are guaranteed to be knocked down. When you clear a zone of enemies, you move on to the next zone.  There are differences, such as regenerating health, a special fist attack, and increasing character stats, that add a bit of twist to the game, all of which are welcome features.\n\nThe strongest part of the game is the humor - a world where the food chain has been alternated such that bears are at the top and the humans are the food, and the hero that will save the day is a lumberjack with a talking fist sidekick. The dialogue is great and the background art that reflects the absurdity of the world is a nice detail that adds to the humor.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without flaws. First, the game becomes a slug-fest. The enemies have increasingly larger amount of health with each level, making each kill more of a hassle later on in the game. If you make the mistake of leveling too much stats that aren't related to damage, you're in for a long game.  Even at max damage, combos still take a while to wear one down and there will be many enemies in each level. Second, while there are a nice variety of enemies to fight in terms of appearance, they have a limited amount of skills.  Skill sets of enemies are rehased so by the half-way point into the game, you've probably seen them all.  Furthermore, bosses are all the same, except different in appearance, health, and damage output. Once you fight the first boss, you'll know how to fight the last one. Third, surprisingly there aren't any droppable items. No guns, swords, bats, brooms, chain saws, power-ups, nothing. It feels like a missed opoportunity given the humor of the game and could've added more variety to the combat that becomes stale later on in the game. Lastly, there's the absence of co-op for a Street of Rage type of game, and having it would've definitely helped with the issue of the tankiness of the enemy by having a friend beat them down as well.\n\nUltimately, while Fist of Awesome does well in the humor department, it is a bit lacking in the gameplay. Even if the enemies remain tanky, additions such as items and co-op could've made the game much more appealing. The game is recommended if you're into the humor and looking for a Street of Rage type of game.  The shortness of the campaign means you will probably make it to the end of the game before being too bored by the combat. But if you do enjoy the combat or want to dive in and out of the game for short gameplay, it offers an arena mode.","March 3, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no blocking, no dodging, no strategy other than where your clunky-controlled player is on the screen and where to attack. Otherwise it is spamming buttons. All of the enemies act in the same way and there is no variety other than the occasional enemy having a new attack (Which is always easy to avoid), and the backgrounds. Even the bosses which I have fought so far have been exactly the same to each other, just with more health. I wouldn't mind but the boss fights act the same as the enemy.\n\nI'm sorry, am I missing something? Because what I found here was a pretty bland and basic fighting game.
