This game is definitely very unique and really put in an amazing effort to incorporate puzzle and platformer to a new level. The game's difficulty had a pretty good progression and did really great job to make players think for themselves and find out themselves how to go to the next level - which, by the way, is very satisfying when you did figure it out.\n\nThe most fun parts are where there are more than one way to solve the majority of the puzzles. There are some where you can pretty much just solve it one way; however, these are essential "skills" (in terms of knowledge / know-how) that you would be using later on. It's very satisfying figuring out how to do it and then being able to use them on the levels later on.\n\nThis game also has a HIGH replay value! If you just initially went for the next level, you might want to tackle the game a bit differently the next time you try the same level by exploring more around the levels and finding mementos (sort of pretty much like item collection) which reveal more about the setting/situation. There are also medals where you can try to use the least amount of times you must use your ability(camera) which makes you view the game on more of a "thinking/puzzle" level. And lastly of course, there's also the finish the level as fast as possible medals. I can TOTALLY see this as a great game for Speed Runs.\n\nNot to mention! They also have a level editor. So... you finished the game? Time to bust out some of what you've learned from just finishing the game and make your own level! Not very many games I know has this kind of feature that's something I would think only the developers would have and not share to people.\n\nHighly recommended and worth the money.\n\nTry it out! It's one of those games that I'd say: "yeah, that was pretty unique and fun." It just hits the right amount of satisfaction for platformers and puzzle solvers alike.","February 24, 2015","true","15.4"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","63","68","4","1"

Utilizing a fascinating mechanic of taking a 'snapshot' of your surroundings to solve each level, it proves that simplicity is often the most effective. As you climb the tower more and more of the story is revealed to you and drives you to discover more.\nAs the levels mount in difficulty you need to take everything the game has taught you thus far into account. The puzzles are lovely to look at and challenging, with wonderful music following you as you go. It is a great feeling when you finally crack the secret of each level.\nDefinitely worth 7.79!

The unique art style is great and really gives me a fun and retro-indie feel, but with a professional polish. Combined with such an amazing sound track that's worth a purchase all on its own, this game experience has been exactly what I was hoping for. Immersive, challenging, lighthearted, and rewarding.\n\nThe learning curve does a wonderful job at consistently testing your perceivable boundaries and pushing you to break them over and over as new obstacles are tossed your way.\n\nEach time I overcome an interesting hurdle in Camera Obscura I'm always left with both a rewarding feeling and the curious notion of whether or not that was the only solution to the puzzle. The snapshot "afterimage" mechanic is so clever in the unbelievable number of unforseen ways it can be used and in how easily it adapts to the user's play style. I found myself constantly discovering new ways to solve simple and complex puzzles, even surprising myself with solutions I hadn't seen at first.\n\nThe controls feel very smooth and play wonderfully with a game pad. Which is of paramount importance in a platformer that pushes you to break your limits. You can play with joystick or D-pad on a controller, or with a keyboard if preferred, the game doesn't limit you with any one option, but a gamepad definitely was a good choice.\n\nThe story is as much a beautiful puzzle as the rest of the game. I found it to be both mysterious and intreuging. At first I had the intention of speeding through the levels to prove that I could overcome each challenge, but after falling into the story I now want to revisit each stage to find the little missing pieces of the overall plot that are tucked in every corner.\n\nOverall I feel that Camera Obscura really nailed the delivery with this fantastic Puzzle-Platformer Adventure.\n\nI'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a high spirited and fun filled experience that will challenge them to think outside the box and push their limits!\n\nEnjoy!!","March 12, 2015","true","6.4"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","30","34","2","0"

It could be that I suck hardcore with games like this, but then again, maybe this game is for someone else.  Probably not the average player though.\n\nI only got through the first two sets of levels and I really did like how the dev integrated puzzle solving within the platforming genre, giving the genere a brand new direction to take.  Kudos on how muitple solutions existed, where only the end-goal mattered and it was up to the player for how resourceful and time-efficient the solution is.\n\nWhat really got me was the stiffness of the mechanics since it was more frusterating than satisfying.  From the automatic timing of when the afterimage becomes stationary to the bulkiness of the character, I didn't feel I had enough control over my character and her tools to feel satisfied whenever I solved a level.  I wasn't able to place the afterimage exactly where I wanted to, and there wasn't much brains involved compared to split-second movements.\n\nIt is a charming game with good art and clever design choices.  But due to the frusteration is caused me, it's not a game for everyone.  If you are willing to put up with stiff mechanics and support an indie developer with incredible potential, by all means get this game.  Otherwise, you're not missing much other than a lot of frusteration.","July 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 66 of 95 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","66","95","6","0"

What makes this particular game different from other similar games is our ability to manipulate your surroundings by taking a photograph. When you take a photograph it creates an afterimage which you can then manipulate for a few seconds to create obstacles, bridges, stairs etc. There are 57 levels of the tower you must climb and each level contains photographs you can collect. The levels are timed allowing you to earn up to a gold star if you complete it withina certain length of time. As you progress the difficulty becomes greater with wild animals, and dangerous traps. For as simplistic as it looks, it is actually a lot of fun. You can really toy around with the afterimage effect and explore.\n\nFrom what I understand there is also a custom level editior with this game meaning you can make your own levels and share them on the steam workshop. This would be very interesting to see how creative and insane of levels people can come up with. All in all, it is a decent buy. Probably best to buy it as part of the developer aliance bundle so you have a few other games to play around with as well,","August 9, 2015","true","3.7"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","38","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bionictriforce/recommended/341500/","bionictriforce","BionicTriforce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bionictriforce/","160 products in account","Since the game's release I've put about eight hours into it, about split evenly between level progression and trying to get the various medals. It's proven to be a very addicting game, as I'm finding myself saying 'okay one more try' or 'let me see what this next level is' many times. It's also very fun, there's not much to it apart from the various platforming elements. There's still some stuff in the trailer I haven't gotten to yet, so the game doesn't throw everything at you right away, and each level is pretty different.\n\nThe platforming is nice and tight, as you're able to control how hard you jump, which comes in handy during speedruns when you just need to make a little hop. Respawns are quick, or if you want to restart the level, that's very fast as well. The camera element, or 'flashing', is interesting. Essentially, when you hit X, you make an afterimage of the background, which follows you for about two seconds before stopping, and then stays there for a few seconds more. You use this to create steps, lift enemies, and get to places you otherwise couldn't reach. It will take a bit of time to master this, as you'll have to learn when is the best time to jump before the platform halts its movement. But when you do you'll be able to move around levels like a pro.\n\nEach level has a Time challenge and a Flash challenge. Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals for using the least amount of flashes possible, or beating it in the least amount of time. Sometimes getting gold for both happens at the same time, sometimes they're mutually exclusive. They're definitely challenging, but I wouldn't say they're unfair. Though it can be aggravating getting a time of 23.01 and you need to get a 23.00 to get the gold. But it's fun to see what shortcuts are in the levels. One that comes to mind can be completed in about five seconds, or over a minute, depending on if you know the trick or not. And when you're doing the speedruns, you'll often find the enemies are placed in juuust the right area to screw you over if you don't do it right. But then you get to do it and then you can laugh and laugh and laugh.\n\nFor the story, I haven't really delved into it yet. There are mementos you can find as collectibles. The main character is a photographer, and she's looking for somebody at the top of this tower. But anything other than that I either don't know or don't want to spoil. The memento give a history of the tower you're climbing, and what you're trying to accomplish, but it's not needed to enjoy the game. Only problem I have with this is there's no indication of what levels have mementos left uncollected, so you may want to write down what mementos you find in each level, as they're at least numbered.\n\nThe music is nice, I think there are about eleven tracks. They don't get repetitive and create a nice ambience for the game. Tempted to pick up the soundtrack myself.\n\nI would estimate that if you were just going through the game, trying to get to the end, it would last you at least ten hours? I'm only at the halfway point myself, and it's definitely getting harder, so it'll take longer to beat the last levels. But it still hasn't reached unfair levels of difficulty, or Braid-level lateral reasoning to beat a puzzle. But then, that time doesn't count trying to get medals, or going back for mementos you missed. I did end up spending half an hour trying to get the two golds on one tricky level, but that feeling of satisfaction after I got them, oh, that was palpable.\n\nThere's also a level creator, but I haven't yet gone into that. But that's definitely something I'm looking forward to seeing after everyone develops some new levels. For the levels in the game, as I said before, there's a lot of variety. It changes the general theme of the level as you climb the tower, getting more mechanical as opposed to the stony architecture of the first levels, which is cool. There are moving platforms, switches you need to hit (or use monsters to hit), tiles that can't be flashed, tiles that need to be switched on to be flashed, and oh yes: no spikes whatsoever. If you die it's simply from falling down a pit or touching an enemy.\n\nDefinitely a good purchase, especially for the price. Absolutely recommended.","February 20, 2015","true","11.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

I play this game way too much...\n\nThis game is a platformer with a nice atmosphere, an entertaining gimmick, and great speedrunning potential. I'm actually speedrunning this game these days.\n\nThis is a standard platformer with one difference, you can copy surrounding platforms and place them elsewhere, temporarily creating new platforms.\n\nThis game gives you medals for two things: using your ability the least amount of times, and beating the level ASAP. In the 2nd condition's case, basically an Individual Level (IL) speedrun. It gets very addicting as, first you route the best path to speedrun, then you keep resetting a level over and over again until you get that perfect run with minimum mistakes and high optimization. I actually postponed beating the main game for about 30 hours just so I could shave milliseconds off of my previous run.\n\nAnd then one of my friends inevitably finds a better route and the cycle continues. I have over 100 hours in this game, so ya listen to me. If you want to get into speedrunning, this is like a gateway drug.\n\nAlso, get the Developers Alliance Bundle.

The puzzle mechanic here has a lot of potential, but the trailer is a bit misleading, as your after image moves with you for a second or so, then it stops, giving you lots of flexibility, but it can also be infuriating later on when you need finesse.\n\nI like Camera Obscura.  The art style has a great deal of charm even if, in my opinion, the animation is a bit choppy here and there.  The story, hidden in the collectibles, is pretty moving and sad, equal parts a character study of our heroine and a look at the cult that built a tower to the sun.  The gameplay is surprisingly devious, to the point where it can get frustrating or be really innovative, depending.  I have spent some time yelling at my computer screen, but generally, it is pretty enjoyable.\n\nControls are fluid, but I HIGHLY recommend a usb controller, just for the difficult platforming sections.  The music is far and away the best part of the game, equal parts mysterious, calming, hectic, and adventerous.  This soundtrack is truly awesome.\n\nThe collectibles and the secret endings can be a bit frustrating as there are no guides to help with them, as of this posting, and the answers are seldom ever clear.  I got two of the three endings with a lot of experimentation.\n\nI do recommend the game.  It's charming and fun, with a game mechanic that you will have to be really inventive with to use to the fullest.  As far as platformers go, it can be a bit frustrating, but as far as puzzlers go, it's deviously clever.\n\nCamera Obscura.

If you're not, it's an ok game, but you'll need some patience anyway. It has alot of unfair and unnecessarily annoying sections, that have not much to do with difficulty and platforming skills but are just plain bad level design.\n\n- horrible collision detection with enemies. The hitbox is a box with always the same size, even though some animation frames make enemies very small, filling only a tiny spot in that box (slime's fall animation, for example, for those how already know the game)\n- the menu has some unskippable slow fades and transitions. That gets annoying when you go through there alot. Selecting a level is especially tedious, you have to wait through multiple transitions when selecting a level.\n- ugly graphics. There are alot of games out there that prove that 2D pixel graphics can look great. This game is the opposite.\n- no restart level button, you have to go through the menu to restart the level, which you will do ALOT.\n- no on screen timer. When you try to beat specific level times for medals and achievements, you have no idea how you are doing, until you see the end screen.\n- when you start a level (coming from the previous level or the level select menu), there is a fade-in time during which you can't see anything, but the level timer has started anyway. For beating the times, you regularly will want to immediately restart the stage to start without the fade-in.\n- the story is presented in text snippets. Yes, simple text, nothing else. Not even an interesting or eye-pleasing font.\n- several levels have long boring sections where you are just walking or even just waiting for a moving platform, for example. And you will have to repeat those sections alot, because afterwards there is no checkpoint and some difficult section follows.

But it works as game pace at least now when i am nearing half-way trough the tower is quite good, relaxed even i would say. Early on you rush trough levels but then you notice those memento pictures in almost unreachable places and you wonder how to get there. Then there's the medals you get for using as little flashes as possible and time to complete a level.\n\nThese combined makes up for a pretty good base for a game where you learn new tricks to get over obstacles you could not figure out before.  Good luck getting those achievements that are awarded for getting all the gold medals. Even silver level is tough as nails to get them all.  This game is also one of thoses games where many times the solution to a problem is right in front of you but you were not thinking it right.

Casual gamers like the simplicity, core gamers love the novelty, and both groups appreciate the low price. Camera Obscura is a side-scrolling puzzle/platformer from Anteater Games that could have easily been made in the '90s, but it still provides an interesting challenge that will appeal to modern gamers.\n\nCamera obscura, which is Latin for “dark chamber," is both an accurate description of early box cameras and also a metaphor for the gloomy tower in which the game takes place. As the story begins, you take control of an unnamed protagonist armed only with a magical camera that can manipulate the environment. The protagonist enters a giant, mysterious tower that stretches far into the sky and proceeds to ascend to the top. It's unknown why the tower exists and why it was abandoned, but you can uncover the secrets by finding pictures scattered throughout the environment.\n\nAt its core, Camera Obscura is a very challenging platformer that requires pixel-perfect precision in both movement and jumps. Since the protagonist moves at a jogging pace, it's easy to fall off small platforms to your doom or mistime jumps. Fortunately, there's an endless supply of lives, and you usually respawn close to where you died. Additional challenge is provided by enemies like deadly slime creatures and flying bats that instantly kill players when they're touched. When you add the Afterimage mechanic to the mix, the resulting difficulty may have you cursing your screen so much that neighbors will wonder if you have Tourette Syndrome.\n\nOne button press is all it takes to initiate the innovative Afterimage flash effect that clones the environment for a few seconds. When this occurs, the player can move to the side or jump up or down to move the Afterimage in the same direction. This process can create bridges to run on or steps to climb, freeze moving platforms, and even trap or crush enemies. It seems like a simple concept, but the Afterimage can be used in a wide variety of ways that depend on your imagination. Since the effect only lasts for a few seconds, the chance of making a mistake is greatly amplified, especially when trying to rush through a level.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game has 57 maps that take place both inside and outside of the tower. Players can earn one bronze, silver, or gold medal for each map depending on the time it takes to finish a map and one medal for how many afterimage flashes they used. Replaying maps to earn gold medals helps to extend the game's length for perfectionists and anyone who desires a difficult challenge. In addition, any player can utilize the user-friendly level editor to create and upload maps to further extend the replay value.\n\nAlthough the retro visuals are pixelated, they still look very cool. The blocky aesthetic of the main environments remind me of Dig Dug, but with more stylish and detailed backgrounds. I also appreciate the beautiful soundtrack that puts me in a mellow mood with its cathartic melodies. It's just too bad that, just like exploring any dark room, a few bugs tarnish the experience. My biggest gripe is how customized controls reset to their default setup every time the game is launched. Other launch problems include low framerates and random crashes.\n\nCamera Obscura is definitely a niche game with simplistic gameplay, but it has a certain charm that will captivate anyone who gives it a try.","March 17","true","15.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

When a platformer has controls that make the game feel harder than it really is then in my personal opinion it's not really a good platformer...

The key feature with both of those is that they’re more heavily story driven than their peers. Camera Obscura certainly did nothing to change my opinion of puzzle platforming, I didn’t have fun with the hour or so I spent with it, but I have to recommend it anyway.\n\nThe key mechanic is the ability to trigger a camera flash which creates an afterimage of the current visible terrain which you can then move around with your character. It’s difficult to explain on paper but the effect is really interesting. I have seen some games which allow for a certain segments of the screen to be captured and moved about but trying to work with all the visible terrain opens up many more possibilities as well as previously unconsidered challenges.\nI didn’t find it fun but I think it’s a well made platformer with an intriguing mechanic worthy of some attention.","September 6, 2015","true","18.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is interesting when a developer tries something new.  So here we have a platform game with a puzzle mechanic.\n\nI will say for the retro style I found the art very appealing.  And I did not find the puzzles too difficult.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe problem is, the developer neglected that at its heart this needed to be a platform game.  Controls are slugish, and the jumping is especially bad.  A platform game with a bad jumping mechanic is no game at all.  The puzzles become not a problem of figuring them out, but of fighting with the controls to execute on an obvious solution.  If your character had smooth controls, this would be an outstanding game.  As it is, I feel it is just below average in the platforming genre.\n\nStill, kudos to the developer for a neat idea.\n\n4/10","December 26, 2015","false","2.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

How do you kill a slime with a camera, you ask? Simple: Using your camera (which, beyond jumping, is all you can do), you take a shadowy copy of the immediate surrounding landscape that is centered around you, and it follows you for a moment before freezing in place, which when combined with jumping and falling, can allow you to reach new heights, cross large chasms, or crush enemies between the shadowy terrain and the real terrain.\nWhile you are able to prematurely dismiss the shadowy terrain you make with your camera, you have no way to deal with the few creatures in the game if encountered in large, open areas, to which most of the levels are designed as, and several levels throw sharp spikes in difficulty at you, like trying to jump from a higher, wider ledge down to a lower, more narrow ledge that is under the wider one, or like in the example in the first paragraph, racing a slime without killing it or letting it get too far ahead of you. There are three other incentives that will also demand perfection from you with the use of your camera; Photos, Flash medals, and Time trial medals.\nPhotos are the game's collectable and actually don't have any images on them, but rather they give details of the game's world and the protagonist's backstory, yet some of them require tricky or advanced shadowy terrain manipulation to reach. Flash medals are rewarded based on how many times you used the camera to make shadowy terrain; the fewer used, the better the medal. Time Trial medals are, well, rewarded on how fast you finish a level. Very straight forward for those. Between the three, they are ment to create replay value for the game, however the absurd increase in difficulty without proper tutorials creates frustration, especially when ingame text about your controls is spread few and far apart (which should be covered in like, say, a tutorial).\nAll in all, if you plan to pick up the game for yourself, pick it up only when it's on sale; The frustration induced by this "puzzle" platformer is not welcomed.","August 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The retro styling is nice, though maybe a little spartan. My main complaint is a slight lack of crispness to the movement which kept me overshooting small platforms, but that might just be my poor-quality platforming skills and is certainly not anything close to game-breaking.

This is a simple, yet earnest game. It is powerful, and small, deep, and simple. It combines the greatest aspects of platforming -- running and jumping - with an innovative, practically unseen mechanic that allows new insight into level design. Speaking of which, these levels are simple, but designed effectively. This game was clearly created on a little-to-no-budget premise, and it delivers that small scope PERFECTLY.\n\nNow, onto a bit more review:\n\nThe game itself involves a mysterious, unknown girl with an equally unknown past who must ascend this widely feared structure known only as "The Tower". Along the way, she collects old stock photographs, which contain the game's only exposition. These small bits of writing unveil the emotional journey of this girl, as she appears to be rebelling against the fears and doubts of those whoe have failed to ascend this "Tower". They explain vital moments of her life that tugged all of my heart strings.\n\nThe exposition compliments the key mechanic - which involves "snapshotting" or creating a "ghost image" of the platform sections in your immediate vicinity. These move with your avatar for a second, then become solid, allowing you to traverse unreachable areas.\n\nThis connection between the narrative and the gameplay mechanics is fantastically done. For a simple game, the designers truly took advantage of every pixel, every word, every platform and level tile. I've enjoyed it very much, but my enjoyment being conveyed through text on your screen won't be enough to convince you. The game is discounted to a VERY low price at the moment, so I must urge you to buy it with whatever pocket change you possess at the moment and try this masterpiece for yourself.\n\nIt is short, sweet, and to the point. The game is earnest and engaging. I am very proud of the developers for squeezing every bit of enjoyment out of what could have easily been passed off as a nameless flash game, were it not to be Greenlit on Steam.

Well, let me try anyway.\n\nThis game can both appeal to puzzle and platforming gamers alike. It brings an incredibly unique gimmick to the table- after-image platforms. One may think that these would make the game easier- however, they don't. Rather, they are a key mechanic in the puzzle aspect of the game.\nOne must think carefully, and move quickly, as these things can only be manipulated for a short time before they freeze. This gives the game a good flow, and the feeling of completing a puzzle is astoundingly positive.\nFrom what short time I've spent with the game, the puzzles are fun and intuitive, the mechanic is unique and refreshing, the story is simple, yet spurs a sense of curiosity, and the new puzzle elements are introduced smoothly.\n\nWhile this isn't the next Fez, this game certainly has potential to become one of the best indie platformers out there.\n10/10, definitely a good buy.","June 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a simple, yet earnest game. It is powerful, and small, deep, and simple. It combines the greatest aspects of platforming -- running and jumping - with an innovative, practically unseen mechanic that allows new insight into level design. Speaking of which, these levels are simple, but designed effectively. This game was clearly created on a little-to-no-budget premise, and it delivers that small scope PERFECTLY.\n\nNow, onto a bit more review:\n\nThe game itself involves a mysterious, unknown girl with an equally unknown past who must ascend this widely feared structure known only as "The Tower". Along the way, she collects old stock photographs, which contain the game's only exposition. These small bits of writing unveil the emotional journey of this girl, as she appears to be rebelling against the fears and doubts of those whoe have failed to ascend this "Tower". They explain vital moments of her life that tugged all of my heart strings.\n\nThe exposition compliments the key mechanic - which involves "snapshotting" or creating a "ghost image" of the platform sections in your immediate vicinity. These move with your avatar for a second, then become solid, allowing you to traverse unreachable areas.\n\nThis connection between the narrative and the gameplay mechanics is fantastically done. For a simple game, the designers truly took advantage of every pixel, every word, every platform and level tile. I've enjoyed it very much, but my enjoyment being conveyed through text on your screen won't be enough to convince you. The game is discounted to a VERY low price at the moment, so I must urge you to buy it with whatever pocket change you possess at the moment and try this masterpiece for yourself.\n\nIt is short, sweet, and to the point. The game is earnest and engaging. I am very proud of the developers for squeezing every bit of enjoyment out of what could have easily been passed off as a nameless flash game, were it not to be Greenlit on Steam. Do yourself a favor, purchase it before the price returns to normal. : )","June 18, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think I bought it for 19 cents or something.\n\nI feel like I shouldn't give this game a negative recommendation because it's exactly what it advertises: an inexpensive retro platformer based on one environment alteration ability. The platforming mechanics function similar to many flash games I've played, and like a few negative reviews, I'd concede that most of the frustration or elation comes down to how you time the jumps and block placements. Interesting for a while, but for me the gameplay was painstakingly repetitive. What's worse is that the "Sun Tower" could have an interesting story behind it, but the story-progressing collectibles are angsty and sophmoric, and laughably printed in the most basic of word processor fonts...\n\nSome people might dig the game, as evidenced by the majority of reviews, and when it costs a dollar or less to try it out, I mean, might as well, right?","April 12","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The idea being that you take a snapshot of the world, and you have a couple of seconds to walk and manipulate your snapshot in it. The mechanic is simple, but it works: it actually leads to some interesting puzzle solutions, and while the game isn't the greatest of lookers and definitely has flaws, it does feel rather different then many platformers out there. I picked it up at 24 cents, and I have to say, I definitely got my money's worth even an hour into it, and I seemingly still have a significant bit to go. Definitely worth the pocket change.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions:  https://youtu.be/cBWdCE5jDMY\n\nLists:\n+:\nUnique mechanic is different from other games and actually works out rather well: makes the game stand out a bit.\nEnvironments play well into different “areas” and introduction of new mechanics are done rather well.\nCreativity is rewarded here with using momentum, leading to interesting solutions. In particular, being able to get rid of enemies with it is rather neat.\nThere's collectables in interesting places to keep you looking for things.\nDo like the animation of death, even if it's completely over the top at times. It's hilarious.-:\nVisuals are definitely lacking. It's not the greatest of produced in terms of art direction.\nOnce in a while, the controls will feel a bit floaty.\nFirst set of levels are definitely on the low difficulty section, but after the first section, it definitely opens up.\nSome inconsistent rule sets. Now note, when it's inconsistent, I'll give them the fact that it's inconsistent where it “has” to be, aka the only way to do it.","June 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Something that I had never experienced before and something that I thought, "hey, I can dig this".  On the surface, Camera Obscura, had everything I was looking for in something new and exciting, and then I played it.\n\nA couple of things; you're a girl, which is awesome, I'm totally pro female protagonist. It's awesome we need more of it, but she's constantly staring at me, its kind of unnerving and a little frightening.  Why? Why are you looking at mt?  Look where your going, just look where you're going!  You're animating your sprite, which is awesome, just turn her head, just turn her head. She's always looking at you, judging you! "Why did you jump then? Why didn't you jump before? Huh? Oh, so that's how you're playing.  I'll remember that."\n\nCamera Obscura's camera mechanic, what do you call this mechanic? I don't know but I love it.  I love the idea of it and everything that can be done with it.  It just needs a better game to better realize its potential, I see great things for this.  Remember Narbacular Drop?  It was an okay game, not a great game but a okay game with a great mechanic in need of a great game, Portal became its great game.  Camera Obscura is like that game, it has a great mechanic in need of a great game.\n\nCamera Obscura, its a fun title.  The music was, a little repetitive, really repetitive, like super repetitive. It felt like a ten second clip looped ad infinitum.  It was... the music needed a lot of work, I'm not gonna lie.\n\nVerdict?  Well if you want a challenge give it a go.  I may never touch it again, but then I really love the camera capture, so maybe I will.  I haven't a clue.\n\nGo live you're own life and stop listening to me!","June 27, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once they are there, the player can move for a bit before they solidify, and then jump on them before they disappear. Platformers with special mechanics tend to walk a fine line-either the mechanic makes the game too easy, or the developer overcorrects and it becomes too hard.\n\nCamera Obscura leans on the "hard" end of that line but doesn't cross it, and I say this as someone who, as of the time of this review, was encountering a substantial ramp-up in difficulty. I do have to repeat that the game is indeed difficult. Probably to ensure the use of the flash-platforms, the main character cannot jump very high on her own, and many stages require careful environmental management to progress (both the stage I'm currently up to and the one I just completed require you to keep a fragile enemy alive to solve a puzzle).\n\nThe game just has a good "feeling" to it, the feeling of puzzle completion, the excellent soundtrack (which in my opinion is reason enough to buy the game by itself), and the sense of being seemingly stuck but knowing there just has to be a way out (which is what the difficulty entails).\n\nHowever, the game also has some of the weaknesses one would expect from new developers. The flash-platform mechanic is imperfect and works a lot better in horizontal movement than in vertical ones, and making the right platform is often not a matter of ingenious puzzle-solving, but pure trial-and-error. The soundtrack and setting of the game imply a slower, contemplative atmosphere, but the frequent need for fast reflexes often contradicts it. Also, though not the fault of the developers themselves, the obscurity (no pun intended) of the game means there's little outside documentation. This, combined with the difficulty, means that a player may be forced to ask around should they be stuck (as I was)\n\nThe relative weakness of the main character without the camera and the fact that she slides a little too much can be a little annoying. Finally, without spoiling anything, the game has more of a plot than it actually needs, and said plot isn't the best-written (although it's a very small part of the game).\n\nIn spite of these, Camera Obscura is a worthy puzzle-platformer. None of the flaws are insurmountable, and none make the game feel tiresome to play, as opposed to just difficult. I got it for sale at a very low price, but it's definitely worth buying at its regular one. While one may be annoyed at how the door to the next level is so close but so far, and struggle with making just the right platform, once they reach the door, the feeling of satisfaction is all the sweeter.","June 30, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your camera has the strange ability to create after images of various platforms. These after images start off being able to slowly move based off your own movements but will eventually freeze up.\nOnce you learn to use the After Images this game becomes a lot easier and has a lot more variety in its puzzle solving.\nSome of the puzzles are a little bit too frustrating. The game will sometimes task you with getting an enemy to a button to flip a door open, this enemy can easily be killed if you're not careful. These missions are some of the most frustrating missions ever.\nThe game is hard and sometimes unfair, however it is mostly enjoyable except for one thing, the level 8-2. This level is just awful, it's unclear what they want you to do and the flow is just horrible. The fact that every guide I found online was about ways to skip half of the level, should show you how hated it is. If you make it that far I suggest you learn how to skip it as well, it's not worth the effort doing it the way the designers wanted it done.\nThankfully the last level is fairly easy but has beautiful back grounds and a great musical score. It really does feel like the climax to your journey and is a great last level.\n\nOn the artistic side I found the back grounds to be pretty good. Some of them even are breath taking. While the sprite work is just average. The monsters don't seem to fit with the main characters art design, instead looking like your standard run of the mill monsters. It's a shame they couldn't come up with something more intresting than, slime, bat, bug. Though the ant eater is a bit different ( though they are Anteater games ).\nHowever the true failure in this game, is the sprite animation. Slimes mysteriously grow butts, the main character jumps by just clapping her feet together. Your death animation is a silly double spin. The games animation is just a bit janky, nothing that upsets me, it just makes the game feel a bit cheap. ( Though the death animation IS hilarious ). However it does have artistic flourishes like having several idle animations that are pretty good, and even animating the scarf when she falls.\n\nThe story is given to you in bits and pieces, scattered across the levels in collectable polaroids. I collected them where I could and got above 75% of them, however I wish they didn't just use the polaroids. For example in Thomas was Alone, they had a voice over that gave you bits of the story and characterization. I would have liked something similar, maybe just text appearing as you played the level.\nIn the last level they have dialouge, but when you get to the end all you get is a samll image in the end credits.\n\nAll in all I think this game isn't the best game, but it has intresting mechanics and some fun levels with a story that is a bit charming. So for the price tag I say it's worth it to play, at least up till 8-2.\n\nTLDR: It's 1.99 you get what you pay for. It's enjoyable for the most part but some levels will have you tearing out your hair.","February 10","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

It can test your patience on some levels, especially levels you're trying to get a double gold. Some levels have hidden checkpoints but not always. So far there is one level that does require you be nearly 100% precise as possible to get gold for time: Cleric's Bridge. Thankfully there is a video that can show you what to do, but be difficult to execute yourself.\n\nSadly there's not many guides to help you out of how to clear many levels quickly or with fewer flashes. There is a guide that shows you what time and flashes you need to make minimum to get gold for each.\n\nThis is a pretty good precise platformer. Easy to understand the controls, hard to master. Do expect to fail a lot in one level alone as you go farther in.\n\nYou do need a lot of patience though. If you lack patience I wouldn't get this game, it'll frustrate you.

They put on their thinking cap, gather their resources, and tediously come up with a plan-of-attack. Everyone is sitting around the boardroom, spit-balling ideas, and someone says:\n\n'Hey I got it - lets make one-trick-pony platformer with PS1 graphics! We will use the exact same mechanic as in Snapshot and essentially only use two buttons with looping ambient music. The art will be generic and so will all of the textures.'\n\nWho's in?\n\n---\nOk, lets be serious though - its not terrible, and the puzzle gimmick is not half-bad either, but it is not something I would tell a friend to spend five bucks on, period. It is more like a proof-of-concept with placeholder art and music, at this point.  If I had to guess, this was made with some easy access video game making software, and very few of the resources are custom for this game. I see people on the forums enjoy speedrunning this, and I guess I get that. I love video games, and I love to play lots of them, but everybody is limited by time - why play sub-standard titles? I don't mean this as an insult, but it has to be said.\n\nI was gifted this game from a Steam account that regularly sends me titles to review. Thats fine, except most of what they send is garbage, which now has inflated review scores because they gift out so many copies.

I respect the developers, and their work.\n\nBut on the other side, after playing the game for at least twenty minutes, I felt like someone who looks for a graveyard entrance to finally begin a funeral - somewhere inside the ruins of a tower. After those 'cute' droplet-things came on the next levels, they gave me the idea to use bad language for another twenty minutes. Maybe I'm not a patient person, but until I gave up this game, nothing happened. I jumped, "flash", jump, avoid droplets, same-same-same-same tower-ruin tilesets. Everytime the same. And the photos. It would be better to collect keys and other things like health during the levels, but nothing just photos. Every single photo-text contains the word "she" at least 23 times. I played the game about 40 minutes, and at the last levels I played, I realized that the main character is a girl. I said: WHAAT!?!? :D :D Looks like a boy character. Oh, and that spinning death animation...every time I screamed like an orc who's balls were ripped off. :D It was funny after I died twenty times.\n\nThat spinning death looks like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovBICKDlU3M\n\nI recommend the developers to not drop this game idea, but transform it to something fast paced adventure game. Faster music, futuristic or fantasy look. More(!) items, more surface area.\n\nSorry for the critics, but I cannot play this game anymore. Why I bought it? It was in a pack. That's all. I gave it a try. Now you can throw the stones.","June 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","8","28","5","0"

The bad:   precision platforming - timing your ability, you may get platforms that are a bit too high up or too low for you to properly progress  Unforgiving levels - repeating parts of levels because you messed up  No mouse support in menus, I just find it easier if it is present.\nI recommend this game, but again, be aware it's not a casual experience, in my oppinion at leats.","August 31, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frankly, I'm unimpressed. The game consists of basic platforming aspects (that don't feel very good), along with one extra aspect, which is taking pictures of the surroundings and moves them with you.\n\nI love the publishers who made this game- they made great games like Out There Somewhere, which is a fantastic game in my opinion. This game failed to really catch my attention.\n\nThe combat is annoying (Trying to crush the monsters which get caught on the afterimages and end up killing you anyways? Sounds like a fun time), which of course leads to entire levels being annoying when they require a ton of combat. Also, there are very little checkpoints in some levels, generally being the levels which really need them.\n\nNow, looking at this game from a completionist point of view: if you plan to get this game for completionist, I beg you to reconsider. The achievements are ridiculous. You have to get a gold ranking on every sub-stage in the game. Every. Single. One. It's simply tedious. There's no rewarding aspect to it.\n\nFrankly, I can't recommend this game. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't fun. It was infuriating and I was just disappointed, especially after the developers created some really high-quality games that I loved. This game, in my opinion, is a no-go. Not really even worth it on sale. Yes, it has trading cards, but those really aren't worth it.","September 6, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is rather nice, and the game play method with creating platforms from after images taken via the camera is unique. I suppose the most off-putting thing for me is that the photos which you have to collect on each level to reveal the story are... Kind of boring? I admit I only got through the first two areas of the tower. Maybe the game picks up more later on. Unfortunately it's already lost my interest.\n\nI will say the music is rather relaxing and I could see this being a good game for someone wanting to just relax and solve minor puzzles of how to get to one place or another.

As per required in the independent landscape, this particular "platformer with a twist" lets you create temporary platforms that move with you when you use your camera, hence the title. It's not a bad gimmick in the slightest, but one that I never felt was fully realized during my playthrough. While some of the level layouts were fairly interesting, the only times I ever found myself stuck was when I overthought a problem. Sometimes that can be effective, but there is a difference between intellegent misdirection and mediocre level design.\n\nTo be fair, there are a few sections that did have a couple of "aha!" moments, but even though the platforming was inoffensive most times, I can't emphasize enough the missed potential here. CO shines at its brightest when the levels themselves are puzzles, and its a shame to see that the majority of the game consists mostly of cheap filler. With more control over the afterimage effects, or maybe some sort of metroidvania skill ups for the camera to add new abilities within the fiction, I feel that while the game offered here is decent enough, there is little to engage the player all the way to the end. That is the real tragedy.\n\nSo why the Yes? Two simple reasons; for all my criticisms, this is still a damn fine game. While I'd be strained to compare it to Braid or games of that nature, CO still pulses with charm that echoes ambition I haven't seen a fairly long time on this storefront. The platforming is a little stiff, but for the cheap price I keep seeing it for, I think it's a great little gem to kill some time with. The second reason is a bit more pretentious of me; Camera Obscura screams of potential, and I would love to see where this concept and its creator go from here. We all have to start somewhere, and as Anteater's first game on Steam I can't help but appreciate an inspired idea, flawed as it may be. For less than a gumball from a gumball machine, I think this game is absolutely worth giving a look. The lovely ambient soundtrack is worth the admission price alone. Definitely worth grabbing when on sale.","December 26, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is hinted at and implied through collectible photo icons that contain snippets of text. Some are descriptions of a religious cult and some are mopey rememberences of a lost love. None are very captivating.\n\nThe gameplay is really good, though. The player can use a camera to clone certain parts of the scenery to create new platforms and solve jumping puzzles. That sounds strange, but it's a very intuitive and original mechanic. The difficulty scales gradually over the course of a robust 50 or 60 levels and many of the later ones especially are challenging and well-designed.\n\nThis is not a very polished game. The graphics are remarkably bad, although they are strikingly similar to some of the worst graphics from the 1990's -- a decade this game pays clear homage to. Is this some high-concept intentional design choice? If it is, it's too subtle for a philistine like me. All I can say is that many of the assests look like they were created at the wrong resolution and then stretched to the proper size at the last minute. Also there is a common "bat" enemy that looks like it was drawn by a child. The music, on the other hand, is amusingly relaxing considering it is often the soundtrack to you dying over and over and over agin.\n\nQuibbles aside, Camera Obscura is a fun, creative platformer that kept me engaged for 10 or 15 hours. It was a great deal for the 50 cents or whatever I paid for it. Recommended for sure.","October 31, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You use the after image your eyes see after a camera flash to make temporary platforms you can walk on to help you progress.  There is some story in this game but I have not played far enough through the came to comment on how good it is.\nThe game has a level editor and uses Steam Workshop to share user created content.  It has collectables for the OCD crowd.  For the $2.00 this game cost at the time of this review, I think it's a very good bang for your buck.\n\nGraphics:  7/10\n\nThe 8 bit graphics are well done and fit the feel of the game well.\n\nSound:  7/10\n\nThe sounds and music fit the game and are of good quality.\n\nControls:  8/10\n\nThe controls feel crisp and precise. Platforming came easily on an Xbox 360 Hori gamepad.  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that when you are moving left or right, occasionally my character wouldn't move because I was pushing up a bit. I think the left/right window should be a little wider. Otherwise the controls in this game are spot on.\n\nGameplay:  8/10\n\nThe gameplay is fairly standard issue platforming fare but with the after image mechanic it finds it's own personality. The flash can make you have to think about how to get somewhere which I found gave this game a fun advantage over plain platforming.\n\nOverall;  8/10\n\nThe value you get for you $2.00 is great. It's fun, it's different and well worth playing.","February 16","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept sounds interesting, but it's far less interesting in practice. The "puzzles" are at best relatively uninspired; at worst they are either way too easy or they are stupidly difficult without any real challenge involved. I think that with some adjustments to the physics of this game it might have potential, but as it is it's just not interesting. I didn't finish it, so maybe the later levels are better, but you shouldn't have to play a game for more than an hour before it gets fun. Also, the "story" inasmuch as there is one is not interesting at all. You find these weird polaroid images that appear to be describing the game's plot (happening in the present) in past tense, and there's no explanation for who you are or why you have this weird magical camera.

Casual gamers like the simplicity, core gamers love the novelty, and both groups appreciate the low price. Camera Obscura is a side-scrolling puzzle/platformer from Anteater Games that could have easily been made in the '90s, but it still provides an interesting challenge that will appeal to modern gamers.\n\nCamera obscura, which is Latin for “dark chamber," is both an accurate description of early box cameras and also a metaphor for the gloomy tower in which the game takes place. As the story begins, you take control of an unnamed protagonist armed only with a magical camera that can manipulate the environment. The protagonist enters a giant, mysterious tower that stretches far into the sky and proceeds to ascend to the top. It's unknown why the tower exists and why it was abandoned, but you can uncover the secrets by finding pictures scattered throughout the environment.\n\nAt its core, Camera Obscura is a very challenging platformer that requires pixel-perfect precision in both movement and jumps. Since the protagonist moves at a jogging pace, it's easy to fall off small platforms to your doom or mistime jumps. Fortunately, there's an endless supply of lives, and you usually respawn close to where you died. Additional challenge is provided by enemies like deadly slime creatures and flying bats that instantly kill players when they're touched. When you add the Afterimage mechanic to the mix, the resulting difficulty may have you cursing your screen so much that neighbors will wonder if you have Tourette Syndrome.\n\nOne button press is all it takes to initiate the innovative Afterimage flash effect that clones the environment for a few seconds. When this occurs, the player can move to the side or jump up or down to move the Afterimage in the same direction. This process can create bridges to run on or steps to climb, freeze moving platforms, and even trap or crush enemies. It seems like a simple concept, but the Afterimage can be used in a wide variety of ways that depend on your imagination. Since the effect only lasts for a few seconds, the chance of making a mistake is greatly amplified, especially when trying to rush through a level.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game has 57 maps that take place both inside and outside of the tower. Players can earn one bronze, silver, or gold medal for each map depending on the time it takes to finish a map and one medal for how many afterimage flashes they used. Replaying maps to earn gold medals helps to extend the game's length for perfectionists and anyone who desires a difficult challenge. In addition, any player can utilize the user-friendly level editor to create and upload maps to further extend the replay value.\n\nAlthough the retro visuals are pixelated, they still look very cool. The blocky aesthetic of the main environments remind me of Dig Dug, but with more stylish and detailed backgrounds. I also appreciate the beautiful soundtrack that puts me in a mellow mood with its cathartic melodies. It's just too bad that, just like exploring any dark room, a few bugs tarnish the experience. My biggest gripe is how customized controls reset to their default setup every time the game is launched. Other launch problems include low framerates and random crashes.\n\nCamera Obscura is definitely a niche game with simplistic gameplay, but it has a certain charm that will captivate anyone who gives it a try.","May 10","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Casual gamers like the simplicity, core gamers love the novelty, and both groups appreciate the low price. Camera Obscura is a side-scrolling puzzle/platformer from Anteater Games that could have easily been made in the '90s, but it still provides an interesting challenge that will appeal to modern gamers.\n\nCamera obscura, which is Latin for “dark chamber," is both an accurate description of early box cameras and also a metaphor for the gloomy tower in which the game takes place. As the story begins, you take control of an unnamed protagonist armed only with a magical camera that can manipulate the environment. The protagonist enters a giant, mysterious tower that stretches far into the sky and proceeds to ascend to the top. It's unknown why the tower exists and why it was abandoned, but you can uncover the secrets by finding pictures scattered throughout the environment.\n\nAt its core, Camera Obscura is a very challenging platformer that requires pixel-perfect precision in both movement and jumps. Since the protagonist moves at a jogging pace, it's easy to fall off small platforms to your doom or mistime jumps. Fortunately, there's an endless supply of lives, and you usually respawn close to where you died. Additional challenge is provided by enemies like deadly slime creatures and flying bats that instantly kill players when they're touched. When you add the Afterimage mechanic to the mix, the resulting difficulty may have you cursing your screen so much that neighbors will wonder if you have Tourette Syndrome.\n\nOne button press is all it takes to initiate the innovative Afterimage flash effect that clones the environment for a few seconds. When this occurs, the player can move to the side or jump up or down to move the Afterimage in the same direction. This process can create bridges to run on or steps to climb, freeze moving platforms, and even trap or crush enemies. It seems like a simple concept, but the Afterimage can be used in a wide variety of ways that depend on your imagination. Since the effect only lasts for a few seconds, the chance of making a mistake is greatly amplified, especially when trying to rush through a level.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game has 57 maps that take place both inside and outside of the tower. Players can earn one bronze, silver, or gold medal for each map depending on the time it takes to finish a map and one medal for how many afterimage flashes they used. Replaying maps to earn gold medals helps to extend the game's length for perfectionists and anyone who desires a difficult challenge. In addition, any player can utilize the user-friendly level editor to create and upload maps to further extend the replay value.\n\nAlthough the retro visuals are pixelated, they still look very cool. The blocky aesthetic of the main environments remind me of Dig Dug, but with more stylish and detailed backgrounds. I also appreciate the beautiful soundtrack that puts me in a mellow mood with its cathartic melodies. It's just too bad that, just like exploring any dark room, a few bugs tarnish the experience. My biggest gripe is how customized controls reset to their default setup every time the game is launched. Other launch problems include low framerates and random crashes.\n\nCamera Obscura is definitely a niche game with simplistic gameplay, but it has a certain charm that will captivate anyone who gives it a try.","May 10","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had to delete the local content after trying to download custom levels, because even when I uninstalled, reinstalled, and restarted, it fails to recognize any custom levels even when the game loads.

Luckily, all progress is (or can be) saved to cloud storage.\n\nWhen the game DOES work, it's rough, but for the most part an interesting challenge; besides the basic "get to the exit" goal, there are speed and "fewest number of flashes" medals awarded per level, plus bonus mementos to find.\n\nThe biggest problem is the flashes, though. I normally get motion-sick when playing 3-D games, so it surprised me that I started to feel nauseated after playing a basic 2-D platformer for about an hour. I can only figure it's from using the camera flash so often, so if that kind of thing bothers you, try to go easy on it.","June 1","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
