The city is well crafted with amazing little details on every corner, and main missions in general are pretty fun. Side activities are typical Ubisoft game though, kinda repetitive. Gunplay is so satisfying with great cover mechanics. Enemies (factions) are varied enough with their own characteristics. I can go either solo, play with friends or go with randoms via matchmaking to do everything in this game. The leveling experience in The Division is one of the best I've ever had in an mmo(lite). I'd give the 1-30 journey a solid 9/10.\n\nAnd then I stumbled upon the endgame. The real meat of the game where I'm supposed to spend most of my time there.  CM are really a challenge, however they're kinda limited in number. It was originally okay before the incursion patch hit, but everything has changed since then. It's way harder to get crafting materials post patch, which means you need to grind your ♥♥♥ to craft your weapon/gear. Incursion is a mess, people can exploit it to beat it way easier. Massive then remove weekly rewards so people who're not exploiting are basically screwed. You may choose to not use the exploits, but you'll be left behind others, and you definitely won't stand a chance in the Dark Zone where everyone is an exploiter. If you're a competitive player, you'll have to use the exploits. The first free update is the turning point of the game for me.\n\nThe game is a mess from its core. There are too many fundamental problems while maybe can be fixed, but will need a lot of work and testing. Massive can only find the exploits after the players abusing them. And when they do fix one, players find another two exploits. Every day there's new glitches and exploits, but they can only apply a patch once a week or two. And it's been going on since day 1. They just can't keep up with the pace of people finding new glitches. And you can't blame them for finding those exploits, the game isn't supposed to have ridiculous amount of them. It's been a month and this game feels like a beta for me. The Division is probably the most squandered potential of a game in years.\n\nMassive needs a 'timeout' to totally fix their game, but sadly they don't have it. The show must go on..","April 20","false","127.3"," 691 of 779 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","691","779","18","41"

I love this game so much.  I pre-order the Gold Edition on Steam with full price.  And I've played for almost 700 hrs.  I tried and played almost every aspect of the game.  And I also constantly browsing and discussing on Division subreddit.  Frankly speaking, this is really a nice game but the devs sucks.\n\n+ Really nice graphic.  Although SnowDrop is a new game engine, the graphic still looks awesome.\n+ Cover system is good for 3rd-person shooter.\n+ Neat and clean UI design.  Informative but minimal design.\n\n- Connection problem as always.  UBI servers are really bad that even worse in MMO.\n- Cheaters and hackers everywhere.  No matter you're playing in PVP or PVE, there are TONS of cheaters makes the game totally unplayable.\n- Looting and crafting system are jokes.  You may get nothing worthy for about 4 hours play since the loot drop is awful and the crafting requirements are unreasonable in some way.\n- The end-game is tedious.  Maybe it's just because this is a new game, the lacking of end-game content makes you get bored very soon.\n- The new gamemode, Incursion, design is quite bad.  Very small map with 15 waves of overlevel enemies only.\n- The PVP is totally unplayable due to cheating.  And the elite enemies distribution is unbalanced and the rewards are not scale up with the difficulty.  Everyone level up in DZ03, and nobody go to DZ06 since the rewards are almost the same as DZ01.\n- Currently there is no cheat detection system implemented.  They try to find cheaters manually and it's inefficiency and inaccurate.\n- The ban is also a joke.  Only 3-day ban for hacking before, and now it's only 14-day ban.  Cheaters still cheating.\n- Lots of game breaking glitches and bugs.\n\nUbisoft ruined almost everything.  And the support is really slow and unhelpful.  I submitted a ticket to UBI support on 20th April, and got response on 6th May with unhelpful answer.  Moreover, lots of problems/suggestions on Reddit were discussed.  Redditors pinpoint the issues and even provide possible solutions.  But devs never listen.  Lots of game breaking issues are not fixed.\n\nActually I quit this game on 20th April, 2016.  After a month later, there's still no improvement in Division.  So I totally cannot recommend this game although I want to.\n\nGood game, bad devs.\n\n--\n\n史上最差的遊戲。\n\n別誤會，我很喜歡這款遊戲，我在Steam預購了黃金版，而遊戲時數接近七百小時，我嘗試並接觸過遊戲所有部分，同時我也常常在Reddit上參與討論。坦白講，這是一款好遊戲，但是爛開發商。\n\n+ 十分優異的畫面表現，雖然SnowDrop是個新引擎，但是整體畫面看起來很棒。\n+ 掩體系統在第三人稱射擊很方便上手。\n+ 簡潔乾淨的介面設計，適時的提供必要資訊卻又不會雜亂。\n\n- 連線一樣老問題，UBI的伺服器實在是很差，尤其在這種強調多人連線的遊戲內更嚴重。\n- 各種外掛作弊滿街跑，不論你玩PVP還是PVE，到處都是外掛跟作弊，讓整個遊戲幾乎無法正常進行。\n- 掉落跟製作系統是個笑話，常常會打了四小時結果拿到的都是無用的垃圾，而製作材料需求設計又非常的誇張不合理。\n- 貧乏的封頂內容，或許因為這是個新遊戲，但貧乏的內容讓你滿等後很快就會感到無聊。\n- 新模式，襲擊，設計的頗差，只是一個非常小的地圖搭配15波超強的越等敵人而已。\n- 到處都是外掛，PVP幾乎無法玩，而PVP的菁英敵人部屬非常不平衡，且獎勵也沒有隨難度提高，所有人都擠在暗區03升級，然後根本沒有人要去暗區06，因為獎勵跟暗區01差不多爛。\n- 目前為止遊戲內完全沒有作弊偵測的系統，他們嘗試用人工的方式找作弊玩家，但非常沒效率而且不準確。\n- 停權機制也是個笑話，之前抓到作弊只停權三天，現在提高了也只是十四天而已，作弊的仍然繼續作弊。\n- 還有一堆讓遊戲完全無法正常運行的漏洞和bug。\n\nUbisoft幾乎毀掉了所有東西，而且官方客服效率極差，我4/20的時候提交了一個問題給官方客服，到5/6才收到回覆，而且回覆內容官腔又沒幫助。此外，在Reddit上很多人討論了許多潛在問題，並提出了可能的修改方式與建議，但官方幾乎都沒有採用，許多誇張的bug仍然沒有修正。\n\n事實上，我在2016年4月20日就沒有再開過這款遊戲，現在過了一個月，看起來仍然沒有改進，因此雖然我很喜歡，但我仍然無法推薦這款。\n\n好遊戲，爛公司。","May 5","false","699.5"," 590 of 707 people (83%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","83","590","707","37","49"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vallkyrie/recommended/365590/","Vallkyrie","Edelweiss ✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vallkyrie/","227 products in account","I almost wrote a review about a week after the game came out, singing its praises.  I waited, because that's not exactly a smart decision to review so fast.\n\nAt this point I'm going to say be very very cautious of this game.  Massive clearly is having a very difficult time making even the most basic stats, abilities, and items work like they are intended.  Every day over at /r/TheDivision it's a new adventure of "What did Massive ♥♥♥♥ up today?"  New patches don't fix things so much as they break even more things and nerf the rest.  You cannot 'trust' this game's stats and info, much of it is either false or does the opposite of what it says.\n\nGot a piece of gear that gives damage resistence from elite mobs? It actually increases the damage you take.  Got a perk that increases the damage you take for a bit as a tradeoff for more damage output? It actually increases your resistences.   Plenty of other healing exploits as well to give yourself infinite regen.  DPS and gearscore values are also completly arbitrary and cannot be trusted.  There was even a bug that messed up some players' inventories, a bug with a backpack, that locked them out of the game on their character for 3 weeks.\n\nEven the mobile cover ability is root of every exploit the game has had since release, yet the ability remains unchanged. at the very least it should be removed until fixed.  I even used it to climb an invisible ladder out of the map and complete the new incursion by myself without getting hit.  Hacking is apparently stupid easy to do as well, with large numbers of people that can fly, teleport, never run out of ammo, and fire 10 trillion rounds per minute.\n\nNone of these bugs get the attention they need in any timely manner, but as soon as the devs find out that one too many yellow items are dropping from a mob, that gets body slammed in a patch within a day, if not hours.\n\nThe game does have lots of good points though.  The story is weak, but the lore is quite strong and interesting. The visuals are excellent, especially the scale and weather patterns. Gunplay is solid and weapon variety is rather nice.  Plenty of clothes to pick up and wear means plenty of variety in other agents.  The game's performance is also really good on a variety of hardware.  Sadly most of these get overridden by Massive's failure to handle the RPG and loot mechanics/stats, as well as the game's biggest feature, the Dark Zone, which doesn't drop relevant gear and can be filled with cheating or exploiting groups of players.\n\nDo I regret buying this? Not really, I enjoyed playing to level cap with some pals, finding the lore, getting basic loot.  But all that stops at the end of the game.   What happened to the Massive Entertainment that made World in Conflict? Can we have them back please? I'd happily give this game a thumbs up if I could only trust the game's data and abilities/perks.  And it would be nice if I could trust the people updating the game as well.","April 24","false","133.5"," 220 of 244 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","220","244","8","10"

Done. Right.\n\nNot at all the epic open-world RPG experience they advertised it to be. Not. At. All.\n\nLong Review Ahead\nFirst, and to get it out of the way, bugs and crashes are everywhere. There hasn't been a single session where I haven't had a CTD. Not THAT frequent, like others have experienced, but still there and annoying. Also, classic U-Play sh*tty "Delta" errors kicking you off the game for no reason. Classic U-Play issues - won't comment more on that.\n\n\nThe Problems\n1. Character Creation: Expect to see clones of your character EVERYWHERE. This is perhaps the MOST limited character creation I have seen in an RPG. Whether male or female, you get to choose between 5 preset faces, 5 hairstyles, a few ugly neck tattoos, and, worst of all, accessories. Yes, accessories. Instead of accessories (such as glasses) being in-game gear, they are considered a part of character creation. It's unbelievable how they made such a development decision. That means that if you choose any type of accessory for your character, for example sun-glasses, you have to stick with them forever. You can't take them off. Ugly face-paint included. It's simply ridiculous. (Don't be surprised if they ask you to pay for a character remake in the future).\n\n2. Missions: Boring and repetitive. There are no more than 12 main missions lasting 15 minutes to 1 hour each to complete on hard, depending on the group. That's the real gameplay. Everything else advertised as "side-missions" is plain bull*♥♥♥♥. These side-missions are 4 missions recycling themselves all over the map. Worst part is that they are not exactly "side" since in order to level up and unlock abilities, you actually have to spam them. Also, they are the unimaginative missions you would expect and have seen in every RPG: rescue the hostages, activate the water supply, defend/hold the area, capture the stronghold. These recycle themselves all over the map and become a chore after finishing them for the second time. IF these unnecessary grinding missions didn't exist - the actual gameplay would be 5 hours tops with the Main Missions.\n\n3. AI and NPCs:  Disgusting. I have encountered 5 or maybe 6 different models of enemies throughout the whole game, all named Alex for some reason ("They got/killed Alex!"). It's basically the usual hoodie/thug model, a stormtrooper model, and a fat boss model. Sometimes you see these weird snipers with a cape that came straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie. It's impossible to distinguish between the different enemy "factions." Only reason you can tell a Cleaner from one of the other guys (yes, that's how bad the story is: I don't even know their name) is the flamethrowers they have.\n-Civilian NPCs engaging in the same 3 behaviours (silly fighting betwen each other, limbing, coughing and dying) all over the map. Also they run like stupid in the middle of gun fights.\n-Store Clerks in the Base of Operations spamming "Come closer" "I have the best deals" all the time even when remotely close to them - simply annoying and shows how no testing went behind the game.\n\n4. Difficulty: A joke. No real mechanics or skills needed to beat anything on hard since the game is a cheat on high difficulties. That is, enemies, other than being even more spongy, are also suicide-crazed shotgun wielders. They just charge at you from behind and 1-shot you without even seeing them (let's not forget the ridiculous spawning out of thin-air - especially in the Dark Zone). Further, you also get these annoying snipers poking their little spongy head behind cover. If you are found off-cover for 1 sec, you get insta killed out of nowhere, forcing you to spam in-and-out of cover between their shots in order to stay alive. Fights against sniper-bosses are an irritating 2-hour long peek-and-shoot game where being out of cover for an extra second means death. It goes like this: Enemy pokes head out quickly to shoot | you have a chance to shoot 2-3 bullets first that do almost no damage before being shot at | you return behind cover ASAP. If you don't, you die with 1 shot. And repeat for 1 and a half hours.\n\n5. Map: Quite small. Taking under consideration that 1/3 of it is the Dark Zone, the rest is divided in small areas that only seem large because you are forced to jog/walk around the map. Copy-pasted apartment interiors/exteriors are all over the place. Every part on NY feels the same, however, overall graphics: They are good for a 2016 title - ruined by a bad story.\n\n6. Story: Boring, characterless, unmemorable, rushed, and confusing. Stuff don't make sense, although that's to be expected since you get spammed with all that information since the very beggining. You walk around while getting audio feedback on what to do, then you somehow trigger another side-mission on the map and the old audio stops and a new character starts talking and telling you stuff. It's a huge confusion. No logic. Characters are all forgetable and generic. It's just rushed.\n\n6b. LITERALLY NO END GAME. All you get is a daily mission that has you repeat a mission you've already done and endless grinding to do in the DZ to get slightly better gear.\n\n7. Dark Zone:  As far as I can tell, the DZ punishes rogue agents so harshly that nobody actually goes rogue and kills others. Once I got jumped by 3 rogue agents, got behind cover and killed them all. All other instances were friendly/cautious people helping. Worst part about the DZ is how enemies spawn behind you out of nowhere, making a solo extraction almost impossible.\n\n8. Money milking:  Game is barely 2 weeks out and I just found out they are already selling clothing on the U-Play store for 4-GBP (5 euro?) each. And guess what. Gold Edition owners don't get sh*t for free. EDIT - Pre-order people were screwed badly: All pre-order "EXCLUSIVES" are now given away for money to anyone. Way to go GreedSoft.\n\n9. The icing on the cake: Since the release of the Closed Beta I expressed my negative opinions of the game on the Steam Forums. Long story short, I got banned by an Ubisoft moderator. After contacting Steam since it seemed like a hate-ban, a Steam representative actually investigated the issue and told me that he wouldn't have issued a ban since I didn't violate any agreements, asking me to contact Ubisoft because he can't do anything about it. Of course, before contacting Ubisoft, I asked the Ubi-moderator in the appeal section as to what did I do wrong, never to get a reply for him, making me threaten him that I will contact Ubisoft if he keeps ignoring me. After I got no reply, I contacted Ubisoft and after days of waiting, they somehow reached and scolded the Ubisoft Steam Moderator who, in the end, let the ban remain as is. After the ban was over, I returned to the forums and asked a question, only to receive another ban for "trolling" from a 1 month old post regarding the Beta on the EXACT same thread he issued the last ban! So, he bans me RIGHT after the last ban ends again for a second time. Apparently, the guy got mad at me for contacting his employers and decided to ban me again, without replying in my second appeal and without explaining the reason, other than writing "trolling" as an excuse. If you are seeing this, this is why you are and always will be stuck in this dead-end job.\n\n\nI can go on and on, but I am out of characters left. Forgettable, flawed, and mediocre. It's clearly evident how "The Division" turned out to be just a really really good marketing job. Expected, since all we got until the very last minute were actor trailers, a limited Beta, and no actual gameplay footage.\n\nCan only recommend this after two years on a -75% bundle with all the DLC's. Which by then, the game will be empty and dead.","March 20","false","61.7"," 2,573 of 3,308 people (78%) found this review helpful 212 people found this review funny","78","573","3","212","194"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002524847/recommended/365590/","76561198002524847","Space Viking","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002524847/","168 products in account","When it has all been said and done, I think most reviews and the criticisms of the The Division are warranted.\n\nTo sum it up in a nutshell, The Division is to gaming history, the most wasted potential videogame of all-time.  It has an excellent premise, but it is poorly executed in not only gameplay, but story, environmental and level design, and NPC interactions, or lack thereof.\n\nThe lack of an anti-cheat system leaves you wondering what Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft were thinking during the planning, strategy, and conceptualization stages of development.  Not only do hackers or players without a conscience continue to exploit this game, Massive has denounced a statement saying that an anti-cheat system is basically out of the question because "we would need to build this game from the ground up again."\n\nUnlike some other The Division early adopters, I was never butt-hurt by the E3 gameplay, or the mad and sickening hype.  Unfortunately for me, I do not understand why some blatantly obvious game designs were not in this game.\n\nThe streets of New York City is barren, even as pre-apocalyptic or apocalyptic world.  Ubisoft and Massive should have opted for a ficticious city instead of a realistic New York.  Trading a videogame fantasy world for a more realistic one is one of the major drawbacks to The Division's level and environmental design.  The problem with this is, you have very little to work with because the developer tried too hard to be true to New York City's landscape, leaving little to the imagination.\n\nThe loot system is severely flawed.  The "Gear Rating System" Massive has in place is misleading.  For example, a player can have a gear rating of 204, but have less damage per second, health, or skill power than a player with a gear rating of 190.  Basically put, the gear rating is skewed and distorted.\n\nI may not know everything about MMO-like or MMO videogames, but I have played my fair share.  In that, I have some credibility as a gamer who once appreciated MMOs and especially MMO-RPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft (golden days), Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, Guild Wars 1 and 2, and modern ones like The Secret World.  While I draw comparisons, I want to say that the MMOs I mentioned at least tried to bring in new game mechanics and MMO worlds that brought "something new" and most importantly, fun gameplay and loot. The Division features loot as guns and "gear," which in some sense it does well.  The character design is pretty to look at and the clothing, equipment, and armor all look great aethestically but nothing more.\n\nThe Division relies heavily on crafting and farming Pheonix credits which you would then trade in to a vendor to purchase new weapons, equipment, or blueprints.  At the moment, players have to rely too heavily on crafting gear in order to take on the only incursion we have in the game.  Daily assignments are few and far in between, so you would have to complete the daily assignments for Pheonix credits every day in order to rack up hundreds of credits to purchase the gun or blueprint that you need to pack any kind of punch for an incursion.  *Massive did state with a recent update that they are attempting to remedy this issue.  We will see about that.\n\nMMOs have instances or dungeons and this is typically the meat of the endgame where players farm for loot or gear.  Ubisoft/Massive "gave" us an Incursion called "The Falcon: Lost" as a free update.  This is the problem and plague of the current situation of the videogame industry.  "FREE UPDATES" and what is it, really?  The base game of The Division before the Incursion update was barebones as you can get.  Very little content, as in, a few missions, and nodes on the map that would give you vertigo, thinking about Assassin's Creed's nodes on the map that induced OCD.  This is probably the most shallow aspect of the game besides its story and NPC interaction in story mode.\n\nOn another note, The Division lacks any sense of threat.  You never feel like the city is lost in shambles; not even in the Dark Zone, which is suppose to be the darkest corners of the game.  Like I have said before, the game design falls short immediately when the player does not feel any sense of threat, urgency, and motivation to bring cause and effect to attention.  Because simply, there is none.  And that in itself is a sad fact of the game.\n\nThe Dark Zone is lackluster, full of hackers, and wasted potential.  In DZ, you are doing the same thing over and over, and if you are expecting the dynamic of human vs human or PVP interaction in the same vein of DayZ and like games, you will be very disappointed.  There are too many hackers.  The punishment and reward system is severely flawed and it does not reward co-op players.  One simple rule, as with past MMOs or MMO-like games is simply this: ADD A PVP TOGGLE ON OR OFF OPTION.  It is that fvking simple.\n\nYou may be wondering why I have invested so many hours in The Division and have the audacity to "thumbs down" the game in such hypocritical fashion.  It's quite simple.  I review games after I have given enough game time, especially when it is an MMO-like-style game.  It is only fair.  After a handful of updates with the addition of the "free" incursion, and Massive's inability to resolve the glaring issues in the game, I cannot recommend it to anyone at this price point.  I cannot even recommend the game for $1 because it would be a waste of your time.  You are better off spending your time doing other things.  Seriously.  I mean this sincerely.\n\nI could keep writing, going in to "massive" detail about what should and should not be in The Division, but it would be an overwhelming task that only my mind can understand at the moment.  Most players would agree that The Division is a huge wasted potential.  The proportionality of negative to positive reviews is not only valid, but almost sound if you were to ever experience such disappointment without reconciliation of the fact you just wasted not only your hard earned cash, but also your valuable time.\n\nVerdict:  Not recommended.  Avoid until Massive and Ubisoft implements an anti-cheat system and addresses and resolves several issues in the game.  While I understand this is Massive's first roundabout at an MMO-like game.  It comes with its own challenges and complexities which deviate from the standard and traditional single-player and multiplayer affair.  Even though I cut Massive some slack on that front, there are far too many minor and obvious issues Massive continues to overlook, which leaves me to question their approach and strategy to fix some of the game's many problems.","May 7","false","108.1"," 236 of 276 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","236","276","7","14"

The fact that they fixed their server problem in less than a day is fine by me. I've seen many games launch and not be playable for a week (diablo 3?)\n\n2) Uplay sucks... how? I clicked the copy code to clipboard button when steam prompted me to, uplay asked for code, i pressed ctrl+v and hit enter, division launched and played just fine. I have not had to open Uplay once in order to play this game so how this is a problem I don't know.\n\n3) Graphics suck... ummm get a better card? I have a GTX970 and am playing 55+ fps on average with dips down to about 40 with a lot going on outside at 1440p. BTW the game looks amazing in 1440p.\n\n4) Grinding for gear... well yeah genius, if you couldn't figure out from the OPEN beta and countless of youtube videos and news articles that this was similar to destiny or diablo in its kill badguy to get better loot to kill harder badguy game then you're an idiot. Don't buy a genre you dont like.\n\n5) AI is bad... It's an RPG style cover based shooter where the AI uses the cover. yes they will pop their head out to shoot at you after a few seconds. Oddly enough this is exactly what you are doing after you reload, does this make you a bad player? Does the AI act like a real human in any other RPG you've played?\n\nNow that that is out of the way, this game has been out less than a day. I can't say if this is something I am going to play for months or not, but I have enjoyed it so far and have had no reason to give it a bad review. If I decide the game actually is bad in a week or so I will revisit this and add an edit to the end. If this is the last line you see then I still feel like its a good game and not anywhere near as bad as people are making it out to be.\n\n~~~\nI did not realize everyone on steam was going to read/comment on this. I will edit this review with actual opinion about the game once I have completed the main story and put some more time into it.\n\nFinished the main story and got BoO to 100% in just over 38 hours played. (happened almost at the same time do to my completionist play style)\n\nSo far the only negatives I have are that microphone is defaulted to voice sensetivity rather than PTT which is annoying but I can mute people. Dark zone feels lackluster, roaming mobs and stationairy groups at the landmarks. other than that there isnt much to do in the DZ unless you go rogue and kill other players. The side missions and encounters were almost all carbon copies of one another which I suppose could get boring. realiztically there are a limited number of them total so its only repetative for a little while. I enjoyed the story. The amount of content included is more than enough to get you to max level. I hit level 30 after completing the final mission and I have only a few side missions and encouters to do. I wont go too much into gameplay because if you are reading this, chances are you have seen some gameplay on youtube and my typing is not going to describe it nearly as well as a video can. I'm looking forward to gearing up for what is to come and playing new content as it comes out.\n\nMaybe I will update this as more content is realeased. If you are reading this I decided not to since youtube will pretty much have you covered.\n~~~","March 8","true","143.3"," 5,015 of 6,816 people (74%) found this review helpful 436 people found this review funny","74","015","6","436","282"

It is full of deception.\n\nIn the first 20 hours, you survive alone in ruin NYC, everything seems to be new, attracting and challenging.\n\nAnd then you get to lvl 30.\n\nYou enter the DZ, get killed by all kinds of cheaters and hostile players. It sucks.\n\nYou try to clear Daily Missions, have equipment with better GS, spends hours on a stupid Challenge Mission. It is stupid, because the golden gear of lvl 182 is nothing comparing to the new gear set in the new mission, which is too hard that those who made it can't pass it in one try. And it will soon get out-of-time in no time.\n\nAnd Ubisoft have run the game perfectly against the normal player, fixing every bug that make players grow quickly in a rush while leaving those cheaters as the king of the world. Not to mention the spam message in the public channel and the awful potato servers with frequent disconnect, lag and error.\n\nThe biggest sadness is that when you realize all of this, you have passed the refund time.\nThat's why I call it deception.\n\nGeneral Score:\n\n0/10 Not recommend\n\n+4 Great Story\n\n+4 Great TPS experience\n\n-8 Ubisoft running, no anti-cheating mechanism, terrible servers with force Internet links\n\nPS: I won't purchase any Ubisoft game again. (I would use pirate copies if the game were really attracting.)\n\nUpdate 27/4/2016:\n\nRecently I saw Ubisoft's efforts against cheating by moving some of the mechanism from local clients to the servers, such as reload clip. In a way it makes the game more "realistic": your weapons may stuck time to time and you can't reload or shoot for a few second. In fact it is only caused by lag. I save those complaints and let you friends imagine what will happened if your weapon failed in a war zone.\n\nI have heard that the designers put some parts of calculating on local clients to relieve the bundle of servers, which is the source of unstoppable cheating. Now they wanna correct it by moving them online step by step. Let us see if the newest gourmet from France are fried potato chips.\n\nUpdate 15/05/2016: Have you ever eaten any ****? This game will be the precious experience for you. The most desperate thing is that you can't shoot, can't heal yourself, can't use first-aids, no DPS to the enemies but they can still shoot you dead. THAT is the worst thing in the game even for a gamer spent hundreds of hours on it.\n\nUpdate 25/05/2016: Update 1.2 is alive. The boring daily&weekly are removed, instead, a much boring system of daily and weekly is live now. I don't see any need to do these search&destry things, just a set of mission done before. Haven't done new missions yet.

They constantly screw it up with bugs, broken patches, no anti-cheat, failure to perma ban hackers, missing dailies, untested content full of exploits just to name a few. You can hardly say they are doing their job well if you pay any attention to this or any of the other releases they have put out in recent years.\n\nThe things I list are not even opinions, the lazyness and non-support for the game has allowed hackers to continue to run rampant.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tagord96/recommended/365590/","Tagord96","Tagord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tagord96/","49 products in account","Ok, SO i have played this game for a crazy amount of time. and i will say the game is really great, although the game is boring at the begining / middle area of the game and the boss are very repetitive the last few missions of the game show extreme potential and are extreme fun and challenging. I have completed the game and pretty much tested everything. so i guess i can atempt to list some of the things i found awesome and some not.\n\nAwesome Stuff\n1. Challenging Difficulty is freaking insane, it isnt just a small step above hard its a very large jump, it gives you a challenge and there is no way in hell you are just picking this up at fresh 30 and just farming your ♥♥♥ some Superior items unless you're the dankest memer the world has ever seen.\n\n2. Final mission, Without spoiling to much its very difficult ( if you do it on hard solo ) and shows extreme potential for raid content and variety in the game instead of just shooting bosses or hitting T and just holding yourr left click.\n\n3. Darkzone, The darkzone is crazy cool and the concept is rich with potential,  only complaint is it kinda encourages you to just stealthly betray people rather than full on pvp. But the PVE aspects are great and the rush from getting your first High grade item and trying to evac it is just great.\n\n4. The content seems to be planned on a consistent basis. we can hope that they stick to it but for now they have already planned out the first 3 expacs for this game, only downside is you gotta pay for them or the season pass.\n\nBad things in the game?\n\n1. It is really hard for players that do the game solo, its very doable but if you're not good at shooters its not going to be that easy, they do have the matchmaking system but lets be honest past the first few first months of this game the lower levels wont be able to do much match making.\n\n2.  Until about level 25 the game is a cake walk, and the content is pretty repetitive, at the start you are immersed and loving them game and then you get to id say about level 10 and its just boring for the next 15 levels. ( luckily its fast leveling )\n\n3. pvp exists but its not instance based or really encouraged. having something like a battleground or arena or something of this nature would help the pvp driven players find that thing that is missing, darkzone pvp is stale and boring and no body wants to lose xp or coins right now so yeah.\n\n4. Its 60$ plus another like 30$ for the season pass. In this day in age your game better have some craaaazy content to be 60$, For instance not even WoW does 60$ expansions anymore, its  just not a good idea. Especially with the content in game right now i dont think this game is 60$ value, in june or so, maybe, Because then we get a new expansion.\n\nOK The last thing i would like to bring to late is the idiots saying this game is repetitive and server crash issues are stupid etc etc. Its repetitive because its an MMO with shooter aspects, not the other way around. If you look at every single MMO out there, it is repetitive, even the sandbox mmos have repetition. Server crash issues should be expected the first day a game is out, its server flooding and the beta as good as it was doesnt really give you a 100% sure idea when a game comes out, most games experience lag and dcs day one or in first few hours. Now that the game is a few days old servers are fine and gameplay is really smooth.

After about 50 hours play time you're able to complete missions on thge challenging level on your own.\n- the cost-benefit ratio is terrible. At least for me. I payed EUR 89.00 for the game (including a season pass) affective  play time was 195h wich is EUR 0.45/h.\n\nAfter several encounters with hackers in the PVP zone (Dark-Zone) the game started to frustrate me. So I stopped playing. If you don't know which kind of hacks I've already experienced and seem to be common, here is a list:\n- aim bot\n- wall hack\n- teleport\n- speed hack\n- no clip\n- flying around\n\nFor me the negative points outweigh the positive ones.\nTherefor my rating for the game is negative right now.\n\nIf Ubisoft can fix the hacking problem I might rejoin the game. If not, I won't.","April 30","false","197.6"," 153 of 190 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","153","190","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnjiao/recommended/365590/","johnjiao","Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnjiao/","129 products in account","It took me a long time, several days of play time, to come to this conclusion.\n\nThe Division is, in no way, a *bad* game. It is, however, aggressively mediocre. It is forgettable, deeply flawed, and a huge missed opportunity.\n\nThe first thing I want to get to is the Dark Zone -- it is, in both practice and concept, a horrible experience. The best gear in the game, ostensibly the goal for most people playing an RPG, is gated behind an experience that relishes having other players steal your hard-earned loot. I literally would have zero problem with this IF there were a way to get that kind of gear elsewhere in PvE, but there is not. The stance of the developers and some fans of "well nut up and play the game or go away" on this is simply insulting. Why they would put this DayZ/Rust-style anarchy as the center of endgame is beyond me.\n\nThe next big issue: enemy variety. There IS none. I have now played almost 18 hours of this game, and I have encountered FIVE kinds of enemy total: 1) hoodie wearing thug with a pistol, 2) hoodie wearing thug with a baseball bat, 3) cleaner (a faction focused on burning out the infection) with a flamethrower, 4) cleaner with a riot shield, 5) bullet sponge boss. This is absolutely *absurd*, and downright embarassing. EIGHTEEN HOURS in, and I've been killing hundreds of the exact same mob, apparently all named Alex because the line "THEY GOT/KILLED ALEX" is chirped ad nauseum by the braindead AI.\n\nNext: the story. PATHETIC. Your character is mute, and thus far in the game (18 hours of play) I've met four main characters, only one of which has had more than ~1 minute of talking time. A doctor, a security chief, a "quirky" technician, and a fellow Division agent. Where's this story going? Who knows! What's my driving force to continue? Who knows! It's as if the writers threw their hands in the air and said "well nobody is playing this game for the story anyway, right?" -- wrong. For a game that clearly blew so much budget on making a cinematic story experience, it's simply sad how flat on their faces it fell. In all the story missions I've done, there's no exposition except through some radio chatter, you never meet any of the bosses (they all have generic names and tons of HP), etc etc etc\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for me is just how mind-numbingly boring it can be to play alone. Matchmaking is only available while in a "safe house" hub, where you are sharded with 5-6 other players (most of which are AFK), and even then matchmaking is only available for story missions. If you wanted to explore and do side quests, you would need to try and matchmake under "Free Roam", which nobody queues for. So you do most of the side content alone, and you NEED to do side content because the story missions are spaced so far apart in level that you couldn't seamlessly go from one to the next.\n\nI think the true issue behind The Division is that you feel unimportant. You are simply a *drone*. The entire First Wave of agents died or went missing (SPOILER for the first 5 minutes of the game, I'm the worst), and you could go missing too and they would just send more. You get so little money for completing missions and for selling the loot you acquire that you feel like you can't buy anything. It's a 40-ish hour slog (if you play comfortably rather than powergame) to the top, and then you just pull your hair out in frustration over the gimmicks of The Dark Zone.\n\nI hate number rating systems because of how they boil down complex opinions into highly subjective numbers, but if I had to rate this I would give it a 6/10. It's a solid concept, much like Destiny was, but the delivery falls flat in a pitiable way. It needs a *lot* of work, and it needs it yesterday.\n\n\nEdit: I feel it's important to be honest and amend my initial review with one fact -- the best gear *is* available outside the Dark Zones. The caveat is that the acquisition rate is absurdly lower.

The April update brought incursions and more daily and weekly assignments which made a better end game, but the end game still feels bland and repetitive. While the paid expansions coming later in the year might fix the end game, I can't recommend a game that makes you grind for better look so you can grind easier. The darkzone is filled with hackers who can increase their damage output to take all of your loot, so until Ubisoft fixes the hacker issue, you are stuck to PvE alone or with a group of up to four. I recommend you wait until Ubisoft releases more endgame activities, or until Ubi releases more end game PvE missions.\n\nVerdict: Wait for a sale, or until Ubi adds more content/fixes the PvP.  I cannot currently recommend this game as it feels like the end game was rushed and unfinished.","May 7","false","117.2"," 82 of 97 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","82","97","5","1"

You and your other 2 friends have just entered the Dark Zone. It is a cold winter night and there is a high amount of snowfall. Visibility is reduced to only a couple of feet in front of you. As your group trudges along the garbage and body filled streets in the center of the epidemic, you hear a faint noise. It starts to sound like the sound of muffled gunshots. Curiosity got the best of us and we began to search out this noise. After a few minutes of trying to navigate the blizzard and small alley ways we finally made it to the point of origin of the said noises. Dead silence... We walk into the middle of what seemed to be an extraction zone when we realized we had just sprung a group of Rogue agents trap.\n\nGunshots ring out. Blind cover fire goes out. We are in the middle of a large open area like sitting ducks. We start to panic and got the adrenaline pumping sensation as we frantically try to seek cover. With little to no cover available we are quickly picked off by the well positioned and well equipped Rogues we have heard so much about.\n\nWe sadly accepted our defeat and returned to the nearest Dark Zone checkpoint. At this point, it felt as if the blizzard would never end, as we continued to push our way through the dark zone. We sought out a small contaminated zone, located inside an underground parking garage. As we approached, what a sight we saw. The 3 dirty Rogue agents that killed us were sitting at a loot crate we had wanted. It seemed like they were checking the stats on the new items they had acquired giving us an opportunity.\n\n"Are we going to do this?"\n\n"Heck yes."\n\nWe lined up our shots and promptly dropped what seemed as the groups pointman. A ring went out announcing the betrayal of our group, declaring us as Rogue agents. After finishing off the final 2 members of the enemy group we realized what this meant. Everyone. Would. Be. After. Us.\n\nWithin minutes several others were chasing after us. We held out as long as possible in the parking garage. Our squad was working like clockwork, reloading when others were out, providing cover fire for pinned squad mates, and working as a team. At this point, we were getting over run by agents and realized we had to keep moving. We pushed our way through the streets dropping enemy npc's as they came along and the occassional flanking agent who thought he was so clever to try to flank us alone. We reached the subway and rushed in. At this point we were full fledged rogues, creating a manhunt against us. We setup in a make-shift choke point in the subway and held off the agents there. It felt like an army was being thrown against us. Bullets whizzed by and the sound carried through the long hallways of the subway. Grenades were tossed back and forth as the shrapnel tore up both sides. As the other agents gained ground, we were pushed back, further and further. Running low on ammunition and medical supplies we had to make our stand.\n\nWe rushed out of the subway with the agents right on our tails. We ran out into the blinding daylight, where we then found ourselves, standing in the very place we were ambushed. Except, this time we were the Rogues. We were the ones taking vengeance against the others.\n\nWe held up against the small barriers around the area. Trying to conserve as much ammunition as possible, we started taking only the best of shots. Quickly enough our ammo was depleted. We had nothing. No med kits, no ammo, no grenades. We were at the end of the line. We were pressed up against the edge of the Dark Zone.  We turned to each other and realized what was going to happen. They were going to slaughter us like animals. We pulled out our pistols and braced. If we can't be the best, then we can sure as hell be the worst.\n\nThe agents flooded us. We were going against the whole server. We pushed out and we pushed hard. With pistols at aim, we made our way back to the extraction zone. Then bam, a shot rang out. I looked over to see my friend get dropped with a single sniper bullet. He looked at me and said, "Make 'em pay." My other friend and myself made our stand in the middle of the extraction zone. Another sniper shot rang out as it pierced my squadmate's leg, staggering him in the process. Then two agents came out from the subway and pegged us in the backs with a few assault rifle rounds. We turned and killed one, but quickly enough my other friend was gunned down. At that moment, I realized the errors of my way and as I looked up at the sky, the cold blue sky peaked out. The sun started to glisten and as I looked down, I saw an agent taking aim with an M1A. As he took the shot I saluted, and heard as the shot sounded out. I heard it pierce through my vest and shirt, swiftly tearing through my flesh. At that my character fell down and I was immediately swarmed by other agents. One approached me as my character was suffering and promptly said "Lights out!" as he slammed his rifle into my face.\n\nI sat there dead, waiting and looked around. The other agents all stood there saluting my team for the excellent fight we put up.\n\n...We're not agents anymore.\n\nWe're Rogues...\n\n\n\nFor the Real Review....\n\nSince alot of people are voicing problems with me simply leaving a review in the form of an ingame story, I'll put a real review to cater to the small group who have problems with the one posted above.\n\nAll in all The Division is a good game. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and am still enjoying it. There is quite a bit of activities to do, as well as exploring and the Dark Zone PVP.\n\nIn some areas, it is definitely lacking, but these things are to be expected. The map is wonderfully detailed, some of the most detail I have seen in any game, especially the accuracy. However, alot of these buildings you can enter are not used to the full potential, i.e. empty when it comes to loot and enemies.\n\nOverall I give it a 9/10\n\nBut then again, reviews are always based on personal opinion","March 12","true","219.7"," 692 of 1,031 people (67%) found this review helpful 176 people found this review funny","67","692","1","176","31"

What the hell, this guy has 90+ hours in 2 weeks and he gives a negative review to this game?\n\nWell, how can i explain this, the game PVE wise it's very repetitive, there's not really that feeling of immersion, the story lacks content, the boss fights are utterly boring just because there's no difference, all the mobs have the same classes even if they are normal,superior,elites or bosses, there isn't really that mechanic that all self intituled RPG's have, this game is just a shoot to kill.\n\nLet me explain this better, this game for a RPG, is very bugged and very badly structurized.\n\nAs the game stands now, there's no balance and there's even a lack of options to counter some of the build that players have or there isn't even a option in certain cases to counter certain builds, this in PVP wise.\n\nSome of the hardcore division fans might come and say, well you obviosly never tryed challenge mode or Dark Zone!!\nAnd for them i can say, im fulled maxed out, i have all gear high end, i have all that i wanted, but the game still feels lacking and repetitive.\n\nSo to sum it up, what can i say about this game, well this is a good game for "innocent" people, for people who just want to play with their friend and shoot to kill, nothing more.\n\nP.S.: I will wait for the new expansion coming in April with the Trade Option and the incursions to update my review, since i will no longer play "end-game content", and i will just play the division, leveling all slots, until that expansion launches.\nAnd for all the hardcore fans obseced by the division look at their budget, the time they took to create the game (5+ years), all the times they tricked us with one massive trailer where the game was amazing totally different graphics, and ok they did well lowering the pc requirements, but at least give an option to download that textures. The game is addicting but a massive letdown for all the hype. The game is not definitly worth 60 euros and even less worth more 40 euros for the dlc's right now.","March 23","false","101.9"," 817 of 1,222 people (67%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","67","817","1","44","46"

Honestly, it did in some ways, however, i peaked my interest enough for me to play for 110 hours. Let me explain why I would recommend this game and why I would not.\n\nFirst off, I will talk about why i would recommend it.\n\nThe story mode is awesome, i had fun and enjoyed it.\n\nIf you are a grind-a-holic, this is the game for you and i would fully recommend it. You can grind your heart out in challenge missions after level 30 and then use the phoenix credits to buy great new gear to go back and DO THE SAME THING. So basically, that's it for level 30. Ok, well there is also the dark zone actually that is pretty much the same thing. You find a group and you kill.. for hours and hours to reach dark zone 50. and then what? you get gear with dark zone currency or phoenix credits.\n\nLet me explain another reason to why this game is great for people who love to grind. You can also craft the same gear over and over and over again until you get something you actually want or is useful. However, you will spend a lot of time getting mats and of course, doing challenge missions or dark zone for hours to get them.\n\nYou see i AM a grind-a-holic and thats why i played for so long to see if the fruits of my playing would turn out but this is uninteresting to me. There is not much controls or content to even stay connected and the abilities and skills limit to only a few useful ones. Talents are kind of ehhhhh but i feel a lack of skills.\n\nThis game is not recommended for the most part because IT IS a grindfest. IF you do not like to grind, DO NOT BUY IT. Be prepared for countless hours doing challenge missions or dark zone getting the same gear and currency over and over      hoping you will get something good.\n\nI had fun but its not for me. If this review helped out, wonderful! If not, i apologize and contact me at Aciteoz@gmail.com  for further info about this game.","March 24","false","110.6"," 315 of 461 people (68%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","68","315","461","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nertlespeed/recommended/365590/","nertlespeed","Nertlespeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nertlespeed/","737 products in account","I'll start this off by simply saying that the line between the good and bad reviews (i.e. the "division" of people playing) is quite rough. On one side there is the people that enjoy the game and will defend it beyond measure and the other side is such vile hatred that cannot be swayed. With that out of the way, here is my review. The good, the bad and the indifferent. It's long, so TL:DR "do your homework".\n\n-The Bad-\n\n- There is a bit too much cusion between mission spots that leaves the game feeling a bit barren. With this, I'm not sure that populating the game world with group after group of enemies would be beneficial since it is already cumbersome enough to deal with normal groups of them, but some sort of filler wouldn't be a problem here. There are items to track down, ECHO's to review, documents to find, etc. but the average gamer isn't going to spend a lot of time with this. (I personally enjoy it since it really is the only way to get a real sense of the story, but who am I to say if it's good).\n- Mission variation is lacking. There are only a few types of missions to do, most of them involving "go here and kill/protect this" or free some hostages. The story missions have a bit of meat to them (longer and more involved) but there are far more side missions than main missions so this can wear on you a little.\n- Difficulty scaling is just weird. Sometimes you run into yellow(main) and blue(mini) bosses that just defy the current level range you are on. This is mitigated by grouping up, but to the solo player you are going to be punching your desk with some missions. I know, I know...git gud...but seriously, the rewards don't justify the headache sometimes.\n- Background banter. The main story voice acting is pretty decent, but the stuff going on with civilians and vendors doesn't fit the theme of the game. One guy is a struggling actor that's been in action movies so he "knows what you are feeling" and the civilians are seemingly oblivious to the horror going on around them. Not really a huge issue but it breaks the immersion too often.\n\n-The Good-\n\n- Compatibility issues aside, this game is actually quite beautiful. Turning everything all the way up in the settings is a treat for the eyes. There were moments when I just had to stop in a snow storm at night and just stare at the lighting and atmosphere. Again, this is removing the issues people are having with their setups/configs. PC gaming at it's finest.\n- Gunplay is fun and visceral. The key here is to remove yourself from the action/shooter mindset. This is an RPG at heart and not designed in a way that allows you to just mow through mobs like a superhero. I was one of three people that enjoyed Operation Raccoon City (any Resident Evil fans???) and this feels like the way RE should have been.\n- Playing with a few friends is really fun and rewarding. The varied skills and talents you can choose make grouping with people enjoyable. You can definitely take on much harder missions and have some intense firefights. This is equally so in the Dark Zones. Once the PvP area is fully operational, I expect to be spending a lot of time there as I did in the beta's.\n- As stated above, the perks and skills are useful and fun. You can really cater the output of your character to how you play the game. Spend a lot time going from cover to cover? There is a skill that up's the damage you do based on how far you sprinted to a new cover spot.  Rely on grenades? Get a skill that rewards you for damaging multiple enemies at once with explosives. There is plenty to mess around with here.\n\n- The Indifferent\n\n- The story is what you make of it. It requires a bit of reading and listening to wrap your head around what is going on. Most of the story is told through various media and the story quests only give you a recap of what is currently happening. Gotta put the work in to really get into this.\n- Character customization is pretty low. I only play with a small group of friends, but if this is supposed to be an MMO style game, people should be able to go nuts with their characters.\n- Technical/server issues. Some people are having a bad time with this, others just intermittently. This is the battle we fight as PC gamers. It will get ironed out and patience is a virtue. I got lucky with this game, but I've had my fair share of waiting with others just to play them.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm having a ton of fun with this game and with the DLC planned in the future it seems like my friends and I will get our money's worth. If you were blinded by the hype prior to the release of the game, you may walk into disappointment but if you enjoyed the beta and like a slower paced, semi-tactical RPG/Shooter hybrid, you might be pleasantly surprised. Don't let the reviews sway you (mine included). Do your research and decide for yourself. Hope to see you in NY!\n\n","March 9","true","87.3"," 742 of 1,120 people (66%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","66","742","1","34","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Exebes/recommended/365590/","Exebes","exebes3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Exebes/","92 products in account","I wanted to love this game, I really did. Ever since its announcement I have been following it as close as possible, pleading the developers to bring it to the PC. The idea of an MMO, modern shooter in New York City is a wonderful idea and early gameplay (and later gameplay as well) looked great.\n\nNow that I actually have the game... well I've come to the harsh reality that the book isn't half as good as the cover art. The Division isn't a horrible game, but it isn't the first class, open world MMORPG Shooter it sold itself as. I'll simply end up forgetting it. Let's look over the Pros and Cons\n\nPROS:\n-The world itself is wonderfully constructed. While the graphics are meh, the actual construction of the city is great, and it does feel like Manhattan turned upside down. Trash is everywhere, cars careened in the sides, and hordes of hungry, desperate people try to stay alive. One minute you are participating in a pitched firefight at Madison Garden, the next you are clearing an apartment room by room, looking over the trashed remains of a child's bedroom. That can hit you hard and these moments are the best the Division has to offer.\n\n-The story works... sort of. It's nothing special, the acting is a little stilted, but all in all, it gets you into the world and invested in it. You don’t need much more from it than it provides.\n\n-Teaming up with other players feels good and the tactics of team fighting work rather well. The AI isn't anything special, but it can be difficult enough to give a challenge to your team. A verity of skills and specializations also make different characters work well together, each having a role in your squad.\n\n-Customization of your characters feels good. Outfits all work well and you can give your character a utilitarian, unique look that fits the world. It doesn't fall into the trap of one character wearing authentic armor and another a solid diamond bikini that many games fall into. It all feels serious, ingrained in the world.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Combat is rather basic and even a little mind numbing. Every battle feels the same, no matter what equipment your foes bring to the fight. You use the same two abilities every time, fire the same assault rifle, and rarely use another weapon unless you run out of ammunition. The AI isn't brain dead, but it does nothing interesting, nothing that will ever surprise you. If you die, it’s either because you make a dumb decision, or you picked a fight with something that is simply too much of a bullet sponge to kill.\n\n-The graphics are meh. If you play on a low to mid-tier system, things will look really splotchy, sort of muddy at all points. Higher end systems remedy this, but even then it’s not anything we can't find in any other modern game. The meat of the graphics is in its final product, not the assets or effects used to achieve it.\n\n-The combat mechanics themselves are lackluster, reminding me a lot of Spec Ops, The Line. Guns don't really feel different and against the persistent bullet sponge enemies you face, your loadout feels weak at all times. Even the machine guns, marksman rifles, and magnum revolvers come off as piddle after you fire a few thousand rounds at a single foe wearing a hoodie. They sound good, but the feel and impact are lacking.\n\n-The total game lacks depth. If you are going to do anything, you do it by shooting. Want to save someone? Shoot someone. Gather gear? Shoot someone. Fix tech? Shoot someone. Recruit an ally? Shoot someone. Gather blood samples to counteract a deadly disease? Shoot someone. There is just no variety and the core gameplay is too shallow to make up for this.  You will grow tired of this very quickly.\n\n-I have no issue with looters or grinders and have indeed enjoyed the aspect in a number of games (I even liked Destiny's later implementation of it) but this game just doesn't make it work. All items feel the same, some having higher numbers than others. The few that have special abilities are really just stat increases that trigger every so often. While I love the feeling of opening a container to find the secrets within, the Division just made me go "Yay. +1 to my stat. Woooo...." In order to make a good looter, the LOOT has to be special or at least exiting. The Division failed at this. Small increases in stats does not a good looter make.\n\n-The MMO aspect feels a bit... sectioned off. It’s as if the entire theory of this section was "Big Fences Make Better Neighbors". In my entire play period I worked with another player all of one time, and that was because I used the matchmaking (which can take FOREVER, even on launch day). You miss that special element of walking down the street and bumping into someone else, or stumbling upon the remains of another player's pitched firefight. While areas like the Dark Zone do this well enough, and Safe Houses allow you to rub noses with other Agents, the moment you walk out the door, you are alone, and you feel it. An MMO should never, ever, make you feel alone, like you are the only person around, especially in the heart of New York City.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nUltimately, the problem with the Division is that, I feel no need to return to it. I'm not hooked into the story and while the world they built is extraordinary, the content within it is ultimately unappealing. I don't want to go through another firefight in the Division, I don't want to go hunting for weapon parts, or rummaging through contaminated areas to find a new jacket for my character. I simply feel no need to return.\n\nThe gameplay is uninspiring, the progression yawn-inducing the looting commits the most grievous sin. I don't feel excitement when I open a container or search a body.\n\nThat's my experience with the Division. I would not recommend it.\n\nAlso, first review not to mention the horrors of UPlay!...\n\n...shoot.\n","March 9","false","7.1"," 1,917 of 3,017 people (64%) found this review helpful 99 people found this review funny","64","917","3","99","110"

It's too bad too, it is a great game. Just seems like the team went into panic mode to overcome some obstacles they didn't foresee and totally blew it. I can't imagine this not being a dead game in record time.\n\n*******************\nEdit/Update\n*******************\nI will level an alt to 30, and use the stash to transfer items back and forth between my farmer/crafter and PKer\nI will level another alt to what ever level it is gear mods open up on the mod vender for electronics\nI will level another alt to use the hub for every other resource for crafting\nIt's just really annoying to feel like you have to do this to enjoy the gameb due to some dumb changes to rules of the mechanics they've set post-release, to combat progression they feel is too fast\n*******************\n\nPros:\nThis game could be awesome if you have a group of 4, and all of you are motivated to get dope gear\nBullet registration is on point\nRuns smooth on sub-par machine (see bottom of review for specs)\nLooks great\nStory is great. The only way I know this is the incredible amount of voice acting you {get to, or have to, depending on your point of view} listen to while doing missions. Most text driven MMO's I just skip through. Being able to travel while having context fed to you is nice.\nWe have managed to figure out how to struggle through a challenger dungeon as a duo, so full groups are not mandatory.\nCons (in order of appearance):\nTheir PR (community manager) during the beta streams referred to going rogue as trolling. Not a great sign for people looking to PvP. Since then, several changes reflect PvP to be an afterthought, reinforcing the original idea PvP = trolling, is in fact shared with the vision of the game. The direct quote is "if you want to troll and go rogue you can do that, you know, but it's going to come with a price". No reward intended.\nDue to the incredibly high stakes and extreme disparity of reward (basically none) if you do go rogue, be prepared to welcome 80% of the DZ with open arms, as they will come from all over to seek your ♥♥♥♥.\nFor reasons stated above almost no one will go rogue; but if you try to hunt rogues, be prepared to desperately try to get the finishing hit on a downed guy in between a dozen other players with the same goal, to get the incredibly huge chunk of xp.\nYou will almost certainly never see an exciting fight in this game. Blowout or nothing. And I'm willing to wager 95% of the time someone goes rogue in this game it will be an accident. I don't think it'd be far off to say that same 95% of all rogue deaths will be from shots to the back while they were trying desparately to run away immediately after hearing the rogue gong.\nPhoenix coin from bosses nerfed. No reason to farm bosses in DZ for Phoenix.\nThe only reason to go to the DZ currently is if you're looking for a particular gun that doesn't currently have a blueprint available, or, to farm for exploits (or both).\nExploit, the 2nd of the 2 reasons to go to the DZ. You can currently get an incredible edge with crafting materials, giving you the ability to endlessly roll items until you get the ones you want. This entails collecting items, using the stash, and an alt. What it does is turn 30 minutes into an entire normal days worth of work acquiring crafting materials.\nThe Xpac is releasing on Xbox first, PC & PS4 will get it 1 month later. With so little to do in the game, as a result of crippling any desire to PvP, it is very likely to be a dead game by the time that content is available.\nDZ bucks are worthless, they didn't figure out a way to make these valuable once you become normal 30 DZ 30. The best thing you can do with them is prepare to go to lvl 30 at normal lvl 29 by running around vendor to vendor, making sure you have all the slightly better stuff.\nThe size of the map is small for an MMO. It might take 10m to run from the N side of the map to the south side, and from East to West it might take a little more. The DZ occupies a small chunk in the middle.\nI'm typically the last to complain about frivolous expenses towards video games, and almost never grab season passes or balloon packages. I pre-purchased Gold for $100. I don't have to pay for the xpac. But with the xpac releasing on xBox a full month prior to PC, I can only imagine this game will be completely dead by then. So a total waste.\nPC Specs:\nAbout 60 FPS with no feelings of input delay, a lot of settings on low, some on medium, the streaming setting thing on 100%.\n\nCPU: i7-3770k OCed to 4.4GHz w/ h100i cooling\nMem: 16GB 1600MHz CL7 DDR3\nStorage: Samsung 850 EVO 500GB Sata III SSD\nVideo: EVGA 660 GTX\nO/S: Windows 7","March 13","false","263.6"," 506 of 782 people (65%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","65","506","782","26","27"

It runs well.  And that's about all we can hope for anymore isn't it?\n\nLet me tell you something.  You've already played this game.  Probably a dozen times. I know I have. You've cleared the building before.  You've swapped your gear for more gear.  You've opened the shiny loot container for a bandage that you can't carry.  There is nothing new or innovative about this game.  It's the same old thing in a new shiny package.  It has crafting.  Of course it does.  Everything has to have crafting these days.  Lots of long runs to the next objective.  Cause none of us have played any hiking simulators in the past few years.  Talent system with special powers?  Obviously. Special powers in a  cover-based tactical  3rd person shooter...\n\nThe gameplay is extremely easy and I find it deeply unsatisfying.  The overwhelming majority of quests are kill quests of one degree or another that provide little challenge.  The third person view and cover based mechanics directly clash with each other.  It's not a shooter.  It's Zeus hurling lightning bolts. You can see everyone at all times, all their movements, preparing to throw a grenade, when they pop up, when they go down.  You can shoot with astounding accuracy over cover without exposing yourself.  And should an enemy actually be hidden, don't worry, theres a superpower that gives you xray vision.\n\nOn the point of upgrading gear, they've found a way to make it even less satisfying than its been in all the other games we've been playing since WoW.  They seperated the gear with stats from the gear that alters appearance.  Ignorning that the majority of the "appearance gear" looks largely similar, now you have two gear screens that you have to maintain and more nonsense sort.  What that achieved for me is making it so that I completely ignore my characters appearance.  Well done.\n\nPersonally, I don't think this game deserves the hype or the success it's recieving.  But that's the state of gaming today isn't it?  As much as I dislike this game, it's probably going to be one of the best titles to come out of the next month or two.\n\nWith the recommend buttons looming below my ever-growing review I'm forced to concede that if you are as disillusioned as I am about the state of gaming these days then you must admit this game does not deserve your support.  But what else is there?  If you are interested in this game and are willing to knowingly pay more than it is probably worth... then it's ok.  It's ok because we don't have a better benchmark right now.\n\ntl;dr This game is like another Wal-Mart popping up in your home town.  You know it's not good. You'd rather it wasn't there. But Wal-mart has shiny graphics and it runs well on your PC.  So it's not the worst thing in the world to shop there.  But your money is better spent elsewhere.\n\n*edit - some commas and some words","March 15","false","18.0"," 464 of 718 people (65%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","65","464","718","40","32"

For a game with so much potential, you guys manage to somehow wipe your ♥♥♥ with it, or should I say with everyone's money.\n\nPatch 1.2 is out and Jesus Christ they dropped the ball...ONCE AGAIN\nOne is none is still broken, Incursions are STILL teleporting players bac (This time it happens even if it is just started GJ),  map is now bugged, there are INVISIBLE walls in the ♥♥♥♥ Zone, still haven't fixed the damn dialog box "You have new master mods" after weeks of that being there, and the cherry on top...\nTHE GREATEST THING IS THAT NOW PLAYERS THAT KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY PlAYED WITH A HACKER ARE NOW GETTING BANNED, SO A BAN WAVE CAME THROUGH ATTACKING LITERALLY ANYONE THAT EVEN SO MUCH AS UTTERED THE WORDS "Pls don't be hacking"  GOOD ON YOU DIVISION, YOU ARE TRULY GIVING A NEW MEANING TO BEING MENTALLY HANDICAPPED.\n\nA few weeks ago when the game first dropped, I was hyped so it would have easily gotten a 9/10 from me, but that's no longer the case.\nTo be honest, the game started out nicely with the introduce of the base of operations and ♥♥♥♥ like that. But the way they put you in the game...they put you in as if you've never clicked a mouse or used a keyboard in your life.\n\nThe game is broken to hell and back. It's as if they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to fix the game, a title that was broken at LAUNCH, now this is Ubisoft we're talking about, and I'm ashamed to say it but I had faith that they wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ up this idea of a post apocalyptic New York.\n\nPeople that were able to hit level 30 and get the Midas before the first patch, they were basically invincible if they had survivor link and the correct roll on the Midas, this was patched soon after word got out, good on you Massive, but wait, THERE'S MORE THAN JUST ONE BUG!\n\nTextures were ♥♥♥♥ing up left right and center.\n\nPhysical areas sometimes wouldn't load in, causing people to fall to their death through the ground.\n\nBulletking...\n\nThere are so many cheaters to the point where it has gotten TOO out of hand, with no anti-cheat and a broken report system, it's free range on literally everybody and it is almost impossible to go in the darkzone without finding a guy that won't put his fist in your ♥♥♥ through a wall, using aimbot, and 10000 rpm.\nP.S. with the report, you need video proof of said person doing it, so I hope you've got shadow played my dudes\n\nThe missions are completely copy and paste and offer little to no team work sometimes.\n\nMissions can be farmed 24/7 (Lincoln tunnel and Lorraine mainly).\n\nThe incursions were brought it as something of a new way to bring players together to work as one productive unit, at least to me. It did the exact opposite. Team work was about 5% of the mission, the other 95% were literally just trying not to get one shotted by shotgun rushers with 2million dps and 6million health and armor. And on top of that, there was a glitch where you could go through a wall using the smart cover that would get you into the play area without really starting the mission, making it so that you could destroy the APC using the sticky launcher.\n\nIn the 1.1 update, they ♥♥♥♥ed crafting to hell with making a HUGE increase in the amount of materials needed to craft another material/gear.\n\n\n\nThey're solution isn't to fix the ♥♥♥♥ ups in THEIR coding, their solution is to ban the people who found a way through their ♥♥♥♥ coding.\n\nThey figure out a way to make players go "Hey, that's pretty good" and then make them say "Kill yourself"\n\nThe game itself is beautiful and I really like the work that they put into making this New York look so amazing, that seems like the one thing they got right.\n\nIn short, I would either not buy the game, wait until EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING THING IS FIXED (BUT WE KNOW THAT ♥♥♥♥ WON'T HAPPEN), or wait until it becomes about $20 in about a year or so.\n\nUbisoft, fix this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥.\nFix your ♥♥♥♥ing coding.\nGet a ♥♥♥♥ing anti-cheat in place.\nStop adding more clothing packs until you fix what needs to be fixed.\nFix the ♥♥♥♥ing crafting system.\nAnd fix the ♥♥♥♥ing DZ, and I don't mean by adding new brackets, I mean by not making ♥♥♥♥ ridiculously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tough to get like some ♥♥♥♥ in the DZ03 vender, you aren't adding any value to the game by forcing people to grind in the ♥♥♥♥ zone until level 90, you are just making them play this copy and paste mission simulator longer.","May 24","false","161.3"," 56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","56","70","6","0"

That is appalling.\n\nThe DZ (PVP ZONE) is littered with cheaters like roaches. I'm glad I didn't buy into their "money-grab pass" either after experiencing how many cheaters there are and how much it ruins the game.\n\nDid I mention that Delta-Senpai does not notice you? Mike-kun doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you.\n\nThey say it's like Diablo with guns but it REALLY ISN'T. Blizzard actually gives their gamer's drops unlike this grindfest ♥♥♥♥-game. Their items make sense!!! The ♥♥♥♥ you get in this game makes no sense!!! The talent on my backpack is literally useless! Healing a device that I don't use for a miniscule amount which makes no ♥♥♥♥ing difference because challenging NPCs blow it up with 1 bullet anyways! The worst part is you can't even reroll the talent so your stuck with useless ♥♥♥♥ you can't get rid of because that's how Ubisoft wants it.\n\nEvery other patch they ninja-nerf drops or alter something like crafting so now it takes you like 30+ elite materials total to craft 1 item. EST 10 months of playtime to get 1 upgrade because every craft takes like 3 ♥♥♥♥♥ you can only get from the DZ that are on a long ♥♥♥ respawn timer and completely luck based.(Now takes 4 gold dz materials but named gold enemies can drop them WoWowwoWoW)\n\nUbisoft never actually focuses on the ♥♥♥♥ that matters either. Challenging boss drops 4 gold (elite) items!? WOW WE CAN'T HAVE DAT! People might actually have a chance to get a good piece of gear that way! Nerfed! LATA NERDS!\n\nMeanwhile there are still the same bugs that have been around since day 1 (like stats not showing correctly, double healing on skill use, falling through ♥♥♥♥ and dying or being teleported back to a safe house, and DZ enemy aggro that will rage you) and you can't even have fun in the DZ without a cheater ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your whole group 1tapping you with aimbot through walls.\n\nThe NPCs talking will annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you with how much they repeat themselves. You will need counseling for your PTSD after you have to mute dialogue in-game because Paul Rhodes is repeating the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over. You will already hate this guy so much from your first encounter that you will rejoice when you hear the idiot with the ♥♥♥♥ed up back who needs meds and follows you to different safe zones to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.\n\nTheir entire community is forced to exploit bugs by killing mission bosses over and over for any chance of loot and they patch it... It's ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic.\n\nLets see... Their BRAND NEW incursion mission... Invisible ♥♥♥♥ing fire that can kill you, invisible explosions that can ♥♥♥♥ing insta-kill you, ♥♥♥♥ shooting me through walls, grenade launchers shooting me through walls that can ♥♥♥♥ing 1-shot. Well then! I know you wanted it to be a "challenge" but who woulda thought that the only way to beat it is to camp a single section of the area for 45 minutes? WOW great gameplay. Might be able to actually move if I could see wtf was killing me half the time. OH~ Thank you Delta-Senpai for ♥♥♥♥ing me again during this mission~ Your rejection makes me want to try harder!~.............. Wait... No it doesn't.\n\nAll you have to do is pay some nerd $10 dollars an hour to play-test this ♥♥♥♥ but the greed is too real.\n\nSupply crate drops secured in DZ : 1/4\nExperience : Killed by aimbot 1shot hackers through walls for 3/4 supply crates and of the 1 crate secured I received 2 PURPLE items... Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? Garbage-tier items.\n\nPersonal recommendation? Don't ever buy a Ubisoft game with hopes of balance or good PVP. They really dropped the ♥♥♥♥ing ball here. This was supposed to be their big-time seller and leave them on top of the gaming charts... But it didn't even last a month before getting old and proved Ubisoft was incapable of managing the game.\n\nOver all I rate The Division : 1 floppy-donkey ♥♥♥♥ trying to strangle you while you take a money-shot/5\n\nTLDR :\nPASS ON THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER PURPOSES UNTIL THEY GET ANTICHEAT!

It also have a very tweakable graphics menu, which is always a welcome sight. It even has native 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio support.\nThey did a magnificent job filling in the world of the Division. While running around the overworld, New York really does feel alive (well, aside from all the plague corpses scattered about). Generally the atmosphere is well-crafted.\nWhile I do prefer more realistic shooting combat, to the RPG "this enemy can survive and entire clip of SMG to the face because it has lots of health and armor" I will admit that I actually enjoyed combat once I ignored the immersion break.\nThe general level up grind, and running missions with friends is just plain fun.\nNeutral:While the game seems to run very well at 1080p; 1440p, and 2160p seems to be badly optimized. (It seems to take a larger performance hit than similar games above 1080p)\nOverall the voice acting is well done, but it can occassionally be super cheesy.\nUnlike other RPGs you never feel like you are playing an actual class (like Tank, Healer, DPS). Usually everyone goes with a similar build (depending on if you're partied up, and if you're doing PvP or PvE).\nCons:Balancing issues. Gear talents, weapon talents, content rewards. It all needs to be tweaked.\nRampant hacking, game is extremely easy to hack.\nSome weapons seem pointless because they are heavily outclassed by the sniper, SMG, and some assault rifles.\nLooking strictly off the Steam player statistics the game has lost nearly 80% of its playerbase since launch. Which I understand not all players, even on PC, are using steam. However, it does give a pretty good snapshot of the current state of the community.\nExtremely thin endgame.\nAfter the crafting nerf, crafting has become tedious to say the least.\nNew exploits discovered every week.\nIncursions are a mess.\nAs much as I want to, I just can't recommend the game in its current state.

We are waiting for new concepts like trading goods between players	 has been added.\nProgress system is perfect! I can improve my character, get new gears, unlock new talents, and seeing them more powerful.\nStunning graphics and high details level. Still beautiful even if you put it on low to gain some FPS.\nCustomisable HUD & Elegant interface/map design.\nGood optimization for PC and very smooth animations:Originally posted by Ubisoft:it's a native PC version and NOT an adjusted console version for PCI liked the Cover system, it replaces the jump/crouch abilities to add a new movement mechanic  Check out this video for more info\nChoose your game style and find your role! For example i like to play as a medic guy with full healing equipment, in order to revive my mates easily and give them a massive healing waves.\nAdrenaline: Lots of fun, especially when you become a Rogue (the most wanted enemy) and you have to survive against all other players (good feeling).\n\nCONS:\nSimply like any other game, the division has its own cons, because there is no one game with 100% of pros:\n\nUnfair PVP system in the DarkZone\nPersonalization has few options, especially character's face (i need to modify more things in order to make a unique character).\nWe need more activities, i mean a new activity more than just shooting enemies (maybe in the next coming DLCs)\nUbisoft network = TRASH...NOT a new info i know. (Update #1: Servers are "actually" stable).\nThe game still expensive just like other Ubi titles.\nI think a successful multiplayer game should be more accessible to be played. This may explain why Rainbow Six Siege servers suffer from a lack of players. We go back to say again "Good game, Bad company" every time we remember your prices.\nSolution: Make your game more accessible by decreasing its price or support us with Free DLCs content. Or give us the Season Pass for Free to solve this point. I abused here?\n\nResults and Final Word:\nI give it 8/10 for (80% Graphics, 85% gameplay and 75% optimization).\n\ni recommend it because the game has a big potential, and its cons are almost nothing compared to the BIG number of good points that this game has.\nIn addition, some of these cons can be fixed easily (like servers connection) so wait for the next update/patchs, they may fix the issues you are experienced.\n\n"Give this game another chance, it deserves to be played."\nThanks for reading my review.","March 7","true","118.2"," 2,691 of 4,394 people (61%) found this review helpful 193 people found this review funny","61","691","4","193","111"

And let's not forget getting stuck in objects on the map, server errors  and players you can't even see on screen running into your firefight or explosions that turn you rogue.","April 4","false","113.3"," 60 of 81 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","60","81","0","2"

The content you get after finishing the game is repeating same missions on higher difficulty over and over again and Non-stop gear grinding.\n- Bad level design the only difference between missions is the mobs level. you enter the level zone and the game keep spawning Bullet Sponge mobs. pretty much a horde mod.\n- Not interesting and bad storytelling.\n- There is only 3 4 type of enemy in this game.\n- Crafting system designed to keep you grinding and doing same thing things over and over again. the only thing you know before crafting a high end gear is the gear score the 3 talents are random and because of that you have to grind the materials and craft the same weapon 6 7 times to get the talents you want.\n- RNG loot system sometimes 0 good loot after farming 10 hours , sometimes tons of loot in 1 hour\n- Darkzone is broken cheaters are all over the place.\n- Ret*arded rouge system peoples jump into your bullets to make you rouge.\n- No PVP Game Mod\n\nThis game cant be fun in first 30 40 hours. with less  RPG elements. skills , perks and gear mods are not good enough to create unique builds and different play styles[characters all r same ].

NO it doesn't suck, as many people are saying. It's not good in my eyes either. The Division falls somewhere inbetween for me. Here's what I did and didn't like, then I'll go into my experience with the game. Also I'd like to add that a friend gifted me this game, as after the beta I had absolutely NO intentions of buying the game.\n\nPros -\n- Great visuals and effects. Lighting was pretty meh, but the fog and snow effects are rivaled only by skyrim mods.\n- Map design is nice, especially the "open world" section of the game.\n- Advertising campaign was a massive success. This game waaaaay outsold what it deserves.\n\nCons-\n- Terrible use of the "Tom Clancy" Licence. This is in no way a realistic game. How they obtained this is beyond me.\n- Abysmal content that could put even the mighty Destiny to shame.\n- Feeling that you're doing the same mission over and over and over. Shoot the things, kill the boss, win.\n-Misleading Promo video, in comparison to what we got. Literally 10 or more inconsistencies in a 30 second clip. I want to play THAT game.\n- SAME boss at the end of EVERY mission ( I have only played up to level 16/30 so far, but have fought the boss 5 times)\n- In mission respawns are an absolute joke. It makes no attempt to respawn you in a safe place. At all. Ever.\n- Weapon customization is nice, but besides the 4 or 5 gun variants, all guns feel the same.\n- Dark Zone is more of a mexican standoff than PVP. You actually LOSE dark zone currency if you shoot another player.\n\nOk, now that's over with, I'll talk more in depth about the game.\n\nUpon first inspection, the eye candy is real here. Lighting is kinda non existant, but good enough. Textures are A+, and the fog and snow effects are very impressive. Right off the bat my friend pointed out a plot inconsistency in the opening fmv. The chinese girl appears to have been shot in face at some point during the heli crash. Just who shot her and what that gas mask with the bullethole had to do with it are two things only beta players will know. They changed the story at the last minute and didn't bother to edit the fmv to corroberate with said new storyline. Finished the prologue and now we're In the actual game. Jumped in with my level 13 friend on hard mode, me being level 7 and every enemy is now levelled to him, leaving me being one shotted through the "last stand" and straight into deadness. Over, and over and over until we finally beat the boss, a flamethrower weilding nut job that paces around the map, with various cannisters that can be shot to blow him up. "Cool Boss!!" I thought to myself. Next mission is just as hard. Takes us the better part of an hour to get through this one. Finally we come to the finale, and I'm curious as to what they will throw at us this time !! ...............Oh...........It's the very same boss. Next mission, With me now level 14, we cruise to victory and low and behold, ye ol' flamer guy is back in the leading role of "head honcho". It was officially at this point, that I said the words..............."This is actually worse than Destiny in terms of content". And it is. Every level consist of shoot some guys, press a switch, incoming wave of enemies, repeat 3x and progress. Repeat that 3 times and then head honcho flame guy. I played 5 missions, all of which were 95% clones of the last mission, on a different map. So I'm pretty much done with the game at this point, but my friend points out that we have yet to visit the dark zone (I had already been there in the beta). I reluctantly agree. being a bit of a bandito in dayz mods gone by, I spot a guy looting up and drill him with my rifle. I get a big red - sign with four digits. ♥♥♥♥ it I thought. Then all hell starts to break loose. Not only did I lose  currency for the dark zone, the entire server was now bearing down on me because I am now "rogue" I get brutally murdered. So what this means is.......................there is NO PVP IN THE DIVISION. If you care about the game, you simply won't do it for fear of losing the currency needed to buy the bad ♥♥♥ weaponary on show in the vendor. in light of this, the sole aim of Dark Zone is to troll people into shooting you once, so you can nick their ♥♥♥♥ without being punished.  It is at this point I realize "THIS IS A F*@+ing Tom Clancy GAME !!!!   WTFMJN:KMNNN:BHBJHB:JBJLHBLJHVJLHVLJHGV" how did they get the licence for this ? Money, that's how. In the exact same way EA defiled star wars Battlefront. Ubisoft have p***ed all over the Tom Clancy series, and served it up to us warm and frothy. There is just no content worth mentioning here other than the visuals. This is Destiny MkII. Ofc I expect a DLC to come out next week with the other half of the game they ripped out, personified into a floater in the now stale pot of ♥♥♥♥ the rest of the game dwels in.\n\nMy advice ? DO NOT SPEND £50 on this ♥♥♥♥. It honestly feels as if they spent half the budget promoting the game, instead of actually making it worthwhile.\n\nA measly 6/10 from me, with 2 of the above points based on visuals.\n\nFor a more visual representation of an honest review of this title, please watch this -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTBcuZTPIEk","March 18","false","11.1"," 405 of 656 people (62%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","62","405","656","31","23"

As it sits, there's 4 challegne missions you can rerun over and over and over and over till you're so geared out the US army couldnt touch you.\n\nThere are bugs and glitches that have been around since the beta(s) that STILL havnt been fixed. Incorrect DPS display being one of them. Now that crafting is out its even carried over into that.

The game feels very rough, unpolished, and has numerous bugs both large and small that lend to an extreme level of annoyance. I cannot recommend this game at all. I was really looking forward to a new Tom Clancy game, but I was highly disappointed. I wish refunds were possible after spending nearly 30 hours only to find the middle of the game was just hugely irritating. I cannot steer potential buyers away from this game more. Good luck if you decide to buy this, and not because of the format: I have no problem with "clear the map" style games if the game content itself is fresh, which this game mostly is. Every death in the game just feels like the game doesn't want you to play it. Maybe the extreme feeling of the game being rushed has something to do with the fact that the actual game was built within the last year of development after Ubisoft Massive spent way too much time developing a game engine that has no substantial innovations (gameplay or graphical) above any of the other AAA games built within the last 5 years.\n\nFurthermore, although it was fairly well known that this would be an MMO-style game, Steam lists it as "Single Player" and does not mention the always-on Internet connection requirement. If you watched all the Steam videos you could be forgiven for thinking this was a game that could actually be played offline, as the social elements of the game are nearly non-existent.\n\nI will be eating the loss of my $60, and won't be finishing the game.\n\nSeriously, seriously, seriously, do not buy this game.","March 14","false","31.7"," 267 of 429 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","267","429","9","5"

The main story is ok-ish  linear and nothing to write about it. At the lvl30 the pve is only about to : repeat endlessly the same mission you did in the main story in a challenge mode for poor reward and often you get kick out the team just before you get you reward, some find that fun.\n\nThe dz is the most cheap and toxic "pvp" ever made in a game, is only about ganking, nothing more. In fact you earn nothing to kill player than you could by killing npc even faster. It just about screw people game time. And mostly the low lvl dz zone are camp but full geared player against who if you start the game you can not even hurt them.\n\nLast point is what make me stop this game : cheater are only ban for 3 days, exploiter are free to use and farm every exploit in the game and will never be punish.

The game is simply gorgeous if you have the system to run the graphics and the physics are great even though dumbed down.\nThis isn't your regular Arcade twitch shooter nor is it an MMO but it does offer some great mechanic and formula such as the Dark Zone and the story being focused on the city itself rather than your regular run of the mill script.\nAlthough the game is fun in certain aspect there are parts that wasn't. Tech upgrade missions and side missions  being a bit tedious and enemies being a bit unengaging.\nIt starts off a bit slow like any other rpg then ends up being a bit better as time progress but then doesn't really change from that point on to becoming great to pull you in and stays constantly medicore like any other end game grindfest. Thank god for the Dark Zone\n\nI can recommend this game to people who Looting, playing multiplayer with friends and if you're a stats/gun nut. Not my cup of tea but can see potential for improvement.\n35-40 hours to get to max level 30.\n\nP.S if you didn't even watch the video or read that this isn't my type of game as I don't personally recommend it to certain players (see bottom) and the fact that I gave it a recommendation for the people specifically who enjoys this type of genre then you've failed really hard to understand the meaning of this review at all.\n\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaawJANnIhA&feature=youtu.be\nPros\n+ Great graphics and physics even though the game is dumbed down from what is seen from E3. The physics of blowing car windows, tires, things flying around etc can be seen.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641421446\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641176860\n(Note this is a respond to the potato peasant at the bottom who claims "Graphic isn't gorgeous")\n\n+ The day and night cycle along with the snow weather is downright gorgeous and seeing wind blowing snow in different direction in the chaotic scenes of Manhattan.\n\n+ Good amount of gun categoy. Sub machine gun, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifle, and Pistols with different stats and drawback. They sound good and looked good with ability to mod for better stats or even rerolling stats. You can buy them, Craft them or find them.\n\n+ Some intresting and fun skill trees with variation such as turret drones or the ballistic shield and also being able to turn that gun into something that shoots eletric or fire. The talent although doesn't feel as great.\n\n+ The ability to free roam the map with friends to do side missions and doing the main missions with friends or stranges is action packed. You can even do it on harder difficulties and watch as people cry on thier mics and struggle.\n\n+ The Looting addiction Factor, Once you find epic and legendary you just gotta find something better.\n\n+ The story is told in an interesting way and focused on the people and the chaos that happaned in the city itself which is a great take for this sort of game through finding phones, Echos (camera recreated images) and footages you'll find in the game.\n\n+ The Dark zone is a fresh idea and very fun and the saving factor for this game for me. I enjoy the pvp aspect and also for taking this route of being a rogue agent that the world will be against me sorta feeling I get out of it. Although it would be nice if the NPC helps me in the process when I am running. I have killed and been killed by many and plenty and as such the entire concept is chaotic and fun with some refining needed.\n\n+ The general size of the map is generous and also big with many things to see and discover and different scenery to admire.\n\nCons - The requirements are really high, you need a high end card to experience just more than half of what you can see. You cannot run some of the features without really good cards..\n\n- Some of the game bugs are very annoying and server based, wierd enemy speeds, teleporting enemies, falling through worlds just to name a few and needs fixes. This kills it for me at times.\n\n- Having to be online at all to play single if you wanted to, that means if the server is down then no game for you but the server went down once for me and with that didn't have any issues after that.\n\n- The enemies falls under 4 factions. The Rioters, The Rikers, The Cleaners, and the lmb (Last Man Battalion) although they have different types from sharp shooters, grenadier spammers, and the flame throwers etc the enemies just didn't seem any more different from each other and was sorta bland. You always expected new enemy types in each sector but didn't get to see anything amazing.\n\n- Most of the missions is tedious because of hours to play such as side missions and the mission to earn points to progress the skill/talent tree you will do the same thing for each and every zone until you reach max. The most enjoyable missions is the STORY MISSION / Main Dungeon\n\n\nConclusion\n- The game is honestly mediocre at best for me since I've seen the concept many times already but features some nice fresh material and formula but overall it was just not my cup of tea, took me about 34-45 hours to reach max level and I just didn't quite frankly enjoy the tedious quest and the lack of enemies variation that gives me the drive to want to shoot them afterwards. I was Always expecting something fresh in each sector as I progress in the level ranges of the game but instead seeing the same thing over and over again. I do however see potential in the game and recommend it if you\n+ Love looting EPICS\n+ Love TpsRpg\n+ Love Guns and stats\n+ Love new pvp concept\n\nStay away if you\n- Hate online only game.\n- Hate Uplay and Ubisoft.\n- Looking for some amazingly fresh concept.\n- or quite frankly its not your type of genre.\n\nCan't give it a thumbs down just because it is not my type of game/genre and the fact that I did play it all the way and enjoyed some aspect of it such as when playing with friends and strangers.\nThe DARK ZONE concept was just fun and chaotic and this is being real honest.The upcoming  end game content will decide how well this game will do later on because this is what most people look forward to in RPGS.\nI want to see improvement on the Dark Zone and more explosive filled missions/high end dungeons.\nAs I see it right now I only come on once a day to do a little bit of daily grind for phoenix credit and play some dark zone casually to see if I can one shot people in the face.","March 13","true","53.6"," 419 of 685 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","419","685","27","32"

This is why:\n\nThe GOOD\n\n● Amazing detailed map, credit due**\n● Really good graphics\n● Detailed modeled and textured Characters\n● Pacing & story feels ok the first 15 levels\n● The user interface looks good**\n● Good cover system\n● Base building/upgrading (Wish there was more)\n● Dark Zone** (First couple times in there is really exciting and nerve racking)\n● Can Fast travel**\n● Crafting is ok (Feels good getting a good role)\n● I was super Hyped ever since first trailer**\n● Darkzone with Friends is super fun!!\n● Challenging mission late game is super fun with friends!!\nI actually asked steam for a refund but then i had at the time to many hours. I then started playing with friends and got very addicted and kept me playing till now.\n**There are exceptions**\n\nAND THE BAD\n\n● Character creation very limited\n● Map is lifeless\n(Completing the main quest changes nothing, just no more enemies.)\n● Transport\n(There is none, you will be doing a lot of walking and i mean a lot)\n● Story is very average and forgettable (I can't remember any characters except the doctor that is a lesbian)\n● Boring Boss fights\n(They are just tanky, except for the enemy agents and a helicopter are more interesting wish there where more and more variety)\n● Stupid AI\n(This could have been over looked, but all the enemies are the same for all factions: rushers, soldiers, grenadiers, snipers, heavies, it gets boring after couple hours)\n● Dark Zone\n(The dark zone has balancing issues, or you easily kill someone or someone easily kills you there is no middle ground if there is i haven't had those engagements)\n● Going Rogue is heavily penalised\n(They have fixed this in update)**\n● Lack of Dark Zone mission content\n(Kill mobs that's it)\n● Crafting (This becomes very grinding, trying to get parts, money becomes obsolete and it all revolves around parts and phoenix points)\n● Grinding end game\n(I’ll say it again it's all just about farming parts and pheonix points to get the best weapons, and gets very boring)(Maybe it will get better with the expansions)\n● Collectables and echos are unnecessary\n(could have been replaced with more interesting content)\n● Fast travel loading times is painfully slow (even worse after one update)\n● Missing content\n(many things that got me exited from the E3 2013 trailer didn't make it in the game)\n● Server issues (Mike should be fired!)\n● Day one issues (After 2 lengthy Alpha and Beta)\n(Small point, you cant preview clothing so you have to go through all of them and put on every piece to see how it look, this is so unnecessary )\n\n\nLook I really want Ubisoft to make a good game, but its seems its the same story as with Watch Dogs. I don't know if i trust the Ubisoft brand anymore to deliver good content. Listen this game has potential, really it has, but as for now, like most reviewers out there that say this game is average(Lookup angry joe review for example ), I can't recommend it for now.\n\nThank you for reading and taking the time, hope this helps you and thumbs up if you agree!","March 24","false","235.0"," 115 of 177 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","115","177","7","7"

I've played this game for 67 hours, and I've basically done everything the game has to offer at the moment. The pvp is non existent since the rewards and drawbacks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ex."If you die as a rogue agent you'll lose about 1-3 ranks and about 20% of all your DZcredits". So all the "DarkZone" is, is a mindless mobgrind, til you get to rank 50 and get the crafting blueprints. Sooo, what shall you do after you get the blueprints, you ask? Well, my friend, you keep mindlessly grinding mobs. Now you guys might ask, what about pve? Pve is at the moment 4 missions that you can go challenge mode  enabled, its not especially hard, but a challenge for some people. Still it's not enough for a complete endgame because the loot you get is worse then the mindless farming in DZ. So I would not for the life of me recommend this game to anyone at the moment. Maybe in a year or two this game will have a complete endgame but for the moment it's just not fun.","March 14","false","99.9"," 277 of 449 people (62%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","62","277","449","16","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SalStrange/recommended/365590/","SalStrange","Salome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SalStrange/","125 products in account","Tom Clancy's The Division is quite possibly the most disappointing gaming experience I've ever had from a AAA title. The game has two great things going for it: an incredibly immersive environment and a great co-op system. Everything else is either average or severely lacking. The sticky cover system is as obnoxious as the worst of the ME offerings (which have been out long enough to have been improved upon, imho). Looting employs at least three different mechanics, making it confusing and annoying, especially in co-op mode. Gear and weapons equip mechanics are fine, except for the fact that crafting and loot are so grindy and random that it takes any enjoyment out of getting a new item or gearing up. You want to be happy that you just downed an elite and got a new weapon, except that weapon isn't the type you prefer, and even if it were, the stats are mostly useless to your preferred style of play. Some sort of voucher system that allows players to choose and customize weapons is desperately needed. But, when you look at the crafting and vendor systems more closely you realize this is an intentional handicap to force players to grind endlessly for gear.\n\nBuying items from vendors while leveling is impossible without deliberately adding in grind time. The average piece of loot is worth maybe 300 - 500 credits, but items are easily 50-100x that, and later game items, what few there are in vendors, hit hundreds of thousands. Even if you do find items you can afford, the stats are unlikely to suit you. Once you unlock recalibration you can "reroll" one single stat on an item for a hefty fee, but even that's random, meaning you can easily spend 40k on a single stat reroll for a single semi-end-game item and get no improvement. None! And that’s just regular credits. There are three kinds of credit systems in the game. For end game schematics you need between 80 and 180 special “phoenix” credits. Put into perspective daily quests reward 15-20 of these. So if you do the 3 daily quests, it takes 3-5 days for a blueprint for an end-game weapon or other piece of gear. Then, you'll have to gather the materials to craft it repeatedly until you get some combination of stats you want. Then you’ll still probably have to reroll a recalibration using your regular credits on at least 1 stat. It's a ridiculous system that only serves to invest players in grinding out the same handful of daily missions over and over or in promoting the PVP area which is also lackluster. Defeat the "end boss" in most any other game and you might expect to get your pick of a great weapon. Not in The Division. Here you get a "meh" handgun. Because in a game filled with automatic weapons and sniper rifles, what everyone's after is an average handgun with a single mod slot. Boy, did I feel rewarded.\n\nIf only the disappointments were limited to loot, but this game fails to deliver on every level. It's an elaborate and richly decorated hamster maze with barely enough cheese to keep you motivated. Honestly, if a friend hadn't forked out $60 buying it for me, I wouldn't have bothered playing beyond the first few hours. It is one of the most cynically designed games I've ever seen put out by a major company. Everything about it only serves to offer the least to the gamer in the expectation that you’ll be so dazzled by the environment and bored you’ll pump hours of play time into utter mediocrity. There was no effort here to make a great game or to tell a great story. This game is all about seeing how to stretch the most amount of money out of the least amount of content.\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed about this game was the ease with which I could play with friends during the PVE main plot. Instead of most games where you can only group with friends meaningfully in battlegrounds or PVP areas, I was able to play the entire PVE main story with my friends. If only more AAA games were designed with this in mind. If an Elder Scrolls or Fallout or Dragon Age type game could figure this out, it would really be something. But, in the case of The Division, the reality is that it was spending time with my friends that I enjoyed, not anything the game itself was offering.\n\nI could go on about its weak design in everything from the mind-numbing and repetitive questing to the spectacularly pathetic avatar customization options to the painfully lame AI (elite boss type mobs have little in the way of special skills or abilities, merely high armor/HP/damage) which doesn't provide much satisfaction in terms of strategy -- even the "friendly" AI characters supposedly there to provide backup, only seem there to frustrate you, whether it's pushing you out of cover or getting in the way of headshots. The skill system is another total failure. Talents are all but useless except in rare circumstances where you force your gameplay into deliberate acts that are largely unnecessary when engaging with the lame AI. There are really only a handful of them that are really useful, so it restricts the build for your character. Quite frankly, even the useful perks and talents are more or less tried and tired. I’ve seen people give this game “average” ratings and being scolded over it, but the truth is this game is far below what should be average. In my opinion, it’s a disgrace because it’s painfully clear this game is deliberately designed to provide the least in terms of player reward, enjoyment and satisfaction; it offers a minimal experience in the hopes that once you hit the button for that first pellet, you’ll become invested enough to just mindlessly keep circling the rat maze for as long as they can milk you.\n\nIt’s clear why they hid so much of this game in Beta.\n\nSave your money. Wait for a sale. Better yet, skip it entirely and opt for another title that actually rewards you with enjoyment for your money and time.\n\nETA: I've updated the Phoenix Credit math after some comments here. I'd only bothered with two on Hard prior to writing my review. I don't feel this changes the game or makes it less of a cynical grind, but it seems only fair to present the correct information for anyone using reviews to determine their purchase choice.","March 22","false","143.7"," 214 of 344 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","214","344","8","11"

The game is extremely boring after you play for awhile. You'll realise that all you're doing is shooting enemies and picking up loot. Repeat. There isnt even much strategy or variety in enemies to actually change your meta up. You don't go like "Oh hey! There's like 5 snipers down there. We better try and sneak and take them out one by one". No, its always "Let's go in and massacre everyone!" And if that don't work, then either you equipment's level is low or your characters level is low. Once you reach the level cap of 30 and start the Dark Zone MAYBE it'll be more interesting however at this point in time im not interested in going there because of...\n\n- Connection issues - My second biggest problem. This may have something to do with me being in SEA but the game runs generally slower for me. Shots i make take a moment to hit and skills i use take a moment before its actually used (Which can cause problems especially whilst in PVP). At worse, the game ill entirely disconnect me from the server and I have to requeue to get back into the game.\n\nGameplay is boring - Well as i pointed out before, you're basically just shooting and killing and picking up stuff which you kind of sell/dismantle and back to square one. Theres really nothing to it. Thats literally it (PVP might add a new aspect of the game but so far i dont intend to find out). The "class" system in the game doesnt even make up for the boring combat. I mean, its nice to have some sort of "role" or "way of playing" but it's so bareback and minor that all classes ultimately feel the same. I guess you're meant to mix and match to create your playstyle? Either ways, still feels extremely bareback.\n\n- Story is uninteresting and other aspects on gameplay revolve around being a completionist - So the story isnt very engrossing. Basically you're special ops that get activated when ♥♥♥♥ goes down. ♥♥♥♥ just went down because of a virus so you get activated and go in. Whilst playing through the campaign, i find that i dont even know whats going on in the story anymore. Besides blasting other people mindlessly whilst hoping for some good loot, the game scatters all sorts of collectibles and stuff for you to go and get. Basically a large chunk of the game is taken up going here and picking up a phone or going there and uploading some virus data. Extremely boring stuff which you're more inclined to follow through as a completionist only.\n\nOverall, the price tag on this game is really not worth it. Maybe if it were on a larger discount then i'd be fun to pick up. I also reccomend getting it with friends as playing this alone makes it even worse and playing with randoms is basically a saltfest.\n\nOh, i was also told that getting the Season Pass will grant you with some nice equipments every month and some of the DLC later. Doesn't that sound like a P2W scheme? Sounds pretty unfair if you ask me...","April 1","false","22.7"," 188 of 302 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","188","302","10","49"

With a great story line, fun gameplay and even if the entire experience was repetitive I didn't really feel it.\n\n- Ubisoft:  Even if Ubisoft is garbage, with poop servers, and poop bugs, it was ok.\n\n- The Dark Zone:  God knows how excited I was to leap into it. Find Rogue Agents, Kill them, bring them to justice by myself. Nope, not happening, you will barely see anyone in it, and whenever you do, they'll either try to kill you while you're not watching them, or gang up on you (3v1 fun), or they will wait for you to extract your items (because you loot them from the DarkZone and have an action to perform to get them out of there) kill you, take all of your work and then extract your items for themselves. I loved the idea. But I like to play alone in MMORPG and this is literally impossible, no way you'll succeed. This is why having friends playing the game is a must-have.\n\n- Interaction with other players: Null, void. There's nothing, you can only meet other players in Safehouses or the DZ that you're in for 2 reasons, you're starting up and discovered them for missions or you died. Talking to people suck balls, and the grouping system will then be mostly random for most of the players.\n\n-The grinding: If you didn't join The Division near the begining or soon after. Good luck to catch up with people. If you are a grindaholic, it might be possible, and then go on ahead. You will be able to grind very challenging missions to get some credits, then some "parts" to craft them and do it again. Until... forever.\n\n[ I actually really like grinding in games, so I didn't mind that part. Except, that it's taking literally too long alone for very small results ].\n\nI had a lot of fun, got the season pass as well (i regret it now), played for a bit more than 100 hours. And finally decided to write a review. I'm still going to play from time to time, but it's not going to be the grinding I had fun to do for the first 2-3 weeks.\n\nIn the end, buy it with friends or don't.","April 19","false","111.3"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","33","41","3","0"

With that said, the "Gold Edition" was in fact significantly more expensive. Here in Canada the base game is $79.99, and the Gold Edition is $129.99, so for an extra $50 you can get the seasons pass (DLC) as well as some "cool" in game apparel, not sure I thought this through. None of this was an actual issue until I cleared my weekend to play this new really cool game with all my friends...\n\nI launched the game, no problems, turned down the volume because if you dont you will go deaf, and changed some graphical options. At this point in time none of my friends had bought the game yet or they just were not around to play, so I jumped into the single player, and thats where the issues started. Within the first minute or two of a terribly mediocre opening cut-scene, I heard a crack followed by absoloutly nothing. So my audio had completetly cut out, and now I was simply watching an injured lady next to me in a helicopter babble about something I couldnt distinguish. Once the cut scene ended I decided to restart my game as It may just have been a one time thing, oh man did I have another thing coming.\n\nSo once again I launched the game, still completely pumped the be playing, and as I'm in the loading screen the audio cuts out again, at this point Im thinking "whatever I just want to see what the gameplay is like then I will deal with the issue later". So I got in game started walking around and before I could even leave the beginning area my game crashes, no errors, just gone. So I check to ensure all my drivers are up to date for everything, and then I restart my computer and launch the game for a third time. Before I booted up the Steam, I closed all non-essential apps, disabled SLI, applied Nvidas recomended graphical settings, and launched Steam as administrator. Completetly certain that Ive solved my issues, I boot up The Division yet again, and yet again my audio cuts out, followed by my game crashing shortly after...\n\nI looked around Google for about an hour, trying small fixes here and there but none of them seemed to fix anything at all, so I decided to contact Ubisoft, and create a forum post detailing my issues and what Ive done in an attempt to solve them. Once I created my post, I continued browsing trying different methods, verifying game cache, etc. and nothing still worked.  Truth be told I still havent found a fix.. Ive tried everything I can think of, anything I could find on the internet, and in a last ditch effort I reinstalled Windows. This still did not solve my problems, I'm figuring its hardware related as Ive only found a few people with the same issue as me. Now I realize this had become more of a rant than a review, although I like to think this describes my first impressions fairly well. Now minus the issues Ive had with the game, I have played a little and found the game to be very enjoyable, althogh very repetative and straight forward. I wouldnt recomend purchasing the gold edition especially if you're here in Canada like me, it's a f*ckin' rip! If you havnt bought the game yet I would say wait for a sale, It will be a while, but you will thank me later.\n\nOh and for the record Ubisoft never got back to me on my forum post or my complaint, I hope this helped you reach your decision.

First off let's knock out some possible misconceptions.\n\n1) It's not a true MMO. It's not one gigantic open world where you see all the other players with everything that goes along with it. It's a lot like Diablo or Borderlands where, depending on your game settings, people can drop in or out at will.\n\n2) It's not a fps game. Seriously. It's an RPG wrapped up in a tps covershooter costume. If you go into this thinking or hoping its an fps and playing it as an fps you're going to get yourself killed ingame, and be very very disappointed.\n\n\nNow some of the good/bad points\n\na) As of this post, the game is still in its first week of release. Yes, there will be some issues that haven't been resolved from launch just yet - the game isn't an MMO, but it's multiplayer enough that it's going to be tweaked and fixed over time.\n\nb) The game is gorgeous. The new Snowdrop engine is just absolutely beautiful. The game has some of the best weather and fire effects I've seen in any game ever.\n\nc) The Dark Zone is not fair. It will never be fair. It was never designed to be fair. You will die. You will get ganged up on. You will get shot in the back of the head before you realize anyone is nearby. Suck it up and move on, because war is hell.\n\nd) If your play area is noisy, for the love of Gygax put your mic on ptt. You're annoying everyone you pass by because the game has proximity chat. Basically if you have a headset and you're not muted, everyone can hear you. This goes double if you're in the dz and you're trying to be stealthy.\n\ne) Don't rush the game. There are tons of easter eggs and extra things to find that are just plain awesome. Take the time and explore, find hat there is to find, search out all the lore items. You won't be disappointed.\n\n----\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the game.

They promised so much and gave a hell of a show when promoting the game. So we waited. We sat on our hands and waited in order to keep from clapping at the idea of being able to roam around in a world so vast and changing, acquiring loot, meeting friends, and forming expansive teams along the way. The game looked awesome and boasted a lot of things to occupy your time. Then....it released.\n\nGraphics were dumbed down. Gameplay was repetitive. There was no guild/clan features. Matchmaking was buggy. Weapon and Gear bonuses and stats were incorrect. This plot of this game shifted from fighting in an environment that was devastated by a virus and more of a giant bug collection where you fumbled and crawled your way through all the pain brought on by the issues in the game just to experience what it was like to level up. And Ubisoft/Massive did little to help. Even now, after rolling out patch 1.2, they have broken more than they fixed. In fact we're all sure that they fixed nothing and uploaded a compiled file of bugs into the game instead. So let's list what we have here. Please read this carefully before you ever consider purchasing....or even playing for free.\n\nPros ::\n- The Game looks gorgeous\n- The equipment system is lovely\n- The personal appearance is pretty entertaining\n- Static clutter and objects are plenty and not stationary. (Shoot that rat. Smack that lamp)\n- The sounds are great. The ambience is just intense with headphones, which is good.\n- There are plenty of missions to choose from for the first 30 hours\n- The weapon modification system is nice\n- The gunplay is pretty decent\n\nCons :: (Hold on to your hat)\n- There are bugs. Bugs everywhere. I mean seriously, this game is made of bugs.\n- There is no customer service\n- Patches break a LOT more than they fix\n- Gameplay is VERY repetitive\n- NPCs can shoot through walls\n- Players get locked out of instances\n- Upon joining a match, there is a high chance you will fall through the map, get teleported out, and fall again.\n- Graphical bugs left and right. You'll see the poly blocks floating around where fog should be, etc.\n- The storyline is extremely boring\n- The game is nothing like the trailers. It has been dumbed down\n- The content you see from the E3 promotions? Totally inaccurate\n- The NPCs are all pretty much the same, only some have flamethrowers and some have armor.\n- The loading screens are EXCESSIVE. Every single thing you do prompts a loading screen. If you join a group from matchmaking, you load for 2 minutes. They can kick you during that 2 minutes. So your load screen resets before you even load in and, what, you're dropped where they SHOULD have been. Then it teleports you back to a safehouse and you load for another 2 minutes. Even for High end PCs, the load times are far too long and there is a sickening amount of things that call for them.\n- The Matchmaking, frankly, sucks. It will not match you with people within the range of your gear. So if you're trying to gear up, it just tosses you in an open slot. And if that group is geared and they don't like that you're not, you get booted. This makes joining groups for get into the DZ and missions in order to even get gear HARD. Of course, you get kicked and get to see those neat load screens.\n- The latency is iffy. I personally run on a fiber connection and the amount of lag that I see is ridiculous. You'll watch people scoot down walls. You'll see yourself teleport several feet from where you took cover. Etc.\n- The cover system is ALMOST acceptable, but it's not. Having your cover system default to the same button as your roll button is just bad. You'll try to move into cover and roll right past it.\n- A lot of the NPCs are overpowered. This game is punishment if you have to fight a group of NPCs that have shotguns. Not only can they 1 shot you, but they have armor. And they don't take cover and play smart. They RUSH you without regard of their own health. You have to pray that you and your group (if you have one) can kill them before they get close.\n- The DZ is boring. It's a lot of running around, shooting NPCs to get another level ladder crawling up, hoping you get loot. Then you get it, try to get back to extract it, and bam : some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is leagues above you kills you JUST to kill you. But, the DZ is one of the better places to get gear. Well tough ♥♥♥♥. Then again not a lot of people go Rogue since there's no benefit from it. The DZ is just boring.\n- It's also impossible to get a good DZ group unless you just run into someone in there and they decide to join you. Matchmaking is useless for this.\n- There is no endgame. Once you hit level 30 and fill out your equipment with Highend equipment....eh. You can go after and hunt the gearsets, but that's really just doing the same mission over and over and over and over and over and over and hoping that if something drops it's not the EXACT SAME THING you already have.\n- There is no clan/guild system. You can't do something as basic as create a clan/guild name, invite friends, and have a system to talk to people when in game. Oh no. you have to relay your conversations through Uplay IF you can meet anyone that plays in game....because, really, the game is pretty much dead.\n- Lastly for my list is that Ubisoft/Massive doesn't care. They promoted this game. They promised so much. They have so many resources available to make this an amazing experience...but they don't. Bugs that are gamebreaking are left in the game. Right now if you join a group, your UI doubles and you can't use it. This has led to people losing items. Gear. Skills being changed mid fight and wiping a group, etc. Where is the company? Where is the customer support? They're nowhere to be found because they have the money and that's the end of it.\n\nThis is an example of a DECENTLY enough game that's good for wasting time, if you're bored and have nothing better to do, that could have been great. Ubisoft/Massive failed this title. They got everyones hopes up, sold the game, and backed off. When other games do this, they get taken down from Steam and there is a widespread refund spree, but not in this case. People are still PRAYING that it gets as good as it should be and hold on by the skin of their teeth...but it won't. It's like they have 5 people who work on this title...2 days a week...for a few hours...and only if they want to. They let the community down. They let the Tom Clancy name down. They let every single person who spent $60 on this game down. And not because they didn't give us a decent platform to start with...but because once they realized they messed up they quit caring about it and us.\n\nThe Divison has been broken since day one. Almost everything they promised they removed. It's not as lush, vibrant, and expansive as they promised it was. We got the Hook and Switch. Now it's struggling to maintain an 8000 playerbase. So before you spend your hard earned money on this title...just don't. This is the game that COULD HAVE BEEN amazing, but it wasn't. This is the game that robbed us of our enthusiasm. This is the game that is dying a very sad and lonely death.","May 25","false","79.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","2"

But you can use explosive bullets or incendiary ammo to overcome that. Still, the enemies could definitely chug your ammo reserve.\n- Graphics are a blast in this game. GTX- 980 here, Runs on ultra with 55 to 65 fps. Messing with a couple of settings (a mixture of high and medium with SMAA in HIGH) gives me a  consistent 80+ fps.\n- I'd recommend playing with friends though.

You can't run in with a bunch of green items and be on a level playing field with somebody with blue items who has reconfigured the stats to maximize their damage with weapon or skill.\nYou can expect to unload FULL CLIPS into people's heads and not kill them if you don't play this game like an MMORPG.\n\nI've played The Division in the last two betas along with launch.

That is to say that I've done all the story missions and the same 3 side missions over and over until I hit level 30.\n\nSo far I'm feeling like there's absolutely no end game content at this point and there's nothing to do for level 30's except get killed by hackers in the dark zone. Yes, this game is FULL of hackers at level 30. The user's weapon stats are all saved client side and there's no check in place to make sure the files are unmodified so people can edit their stats to have damage be 1,000,000 (literally) and their armor stat be over 5,000 and they run around the darkzone just killing people for fun. (Edit:) I've looked into this issue more on the steam forums, and from my investigation, people are using CheatEngine. The simplest and most widely known file modification program around. I simply can't believe that Ubisoft didn't foresee this issue before the game launched since there was 'hacking' in the beta as well. Actually I can, it's Ubisoft. I've had this happen many times after reaching level 30.\n\nThe characters feel bland and uninteresting after you talk to them the first few times. Each safezone vendor has their own "personality", I put personality in quotation marks because they're simply different stereotypes that always stick to the same stereotypical archetype without fault. That is to say, one of them has allergies. No other character traits, literally just blathering on and on about the histamines and pollen in every single conversation. Then you have the stereotypical PTA homeowners association mother who's excuse for you doing her missions is that they're lowering the value of the neighborhood. There's the typical New York tough guy who threatens to 'crack ya head in' every chance he gets and so on. They're very boring, very repetitive and provide nothing to the story other than a different voice actor for the same 5 side missions over and over. They also seem to go out of their way to make note of the characters that are homosexual. Sure, that's all well and good but it's simply out of nowhere and just pandering for more attention. Sure Dr Kandal, I'll do a mission for you. Oh, you had a wife? Oh, and EX wife. Do you want me to save her? No? What's that? She's not even in the game? Why bother telling me then.\n\nAt this point, absolutely DO NOT spend more than 25 dollars on this wreck of a game, maybe once they finally add some content or fix the "hackers" if you can even call them that.\n\nUpdate: Incursions are out! I've never played them because of a bug when you attempt to join an Incursion in progress, you get stuck at a loading screen loop until you close out of the game and reopen it. But don't let that fool you, Ubisoft is patching the game. They've nerfed every farming method players have found so far. The Incursion update added a bug where each challenge mode boss would drop 4 high-end gear items. This was fixed in a hotpatch the day after Incursions were launched. Meanwhile; players are still falling through the ground for no explainable reason, getting booted off Ubisoft's god awful servers, getting CTD's hourly and, since the Incursion update, some players are even reporting their characters deleted with no word if they'll be recovered at all. All the while Ubisoft is busy patching all the bugs that don't affect players or the game in a negative way.\n\nFrom all of these "new" experiences with the game, I would absolutely recommend you to STAY AWAY from this game completely, ignore it even if it goes on sale. The game had potential but Ubisoft simply killed it with their typical business practices and only seem to be making it worse each update.\nI will gladly change my review to recommended when/if it ever becomes playable or enjoyable because it really truly did have a lot of potential and my hype for the game pre-launch was through the roof.","March 21","false","94.7"," 112 of 182 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","112","182","4","4"

And they are giving these "free" dlc's to keep the game awesome... that stuff was clearly left out of the game to make them cool and awesome giving free stuff to players when it should be in the game already? ugh.. again .. Well as you can see.. this game doenst rly let me write a positive review.. because it doensnt rly deserve one.. It's a meh.\n\nFor normal gamers.. you can put max 20-40 hours to actually enjoy it.. the rest of the gameplay after that is just repeating same missions you have done 50 times already to get better gear.. so you can actually survive in the boring Dark Zone.. that again.. is repetive farming for better gear.. The game is after the story just farming for good loot.. IT has no meaning rly.. it's boring.. I mean.. the entire city.. u just dont do anything there? Which is kinda sad.. You just do missions and DZ(dark zone)..\n\nI wanted a cool fallen city to explore.. do stuff.. but u know.. u dont do anything there after u have done the story.. Any honest person who played this will and could say that.. It's the truth.. so for the last time.. i say.. this game is MEH.. pretty ok.\n\nThe game leaves you feeling empty.. like.. is this it? It just doesn't touch you in any way...\n\nThis is it,  Sorry folks..  If i left you feeling confused with this horrible review.. i hope this video helps you get my opinion better out :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3ZHtSZZwuM","March 26","false","84.2"," 67 of 104 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","67","104","2","7"

It actually has a great back story as to why this all happened.  Everyone likes the idea of a a Shooter RPG...but this doesn't really do it.\n\nPayday 2 is a garbage company, but does the "feel" of the shooter much much much much better....from the beginner to to deathwish.  Its more fluid and just feels correct.   I would even say that Warframe feels a lot better mechanically and gameplay wise.  When you get hit, when you shoot, it feels correct.  Here, it does not.   I think the problem lies in the idea of trying to make a shooter a RPG MMO...not sure it can be done.    Let me explain this, please...\n\nIn a regular MMO, I have no problem with 89 lightning spells being cast to kill a mob.  In a shooter, I have a problem with unloading 984 bullets into a mob to kill it.  This sounds dumb, but it's true.  Magic spells, swords, demons, whatever, is one thing...bullets is another...I don't think you can make a shooter MMO and make it "feel" right.  Mobs are bullet sponges and it just feels wrong.  You can't give them more armor or hp and make it feel right in a shooter.\n\nThe game is exactly like Elite Dangerous, beautiful graphics/world, with nothing in it.  There is no life to the game, nothing going on, no people, no random encounters, no events, its NOT a living world.  It's just a graphically great world.\n\nIts 2016, they tried, and its not a $60 game.  $20 Indies that people have played 100+ hours on get drilled way more than this game does.\n\nI wanted more out of this from an AAA with 5+ years in development..you should too.","March 9","false","174.0"," 1,167 of 2,023 people (58%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","58","167","2","65","70"

You encounter more players in your average fifa game than you do in this game.\n\nThe story mode was fun (albeit a little repetitive), but entireliy too short. It was the only thing that gave me any joy from this game. The endgame consists of running the same mission over and over again or running around grinding "bosses" is the dark zone (calling them that is the eqivalent of calling a lamp post a "shining pillar of light", they are laughably easy and can be taken down in a matter of seconds).\n\nAll in all, if you like to play single player TPS games with a decent story, buy this game during the next sale. The story mode is acually more or less a moderately interesting single player experience. But if you are looking for a progress based game with challenging end game content look elsewere, the endgame here is utter ****.","March 23","false","72.5"," 168 of 282 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","168","282","8","5"

DZ) - is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as CS:GO/CoD/BF4 kiddie lobby. If you die to one of these kids, they will sit on top of you and BS talk you till you want to turn off your speaker system because it's Proximity/OPEN MIC to all. Then to top off, if you are able to snipe/sneak attack these kids in return, you get the "HAX! HACKER! CHEAT! BS! I'm going to /report you and enjoy losing your account". Normally I'd laugh it off, but the thing is ubi/masses actually ban people off of these reports. So if you have the kiddie team of 4 people reporting you in the DZ, say goodbye to your account.\n\n- PvP zone (Darkzone, aka. DZ) - there are actually TONS of hackers, cheat users, exploiters.\n\n- In general, if you use an exploite, ubi/masses actually stated they will punish the player for it, (Temp ban) so if you accidentally found a glitch, you are BANNED. What's the old saying? "Don't hate the player, fix the game" but does that make any sense to anyone? You're finding the company's flaws, and if you report it via video/emails there's a good chance you are banned for finding it.\n\n- The patches: instead of fixing things regarding the glitches, the company actually just push patches out that make things more broken: the recent fixes equipment switches/stacking stats/glitching through walls. Made it worst, by worst i mean it broke the server, constant lag, unable to connect, losing equipments (empty equipment slots, which is not possible)\n\n- The patches: there used to be a GOLD/named weapon drop called "Midas" it used to have its own special "Talent" which allows for critical hits to refill your signature skill (normal cooldown without anything: 10mins) cooldown to about 10 seconds. I agree it was overpowered, instead of fixing it, they disabled the ability for over 5 patches. Then when it comes time to reactivating the fix, it was dumb down, then all together removed. So if you are lucky enough to actually get this weapon before, it is worth less than ♥♥♥♥ now.\n\nSo wtf is good about this game?\n-graphics, neat\n-grinding, neat\n-bullying new players, if you're into that sort of ♥♥♥♥\n-playing without a class system\n-varity of tools and skills that not many uses due to the lacking of said skills and tools\n","May 7","false","269.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

As a whole this game is super repetitive and boring. Once you get to lvl30 you will literally do the same handful of things over and over and over and over... The dark-zone isn't fun at all, you run a farming route or get killed by rogues, over and over and over... Even with the new patch, it's more of the same tired old stuff that we have already done a thousand times. The game is just a REALLY long grind for some perfect piece/set of gear that is ultimately useless once you get it. There's no sense of reward or accomplishment, just time wasted. I'm all for wasting my time and everything, but there's much better ways to do it than by playing The Division.

This game is fun, but the end-game just isn't satisfying at all.\n\n- The Dark-Zone is a PvP zone where there is little to no PvP. If you do decide to shoot another player and go Rogue, the reward to punishment ratio for not making it out of the Rogue state is 1-20. So why would you risk going rogue for +1000xp when you die and get -20,000 xp, -30,000 DZ funds, -# DZ Keys?\n\n- There are multiple areas of the Dark zone that don't even work (i.e. Mid-town Music, Abandoned Gas Station,etc). On top of that, some areas don't even respawn when they should so you will have areas listed as active where there is no loot and no enemy NPC's.\n\n- Shotgun rushes on challenging missions. Yes you can complete the mission, but get used to falling back and playing like a puss.\n\n-DELTA error. This game has a lot of server issues where you will just dc in the middle of a fight and then spawn back in right on top of enemies.\n\n---\nThis game is great while you are leveling, but as soon as you enter the end-game raids or the Dark Zone, prepare to enter the most boring/frustrating grind in an "rpg."

The only reason why I'm giving this game a "no" vote for now, is because of the rampant bugs that I'm receiving left and right.\n\n-I cannot fire my First Aid skill unless I double-tap the skill button, meaning I can only heal myself and a small radius around me.\n\n-Sometimes, you get stuck in items and actors without even trying. The doors will trap you sometimes, the JTF forces can noclip you through the map, and enemies will sometimes clip through objects to get to you.\n\n-If you're standing on top of an object that's below the fall-damage line, you have to struggle to get your character to jump off, which means that you're stuck looking like a dying fish out of water for thirty seconds while you sprint into an invisible wall and roll around on a 4x4 box.\n\n-There is a VERY RARE glitch that has a regular one-chevron enemy 4 levels lower than you just one-shot you without even trying, ignoring any cover you're behind and any armor you have. This one is the most frustrating to me.\n\nRegardless of all of these, I still love playing this game. I would buy it again.

Played about 237 hrs. tl:dr opinion: Just press the back button of your browser. Paid content for season pass will come at summer and i wont even download it.\n\n-----\n\n1- Lies\nEverything about this game is a huge lie. I cant express how this community-developer gone sad, when developer say something on the stream or anywhere, player can be sure it IS a lie. Because they lied so many times, not like implying things but straight up lies. Examples: Season pass owner should've got so many things by now (Exclusive Drops, Montly Events and Sports outfit.) What people get is a level 7 weapon that you will never use (you'll get it at level 8, its a shotgun which no one use), montly events is "under development" yet they still advertises with season pass, exclusive drops are just bunch of craps that you can farm at 3 minutes. And we had a promise for "Sports Outfit" which they advertised with season pass and they said "Oh ♥♥♥♥ it, we never said it'll be free, pay for it guys." These are straight up lies with many others at developer streams. I just cant take it anymore, i'll just hate the all the development team.\n\n2-The Biggest Wasted Opportunity\nThe city is HUGE, not only that is AWESOME, like they create a beautiful city and say "♥♥♥♥ the rest". You'll only stay in it and grind till level 30 (40 hrs) then you will never see it. With the patch 1.2 they try to make you replay the city but it just dont work.\n\n3-Cheaters\nAfter level 30 (if not earlier) you have to grind at Dark Zone always. Which is a nest for cheaters. The game uses client trust protocol which means you can do whatever cheat you want, teleport around, kill all the server with one single shot etc. And since best loot is in the Dark Zone you have to go there and get killed by a cheater. After patch 1.1 they banned "many" cheaters but Ubisoft is the worst publisher in term of an anti-cheat. It just dont exist, Massive is banning people manually which would take years to ban all cheaters. GG.\n\n4-Poorly Designed Loot System\nThe city is good but this is a LOOT-GRIND game, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up the loot system you dont have a game. And by looking other games from the genre like Destiny or Diablo, this game, by far, has the poorest design. They create many different weapons and armor pieces with each of them has 4-12 ability or option WHICH all of them vary. The thing is you need 1 SPESIFIC one that actually you can use (or the BIS item for you [best in slot]) you cant craft it so you have to loot for it, and your chance is %0.0000000001 if not less, there is not a SINGLE player who compleated his/her armor weapons without cheating. So most of time you go Dark Zone, grind for 4-5 hours, get the base check your loot, DECONSTRUCT ALL for crafting material which give you material for 1 try, try crafting, fail. Aaaaaand ZERO. Imagine doing this for 2-3 weeks, if you enjoy this, buy the game.\n\n\nThere are many issues other than those but i tired, they MAY resolve in the future (I bet my 100 bucks that they wont), until then please beware.","June 1","false","237.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The story starts of intruiging and captivating, and after a few hours into the game it continues to be so. However, from a gameplay standpoint the game never changes. It's always one of a few events pulled out of a grab bag for what encounter you'll experience next when completing missions. However, this is a cross breed of an MMO and a Third-Person-Shooter, so some grinding and repetition is to be expected, but i feel as if the balances in this game between innovative gameplay and senseless repetition are off.\n\nThe graphics in this game are quite gorgeous, and the audio is very nice. There were some graphical bugs, but not anything I felt the need to become exasperated over, since no game is without some bug and this one was minor.\n\nOverall, barring more specific examples, this game is a midly interesting production of a corporation who uses a buisnessmans approach to a game rather than an artists approach. It could have been done better, but it could have also been worse.

As a player there's a massive frustration in seeing something that could have been an absorbing and amazing game reduced to tedium by the design rather than technical or artistic limitations.\n\nThis is before we get to the darkzone stuff which is meant to be endgame, but there's still some clear design confusion over whether this is meant to be a long-term MMO or short-term story with multiplayer tacked on. It's a decent concept but at the moment broke in the implementation, and quickly becomes a grind with a clear risk/reward issue around going rogue. In terms of multiplayer (and overall game) longevity, this is Borderlands - there's some, but nobody still plays Borderlands now, right?\n\nIn summary, this is not a *bad* game, but comes frustratingly - visually and technically - close to being an amazing one, then is massively let down by game design to below mediocrity.\n","March 17","false","36.9"," 68 of 113 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","68","113","4","0"

People were enjoying it, yet there were still bugs and glitches, but it was still a great game.\nIt all got ♥♥♥♥ed over when Ubishit tried updating aspects of the game. Instead of just fixing things, they created new problems from those fixes. And it just kept adding up and up and up until it became a ♥♥♥♥♥torm.\nThe addition of new content was short breaths of fresh air. Fresh, yet short lived. A lot of what made grinding for gear fun was completely wiped and those that were lucky to become OP in the early stages of the game have become even more OP. A complete divide between OP players running around going rogue in the Dark Zone and other players looking to get better loot because things like Incursions are either too difficult, not their level, not their taste or simply dont want to, getting screwed over by higher levels.\nThe Dark Zone (PVP) aspect of the game was great. People could gather loot, extract it without worrying about it being taken away, all the while facing competition from AI or other players, which was a tremendous idea.... until update 1.2. Update 1.2 now allowed players in the dark zone to steal the loot off of other people as they were extracting. Now, instead of extracting and leaving to get more loot, now you have to make sure you protect it, which was an incredibly dumb idea. The moment I heard about that part of the update, was the moment I knew that the game had seriously gone downhill, and that Ubisoft had not only completely screwed over fans, but also screwed over their game\nOverall, if this review came out a week after launch, it would have been a solid 7/10 for me. But now, it drops down to a dissapointing 3/10\nPick it up, Ubisoft. First the AC trilogy goes downhill, now this? This is definitely not their best work.

Ende.\nThis game is what would happen to the matrix movie if Neo took the blue pill!\n\nI’ve actually gave it another chance and waited for a first patch to post an honest review.\nI've also put decent amount of hours into it, playing it solo and with friends, trying to cover all the "alleged aspects" of the game, by actually playing it.\n\n\nLet's start with a few obvious negative points:\n\n- Repetitive\nAfter few interesting encounters when i started the game it became so repetitive that i caught my self falling asleep in cover several times, seriously.\n\n- Item junkyard simulator\nThere is just too many same items in the game and yes game suffers from all those problems of generic mmos.\nOne of them being you need no single item bought or found before you reach end game.\nThe only difference being most of those games went free to play nowadays.\nAlso dismantle of items just magically works wherever you are, no need for anything specific, how convenient...\nEven in a games where you have magic as main theme you need some kind of skill or "table&tools" etc...\n\n\n- No trade\nApart from primitive form of item exchange in instanced missions.\n\n- No market\nNo player driven market or even auction house of some sort.\nIt makes grinding even more dull.\n\n- Oversimplified things, catered to the kakapos!\nThis is simply the main theme of the game.\nUnbelievably simple game in general.\nOne example would be GPS nav.\nWTF is up with GPS guiding? Why?\nI honestly can not comprehend the ignorance to make such a mistake. You make a gorgeous map representing magnificent NYC, with\nso much effort put into details like graffitti, which are  stunningly looking by the way;\nIn trash cans garbage made so it doesn't feel generic and copy pasted and so on....\nNo seriously, if you stop for a moment and wander on your own in the city, you would be amazed by the level of detail and effort put into it.\nAND THEN you make a GPS faking line that is in the middle of your screen guiding you as if you were intellectually challenged person, from point A to point B, making sure you see nothing and remember nothing of the city they’ve put several years into making.\n\n-Crafting\nIt is insultingly simple. In the lack of better explanation.\nThis is another aspect of game which feels like delivered on plate already, you need 0 intellectual effort.\nIn contrary to deconstructing items you actually have to "teleport" to a base and approach a desk where you can construct anything you want from 5 types of materials in 3 different colors. Amount you can carry with you is unlimited though.\nIf i give it a serious thought, I doubt that all those items you carry would fit into small truck let alone man with backpack, but hey, I’m starting to be picky about game immersion am I not. NOT.\n\n- No Open World and falsely advertized as sandbox/openworld\nInstanced to the bone.\nThe only "open" area is Dark Zone which is further bracketed and instanced for players with higher and lower gear score and level.\n\n-MONEY&Currency\n\nThat is the most ♥♥♥♥♥ up concept in most games today and this one does not miss the well.\nIn the lack of imagination, i guess, they implemented, not One, but 5 different currencies in the game!\nAs a result making the main currency obsolete, period.\nI mean you can buy ♥♥♥♥, but then again in 10 minutes of game play you outgrown it and sell it again.\nThat concept/flaw is known to some games, but those are dating back to 2003 and have a good excuse by patching old wounds.\nNot an excuse for a 2016 game, specially in that price range.\n\n\n-Endgame\nIt seams that they abandoned the concept of PvP endgame and now rushing to make anything PvE wise.\nCheat protection still non existent to date.\nThis is even more interesting if you start to dig deeper and come to understanding that the core of the game is client side computed.\nThis fact erases even hope to prevent cheating in the future.\n\n\n-PvP\nThe idea that someone had is actually good and there it stops.\nRisk / reward PvP system i mean. It could have been brilliant.\nBut then somehow it seams they just shied away from committing to it.\nWhat I actually saw in a promotional trailer from 2014 and 2015 blew me away. 4 guys on the extraction zone\nwent Rogue on each other, because of loot, which most found amazing, imagine the balls...re precautions if they were your friends etc...\nWhat we’ve got is not that you can not go rogue on your friends, there is NO Friendly fire even.\nAgain oversimplyfied and catered to the kakapos!\n\n\nThe GOODZ\n\nTo be perfectly honest game has some seriously good engine.\nAnimations are fluid and feel natural.\nMovement, specially from cover to cover, is really good.\nAnimations in general look stunning.\nDynamic weather etc..\n\nShooting\nVariety of sound effects and behavior of diverse guns.\n\nEye candy explosions and graphics.\n\nCity and texture details of the game are really solid.\n\n\nVoice overs are excellent.\n\nAtmosphere.\nWhen you are in instanced, solo campaign, map it really feels deserted, as if appocalipse has struck.\n\nIdea of game is great.\n\nAI is actually very solid.\n\n\nVerdict>\n\nIt really disspleases me to say that i can not recommend this game, it really does.\nIt seems that The Division is yet another example of "corporate management over product" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\nIt is so obvious that the decision makers of this game had only one thing on their mind.\nI often found myself asking the question did they even tried to play their own game.\nBy playing the game, it really speaks trough cracks that those decision makers of the game actually do not play games and have no idea what a game, in general, should be about.\nAt the end i feel sorry for all the missed opportunity, for all those awesome and talented designers and developers that were involved.\nHaving all that talent and resources on disposal and make so many common sense mistakes for an mmo it just can not be more than average product in the end.\n\nAs a final verdict to the game i would like to paste the link to video review that i find very honest and a bit deeper then those generic\nreviews of today, which seem to be focusing only on few aspects and missing what games should be about.…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTBcuZTPIEk\n\n\nThank y’all friends foes and all mfs that i played against or along with.","April 13","false","125.3"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","22","31","0","0"

After buying this game I will be more careful in my future purchases. This game is not worth the asking price.  The trailer that originally got me interested in the game is nothing like what it really is. The end product is a Destiny wannabe with zero Tom Clancy feel.  The story is bland and the voice acting is just pathetic.  Zero effort to make you feel like you are a special agent helping save a city.  You start the game off like most by making your character.  This game is sappose to be new and amazing and the character creation options are barren.  Its almost a slap in the face how few options there are.  You get very little customization so you end up looking like every other Agent running around.   The Dark Zone is the only open world part, and most likely people will only be trying to kill you there instead of team up or help obtain loot.  Leveling up from 1-30 can be fun at times but there is alot of running around.  You can fast travel back and forth but it still makes getting around boring.  I guess bikes and cars got affected by the Virus???  Once you get to lvl 30 the game kind of hits the brakes.  The only goal you will have is to better your gear.  Sadly the end game is where the lack of content is.  Your options are go to the Dark Zone and hope you get lucky there or do dailies for Phoenix Credits and buy fancy blueprints from the vendors.  Even after farming the Dark Zone and farming Phoenix credits  there is still a lack of things to do.  They make you replay the same missions over and over and over.   I feel as if they just rushed this game out and its missing so much content.  They are trying to sell you a $60 completed game but its not worth it in the end with a lack of things to even keep you wanting to play more..  Wait till it's super cheap or get it for free if offered with some new computer parts you purchased.  I got my 100 + hours out of it and I guess thats the only posotive.  I'd suggest staying away from this game until it gets its ♥♥♥♥ together.

I followed this game since it was first teased I believe some time back in 2012.  Back then the game looked gorgeous, I remember when the first gameplay trailer came out and the game truly looked like a game of the future, with a dynamic world and stunning picturesque graphics.  I am writing this review out of solemn disappointment as I know many players of this game will agree with me, Ubisoft has really ♥♥♥♥ed up big this time.  I played the game tonight, in hopes of finding any sort of recollection with the game after the 1.2 patch.  Decided to try the new Incursion to see if my problems from the last one were solved.  I have not been able to even remotely come close to finishing either Incursion since they were released.  The only piece of high level gear I have was purchased from a combination of a pheonix credit reward plus farming the daily and weekly missions for a couple of weeks.  The game has turned into a complete and utter disappointment and although I know I will inevitably play it once I know that many of the broken aspects of the game have been fixed, for now, Ubisoft has lost me.  I will end my review by saying one more thing to Ubisoft...LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY!

They hyped the crap out of this game and made it look *much* more immersive than it really is.  You spend all your time essentially doing the same thing: killing bad guys who might drop better gear so you can kill tougher bad guys who might drop better gear so you can kill tougher bad guys.....\n\nThe sense of realism is pretty good in that they put a rediculous amount of effort into the graphics and details of the world.  The realism shatters however when you realize you can carry many hundreds of bullets, and the enemy bosses are so tough that you'll need every last one and more.  It's no fun to hope for headshots as you dodge a bullet-resistant boss's shots for long stretches at time.  I wonder how much better the game would be if they didn't spend so much effort on the graphics and details and instead went for enhancements to the playability or variety of encounters?\n\nThe sense of community is absent.  Sure you can link up with people but the in-game microphone system is not intuitive so everyone I've played with has it on automatic and all I hear is the sound coming out of their speakers, which is usually similar the sound coming out of my headphones but with a delay so I have to turn off the in-game voip completely.  If one dork in the group has it configured wrong, the entire group cannot communicate and the system fails.  So much for teamwork.\n\nAlso the game requires a 3rd party always-online account called Uplay.  I hate it when developers force me to use stuff that adds nothing to the game.  Literally nothing.  I can communicate with my friends through Steam, why did the developer spend their resources trying to make a system to compete with that and then force me to use it?  It's stupid.\n\nI'm sad I was suckered into buying this game.  You should learn from my mistake.","May 8","false","14.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Gorgeous environments and the story is actually interesting. Playing on your own going around doing quests, listening to random phone messages, shooting dirtbags and having the story unfold is a lot of fun. I'm a sucker for a fps rpg (I bought a lifetime subscription for Hellgate London.. it uh.. didn't work out) and this one has great weapon itemization a fun story and a combat system that while not overly complex doesn't get boring after a handful of firefights.\n\nNow the bad. While there is a great variety of weapons to use they missed the mark on character customization. Very few options when creating your character to make it unique. BUT they may have thought of this because there are seemingly hundreds of vanity items you can collect to customize your character. Hooray!!.. well NO because it's 500 hats all called different things that look the same. No matter how much you mix and match you will still look like everyone else. Unless perhaps you pay real money and buy an outfit pack for $5. Then you might look a LITTLE different. A deal breaker? ehh.. not really but I like to feel my character is unique in my rpgs even if the roleplaying is only in my head.\n\nNow the real bad. The team making decisions on how to manage this game baffles me. Their quality control is a joke. Caught flat out hacking and murdering everyone in sight? Have a 3 day vacation, keep all those items you got though. Found a glitch that lets you get the finest end game loot with no effort? We will fix that... eventually... but in the meantime farm away. Then when you get bored you can roflstomp the casuals who didn't grind out exploits. They literally put out their first (and likely only) free content addition to the game and within a day tons of people have the best loot in the game without having to earn any of it. why go back and do earlier content for worse gear? Also people doing things legit are even MORE screwed because they made crafting way more expensive. Very low risk to exploit developers mistakes because they don't even ban people using third program hacks!\n\nTLDR: Fun game.. for awhile but unless they get serious about punishing exploiters/hackers the end game is a hot mess and zero fun for anyone.","April 14","false","62.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

With all the hours poured in you downvote the game?\n- Yes, I do\n\nReview v 1.1\n\n1. World\n\nThis stunning hand-crafted NY city is as beautiful as it is empty. When you grinding towards level 30, you are completing unique story missions along with absolutely unimaginative obligatory side missions.  Upon completion of all the activities (takes about 14 hours if you do not rush anything) you are stuck with absolutely useless NY city. There are no real random or special encounters on the streets of NY after you reach level 30. It feels empty and I wonder why the put so many effort in decorating city which is 15-hours-long-and-the-gone.\n\n2. Mechanics\n\nThere are a lot of bugs and inconsistencies all over The Division and they all add up to the overall frustrating experience we get as an endgame. From exploits that let players get the loot instantly and then troll the dark zone newbies to bugs with perks and talents, jammed guns and skills delay / miscasts / double cooldowns and so on. Sadly, there is nothing behind that cinematic beauty we have been fed up with but poor execution. I will not be detailed here as there is so much broken in the game that I doubt they can fix it even in a year.\n\n3. Endgame\n\nIn my opinion the endgame in The Division is a non-stop mindless grindfest for items that you don’t care about. Maybe a little PvP on top but that’s it. You get the best gear and then you kill all the weaker agents in the dark zone simply because almost everyone are within the same 161+ gear score bracket.\n\n3.1 Loot\n\nMassive is simply screwing people about loot. I do accept that this type of game involves grind but not of extent that you farm dark zone, missions for tens of hours so you get  nothing  better in return. There are different kinds of problems with the loot but the core thing is it  not feels rewarding at all .\n\n3.1.1 Grinding\n\nBelieve me when I say this is a mindless grind. It really doesn’t matter whether you exploit or do not (so you will have to waste enormous amount of time as I did) it will take a lot of hours for you to get something useful. It would have been a bit better if you get a truck of useless stuff and then you make something useful from it. But no, the equipment is scarce even though it is complete crap in most of the cases. The  wow effect  will instantly vanish when you see that the first high-end / set item you get is actually worse than your epic purple. And the second, and then the third. Damn, what’s wrong with this game? Have they checked out Diablo 3 and Destiny lessons learned?\nWant to add about Division Tech grind. Yes, you can farm it only in the dark zone and it will take ages for you to farm it even with boosted chance of drop because crafting takes so much of it for each ♥♥♥♥ roll you do that you can spend entire weekend for div tech farm ending up with nothing.\n\n3.1.2 Crafting\n\nGenerally, crafting it is not a bad thing. Bad thing here is that it is the most reliable way of getting decent equipment. And the most reliable way is full of random. Random stats, random effects, random talents with 90% of them being completely useless. I am extremely lucky that I get best-in-slot guns after 10 to 20 rolls but still I have that amount of hours in because I farm materials for these rolls. I have seen people that exploited hell out of Hornet, Bullet King etc., rolled for hundreds of high-end vector and did not get a single decent one. That’s simply frustrating.\nWith 1.1 update they aimed to divert people from crafting through.. increasing amount of materials required to craft. Well, that’s cool but it is not punishing at all for exploiters or for those who are already in decent gear (so they farm high-ends for materials) – it is punishing for those who are still level up. You can get decently geared in a day (of playtime) if you have a good team but that is almost a month for casual players (assuming 10 hours/ week or less). Okay, you trying to show people that crafting is not the best way but are there any others really? Sure you can farm DZ for high-ends quickly reaching a certain gear score within 180ish bracket and then slowly making it into 190ish bracket. You can farm Incursion for the 214 gear (challenge mode). With a good team you can do it in 25 mins but I guarantee you will fail at least several times beforehand.\n\n3.1.3 Talents and stats\n\nThere are a lot of useless talents and stats on both weapons on gear (say hi to additional experience gain for level 30 characters, but wait, do they need one after they reached the level cap already?). There are a lot of stats that really doesn’t significantly add up to your survival skills. Useful stats and talents compromise something like 10% of all currently in-game. Weapons are simply imbalanced - there are obvious choices for PvP and PvE .\n\n3.1.4 Gear Score\n\nThis is innovation made life so easier for.. who exactly? You think that higher gear score is better? Higher rarity of item is better? Well, think again. Same mistake was done in Diablo 3 before Reaper of Souls and here we go again. I have 191gs set items  WAY BETTER than 240gs set items. And that’s not some weird one case – I still have a few 191 pieces I cannot improve after don’t-know-how-many times passed Challenging Incursion.\n\n3.2 Skills and builds\n\nI have experimented with builds for a while but there is nothing in game that really rewards altering your playstyle. Aside from playing technician on Incursion there is no point of other build than “SMG + M1A First Wave, Firearms + Stamina, Pulse + Heal + Survivor Link”. If you claim that your build is better,– you simply haven’t met SMG-M1A build of your level yet.\nSpend several hours tweaking your playstyle and equipment and you will see that there are clearly a set of skills that are better than others. There is no real balance here and the game is constantly pushing you to a certain way of playing.\nI have to mention “exploit cover” skill, or how Massive calls it – mobile cover. This skill needs to be deleted from the game (sorry, 1% of players) for the greater good.\n\n4. Dark Zone\n\nPvP experience at its finest - thought MassiSoft.\n\n4.1 Area\n\nWhile it looks big at first, you will soon realize how small it is. You will, literally, farm 4-5 spawn points for materials and div tech all days long. Shoot, extract, run, repeat. The chance of good drop is so small that you can play for 100 hours and get just a couple of decent items. And all glitches and exploits apply to this zone as well.\n\n4.2 Gear score brackets\n\nThis system would be nice if we had more gs brackets. Currently, guys with 161gs (~30 hours of play) and 222gs (~250 hours of play assuming best-in-slot gear) are placed within the same zone and so the is how Massive defines PvP experience. A one-shot zone for everyone.\n\n4.3 Cheaters\n\nC’mon, Ubisoft. You are doing this to us over and over again. Anti-cheat system doesn’t exist in Ubisoft titles and this game follows the rule.\n\nThis list is in no way an exhaustive list of flaws but it provides the same impression I have about this game. Overall the game is 5/10 at most.. Hope my review helps.\n\nDisclaimer: With all the words said, I still appreciate the work done and I know that developing games is not an easy job. It is just frustrating to see that another promising title turned into who-knows-what due to poor execution. Let's not be too harsh on developers - let them try to fix it.\n\nUbisoft is very good at marketing and innovating but they suck at execution so much that you will hate yourself for buying their game. Again.\n\nOut of chars.","April 19","false","281.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymboL/recommended/365590/","SymboL","SymboL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymboL/","86 products in account","TL:DR\n\nInteresting story, cool combat, good voice acting, I don't know about the current PVP ( I only played Dark Zone in the betas ).  Good game in my opinion, but don't buy it if you are expecting it to be like DayZ (Survival, heavily based on trying to stay alive in NY) or COD (Fast paced and frantic). More like a modern day Borderlands 2 (Fun looting, good times with your teammates, enjoyable and intriguing story, with a good cooperative element).\n\nI think this game gets too much crap for how good it actually is. I mean half of them are complaints about Uplay, PVP, and downgraded graphics. Give it a shot, and with some friends too.\n\n\nI got hyped for this game for a couple of reasons. My love for modern day shooters, apocolyptic atmospheres, and the system of looting and advancing your gear to fight other bad guys. The graphics looked great a few years ago, but let's not take about that (P.S. Ubisoft downgraded the graphics hardscore). I played both the closed and open betas. They were very fun and boosted the amount of hype I had for the upcoming title. They were alright except for many bugs and glitches that people exploited. Anyways, let us go on to the game.\n\nLooting System. It's sort of slow-paced. You have to play multiple missions or encounters or side missions to be able to purchase good stuff in the venders and stuff. But it shouldn't be a problem to most people.\n\nCharacter custumization. Nothing special. You got your basics and some accesories. Not out of the world Black Desert kind of stuff.\n\nUser Interface. It looks nice, but it isn't as cool as you would expect in such a big game.\n\nUplay. Please. For the love of god. Ubisoft can just ♥♥♥♥ off with their stupid--\n\nStory. It's a good one. Even though I haven't finished the game, you can't help but get sucked into it. Without spoiling the plot, each mission slowly builds up into the bigger picture of the story and some will make you think about the actual possibility of a virus spread on banknotes.\n\nAtmosphere. It's beautiful, capturing really good details and areas of modern New York. The roaming civis in the streets struggling are a good plus, as well as the interactive ones that reward you for donating consumables to them.\n\nCombat. As you all know, this is a RPG. That means tanky enemies with high HP. It can be slow and boring by yourself if you don't have the right weapons and gear for the difficulty, but that can be easily fixed by getting a couple of friends to play with you. NPCs all have nice dialouge and good audio to them. The AI is smart but not lifelike.\n\nPVP. I can't say much because I've played like 10 minutes of it since launch. The NPCs have been buffed a lot from the betas, so I would reccommend reaching mid to end game before entering the PVP area.\n\nOverall Score\nLooting : 7/10\nGraphics : 7.5/10\nStory : 10/10\nCharacters/NPCS : 6.8/10\nPVP : N/A\nUI : 4.5/10\nUplay : KillYourSelfUbisoft\n\nI like the game, but there are postives and negatives to it. But the pros outweigh the cons, making this a game that I was proud of preordering back in December.","March 10","true","83.4"," 266 of 483 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","266","483","10","4"

I was again, wise to wait. As much as I love upgrading my character, and building gear that will headshot and make that sweet sound, I cant play it anymore. I am fed up with the game crashing and the maps glitching out making it unplayable. From the hackers in the DZ to the farming in the free roam there is no way to fully enjoy what SHOULD make this game great. I've never played Destiny but I am aware of the comparisons. And I'm sure they have had their issues. But Ubi does not seem to care about fixing the problems. You may or may not enjoy this game until you 've reached level 30.

The amount of hackers in the dark zone and in the game period are ridiculous. A person will work all day to get from 80+ DZ rank, say 83 to 84 , and hacker shows up with saved teleport spots and drop you. The same thing happens if you go rogue too. You're honestly better off trying to farm NPC's with the horrendous XP they give you. Cause heaven forbid if you die you've lost the last hours work. That on;y way you can really defend yourself against the hackers is to A. Stay out of the dark zone, or B. get the hacks yourself but then you get reported and banned for trying to help police the game. The best part about the hackers is that even if you upgrade your anti-cheat, someone will find a backdoor and then the coder will probably make it undetectable if anything and it'll be right back in the game. Maybe there could be a conference between another company that has a badass anti-cheat system and there could be points. As for the mobile cover, this has been a complaint for quite some time and rather than disabling it, you choose to fix mundane things like not having people blow up the APC with sticky bombs in falcon's lost. Sadly, The Division used to be a game a highly recommended to my fellow gamers and now after playing some 300+ it's absolute garbage. It's not even worth the sixty dollars I paid for on steam, I'd have rather spent the money on dark souls.","April 29","false","413.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsta_tv/recommended/365590/","monsta_tv","Monsta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsta_tv/","47 products in account","Tom Clancey's The Division is a complete let down, it has almost nothing going for it, it does not have a good story, it does not have good end-game content, it does not have a good multiplayer experience, it does not have good game mechanics, and it just fails at what it is meant to do. I will be going through everything I mentioned in detail and at the end give it a rating out of 10.\n\n- The only thing you can give this game credit for is the graphics and its amazing recreation of Manhatten. It has some of the best graphics in the industry and features some neat things like global illumination and a descent level of interaction with the enviroment, although sadly graphics cannot make up for the failures this game has.\n\n-The story in the game does not have a purpose and at the end it leaves you wondering what your work meant to the story at large or for the future of the game, you don't make any connections with any characters, and you feel disconnected with the enviroment and struggle shown around you.\n\n-When you complete the lack-luster "campaign" you are greeted with four options, repeat the missions you have done at a higher difficulity (Stronger and more bullet sponges), do the meaningless side quests that are litered around the map,  venture into the unforgiving darkzone that is litered with hackers or take your skills into the incursions at a chance to snag amazing gear. There is not much more to do outside of these options other than to explore Manhatten, which only lasts for so long\n\n-The Darkzone as it stands now  is not very fun, at the launch of this game it was not much of a PVP zone but rather a walled off area with higher level enemies with the best gear in the game and a mechanic that made PVP a unforgiving and somewhat annoying experience, while PVP has been improved in terms of its mechanics you are now greeted with a large amount of cheaters who know their actions will not be punished thanks to the largely flawed anti-cheat system that has no worth. Hopefully this can be changed in future updates but as of now it is a annoying experience.\n\n- The mechanics of this game have had its problems since the start but continue to be the same with some ironed out,  and while some players will disagree with me I stand firm with my opinions on how this game is played out. To start, there should be no place in any game where you are almost always confronted with a enemy that is completely broken, and I refer to Shotgun wielding enemies that are very annoying for all but the highest level players. They become a annoying problem in some missions where you are pitted against multiple yellow bar'd shotgun weilders in a close space, specifically "Falcon Lost" and the one where you kill Lauren. They prove to be an almost impossible feat in these missions as they have a large amount of heal, a powerful weapon that will kill a player in one or two shots at an incredible range, and the usual groups of 5-8 that they come in.  Another mechanic is the cover system, which provides very little benefit as you forced to stay in cover to avoid taking damage or pop-up  in most cases and be instantly killed, from my experience I have seen most players avoid forced cover and use objects taller than the player model to shoot from that allow the player to only have their weapon sticking out.\n\n\nAs of now I would rate this game at a 3/10 due to its many,many faults, but I hope and pray that future updates will make this game into one of the best Open world games out today.\n\n*Update* I don't think I have ever disliked a developer as much as I like Massive, looks like the only thing Swedish devlopers can do is make games that look good and nothing esle. Maybe a kick in the teeth (Getting laid off) will hopefully start making developers test out their games and their extra content before throwing it out to the public. I wish developers would own that their piece of ♥♥♥♥ game is a failure and work with the community that buys their games. We need a Gordon Ramsay of video game development to go to developer studios and tell them how bad their games are.","May 23","false","91.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Graphics are great and some elements do resemble NYC closely. Once you get past the graphics in the first two or three hours of gameplay, you are left with perhaps the most repetitive and boring game out there; I quite often felt like I was playing Rambo for the Sega Master System or Cabal. Seriously, even the multiplayer mode gets old extremely quick. Patches are only making the game a lot worse, the game does not load up half the time, however my PC easily runs the game (when it runs) at max parameters/settings with no stutter or sweat at all. The little "parkour" in this game sucks, and will quite often get you killed, specially if set on auto when your character will try jump over a fence rather than going trough the open gate right in front of you while being chased, or when you are trying to get cover but your character decides to climb the crate or obstacle instead leaving you 100% vulnerable to become a cheese gratter. Now this is where things get really bad: The dark zone, a PvP area for farming and the end-game portion left after clearing the main story, is riddled with hackers; no fun at all, very frustrating and infuriating. You are dead on your tracks at this point unless you are a hacker. And what for? Nothing, since there is nothing else to do. Not worth it.\n\n\nI am done with everything Tom Clancy and UBI soft related. I really wanted to like this game specially after shelling out $60. A total waste of good cash. I would hesitantly recommend this game only if it goes on sale for under $5. Want to try a game with a lot of content, good graphics, fun single player and multi-player, parkour done right, excellent support and a lot cheaper?

The community in the game is not that great and many routinely use exploits/hacks/cheats in PvP. The developers will plug one leak and another one will pop up. Because of the community in the game it is almost as if the players that play legit are being punished for not using exploits. Progressing is near impossible without cheating the system in some kind of way. I was hoping the first incursion that was added to the game will fix issues and bring a new layer of fun to the game but that quickly proved to be not true. Overall the idea of The Division is fantastic and the world is amazing to explore and very well mode but the delivery of the system is poor. I went into the game really wanting to love the game and invested a good amount of hours into the game and tinkered with my build to be more effective in the dark zone but it was all for not when playing against people who can one-shot you from across the map (literally getting sniped by someone while in a building in DZ6 and he or she is in DZ1.","May 9","false","263.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atlismoral/recommended/365590/","Atlismoral","Bo0tyJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atlismoral/","215 products in account","A great game made by Ubisoft, one of the only games I don't mind using Uplay for (as terrible as it is).\n\nThe firefights are like any other MMORPG but with the use of assualt rifles, and other gun-type weapons. There's nothing over the top like a flamethrower, this game has a pretty nice sense of reality. Enemies are bullet sponges, but that's how every other MMO chooses to have it, so I never found a problem with it.\nGoing into a firefight against enemies that are barely higher level then you (3-4 levels higher) shows the balance between them, showing a sign of progression and leveling.\n\nThe questing is different in a good and a bad way.\nGood way being there is a main story line, each story mission mixes gameplay and story-telling very nicely, although players are usually grinding away at them trying to reach level 30. The main story alone would probably take about 8-10 hours of gameplay, NOT including the side missions and the weapons you have to get to achieve them.\n\nThe bad side of questing are the side missions. There's 3 different types of side missions, each one is in a different location (the voice lines in the same type of side mission are literally copied and pasted). There's also encounters, which are almost useles to do until endgame when the main story doesn't give you enough resources to get your main base to 100%.\n\nThe weapons are balanced from each other, the better rarity you have the more stats and special weapon unlocks you'll get.\n\nNow the bad part.\n\nThe rarity system in this game is TERRIBLE. The system goes as shown, gold being the rarest and highest of value.\n[0list]\nWhite\nGreen\nBlue\nPurple\nGold\n\nAt first, it seems there's nothing wrong with that, but let me explain something else. At level 10-15, you will literally never get a purple for your level, they simply just won't drop, It seems as if the gold weapons wont drop until the max level. These are not showing there level of rarity, but instead they show how high-end they are.\n\nThe end game is the #1 thing you'll see people talk a lotta ♥♥♥♥ about, and it's well deserved. The end-game is just straight up BORING. The endgame is grinding for special credits for a special vendor (which to remind you is literally story quests with really hard difficulty). The darkzone is the #1 place you'll be at level 30, because you won't get anything from outside of there. The darkzone is a place where pvp is allowed, but not required. It's so damn stupid to be killed by someone with the overpowered midas or vector, while you're trying to look for one.\n\nThe game becomes different near end-game. It becomes unplayable, unfair, and unfun.\n\nIf you see this game for $20 on some 3rd-party website, please buy it with your friends and play the story, this game is great with friends. If you still see this game for $60 on Steam, do not buy it, it will never be worth it.","May 9","false","25.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Inheritly easy and fun gameplay. More bugs and annoying problems than you can imagine for a game of this "quality bar". The QA team should be either ashamed of themselves for not identifying bugs that have been reported since beta that still exist today (namely the cannot climb stairs bug), or they should be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that the bugs they've been reporting have not been fixed by developers.\n\nI just spent an hour on a mission, and after defeating the boss after several attempts, I was tasked with climbing some stairs to operate a crane which will finish the mission. It bugs my character out at the last step of the 2nd set of stairs, and after trying for 30 minutes to trick the game into letting me walk up some stairs, I decided to quit and uninstall.

One example is the inventory system. It defaults to sorted by quality. I honeslty don\'t get why a gun of level 8 is on the top of the list than a gun with a higher level. Even the sorting between DPS is messed up. The game doesn\'t say why this gun with a lower dps and lower level has more quality than a gun with a higher level and higher dps. The gun selection interface isn\'t friendly either. I have to select each gun to see what type of gun it is. It isn\'t sorted by type! I had to select one gun at a time just to know what type of gun I currently have. It\'s just a pain!\n\nAnother one is that you have to hold the button F to do something. The feedback to a player isn\'t very well designed. It doesn\'t let the player know if you can now release the F key after holding it for so long. It doesn\'t say that you have to hold the F key unless you happened to notice that little arrow in the upper hemisphere of the circle to know that you have to hold the F key!\n\nAnd about the fast travel. Why is it the screen for confirming fast travel and actual fast travel is the same? What I mean is the moving arrow animation to the selected destination for both confirmation screen and actual loading screen! I waited 5 minutes just to notice that I have to confirm fast travel! I don\'t mind the confirmation function but the ♥♥♥♥ing screen is the same! The only hint that you have that you actually fast travelled is that walking sound after the confirmation screen. It\'s too soft to notice any difference!\n\nI think the game idea is great but the user experience is so abhorrent.\n\nDon\'t buy this game even if Emma Watson or Emma Stone goes on a date with you.\nDon\'t waste your bandwidth downloading this game.\nDon\'t even torrent this game as to prevent it from spreading on the internet.\nJust don\'t\n","June 1","false","18.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I wanted to put a lot of time to write a decent review. The combat is fun, the AI provide a decent challenge and move and react well. The game is stunning even on lower settings and seems to be very optimizable which is nice. On to the bad. The game crashes all the time. Devs show know sign of fixing any of these issues people are having. They allow this game to work with cheat engine so there are a slew of hackers in the darkzone at almot all times. There are plenty of graphical glitches including the ever so annoying walking along and you fall through the map glitch then you spawn in a safe house down and have to respawn again. The loading times are totally obnoxious even on a SSD. There is not much end game, they give you 3 dailys with poor rewards, and that leaves the dark zone which again is normally full of hacker ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or people who camp extraction points or safe houses to player grief. Not to mention they nerfed the amount of pheonix credits you get from bosses which makes no sense whatsoever. I will wait for 1 more patch and a DLC and then I will most likely be dropping this game as will I am sure a lot of other people. This game has great potential but ubisoft and the devs seem hell bent on making it totally unenjoyable.","April 9","false","287.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","12"

All of the better gear REQUIRES a mat that can only be obtained in the darkzone. (PVP area).\n\nThe game is littered with Hackers and Glitchers because the majority of the game is client side. They ported it over from the x-box to the PC and didn't even think that it would need anti-cheat. They only recently implemented it in a hot fix 2 months out.\n\nThe "innovative feature" of being a "cover-based shooter" is more hindering than it is innovative due to the fact that you have to press another key to use the cover feature and that same key is also used to roll and dodge. so If you double tap the key next to a coverable area when you want to roll you end up jumping to that cover and vice-versa.\n\nThe "Endgame" that they say is totally optional is peppered with players that have glitched their way to the highest gear in the game within the first week of incursions release, so when you grind and struggle to get to PVP99, you will constantly run in to players that are over geared and have a huge advantage over you during your confrontation.\n\nThe only thing positive about this game is the co-op feature. you can play 4 players in the same game in PVE and grinding from level 1 to 30 can be fullfilling but you can do that in 2-3 days and about a week for a casual player.\n\nI regret spending $99.99 for this game and if I could go back and do it again, I would wait 6-8 months for Massive to become a professional developer and check the state of the game when wasting that kind of money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greg317/recommended/365590/","greg317","Xostean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greg317/","167 products in account","This game is one of the funnest game's i have played in close to a decade. It is fresh, new, and fairly unique gameplay. It has some of the best PvP in any RPG out there, skill, using whats around you, knowing when to pop CC at the right time, knowing when to fight and when to flight. It leaves INCREDIBLE room to outplay your opponent.\n\nNumbers in a fight are also not that huge of a factor, a group of 4 can beat a group of 20 if played correctly (trust me, i've done it)\n\nSo now youre probably wondering why i am giving this a negative review if i find it that fun. Well its because unfortunately the game riddled head to toe with people using third party cheats. The game primarily runs client side (meaning stats, hit registration etc is all handled on the side of the players computer instead of the game's server).\n\nThis allows for incredibly easy exploitation of the game, as a result 9/10 pvp fights you get into in the darkzone will have atleast 1 person using cheats and 1 shotting people from 100 yards away with an SMG. Whats worse is that Ubisoft is choosing to focus on fixing exploits on the PVE side of things (like a boss glitching out and being able to kill it over and over for loot) as opposed to focusing on the darkzone (PvP) which is the ONLY reason the game is as fun as it is.\n\nIt's been 2 months and still nothing has been done to fix the issue aside from 3-14 day bans for those caught, only those bans can be removed by simply changing your Uplay user name, thats how ♥♥♥♥ing horrible their security is when it comes to cheating.\n\nI cant recommend this game, it completely ruins it and Ubisoft doesnt seem to give a ♥♥♥♥. If you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE the game, buy it on the console. Thats coming from a PC Master Race nazi too, thats how bad it really is.\n\nMay The Division rest in peace","May 1","false","128.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Its new release so we can all expect high end effects. Engine looks amazing, you can see in water not random textures but really what is at the water reflects.\n\nAlright lets get to the point of this review.\nGame feels really empty, even if there are some random walking and shouting pedestians game still feels empty. AI isnt that good but the point of it is to coop with other players and have very srong enemies to kill. Understandable...\n\nGame have lots of bugs, at the very start i couldnt acquire mission from laptop, at the other hand game crashes constantly throwing me to my desktop. Sometimes enemies body glitch on the floor making them flying around the spot they died.\n\nDisconect from the server ocassionally sounds really bad for AAA release. Loading the mission and loading screen stuck at 36%... games freeze and crash to the desktop. Constanly when staring new mission coop after joining the division game just freezes and cant do anything apart for restarting the app.\n\nAudio is really solid, graphics looks awesome, everything runs smooth but its not paying off that feeling its just a game.\nTitle with potential but its not used properly. Probably with a time there will be DLC's filling out the whole game world.\nMy point of view about this game is that title isnt finished. You can clearly see there is a lot of things to be polished and its done in rush.\n\nStrong 7 out of 10 for lack of random events, lonely feeling when playing this game where i need to admit beta gave me that feeling of emotions. There isnt anything to keep you playing, so far its ok but i know i will lost intrest of the game because all side missions and materials farming missions are all the same.\n\nIf could refund the game now i would do it. Game is good but its not lifes changing title. Can i recommend this game? I will say YES if you are looking for some great effects and overall good looking game. If you was waiting for great title where everything is about great gameplay youll be dissapointed and i cant recommend this game.\n\nKind regards,\nd5","March 8","false","206.6"," 231 of 420 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","231","420","7","1"

Here are my reasons why.\n\nDumb AI (Literally there was a point when the enemies just stood in front of me and not do a damn thing)\n\nBugs and quite a bit of them (This includes in game with not giving us gold and pre order content to black screens, as well as disconnecting issues)\n\nThe gameplay reminds me a lot of Destiny but with a new settings and the fact its in third person so different mechanics (It feels stale I only played for two hours and I started to get bored after getting to Manhatten. Its literally point A to Point B with the same dumb AI with a slightly tough boss here and there)\n\nOnline is alright but it gets old. (Didn't get to play to much online but I mean from what I've played its nothing to return to)\n\nGraphics were definitely downgraded and I don't care how much Ubi denies it.. It was because of consoles and they INFACT did downgrade this game to keep all platforms on par. (I know this isn't a big deal but it still cant be ignored either)\n\nHonestly I will buy this game again when it goes on sale within the next year. I would not spend over $39.99 for this game. I requested a refund so now I will spend my money on something a bit better.

Left wanting because 5% of the game is actual story.\n-Down right beautiful game. The detail is incredible.\n-Had a blast leveling 1-30.\n-Fairly large map.\n-Co-op in 100% of the game.\n\nCons:\n\n-There's enough glitches in this game to confuse people into thinking they're playing a game in beta. The beauty is that I don't have to even give an example. Play the game and it won't take long to find one.\n-The game effectively ends once you hit lvl 30. After that it's just a pursuit for better gear which for me is a waste of time. Ubisoft could easily have expanded on the story past lvl 30 and built more of a unique character. Instead they took a very lazy route and said....story?...No, your story progresses and your character develops solely based on gear stats. Booooooriiiiiiiiiing.\n-Hackers. Actually the first game I've ever had a problem with this. I've come across them before in ther games (sure!), but in the Division you just expect to run into a hacker. This problem expands as well. See, past lvl 30 the dark zone is really the only area to play in minus Incursion. If the only area left is over run with hackers what are you suppose to do in this game? Login to fulfill some daily generic quota. That's called a chore.\n-Tying in with the last point. They have at least 75% of the map they designed useless past lvl 30. Why waste all of that? Do something with it!\n-Weapon system is broken. Everyone uses the submachine gun or assault rifle exclusively. Shotgun? LMG? Show me a person that rocks a shotgun at high levels and I'll show you The Division glitch free.\n\nI think what the future brings to this game will be a good thing. I'm definitely not giving up on it despite the cons I listed. I really do hope that the problems everyone is complaining about will not fall on deaf ears. Looking at the future content they've posted also seems like a good time. Hackers gone, glitches fixed, usable map equals a very high recommendation.","April 29","false","150.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I /had/ a lot of fun with my friends playing The Division, but now I don't even load it except once or twice, then realise nobody is online and quit instantly. But there are a lot of key problems to the division:\n\n1) The amount of bugs/glitches. This game was developed by a very large game corporation and they release with a plethora of bugs and issues. Come ON!\n\n2) The game gets boring and repetitive easily. These new feature don't save that. Missions are all the same, exceptions being the incursions which are fun but not worth doing multiple times\n\n3) NOT a single player or small group game. You have to be in a group of 4 to do any form of event or activity else you'll get ♥♥♥♥ on by other players\n\n4) The weapons are not balanced, the skills are not balanced, the armour bonuses are not balanced. Things like 1 hit kill sticky bombs or when you hit someone with a full clip of 200k DPS and only a micrometer of their health bar changes. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game at times, and when I say at times I mean about every 10 minutes in the DZ.\n\nAlthough there's a lot of negativity, we do have to give credit where credit is due.\n\n1) The game is visually stunning.\n\n2) There are brilliant teamwork possibilities.\n\n3) Multiple abilities can pitch in; you don't have to be just one type player, you can mix and match your skills and abilitites.\n\nOverall, however, the cons outweigh the pros and I would give this game a 4.5 Grind out of 10.

Maybe I will try again in a few years, who knows. I've already lost faith in Ubisoft before this game hit the shelves. Although, I had a small glimmer of hope for The Division before, even that, was crushed by Ubisofts lackadaisical and neglectful attitude toward The Division's players, not to mention a disgruntal worker releasing the sourcecode for the game, making any cheat possible.\n(Ubisoft has a lot of disgruntal workers, I wonder why...)\n\nOf the many problems:\n\n- Glitches and abuse of glitches in PvP and PvE that strait up break the game\n\n- Script Kid galore. Any cheat you can think of is being done in The Division\n\n- Bugs are not being fixed fast enough. What do they have, one guy left to fix all of The Division's errors? Poor guy, no wonder they are disgruntled.\n\n- End Game Content is being rushed\n\n- Loot system was margininal, until they strait up broke it\n\n- Crafting system was meh, until they strait up broke it\n\n- Ubisoft banned a cheater who warped to noob areas and one shot people for... wait for it... 3 WHOLE DAYS (but only after a verbal warning to stop cheating).\n\n\nDon't believe me? Just look on youtube. Or follow this link:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DieOaMGiHF8\n\nI don't blame all of the Devs, I don't think the game is inherently bad (It could be quite fun actually). It's just the way Ubisoft in general handles their products and the lack of respect they give to their consumers and the gamming community that has me thoroughly disgusted with them.

Considering just logging into the game and having an extra 3gb patch to download on launch day added to my time played at least an hour and a half. The last hour I spent playing a game that felt fun and exciting at times with the size of the map and easy to pick up combat.\n\nI found myself being shot at some point by invisible enemies. Multiple times killed in the Darkzone and regular campaign by enemies that hadn't loaded on my screen but were able to kill me over and over. Not to mention areas where my friends could walk through freely but I'd be blocked off by an invisible wall. My system surpasses the recommended settings and I even set everything to the lowest possible settings graphically. Still certain areas of the city would remain blacked out not like it was apart of the dynamic lighting but like certain levels weren't loading correctly... this was usually followed by being killed by an invisible NPC/player.\n\nI haven't even made it past level five and I can't even finish one side mission. I would have really liked to sink my teeth into this game but with how it looks right now I'm just glad to have a refund.

I forked out a good hundred bucks for it because I really enjoyed the beta, with only a few days til release I figured it would be safe to bet most of that beta was accurate. Boy was I wrong as hell. I personally have a strong distaste for anything with the Tom Clancy title slapped on it as there is usually a lot of gameplay elements that I hate in them. When I played the beta everything seemed to my liking, but when I actually played the final release I started to see that clancy after taste that I despise so much. So many bad gameplay elements that in theory would be good. In the end I ended up getting a refund, I really wanted to like this game.\n\nPROS: decent graphics, an okay story, lots of weapons, at face value decent gameplay.\nCONS: rather unintuitive controls, horrid AI, lack of character creation tools, repetative missions.\n\nPersonal Note: I encountered this strange "bug" where my cover would become hollow and bullets would pass right through hitting and killing me.","March 8","false","3.2"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","39","66","0","0"

That is the early, mid, and endgame of The Division. If you have no one to party up with, you will NOT have fun. The atmosphere will keep you drawn in until right about level twelve or so even if you are by yourself. Then the repetitious nature of the game will become more and more noticeable. All of the story missions are more or less the same with small progressive story elements.\n\nSearch and destroy or capture and hold, followed by a boss fight half the time, the bosses are typically slow moving tanks or gadgety tanks or a combination of both at once. The bullet sponge mechanics of the game are mixed, some firefights are fluid and realistic feeling. Others reminds you that the game is an RPG and you pour bullets into elite/armored/boss enemies for upwards of ten minutes.\n\nThe Dark Zone\n\nIt is, in itself, fundamentally flawed. There is little to no incentive to go Rogue and the fact that self defense causes an increase in your timer places you in firefights where you are outnumbered at least two to one. So then who goes rogue? Twinks. No I'm not talking about gay porn. The only rogue players I've seen have been players at max levels of their brackets with the best equipment the Darkzone can give them. They go around in teams of two to four players and butcher lower levels.\n\n"How do they manage that if it's at least two to one?" Rogue status is triggered by a certain amount of damage, so two rogue players can coordinate to kill off two members of a four man team so they now have an almost even; stand up fight. Or more commonly, they just come up behind PVE players and shoot them in the back and take their stuff. You lose your gear, and likely miss your window to recover it as your murderers timer's will have ended before you make it to them. You will also get killed by the same players who go back to "Non Hostile" status after their timer ends. Self defense for both Rogue and Non-Rogue players warrants punishment, trying to recover your things after the timer ends makes you Rogue, shooting people you know will go Rogue and kill you makes you Rogue. Which brings me to the final flaw.\n\nBlue Blocking\n\nBlue blocking happens on this game enough for people to notice, but not enough for everyone to talk or complain about it a lot. Blue blocking is stepping in front of someone who is fighting Red players or NPCs and making them Rogue, how many times have I seen it? Seven for about ten hours in the Dark Zone. Its typically people blocking your line of fire with jumping jacks while you're trying to kill a rogue player. It is, very, very annoying.\n\nWhy did I elaborate on the Dark Zone more than anything else? Because that is the most interesting part of the game, grind, grind, grind, through the story so you can grind some more. This isn't necessarily a bad game. But it's definitely not a game I recommend to most people.

The game is very bland in gameplay and in my opinion it's basically just rinse and repeat. For example, the dark zone is the same as the beta, it gets very boring. You literally run around looking for loot and racking up currency to buy gear that changes every so often. I have noticed that there is basically no end game, it's just farming the same weapon or armour.\n\nHowever, mission levels are well designed, the design of the level is always in high detail and has a lot of places to explore. I wish they added more things that you can actually searc and loot.\n\nThe AI is poor, they sponge a lot and act very stupid, they literally just run into you and deal immense amount of damage; this can be very frustrating over time. The load times as well are very long, depending on your PC build.\n\nI have noticed the weapons on this game are usually just alterations, i.e. The SCAR. The SCAR has two variations, automatic model and single shot model. Same thing sort of applies to character clothing, I wish they added various different types of backpacks, they all look the same.\n\nDon't get me started on character customization, probably the worse creation system I have ever come across, it is all just presets. You cannot change any of the facial features, i.e. eye brow type or eye colour.\n\nThe only good thing that I found with this game is the atmosphere and world design, even though the game went through a downgrade since E3 2013. I played only 2 hours, but I can see this game will fail over time and its direction is not aimed at me at all.\n\nThe game was a huge let down to me, but I kind of knew this was going to be the outcome as it is Ubisoft.","March 8","false","2.6"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","26","42","0","3"

The PVP, which was the main focus of this game? Broken. Completely unbalanced, totally not worth going rogue, the punishment you get for pvp is crushing.  IF you want some lore on what happened, or anything story based, just go pick up collectibles, and even if you do that, you'll just feel like you've missed the whole thing and arrived late to the party. Now, the MMORPG aspect is kinda of acceptable, except for the annoying daily missions grind, or DZ lvl 32 bosses grind. But you know, these unbalanced things will settle with time, but the history? That won't. Maybe if you bought a season pass they could make a DLC where you play the first wave? Maybe.

This is a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace and if it's not by fixed tomorrow morning I'll be getting a refund and I'm NEVER in my life buying another Ubisoft product.\n\nEdit: After seven hours of errors, bugs and crashes, the game seems to be working fine now for most people, myself included. With that said, the performance is still highly inconsistent and the character creation is a JOKE. The Nvidia game-ready driver does nothing to improve the performance and judging by the visuals (which have definitely been downgraded btw) the game should be running a lot better. So far, I'm not impressed.\n\nEdit 2: The launch for this game was awful, and the performance is still not ideal but I finally can say that, as of right now, the game is working like it was supposed to from the start. I wish there was a neutral rating I could give to this game, because it's definitely not for everyone. I can see and understand why someone would be cynical and judgemental towards this game. It's one big grindfest, the enemies all look the same, the story is nothing special and the visuals received a significant downgrade, although it's nothing quite as striking as the Watch Dogs and Dark Souls 2 downgrades. With that said, I'm still really enjoying this game, and I can only see it getting better as it goes on. I wasn't mislead in any way and I knew what I was getting myself into. It's a somewhat generic third person shooter with RPG elements, but one that knows how to keep its hooks in you when it needs to. It's a mix between Destiny, The Last of Us and Ghost Recon but with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign. If that's what you are looking for in a game, then you might as well give this one a try. But if you're like me and you're sick and tired of the way Ubisoft's been treating PC Gamers, then vote with your wallets and stop supporting the company alltogether.","March 7","false","80.3"," 68 of 121 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","68","121","3","3"

Really bad. Like, it's supposed to be a 'Risk vs Reward" system and all it is right now is a "Risk vs Mild entertainment and possibility of hours of work lost" system, which isn't neat, or fun, or engaging. Just punishing and grinding.\n\nIf you're only looking for a one playthrough experience, it'll be great for you! You'll absolutely enjoy it for that! If you're looking for a game that claims to be an "mmo", it's not fullfilling in that regard at all, I fall into the "Hardcore" side of games when it comes to MMO's, and I was fully geared in about 20-30 hours of gameplay by running the same dungeons over and over. It wasn't overly fun, but it was thoughtless and unfortunately the best way to get the gear. You can also grind the "Darkzone" but it's just grinding NPC camps and being mildly irritated that when[Not if, it will happen] you die to an NPC  you lose between 10minutes and an hour of experience depending on how much time you've already spent in there.\n\nDisclaimer: I fall into the "hardcore" side of MMOs when I play, so understand that while I only got about a week or so out of it, you may get up to a month if you play it casually.

What is worse is that every time the end game and PvP gets adjusted it get even worse.\n\nI have many issues with the game and one of them being the crafting system for level 30 gear.  When the game first came out the number of lower end material need to make one higher end material was the following; 5 green to make 1 blue and 5 blue to make 1 yellow.  After the incursion patch and is still 10 green to make 1 blue and 15 blue to make 1 yellow.   You probably thinking that this change does not sound so bad and it would have been fair if Ubisoft had adjusted the rate at which you get material, but no Ubisoft made it worse.  Each material point on the map now only gave 2-3 items per box at a refresh rate of 4 hours per box.  This was changed from the 2-3 items per box at a refresh rate of 1 hour per box.  Also the weapon breakdown went from 2-3 material per item broken down to 1 material per item broken down.  This change had two effects, one it made crafting into a grind and a joke as all the stats on an item you craft are random and you can only readjust a single stat.  You’re probably thinking big deal why don’t you just make another item to reroll the stats, that a great idea if Ubisoft hadn’t jacked up all the prices for crafting.  What cost 3 weapon material 5 electronic material now cost 8 weapon material and 6 electronic materials.  The second effect is that it screws over legitimate players mostly.  The cheater/hacker/exploiters don't need to craft anything, they just run the incursion on hard or run around screwing legitimate players in the dark zone.  The cheater/hacker/exploiters are the ones running around with the best gear and killing people at random because they think it is fun.\n\nAnother issue is the vendors.  90% of the time the vendors just sell the same stuff over and over again and they don’t rotate the blueprints.  Which means you can get 2 items from the new armor sets then you have to play the incursion or the challenge mission and prey that you get the piece of armor that you want.  That would not be as much of an issue, if there were more ways than playing the bullet sponge filled challenge and incursion mission.\n\nAnother major issue is the PvP, dark zone.  When the game launched it was really costly to go rouge and a lot of people we just cooperating for the most part.  Now all the penalties for going rouge have been nurfed and you’re more likely going to get killed by some random hacker who is running around killing people for kicks because he/she is already maxed gear and does not need to go around and kill you to steel your gear.  Ubisoft should have had multiple dark zones like they had shown when they announced this game a few years ago at E3.  Different dark zones with varying penalties for encouraging people to be cooperative or not; This would have solved for the most part, the need to adjust the dark zone over and over again.  I for one would have like to have multiple dark zones and have all the different bonuses/penalties for going rouge/ cooperative play.\n\n*As of right now after the April 29th "Ban Hammer" drop, the dark zone as it stands rewards players for being an a**.  A PvP zone in which to get the gear you have earned to your inventory you have to call a supply drop.  That mechanic is fine, but what isn't is that there are now groups of people just camping drop zones to kill anyone not in their group trying to extract dark zone gear.  I have been gaming a very long time and I think this is the first PvP game where I have been actively punished for not being an assh*** in the game.  Also why am I getting killed by people with a dark zone rank of 99, my question is why are they in the same dark zone as me, why did Ubisoft not separate people by dark zone rank and gear level and lastly how in the world did you get to dark zone 99 last month with all the rapid hackers in the dark zone without cheating.  All these problem for the most part would have been fix if they had multiple dark zones.  Also to that end why is it that the people who kill you and steal your stuff don't show up on a play log.  The way it is now you can't really review your actions and you can forget about even look up the people that screw you over.  Even if it is to see if they were legit screwing you over or using ill-gotten gains to screw you over.  If Ubisoft wanted me to tell them if someone is cheating, Ubisoft should have given the average player the tools to look up the assailant at least on a basic level.\n\nThen there is the incursion itself.  It was sort of fun, but not.  The enemies don’t really use any real tactics except for charge at you gun's blazing.  Normal enemies just melt and die from level 30 weapons but the incursion is different and not in a good way.  Every enemy now has the HP of a challenge mission boss and can do damage that is comparable to the average level 30 player but the enemy now have an accuracy rating of 100% stacked with a stability rating of 100%.\n\nThere are many more glaring issues, but the ones listed above irk me the most.  The short end of it is don’t get this game as it is.  It is very broken and not worth anyone’s time or money.","April 29","false","223.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Some amazing little touches and attentions to detail.\n\nRoaming around a beautifully reconstructed post-disaster New York, working your way with your friends to level 30: a whole lot of fun.\n\nPost level 30 endgame: barely existent. Terrible. Hideous. Broken. Pointless.\n\nIf I'd written this review during the romp to level 30 I'd have given it a solid 8-9 out of 10 and a big thumbs up. However, once you see the utter lack of enjoyable content after all the story missions are done with, playing this game just becomes a chore.\n\nRather than the intended interesting, tense PvP experience, the Dark Zone has just become a nest for hackers and griefers. There's no anti-cheat system so groups of teleporting scum will one-shot you for fun, and there's nothing you can do about it. The only thing to do in the DZ anyway is run around farming crafting materials, which is unbelievably boring in the first place. But the fact that you're basically unable to even do that due to said hackers and griefers... yeah. The endgame is a broken mess.\n\nIt might be worth trying in 6 months or so once they fix the biggest bugs, do something about the hacking, tweak the balance so other loadouts besides the same SMG/sniper are viable, and add more endgame content that isn't utterly repetitive. But a lot of these issues involve making huge changes to the underlying game, so who knows if they'll ever get fixed.\n\nI was looking forward to this game for more than 3 years, but as fun as those first 10 or so hours were, this game is simply not worth buying at this price.

I bought the season pass, being totally on board the hype train. It was an amazing experience throughout, beautifully crafted environments with so much small detail I could get lost in them for hours just looking around. The story was mostly engaging, with most of the lore burried in the environments and collectibles. Those were surprisingly fun to find and taught you a lot about what happened during the events before the second wave. The DZ was fantastic, the loot drops weren't the best items you could get, but grabbing them for crafting materials was totally worth it. Crafting was great, and I made several very cool weapons that carried me through the majority of the late-ish game.\n\nBut then hackers. I mean a LOT of hackers. Practically every DZ I went into had someone, sometimes groups of them, teleporting around and instakilling every other player they found, regardless of whether they had gear or not. The few times I got into a DZ with no hackers I reallt enjoyed myself, running around killing enemies, finding other players, going rogue once in a while to spice it up and get my adrenaline pumping.\n\nThen the Incursion update. This brought with it the crafting nerf, and also buff of DZ and challenge mode missions. I picked up so many HE's I didn't even know what to do with them all. But the majority of them were garbage. So they became crafting mats, that I couldn't get enough of because of the crafting nerf.\n\nI tried the Incursion. It was some of the worst gameplay I've ever experienced as an "end game" activity in any video game. 15 waves of enemies? That would be fine if there were any save points. But there weren't. You died on wave 14? Do it all again, if you were lucky enough to make it that far through all the one shot mechanics that is. Shotgunners that can't be stunned and random tank shots from the APC drove every player into a little hole in the middle of the map to slowly pick off enemies and not get murdered every 5 seconds. Sitting in a little hole picking off enemies is boring. And thats all it was. For 15 waves. I never finished it and just gave up because it wasn't worth 2 hours of boring gameplay for one piece of gear that may or may not be an upgrade. Whoever thought of that as a good idea for an end game scenario should seriously rethink their definition of "fun".\n\nThen came the exploiters. Breaking the game to get the best gear possible, and then taking it into the DZ to be invincible against any other player. They were just as bad as the hackers and script kiddies before them. As if the DZ wasn't broken enough with hackers killing everyone, instead it was someone that had exploited the incursion to get full gear sets and the best guns killing you and calling you a scrub for not doing the same.\n\nI want this game to be good. I want it to be everything they promised and more. It seriously had a chance at being my all time favorite game with the amount of fun I had in the first month of playing. Instead it has fallen apart, filled with cheating, exploiting, hacking and toxic players that love nothing more than ruining other peoples fun. It is a broken mess of a game. It could be great. The Division could have been one of the best, and that's what breaks my heart the most.\n\nI'll be reading the subreddit hoping that something changes.

It was fun completing the missions. Teaming up with people to finish tasks.  Complete the seperate wings.  Get the place run.  It was fun with the incursions, challenging as they are, especially with the new Falcon Lost.  But then the DZ was always the place to pick up the higher end gear.\n\nAnd thus griefing and roguing became to do in this game.\n\nThis game rewards those who like to be the bad guys. To grief players. To farm farmers.  To screw other players over.\n\nBecause after you complete the missions and run the side quests and even do the new added daily missions and HVT, we all know the best gear is in the DZ, and yet the only way to get it is by either extraction or roguing and steal from others.\n\nTo those who are below 200, it is probably much more enjoyable before you get to the upper brackets, where its all rogues all day long  and all night long.\n\nI get it. This is the set up.  I don't think there's any real way to fix this unless there's an arena within the DZ just for PVP.  But that's just not going to happen.\n\nSo when you are in the middle of a 4 sided NPC battle with your group of 4 players with high gear, you can get hosed by another pack of 4 rogues who will gank you and your crew, take away your stuff and talk crap about how much you suck and that they love roguing.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you lose gear, dz xp, dz credit, and all that time you wasted.\n\nNo wonder the number of players have dropped.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/recommended/365590/","DominoEventide","Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/","156 products in account","I have a lot of mixed feelings about this game. On one hand, I love pretty much anything with RPG elements tied into it, and what the devs themselves were going for (emphasis on going for, because they sure weren't very successful in it) is exactly the kind of game I'm looking for. Plus, just about everyone likes a game with guns. Lots of guns. And explosions. Pew pew.\n\nOn the other hand, though... The creators have done just about everything WRONG in the RPG aspect of the game. Not to mention the fact that... well, Ubisoft. Enough said. And just in case not enough is said; bugs/glitches/exploitations everywhere, most of which will undoubtedly never be fixed. This, combined with Ubisoft's modern-day lack of creativity and uniqueness across its games, and tendencies to water down gameplay with DLC and repetitive activities, rather than actual content, leaves a lot to be desired in the game. Bearing this in mind, can I, and will I ever be able to recommend the game to anyone, especially with Ubisoft outright lying and false advertising their products (check the Season Pass's reviews)? No, absolutely not.\n\nLet's skip the part about actual bugs in the game, because Ubisoft is Ubisoft and the bugs themselves are already covered in plenty of other reviews. I want to concentrate on the actual game, and why I'm perhaps more enthusiastic in it than I should be, since it's the closest thing to what I'm looking for ever since the Borderlands series. The MMORPG aspect of this game could have been so much better than it actually is, and it feels completely rushed and not well thought out.\n\nIn terms of character creation, there are a maximum of 5 different selections in most visual/cosmetic appearance options, and each option is very, very generalized (for example, rather than being able to edit and make specific variations on facial structure, eyes, nose, jawline, etc. it's just a "face" option, and there are only 5 face options for each gender). You'll be seeing a lot of people who look exactly like you, especially considering hats completely hide the hair, and all the hairstyles look exactly the same across both character genders.\n\nNow, as for the actual RPG area of the game, the devs seemed to have a "great idea, poor execution" thing going on here. The way you get skills, skill upgrades/"mods", and other stat/trait boosting character additions is by upgrading your base through resources for each wing, each wing being directly related to one of the three skill trees, and the resources being obtained through missions along the map spread out evenly through level-specific districts. The problem with this model is that no one can actually build their character and playstyle the way they WANT to as they level up; rather, everyone is forced to upgrade base wings, and by effect, skills and skill mods, in a balanced fashion, unless they want to take the HUGE risk and uneven, broken exp distribution of going Metal Gear Solid mode through the higher level areas where enemies will one shot you and doing specific encounters/missions still left which are either devoid or scarce of enemies. Either that, or get a higher level character to powerlevel you through it. They essentially force it to be ideal for you, along with every other player, to upgrade wings, and by effect, your skills, evenly and at an equal pace, regardless of what an individual wants to specialize in, or how he or she actually wants to play, until nearing the maximum experience level.\n\nThis further shoves the fact that everyone is a direct clone of you into your face. The fact that there are only 3 wings (3 skill trees) and a few skills for each tree, and a few skill mods for each skill, is already bad enough, but everyone is stuck with upgrading all the base wings and their skill trees evenly, rather than focusing on the medical, security, or technology tree they'd actually want to to build a healer/medic, tank, or support-y character, respectively. For an "open world RPG experience," Ubisoft made sure not to keep things very open, or worldly... or RPG-ish...\n\nThe gunplay in The Division is the only decent part of the actual combat system put in place. Combat itself feels drab and stale for the most part, especially when playing solo, every encounter being extremely similar to the last with level differences and enemy "elite" statuses meaning everything. A lot of people think "HOLY HELL I, I JUST GOT THIS AMAZING LMG WITH A MAGAZINE SIZE OF 100, THIS NAMED ENEMY WITH A GOLD HEALTH BAR WHO'S JUST A COUPLE OF LEVELS ABOVE ME WILL BE A PIECE OF CA-" followed by the emitting of a lot of loud and blood-curdling screams since they died in one or two shots that came from 100 meters away before they could even get in close. Guns just... feel off. They don't -feel- like they work as actual guns, and some of the mechanics behind a few guntypes are just plain broken, in terms of functionality and/or balance (lol SMGs).\n\nThe endgame? It comes as early as level 30 (and it's possible to get at least several levels a day), and the endgame content itself is, like the content in general, very scarce. The Division is yet another one of those MMORPGs to fall into an endless grinding and farming sequence to nitpick and perfect gear, spending the majority of the time doing what is often the same mind-numbing mission over and over again for "credits" towards what you may or may not want to buy and/or a chance at the exact kind of piece of equipment you want, with the exact type of that piece, with the exact stats on that type of item, fighting the same enemies (and the RNG system) for that same low chance of what you want, which is sure to be replaced only days afterwards by a new content update, likely not free, with an even-more-superior variant of it. To make it worse, there are "daily missions" which provide meager bonuses and force dedicated players into "playing" the game regularly and constantly only to repeat a mission already done for an iota of a chance higher to obtain what they want. I myself have only -just- reached level 30 (and could have done it much sooner since it's rather easy to level up, but I was grinding and farming in the Dark Zone--the only place in the game that doesn't level your actual experience level--A LOT) and I already feel very exhausted just looking ahead. It should primarily be about the journey rather than the destination when it comes to anything RPG, but when the journey is forcibly so short and the destination is so heinous and full of tedium and mediocrity compared to other MMORPGs, is it even possible for the journey to be enjoyed?\n\nI could go on and on about various issues along with things that I like, but in the long run, they're much more unimportant, and I can sum up whether or not you, as someone curious about the game, should buy it, as this; exactly the way it's described and you see it, it's a much, much more mediocre experience than you think. It's overly glorified, both in its trailers by Ubisoft and by some of its fanboys in some positive reviews, and made to look much more impressive than it is, and probably will be even after the coming free and Season Pass updates and patches.\n\nAnd, if you're curious as to how I have all these complaints and don't recommend the game even though I've put well over 100 hours into it in around just a week; as mentioned before, I instantly become curious about almost anything involving RPG features, and, as I am an easily entertained no-life, brainless grinding and tedious processes happen to be the perfect timesink for me.\n\nOh, and PvP in this game is an absolute joke at level 30, there's at least one hacker in every Dark Zone server, and even if there wasn't, groups of 4 with perfect gear always monopolize the entire area. Good luck getting the top equipment items that're exclusive to the Dark Zone.\n\ntl;dr I give this game an arguably biased 6/10 at best and I also like bacon.","March 29","false","137.7"," 43 of 75 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","43","75","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaemonQueeN/recommended/365590/","DaemonQueeN","TactiCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaemonQueeN/","401 products in account","(As of patch 1.0.2) --- This review is probably subject to change depending on updates to the game.\n\nIt's an okay game, an average game, it doesn't really innovate in any areas.\nI am hesitant to reccomend to anyone, even though I've played a lot of hours and enjoyed them.\nAs far as a shooter goes, go for it. Fun for awhile. As far as a long term MMO goes, no.\n\nStory falls flat and is forgettable, especially if you accidentally play it out of order because you group with higher level friends instead of being solo. For a story in a Tom Clancy game to be so lackluster it's just a little sad.\n\nI enjoy the ramp up in AI, fighting the different factions is interesting, but soon enough you're level 30 and just fighting the same late game enemies all the time and it gets a little boring. You see all of them them again in the Dark Zone, but late game poor balancing makes DZ not all that much fun.\n\nPvP is overly punishing and therefore on average, people don't really do it. And when they -do- do it, they always seem to be the people that are just super-geared and bored, so you stand no chance in defending yourself.\n\nTo get geared, you have to run the same challenge missions to the point where you'd like to just tear out your eyeballs in frustration. Running the same missions over and over. For example, I had to run a mission 6 times to buy 1 blueprint. Average runs for missions are like 15-30 minutes depending how geared and skilled your group is. If you run an average of about 20 minutes per run, that's 2 hours it took to buy one thing. Not counting the hours after that to farm materials to get a good crafting roll.\n\nAlternative to get geared, spend hours in the Dark Zone attempting to kill NPCs for drops (no guarentee you'll actually find something) and hope you don't run into the overgeared players if you do. Basically no guarentee at all your hard spent hours will pay off. Fun for some people I guess, but when time is limited, you need to choose.\nFor me, I've been trying to get geared in missions and then trying my luck at DZ just for fun, knowing not much will come out of it anyway.\n\nI think they need a dedicated PvP mode that rewards you for doing well at PvP and doesn't punish you for failing. DZ as it is currently is not scratching that itch. I'm not saying to change DZ, maybe it's fine and working as intended. But another battle arena area or something.\n\nCosmetics are limited and most of the ones you can find in game are super lackluster. People end up looking all the same and there's no way to tell a level 3 player from a level 30 player at a glance. There's a lot of potential for better stuff, but it's just not really there. Unless you buy the DLC packages that actually have the cool stuff. There isn't any camo clothing in the game... you have to buy the Marine DLC. Thankfully they gave us cool gun skins in game and didn't release them in a DLC instead. Usually cosmetics aren't that important but in a game like this where you are literally staring at your character all the time, it really is.\n\nGuns feel good, I enjoy the different types available. I feel like I can't find a sniper rifle that beats out the performance power of an assault rifle though. Assault Rifles overall seem to cover all bases and using other weapons seems to hurt DPS too much. Shotguns are pretty fun though and LMGs seem good against NPCs when in a group for suppression power. SMGs are pretty good also if you're in range. Maybe it just comes down to preference and finding weapons with the right stats.\n\nGetting new gear is fun. It's that Diablo high. Developing your character and tailoring your gear-build to your playstyle is fun. It's just a shame that getting the new epic loot has become more frustating than fun. Kind of like Diablo 3 at release.\n\nThere's a lot of bugs to iron out and it seems like when they patch they end up breaking more things in the process. I'm sure eventually they'll get all that sorted out, but in the meantime it's a bit frustrating. Definitely has been a turn off for a lot of people. Overall it's been a relatively smooth launch and when the game works it runs alright. There has been occassional times where the NPCs lag out and appear to hang up and crash, which can completely fubar your mission run... which feels like more time wasted considering how frustrating they can be. Maybe give it a month and see how much bugs they've ironed out.\n\nAlso loading times for traveling across map, etc. are stupid slow.\n\nTL;DR  I like the game, I want to enjoy the game. But I think it might be awhile before the content catches up to make it that better game and I hope it's not dead in the water by then.","March 22","false","115.8"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","3"

(if you choose to any way) 2) dont go to lvl 30 stay at 29 (if u want to hit 30) 3) pve in the pvp zone and hope you can lvl up fast enough to get/make good gear.   i have 50+hrs in this and only have 1 high end piece. and i havent even hit dz 30 yet. so if u r rushing your lvls in this game dont play dz at lower lvls to make dz rank 30+. if you can hit dz 50 before you hit pve 30 then you are in like flin","March 19","false","57.5"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","24","40","0","0"

When it was about to be released I noticed that there was an embargo on reviews, it wasn't a good sign so I held off. When the game launched there were many complaints but on recommendation from a friend who said it wasn't as negative as they said, just day one issues I purchased the game anyway.\n\nSo the good:\n\n-Pretty good graphics and setting\n-Groundwork for the plot and factions\n-Instanced Multiplayer\n-Large open world: Always something to explore and to collect.\n-Base development\n\nThe bad:\n\n-Uninteresting enemies: Three main enemy factions are mostly only distinct based on the clothes they wear. You have similar classes and each faction gets it's own twist on weapon capabilities but it boils down to "Oh it's these guys again" and then mop the floor with them.\n-Bugs and graphical glitches: Some of these ruin the experience quite a lot. In one case I kept falling through the ground and dying because my game had not loaded the world properly, and then dying again because I respawned where there was no world and fell through the map, meanwhile my teamates couldn't rescue me.\n-Weapon variation: There isn't much of it. You have basic weapon designs each with their own quirks and you get higher level weapons with more bonus' but they tend to be the same few designs. With the number of guns available in the US I would have thought I would have been using a wider variety than the same 3-4 assualt rifles.\n-Large open world map: Always something to do and collect becomes a chore. Trying to get to the next mission or safehouse and then getting pulled into a side mission or collectable means that you spend far more time figuring out how to get to a roof than actually advancing the plot. So long in fact that you start to forget what you were doing in NY to begin with.\n-Boring when you are playing by yourself. On your own the city is a cold and quiet place. You might spend 5 minutes running without anything happening. You don't run into anything interesting and the buildings are very reptitive. Apparently everyone in NY lives in the same type of building.\n-AI civilians are incredibly dumb. You run past them on the way to help stop the arnachy and they accuse you of being one of them. Tell you not to point your gun at them when you didn't.\n-Some game mechanics are overpowered. Supression for example, makes enemies just stay where they are, they don't react to when you flank them, they just cower in fear.\n-Clothing customisation is essentially having the same 5 styles of coats in different colours. When you first get the option its nice but you have hordes of them by the end and no way of previewing it or sorting them.\n-Collectables more often than not, don't add anything to the game. A phone call about how someone misses their ex wife is relevant to the current situation how?\n-Faction histories vary in sense. The rioters are actually the ones that make the most sense, although I could be wrong about this but I'm pretty sure they are all black, but again I could be wrong. The cleaners, god knows where they got all those flamethrowers. And the RIkers? The hell is up with them? They get the opportunity to escape and they go to Manhattan? A quarintined island full of deadly disease? Where did they get such heavy ordinance?\n-And why out of all the enemies and friendlies you come across in the ENTIRE game that matter, only four of them are women? What women can't riot or burn a bunch of infect civilians? Were there no female prisoners anywhere? The only woman who shoots bad guys gets badly wounded in the opening stages of the game and does nothing. One them just sells you ♥♥♥♥ who doesn't even have a name and another just gives you sass for not giving her enough virus to study. The only female on the villains side leads the Rikers. I'm not saying this for feminist reasons at all. If you want a believable setting then you should make it believable. Otherwise I'm just liquidating the male population of Manhatten the entire game.\n\nOverall, if you have people to play with, you could kill a weekend or two playing this with them. But if you don't have anyone to play it with you will get bored and not get your moneys worth from this game.","April 2","false","17.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Should be first offence > ban.

The darkzone is bland, and doesnt have enough content, going rogue is pointless and has no upside. that supply drop ♥♥♥♥ isnt worth even getting, purple gear is nothing after you have some high ends. the darkzone should be named; The Grief Zone.... PVP in DZ is awful, its killing its own playerbase 90000 > 10000 nice job devs!\n\nI only have 170ish hours in this game, and i feel that it has so much potential but no, they devs are really stupid. They raise the amount of parts required to craft by almost 4x and it was hard enough already, the spam in chat with korean/chinese letters and people trying to sell incursion runs is cancerous. also; season pass bonus's are pointless too, its like 1/5 of materials needed to make a gun.\n\nThe graphics downgrade and optimization of this game is awful, the game looked too good to be true 2 years ago, and guess what, it was too good to be true. the snow looks like plastic EVEN ON ULTRA. the optimization in some areas is awful. but im willing to forget about that if there is good gameplay, but no.\n\nAs much as i like this game i will still play, but honestly, they didnt need to release this broken pile of ♥♥♥♥ this year. they could have made it so much better.\n\n5/10","May 15","false","296.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

This game is terrible, absolutely awful, first of all, the game keeps crashing on my end, and its not my PC. This game was NOT meant for PC, it is a bad console port with just minor configurations, same game, nothing new. Ubisoft needs to stop releasing broken games, the game stutters for 150 FPS, the game is repetitive. The plot is bad, its like a M Night Shymalan movie. Way to many loop holes and plot twists. The charcters are hardly recognizeble, and not memorable, there's shallow writing, and dialogue. Most will say the same lines, and their personality behavior turns a 180. It doesnt feel like you're saving Manhatten, and Day 1 release was bad too. The Dark Zone is REALLY BAD, it doesnt feel rewarding at all, going rouge seems pointless.  I have to say I am done with Ubisoft; I will remain faithful with the Assassins Creed series. Try as you might, but you will be disappointed with everything.

A lot of fun. So much fun that I put 100+ hours in during the first two weeks. In spite of a ton of minor bugs, I enjoyed the game.\n\n\nUntil I got the "Connecting Screen fo Death" this past Monday. I learned about this bug through the Ubisoft forums, in which it took a community manager 13 days to respond to the post (which was sitting at 23 pages by that time). Apparently it takes them two weeks to "investigate" an issue which is literally game breaking. Some other gripes;\n\n- The support ticket system is absolutely worthless. If you get a response at all, it will be an automated message telling you to check your internet connection. Respond to this and you'll likely get the same message. Oh, you speak Portugese? Enjoy the horrible translation.\n\n- They're too busy putting out Tweets glorifying Bullet King (an explot in their own game!) instead of warning people about this truly game breaking bug. Numerous people could have been saved the hassle if it didn't take 13 days for a Ubisoft rep to relay that the dev's are "investigating" the issue.\n\nEdit: And here we are a week later....still locked out of the game.

No.\n\n-Game is so buggy for the price. Graphic is very nice but it is not so nice where there is a sink hole leading to the bottom of the map on the beautiful groun isn't it?\n\n-Story mode is not very interesting. Seriouly, the trailer got me buying this game. I was happy in the first day playing it. I soon find out many missions are the same and it gets boring quickly. Replay value of this game is very low. Consider a $60 cost of this game? I say it's atoo expensive. The Co-op mode is ruinded by having the enemies level correspopnd to the highest level player in the team. Once you hit max character level, you have to depend on gear level, which is something you cannot work on easily and must depend on co-op or going into the dark zone. Which means either you have to suffer extremely tough enemies which cannot be killed and they can kill you quickly, or you have to suffer the evil deeds of other people. Either way, you will end up being more clyncial for the rest of the day, It's not very healthy. This is a seroiue catch 22 error the developers didn't think it throughly. For instance, you graduated from college but 80% of the jobs requires 5 years of experience. This is not right. We all know the reality is bad and we don't need this in a game, especially we paid $60 for it.\n\n-Since the story mode is boring, repeatitive, one may assume the mulitplayer mode will make up for that...and the snwer is NO. They allow the worst side of humanity to ruin the game. We all know people like to do bad things to others if they are given the chance. UBI thinks it would be exciting to allow people to do what they want in the game and history tells us it usually leads to chaos and this game is no execption.\n\n-Shows the worst side of humanity. I suggest you avoid purchasing it if you have something bad happened in your life lately. You don't want to get more negative energy from a stupid video game such as this one. I uninstalled it because something bad is happening to my friend and I wanted to releax a bit by playing this game and boy....was I wrong. I am even more depressed after playing 3 days in Dark Zone. I told myself....F**k that, that's it. If I spend 3 more days in there, I would probably, literally kill myself. I am not even trying to be funny, I am damn serious. Thank UBI. Thank you for making my life worse after I paid you $60 of my hard earnt money.

I've deduced that my DZ crashes were often around "possible" hacked accounts since those characters were on their own vs when Im around alot of folks in the DZ. No real end game and that was very dissapointing. It reminded me of an old game that most of you would remember...had to do with "Cow Runs" just to get those top tier gears. Well the cow runs here happens to be the DZ.\n\nDont get me wrong, the graphics and AI's are great. The games fails with in its playability. Once you hit lvl 30 your really on your to challenge other areas in Hard mode. Also remind me of that other game, ok if you dont know what that game is...it's Diablo. They are both similar in concepts. So after awhile you are burnt out playing in the same areas.\n\nThis game had potential but fell short.","May 14","false","175.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","3"

No.\n\n-Game is so buggy for the price. Graphic is very nice but it is not so nice where there is a sink hole leading to the bottom of the map on the beautiful groun isn't it?\n\n-Story mode is not very interesting. Seriouly, the trailer got me buying this game. I was happy in the first day playing it. I soon find out many missions are the same and it gets boring quickly. Replay value of this game is very low. Consider a $60 cost of this game? I say it's atoo expensive. The Co-op mode is ruinded by having the enemies level correspopnd to the highest level player in the team. Once you hit max character level, you have to depend on gear level, which is something you cannot work on easily and must depend on co-op or going into the dark zone. Which means either you have to suffer extremely tough enemies which cannot be killed and they can kill you quickly, or you have to suffer the evil deeds of other people. Either way, you will end up being more clyncial for the rest of the day, It's not very healthy. This is a seroiue catch 22 error the developers didn't think it throughly. For instance, you graduated from college but 80% of the jobs requires 5 years of experience. This is not right. We all know the reality is bad and we don't need this in a game, especially we paid $60 for it.\n\n-Since the story mode is boring, repeatitive, one may assume the mulitplayer mode will make up for that...and the snwer is NO. They allow the worst side of humanity to ruin the game. We all know people like to do bad things to others if they are given the chance. UBI thinks it would be exciting to allow people to do what they want in the game and history tells us it usually leads to chaos and this game is no execption.\n\n-Shows the worst side of humanity. I suggest you avoid purchasing it if you have something bad happened in your life lately. You don't want to get more negative energy from a stupid video game such as this one. I uninstalled it because something bad is happening to my friend and I wanted to releax a bit by playing this game and boy....was I wrong. I am even more depressed after playing 3 days in Dark Zone. I told myself....F**k that, that's it. If I spend 3 more days in there, I would probably, literally kill myself. I am not even trying to be funny, I am damn serious. Thank UBI. Thank you for making my life worse after I paid you $60 of my hard earnt money. I hope you developers can sleep well at night.","May 15","false","72.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I played the public beta, bought the game and season pass at full retail price, and have mostly enjoyed the game.  While playing the PvE early missions, I thought that this game was a perfect marriage of the cover system of Gears of War and the Third-Persion Shooter/RPG system of Mass Effect.  The PvE story is great and the challenge mode missions give a good sense of difficulty and accomplishment.  However, the PvP mode is so rage-quit-inducing that it alone is worth a thumbs down.  PvP is inundated with cheaters.  There have been instances of players teleporting out of combat, sniping through walls, infinite ammo cheating, and crit-accumulating (somehow unloading with a zillion point one-shot).  The bugs have been asinine (see the \"Protection from Elites\" debacle).  If you like Tom Clancy style games/settings, the PvE is for you and you\'ll enjoy it for a single playthrough.  If you think this game will have the longevity of CS:GO or any of the CoD/BF series, you\'ll be disappointed.\n\nPros Beautiful graphics\nGreat premise/story\nRealistic NYC map and environment\nBeautiful weather effectsCons No PvP-toggle (i.e. players can kill you before you know they\'re toggled PVP)\nCrafting grind is soooooo bad\nNo anti-cheating detection (e.g. PVP cheaters in the Dark Zone teleporting and wall clipping)\nEnd-game enemies have rediculous stats (e.g. enemies can absorb hundreds of headshots before going down while you go down with a \"sniper shotgun\" burst.)\nThe gear score calculations are rediculous (e.g. some of the lvl 192 well-rolled gear will demolish a poorly rolled lvl 240)","May 31","false","171.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I currently do not recommend this purchase (excepting steam sales) due to a disastrous end-game, but the game leading up to it is polished and fun. Patches might repair the damage but until then beware.\n\n* PROS: Great story, lots to explore, many side-quests until end-game. Crafting your base and early gear increments are exciting and addictive. Graphics are fantastic and you will make a lot of friends working missions and in general. Weapons and gear can be modded in many ways and can genuinely feel unique and handle very differently based on your choices.\n\n* CONS: End-game is exceedingly repetitive and becomes a frustrating grind for often-times nearly useless crafted or enemy-dropped items. Crafting was recently made much more of a grind, basically tripling the required components, which exacerbates the repetitive grinding in the Dark Zone and in Challenging missions. Incursions are static and get old fast, strategy is the same every time and gear scores are already maxxed on many players (suspicious). ***Massive*** issues with players cheating, particularly in the dark zone using hacks to one-shot kill, teleport, and using shotguns and SMGs at very long ranges. Little or nothing done to combat this from a player perspective. Story missions and the immersive feel of the game end the moment you hit the level cap.\n\nUnderstand that currently you are better off taking your time and enjoying the story and avoiding the end-game until the game has more to do and gets many fixes for the hackers. So-called challenging missions you can run by just following a solo by Chinese hacker firing guns that also shoot rockets and grenades and kill everything they hit in moments kind of takes the fun out of the missions. This game was a life-sink until the level cap. While I have high hopes much of this will be fixed, I currently hesitate to recommend the game in it's current state. There are few if any bugs, thankfully, but design problems and the ubiquitous cheating taking place in the barren and grind-heavy end-game is not worth playing.\n\nI personally uninstalled the game and may come back in a few months if things are patched.

Add in the enviroment and atmosphere that Massive Entertainment spent years on perfecting and breathing life into and you have a stellar game whose only down fall is a lack of continuing content beyond the base game to keep the excitement up.\n\nSadly the PvP aspect quickly degraded from decently fun to unplayable. Originally what kept the PvP aspect from reaching its potential was the lack of actual PvP due to a small number of players spread out over a large area and also how punishing it was on players who initiated PvP (went rogue). Currently the Darkzone is home to hackers and if perchance you find an instance where there are no hackers you will sooner or later have one join in to ruin everyone's day. Add in the fact that the developers and publisher haven't taken aggressive, active action to resolve the hacker controlled Darkzone and instead opted for a passive, legitimate player driven cleanup of hackers and you get a feeling of being forgotten about by those you gave hard earned money to for a product they are not willing to actively support while also not listening to the playerbase when it comes to drastic gameplay changes that negatively affect the game.\n\nAll in all I have a small hope that the game will get better, but for now I recommend waiting until you hear more positive news about The Division and less headlines with the word 'hacker' or 'revamp crafting' in them.\n","April 30","false","65.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I stopped playing the actual game after just 20 hours. It was litterally a total disappointment. There was nothing hyped that came out from when I played the Alphas and Betas. Not only that, the same problems occured. Crashes, terrible rendering, unbalanced scripts. Hell the Alpha and Closed Beta were actually more enjoyable than the games release itself. The issue with hackers hasn't even been touched on. That is a real shame because hackers appeared in the Open Beta and still haven't been fixed. In the Alpha and Closed Beta we didn't see any. Honestly this game should still be in the Alpha state. We were given what, 3 days to play it? Then not even a month later Closed Beta was released? Then 3 days to play again? Total joke. With a game that is supposed to be this hyped and some of us people waited years for its release, the companies involved with this title completely failed. I was hyped for this game since 2012 and I my hype for it died down the moment the game was released. Honestly everyone who bought this game should be refunded. And change the freaking price to $20 and put it as a Beta, cause seriously they need to fix so much in this game. This game was supposed to have an actual survival element, where you had to eat and drink. And the open world part wasn't supposed to be client side or only up to 4 members. It was supposed to be even bigger than what it is now. So many more things were supposed to be lootable. The looting aspect was actually supposed to mean something and not seem pointless. Why scrap more than half the ideas of what the majority of fans were hyped for? This is just another marketing stunt to get us hyped for another failure. Too many games that seem great, fall down because of their developers, publishers, and companies that are associated with the game title. Watch Dogs? ♥♥♥♥. DayZ? That went to ♥♥♥♥ too. Infestation Survivor Stories (WarZ)? ♥♥♥♥ also. The later COD Series? Even more ♥♥♥♥ (Honestly just play MW2, same ♥♥♥♥ passed that) Just don't buy this game, it isn't worth wasting your hours only to realize you can't refund it. Now some good games I will mention that are worth it. Rust (Still in Beta), The Fallout games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas being my favorites), The Elderscrolls (ESO isn't for a lot of people, wasn't what a lot of the fans expected), Rocket League, and many more. Most indie games are more successful and more enjoyed than over hyped ♥♥♥♥ like The Division. The saying "It sounds too good to be true" usually is just an upright honest saying. In this instance, it's true. Don't get this game, you'll want to bash your head against something for clicking that green enticing purchase button. Just bag the thought of this game up, take it to the back alley, throw it in the dumpster, ♥♥♥♥ on it, and forget that it ever even existed.

But sadly, it isn't. It is nothing like that, it is like smashing warframe with DayZ together and sell it. I have more than 2300 hours into Warframe, but for the 100+ hours in the division, I am not enjoying it at all. Because when you put heavy grinding and open world pvp together which only appeals to the most toxic and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ KOS players in the community, it will never work as intended and only drives people away because the so-called pvp in the division is PURE GRIEFING and nothing else.\nThis game is bad, very bad and the last thing you wish to have in a game like this is user-unfriendly UI.\n1.THERE IS NOT A THING CALLED "CRAFT ALL".\nHow could Ubisoft even think this is acceptable?\n2.CAMOS TAKE SPACE IN INVENTORY\nAgain how is this even acceptable when you can only store 40 god damn thing in your inventory and you can't expand that by any means?\n3.MAP NAVIGATION\nIf you misclick on a subject on the map (let's say a mission, an echo or a survival guide) and drag your mouse to find somewhere else to go and the only thing you will find is the navigation to the place you misclicked.\nAnd when you press F to set a point to go to, when you press F again to cancel it, 50% chance it will not work.\nThere is a bug that you can't set any navigation unless you open the map again.\nThere is a bug that the navigation point you set is 10 miles away from where you actually click the mouse.\n4.YOU CAN'T COOK YOUR NADES\nIt is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you even think about it.\n5.YOU CAN'T CROUCH.\nOnly thing you can do is the take cover only behind the DESIGNATED objects.\n6.YOU CAN'T PRONE.\nYes, in a run and gun game, you can't prone to avoid damage.\n7.MOAR\nLots of mechanics in game is really bad and I don't even want to talk about these. Because Ubisoft will never ever fix those broken-♥♥♥ crap.\n\nConclusion?\nDON'T GET IT UNLESS THERE IS A DISCOUNT AROUND 75% OFF.\n\nAnd also, fxxk those KOS dbag ♥♥♥.\n\n\n\n","March 24","false","292.2"," 87 of 160 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","87","160","9","11"

The rest of the games completely fine up to the point the only way you will get high end gear is threw luck, crafting or this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t challange mode. ♥♥♥♥ that. You think its funny forcing people to kill themselves over how frustrating this ♥♥♥♥ gets. Master level players who had the chance to farm up 1000 credits before that ♥♥♥♥ing patch killed everones chance to get anything good. Before hand those players, the lucky limited few who spent that money on mods and gear for these modes. GG for them they can blow threw that ♥♥♥♥ easily with 15+ health regain on crit or kill an enemy = god mode for 2 seconds. etc. The ♥♥♥♥ing rest of us by nerfed, the drop rate and leaving no other choose for us. Guess what. Its ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. Full week of play in to the game. I do not recommend this still they fix the problem with challange mode. Games not worth it.\n\nNow. For a more level headed point.\n\nThe game play up to the end game content, dark zone, hard mode and random incounters with enemy groups. They all seem to fit well and can be farmed for what little they give. The gun play is ok but a bit cluncky with reaction times. weapons dont fire right after being reloaded, some shot at the ground just after an animation and dont hit anything but the ground. Some small net code bugs like that. Worst I have seen has been people shooting a tank enemy in the face and showing no damage for over a minute before finally he ether killed everyone and was 16 feet behind them with a tiny bit of health left, or he dies instantly after still having a full bar of health.\n\nThe game needs some server restrictions. No one from china should have to put up with listening to a bunch of whiny 10 year old kids from the US, and No one should have to listen to a bunch of spanish kids screaming in the dark zone when you live in Canada. Point is. The Dark zone has no continental server support for those areas. Worst still is that you cant communicate with people that are doing missions who speak everything else but english. Personal problem for me maybe but how is it fair that they have to put up with me when I cant understand them and them asking me to do something? Its not is it.\n\nAfter all is said and done I cant completely bad mouth the game till the dev's let out the DLC and hopefully bring patches to resolve this stuff. Till then the game sits a 2 out of 5 for me and I do not think anyone should bother trying to play this game up to end game levels.","March 22","false","169.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

And I live in NYC, which makes me feel I wanna "explore" my city in a game, which would be dope. However, in fact, we stuck in a small piece of the city -Midtown. Well, I'll say okay cuz the graphic looks cool anyway.\n\nThe first couple of hours are pretty cool. The misssions and the story lines are well built. After a while, you'll find out the game pattern is shooting(which is more like a RPG way) and getting a higher level weapon. The attribute of weapons actually does not change that much and the only thing matters is the number of DPS, which is just a number.\n\nI feel so bored after playaing 20 hours and as long as I finished all the missions, the only thing I can do is to do those missions again in order to get a better weapon, which bores me to death.\n\nIf you are a fan of this kind of game, like Diablo 3, then definitely buy it. Else, not really a good game.","March 27","false","28.0"," 50 of 90 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","50","90","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenpojujitsu3/recommended/365590/","kenpojujitsu3","KenpoJuJitsu3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenpojujitsu3/","1908 products in account","This is one of those games where I wish Steam had a neutral option. Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, I've put a lot of hours into this game. Yes, I'm still actively playing it at the time of this writing. No, I do not recommend new people buy it at this point.\n\nPros: The game looks gorgeous with some of the best lighting and fire effects out there (note: I said *some* of the best, not *the* best). The sound design is on point and the gameplay itself is engaging which is why I'm still playing. It looks good, it plays good.\n\nCons: The game is content light and the developers don't seem to have a good grasp on how to handle this MMO/Shooter hybrid they've constructed. Once a player has finished the missions the game offers for leveling, that's it. The only content available after that is grinding in a PvPvE area known as the Dark Zone, playing the poorly constructed endgame "raid" (it's not a raid in the traditional MMO sense, it's a single weakly put together horde encounter), or replay a small selection of the missions the developers decided to bless with a replay option as opposed to offering an option to reset the world state. That's it on the content side of things.\n\nOne of the staples of successful MMO's as far as the end game is concerned is that there are multiple paths to getting endgame gear. While players will always find the "optimal" paths, the separate paths are generally kept on par with each other to support a variety of play styles. The Division doesn't do this *at all*. It shoehorns players into one method of playing by making other methods tedious and deliberately punitive. For players who enjoy crafting their gear in games, steer clear. The developers have made it abundantly clear that crafting shouldn't be an engaging activity a player actively, and intentionally, seeks out in this title. The amount of materials required was already large, and a recent patch multiplied it by a factor of 15 through increasing material costs and decreasing materials gained from salvaging unneeded items. The currency needed to purchase recipes to craft the gear, once materials are collected, requires a grind of its own. As if two levels of the grind is somehow insufficient, the player is barred from crafting precisely what they want, as some other games allow, in favor of a completely RNG based crafting system. So a player will collect the required materials for hours, grind for hours to days for the recipes, then craft an item that the RNG deems completely useless so the player has to amass fresh materials for more hours to try again...\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the gear dropped from enemies was worthwhile and actually made crafting something a player doesn't *need* to get the better gear, but the drop system is lacking. For one, the drop rate is absurdly low. The recent patch to guarantee "high end" drops from bosses is a bit of an odd duck. Yes, the bosses drop "high end" gear, and this change was advertised as removing the need for players to craft items. The problem? The "high end" drops from the majority of encounters in the game are a tier below the weakest "high end" items players can craft let alone the strongest stuff players can craft. Only a *very* small section of the game map offers drops on par with some crafted items. So to get the good stuff the players still generally have to invest in a crafting system that was intentionally setup to be punitive in a game that also has a problem with a lack of fresh and engaging end game content.\n\nShort version: If you're only interested in the game for the leveling experience form 1 to 30 (the current cap) this game might be worth it to you at full price. The game after level 30 is simply a grindy mess not fit for purchase without a steep discount. In its current state, the endgame could serve as a case study of what not to do when developing an engaging endgame.","April 19","false","173.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

Yet Ubisoft managed to create one of  the worst PvP experiences I've ever seen.\nIf you run around in the dark zone looking for gear you might just get ambushed by a group of rogue agents, if they start firing your chances of escaping are minimal. The XP loss is not as big as it was before patch but still significant especially if you are on your own because getting those xp back is going to be harder.\nThis results in a senseless grind of Dark Zone XP only to be farmed by rogue agents.\nUbisoft, nice try but a big part of your game is a real funkiller.\n\nSince the patch the DZ has become a place where I spent ~ 65% of my time running away from rogue agents (mostly failing), respawning, and trying to extract items (mostly failing).\nNow the question I ask is, besides the 3 daily missions what else is there to do in this game? Nothing so far that caught my eye.\n\n- Another big issue is cheating in the DZ, people are able to glitch out of the DZ (into checkpoints) while having rogue status. This is a known issue and Ubisoft doesnt seem to do anything about it.\n\n- Customer support claims they answer within 48 hours, I've written a ticket, updated it after 97 hours, 24 hours still no response. Does customer service even exist? 90 euros for this?\nUPDATE on customer support: after waiting for some more days my ticket got deleted without comment. Well thanks ubisoft for not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about customers.\n\n- PC issue: when buying blueprints for gear crafting it is not possible to scroll down to see all of the information that would be available. You have to buy it then you can read everything in a different menu.\n\n- Lootable containers in the base of operations (homebase) should be lootable once per hour (giving crafting material). This does not work properly, I can usually loot 2 or 3 of 4 available containers per hour, the rest stays locked.\n\n- Missions can be played at different difficulties (which is great), the only real problem in challenging missions are shotgunners charging the group and killing them. I hardly ever see a group get wiped by anything else than shotgunners in challenging mode. Not very creative or diverse.\n\n- DZ is not playable in less than excellently equipped squads of 4 people with voice communication. Everything else is just fodder for rogue groups. Either they shoot you right away or they follow you until you want to access a safe room or check point and then just fire away.\n\n- Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Generator would be an appropriate name for the Dark Zone","March 20","false","143.9"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","25","43","0","0"

It crashes after minutes in the game.\n\nFirst researched seemed to be something related to the sound drivers as part of the nvidea cards.  Which, I was using as my sound to a soundbar.  Disabled that and put sound into optical out and my staying power for the crashing "seemed" give me more minutes per crash.  But, seemed it still was too much to run in 4K.

No economy involved whatsoever.\ngear score gimmick\n\nGame summary:\nExcellent graphics.\nVery good voice acting.\nNo content (great engine and sandbox but not much to do in there)\nAI is dump as #$#!#, so no fun playing missions in co-op over and over again.\nOnly 4 main missions with challenging difficulty level.\nRepetitive side missions.\nPlain main mission objective:\n- go to beacon A;\n- trigger A fired;\n- enemies spawning at beacon A\n- when enemies killed go to beacon B, and so on\n\nGame difficulty is risen by making from enemies damage sponges.\nIn Open World gameplay they don't even react when are shot at.\n\nGame has hundreds of small bugs that should not be there upon release in AAA title.\n\nThere are so many flaws in this game, I doubt that they will ever fix it.\nGame got released, they got our money, most of the development team is probably switching to new projects now.\n\nI do not recommend buying this game now. If you're interested in it wait and see how the situation resolves.\nOr just wait for a sale and get it cheap and only if there sill is existing playerbase. The Division is NOT worth the price they asking for it. This game is more like BETA or Early Access and not a finished product.","May 8","false","311.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

My friends and I enjoy utilizing strategy and communication in the missions both hard and challenging, we completely enjoyed the DZ experience just over a month ago before all the hackers and exploiters took over, the tension in extracting loot was real.\n\nHowever, being a product from Ubisoft, they ♥♥♥♥ed this game. No lube.\n\nMy biggest complaint, aside from the complete LACK of any form of anti-cheat/glitch/hack system, is their slow ♥♥♥ development time for fixes and patches. There have been LARGE bugs since release (backpack glitch anyone?) that they STILL have yet to fix. These devs should be ramming patches and hotfixes down our throats to fix all the problems.\n\nLet's run down the pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-Amazing looking game visually, when your graphics arn't getting screwed by artifacting or glitches.\n-Runs quite well, lots of graphic scalability and options.\n-Cover system actually isn't TOO terrible, I haven't had too many issues navigating cover.\n-Gunplay is solid, responsive, accurate.\n-Playing with friends is an absolute must for enjoyment.\n\nCONS:\n-The million glitches. Wall glitches, mission glitches, falling through the world glitches, weapon and perk glitches and exploits. The list just goes on and on.\n-ZERO anti-cheat system in place, it's like WarZ all over again with the hackers. Soft AF stance on punishing cheaters.\n-The current incursion is fun the first time you play, after that it's a repetative chore.\n-DZ is basically unplayable due to all the hacks/exploits being used.\n-DPS numbers change constantly depending on what weapon you actually have equipped, when viewing other weapons, unreliable system to evaluate other weapons.\n-The loot is in SERIOUS need of an overhaul. Yes the 1.2 patch is supposedly addressing this, but this review is of the current state of the game. Loot is basically garbage, anything below challenge mode will give you garbage, crafting was the only way to get decent rolls but they nerfed it into the ground last patch.\n-When legit PVP does happen in the DZ, it consists of running around in the middle of the road with an SMG and Survival Link, hoping you kill them before your link wears off, then its combat rolling for days until you get away or die. I don't think I've ever seen anyone really use a skill outside of First Aid.\n-Only 4 challenge missions available, gets super snore after a while.\n\nBasically, this game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but due to corporate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and Ubisoft being Ubisoft, it is ♥♥♥♥ED. I really want to see this game get better, and not die like lots of other online games have, but the devs need to take a serious step up to the plate and FIX THIS ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOn release: 9/10\nCurrently: 3/10\n\n","May 9","false","259.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I hit lvl 30 after a few days, got a Gear Score of 180 shortly after. Probably within 24 hours of play. I'm currently at 115 hours and I've moved up a total of 15 Gear score. Its not even enjoyable grinding. You run around in circles picking up gear that you're just going to deconstruct. OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n2: The unfinished state of the game. So many glitches. I get kicked out of the game at least once everytime I play. Glitches ran from game shut downs to the inventory being messed up (Where are the rest of my shoes) to lights not being on in the Base of Operations. It would be one thing if the game had amazing content, perhaps i could ignore the glitches but the fall-off after lvl 30 is like jumping off a cliff. Welcome to running around the dark zone for hours on end with little to no reward. Yaayyyy Monotony.\n3: Incursions. The Developer's attempt to spice up the game perfectly incapsulates why this game sucks. You sit in ONE ROOM and battle through 15 grueling waves of people to recieve two pieces of gear that may or may not be something you want. Wow, way to go team. Who wants this ♥♥♥♥? I have 4 pairs of the same gloves. Guess I'll deconstruct them so I can get 2 pieces of fabric. Yayyyy.\n4: PVP. So unrewarding. You could literally take down the whole server and recieve nothing for it. Only if you complete your manhunt do you receive a reward. You get less experience for taking down a rogue than you lose from getting killed by one. I love walking into the DZ and getting steam rolled by a manhunt group. Neither side is rewarding 99% of the time. You either die from a rogue or live long enough to die as a manhunt. All for some experience and money to buy gear that frankly, if you're able to survive one, is much worse than what you have.\n\nThe realization hit me today that this game is just not fun. Sure you'll waste hours on it thinking you're enjoying yourself but you're falling down a rabbit hole of boredom. Don't waste your time with this dribble of content.\n\nThe game could be a lot better if they reduced the amount of bugs, made pvp interesting (there was a group of guys that started a fight club in the DZ that was pretty enjoyable, spice it up boys.) and actually put content into the end game beyond literally running around in circles hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel,","May 10","false","116.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Just don't buy it, or any other Ubisoft games for that matter, because this is what you can expect if you do.","May 8","false","92.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I started this game with 7 other friends, including my brother. Let’s just say as of this past week none of us play anymore. We’ve given up on the game. The game started off a lot of fun, but you soon find yourself bored of running the same 4 challenge missions at end-game. The DZ is completely broken due to various reasons, which some of these reasons fall over into the PvE aspect too. This includes build diversity, which there is none. Glitches and hackers all over the place are completely ruining the game.\n\nThis game has a strong emphasis on loot, yet there is next to no loot. Most loot is worthless as the Meta is extremely small. The same can be said about the abilities. The incursions that just came out are completely uncreative and feel as stale as the rest of the end-game. It doesn’t matter because everyone is just using glitches in the incursion anyways. This game has a gorgeous replica of New York City, yet a massive chunk of it is not used in the end-game whatsoever. I recommend not anyone else to buy this game. Do your research before doing so. You’ll see my comments regurgitated here such on YouTube, forums, and other social media outlets. I will not buy another Ubisoft backed game at launch ever again.\n","April 17","false","184.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes this is sitting on the fence between the two in my book and it doesn't do a very good job at either genre unfortunately.\nTo give you a run down of the basic categories the graphics and animations are very nice along with decent audio and voice acting, the story is rubbish and so generic these days, in fact i am not sure how many more post war or zombie games I can take before falling asleep.\nThe gameplay is decent and the feel of the weapons plus the varity and mods are all good but it does not mesh with the fact that you need to unload full clips into the face of some enemies and even then they still keep going, are these guys super mutants?\nThe game does deliver fun though - when you finally get connected with your mates and assuming you are all at the same level or very close then you can spend hours runnig through missions and maps together just as you were hoping for when you forked over your hard earned cash.\nThis unfortunately is also where the games falls down;\n- Having to connect to the Ubisoft servers several times just to get into the game\n- Getting kicked from server a couple times each gaming session\n- Laggy when playing Co Op\n- Even more lag when playing Darkzone (PvP)\n- And the biggest issue with Division is it ramps enemies up to the highest level player in your group so if I am level 10 but 1 of my mates in Co Op is level 20 then all enemies are set to level 20 and easily 1 shot kill any player less then 4 levels below 20, this is madness it should be running to the lowest level character in the group and ruined a potentially good Co Op game.  4 player Co Op was the biggest draw card for this game.\nTo sum up the game is better suited to playing solo which would have been fine if the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s didn't market it as a 4 player Co Op masterpiece.\n\n","April 17","false","36.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

From a content starved initial release to a pure repetitive gear grinding game in less than 2 weeks of ownership.  First preorder I ever remember making and will also be the last.  Story/campaign is short (welcome to Ubisoft games) and lacked any diversity or challenge in the gameplay of those missions, but in fairness the actual story itself was good.  Once you invest a couple nights into working through the storyline and the limited number of missions, you find you are left with doing the missions over and over again, hoping for something decent (gear/weapons) to drop – or the alternative is to venture into the Dark Zone (pvp/multiplayer area), which as it turns out is just a repetitive grindy as the lackluster mission gameplay.  Ultimately the multi-player system is very weak overall, lacking any interesting or significant multiplayer game elements.  Add in getting griefed by hackers shooting through walls and watching hours of gameplay get erased in a few shoft minutes of weaker cellmate prison shower time by one-shot wonders, it's more than just a nuisance, it’s downright stupid.  You can count on that happening once every few days.  The penalty for getting your loot jacked, your DZ chest keys stolen and your DZ funds gobbled up by skill-less wonders isn’t bad enough, they also drop your DZ level experience like a virtue.  A couple hours of work wiped out in a few minutes.. and at a season pass price, it's just about everything you would hope for..  Not that levels are important depending on which month they patch and "balance" out the game play, which is a bear in it's own right.  You spend a week getting one perfect gear piece, grinding away on useless drops that you mine for parts, only to have it completely invalidated/outdated on the next monthly release with gear level cap increases, etc.  It’d be nice if they spent some time on adding feature rich content or interesting game play elements rather than just adding another carrot to the stick to try and keep you grinding away chasing decent gear.  Anyway, it is what it is.  The gameplay mechanics are decent for what you can do, the cover system is a little awkward when you get stuck in a cover to cover move uninentially and are still in the blast radius of the incoming grenade.  It's more frustrating to be surrounded by vehicles that you can’t jump in and drive for no reason that you can understand.  Not that it would be that intersting with no multi-player outside of the darkzone, but it would close one of the "wth" elements that aren't explainahle. All I can say is that there isn’t another game that makes me want to load up GTAV and enjoy all the elements this game fell short on quicker.  If you are on the fence, I’d wait until this was discounted 75% and was out for more than a year, which is about the length of time it will take Ubisoft to stop releasing content I imagine (at least for free).  It could be worse, you could have bought a FarCry 4 season pass and found yourself on the losing end of "Valley of the Yeti’s" as one of the few updates  Doh!  I was foiled again by Ubisoft…. Time to go play GTAV, with more relevant and free updates being released three years after release than this one on the second of a twelve month planned release calendar.  Recommended?

If you asked me to wright a review a few weeks ago i would have given it the full thumbs up, but at the moment the game is filled with hackers. You just can't compete with that. Also bugs are a major issue. I know that there are players that exploit glitches in the game to get better gear but as for my self, i take about an hour of my day to try and do daily missions to get some pheonix credits. But hey guess what... the "daily" missions cant be played over weekends. Even in the week, some missions have a door that has to open when you want to start the mission, but it doesn't. This is a realy big setback for someone like me. My weekends i am free to play games. I want to farm pheonix credits but oops... they're unavailable. So let it just be known... this is the very last ♥♥♥♥ing ubisoft game that i will ever buy. i have had enough of this ♥♥♥♥.","May 9","false","193.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you really want to "grind" high level items very fast, you need to play the dark zone. But if you want to play the dark zone effectively, you need high end gear (discounting if you're lucky not to run into high end rogues / cheaters).\n\nYes you can still play the dark zone even if you are on normal gear as long as you have reasonable skill\n\nYes you can still grind for high level gear in PVE.\n\nHowever, chances are high that you will end up feeling frustrated in the end if you encounter what I shall describe below.\n\n=PVE=\nOf course, you can still get high end gear by playing daily missions and Incursions (i.e. Raids). But there are only 3 daily missions a day, and chances are you get high end drops that you do not want. You can do things like making multiple characters (to do daily missions multiple times) to farm gear and special credits which you can use to buy high end gear blueprints.\n\nInitially I got sick of what the dark zone has become, so I thought I can still redeem this game providing me a chance to get gear on PVE/COOP missions like Incursions instead.\n\nIncursions (raids) also give you really high end gear, but if you are the kind who plays with randoms, good luck trying to coordinate winning the mission. I've wasted hours on the team dying in Incursions. That's because Incursions are really long missions and of course you start all over again if the team dies (no checkpoints). The very first incursion was long because instead of trying to make it interesting, it is just waves after waves of bullet sponge enemies, which are easily solved if you have good gear to take them down very fast. (And getting good gear in this game is now a slog.)\n\nIt's better to find a group. Hopefully you get someone with very good gear in your team (or yet, a cheater/exploiter).\n\nThen there's the problem where chances are you get kicked out of a group for having low level gear. Trust me, even if you meet the gear level requirements of the Incursion, it is still really low, and I've seen people get kicked. However, you can still be of reasonable gear and be skilled, but then you will just slog through and it feels grindy and boring. The very first Incursion mission itself is really boring.\n\n=PVP=\nThe Dark Zone.\n\nToo many griefers. You come to this point of diminishing returns. If you are unlucky, basically there are rogue agents who camp at extraction points for other players to try to extract high end gear. These players work hard to get high end gear only to get killed by rogue agents who just pick up the loot and extract immediately. Then these rogue agents get better loot and they become more powerful. And the cycle continues.\n\nSure, you can get your team to hunt them down. But only if your team is really high end.\n\nSure, you can try to ask other teams to help you take down the rogue agents, but doing so is difficult. Main factor is that dying in the dark zone causes you to lose "Dark Zone Credits (Another form of currency to buy dark zone items)" and Dark Zone levels (which is separate from Character Level and also allows you to get dark zone items).\n\nSo basically no one wants to waste their time hunting down high geared rogues when they just get killed and respawn so far away from the rest of the team and getting penalties for dying.\n\nNow imagine the above situation with rampant cheating .","May 19","false","91.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Don't get me wrong it's fun as hell in the beginning. I feel like Ubisoft has given up on the PC version of the game. You can't get any good guns or gear without getting to level 75-90 in the dark zone, and it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get to that level because there are hackers everywhere killing you and making you loose XP. Speed hacks wall hacks rate of fire hacks aimbots etc etc. They made the drop rate so high in the game that getting a good item means nothing. They nerfed crafting basically out of existence to buff the drops ridiculously. All NPC's and challenging missions even the Incursion are way too ridiculously easy, so if you're looking for co op play youre looking in the wrong place. All servers are way too small and over crouded as hell you can't even make it halfway to a landmark without it being finished by another group.

It's not a horrible game. In fact, it's really fun. It's almost perfect. The problem is, however, the devs, Ubisoft.\n\nThis game is beautiful. The graphics are some of the best I've seen. The story's nice and was set up well. The mechanics and gameplay are easy to learn, and it usually never gets repetitive. It definitely deserves and award or two.\n\nThe thing that doesn't make it deserve them are the developers, like I said before. Yes, they have addressed some things like game-breaking and frustrating bugs or glitches. However, there are some still left behind. Some of these include:\n-Falling through the world\n-Random flying bits of textures flying everywhere\n-Some I can't even put into words\nAlso, the updates. Yes, only the April update has come out and the May update is dropping soon. But look. The April update gave us Supply Drops, which we all got hyped for. However, when it actually came, we were disappointed. The May update has been confirmed to include "High-Value Targets", which will hopefully drop better loot than Supply Drops.\n\nSo am I saying you should not get this game? No, that's the complete opposite of what I'm saying. Get the game if you want and enjoy the beauty that is The Divison. All I'm telling you is that the only reason why people look down on this game is because of its developers.

The first 50 or so hours is quite fun and exciting, but as you reach the end game you start tolose that drive to carry on. Diablo games in the past have been successful because blizzard has made them competative and made people care despite  bad design decisions. This is diablo as a third person shooter but it gets boring much faster. This game will leave you feeling empty inside wondering why you wasted your time and money. Not worth.

My team sees a rogue on our mini-maps and I think, hey it's only one, time for a little fun! We get there only to have him come out of the building, gun down 2 of my 3 man team, leaving me to get his health down half-way before he DESTROYS me via rapid reloading & firing an lmg. Then proceeds to clap slowly while instantly killing a guy 40ft behind him, oh and did I mention these were all head-shots too?\n\nLater on he stacks my team (pub team) into a safe house were no-one listens to anything and they all just rush outside, resulting in a massacre. I make it out by the thread of a hair when I get out and get to an extraction zone, alone, not too far from the safe house. I start the extraction, 10 seconds, nothing. 20, nothing. 50 nothing. Last 20 seconds? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shows up, I hear him moving around like a cockroach, decide to jump off the balcony as a last ditch effort to avoid him, get airshot. lose gear but he doesn't take it.. I run back, with the plan to get my gear and go to a checkpoint and wait it out. I grab my gear and run for it. that skull shows up and guess what? It's a manhunt.\n\nI fear for my gear seeing the little meter counter go up and down. Then out of the blue it rapidly descends. My heart is pumping, I sprint to a nearby light generator. Shots ring out through the world as half of my first bar of health is depleted. I take cover and see him down the sidewalk unloading everything. It's like a shower of bullets as I think of what to do.\n\nThen I got it, time to surrender. So that's what I did, used the icon that I've seen only a few use genuinely in my time in the dark-zone. He sprints up and says word for ♥♥♥♥ing word over his mic, "Okay, we friends now...". Blew my ♥♥♥♥ing mind. At this point I was praising him as a god and started to walk off towards the last stretch of the road towards the checkpoint when he runs in front of me and tells me to *ahem* "kill me". No this isn't a joke, and hold up, this does get worse.\n\nSo we sit there for three minutes as he try's to convince me he won't kill me, mind you this was after the patch came in that made non-rogues rogue after shooting a rogue agent. So you can imaging what happened next... Basically in the end everyone came out of hiding when I killed the hacker only to then proceed to anally ♥♥♥♥ me.\n\nIn the end, that was one story from the plethora of stories that made my experience ♥♥♥♥ this game has to offer. Honestly ♥♥♥♥ just got pissy after lvl 30 and it became a dry, boring run through the DZ with hackers replacing the npcs as the most annoying things to ever ♥♥♥♥ing exist. Honestly the beginning was SOMETHING, at least you had objectives, till after 100 hours when you realized you spent actual money on a game that progressively becomes a ♥♥♥♥-fest of updates leading to more problems, gear grinding that is worse than grinding your own hands off with a band saw, and tedious crafting that never yielded what you wanted so you had to go and grind MORE for MORE tools that you can't buy with the useless money that becomes obsolete halfway through the game.\n\nI made a new character just to get in another 100 so that I wouldn't have just wasted my money for nothing but in the end I feel that buying ♥♥♥♥ing erotic porn would've kept me more contempt than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game that has no right to bear any type of connection to rainbow siege six. ♥♥♥♥ this game and it's late game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","May 11","false","221.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics are really nice and detail is amazing but that's about it. I don't like the relentless grinding that never really makes me feel like im accomplishing anything or at least getting my character's stats the way I'd like them to be. That would be somewhat forgivable if it weren't for the fact that this game is broken so many different ways. That's just my opinion though but here are some real reasons I have a problem with the game.\n\n-Hackers rampant in the dark zone\n-Loot in the dark zone never really being worth the struggle\n-Some stats on gear not working properly\n-PvP being extremely lopsided and gear based, means you'll likely never get a fair match\n-Random server disconnects\n-Lack of involvement in the community by massive or ubisoft\n-Random crashes\n-Incursion(s) being so difficult for little to no real reward\n-Season Pass not being worth it\n-Lots of random bugs/glitches\n-Lack luster clothing/character customization options\n\nThe list goes on but most other issues are small enough to be forgivable in my eyes. However after having put in over 100 hours into this game I just find myself getting very bored and fed up with it's problems. I REALLY REALLY want to like this game but this game doesn't want me to like it.

Have over 300 hours of play time in this game.  Worked really hard to get good weapons and gear which is hard to do with the RNG in this game.\nPVE was fun and the Hard modes when leveling up were hard and again very fun.\nOnce 30 I loved the Challenge modes and the DZ.\n\nThe game environment is amazing and the attention to the small details is great.  The first couple of weeks I was still astounded by the little details I hadn't noticed and kept seeing.\n\nHowever.... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nI am DZ rank 92.  I have 23594 kills in the game, 2756 items extracted, 269 Rogue agent kills.  The DZ however is broken.... really really badly.  The DZ is the PVP enabled area.  It is full of intensity, are you going to get those items out via extraction or will someone come and try to kill/engage you to take your loot from you.\n\nI literally love the DZ, but it is broken.  There is no balance. After the 1.1 incursion DLC was released it literally doesn't matter how much health you have as the DPS is SOOOOO large now it is basically first to shoot wins.\n\nOn top of that there is a prolific cheater problem.  You CANNOT go rogue anymore as you will die to a cheater that is shooting through walls or teleporting behind you or flying or in a building.  You literally die almost instantly to cheaters.\n\nIt is such a shame, this game has all the potential to be amazing.  The DZ is awesome and the intensity they have created with it is so much fun but they are not addressing the biggest issues this game face which are the cheaters and the game balance in the PVP area.\n\nOne day they might fix it and get rid of the cheaters but the population for this game is already seeping away. http://steamcharts.com/app/365590 the game is on a steady decline in users.\n\nThe forums are awash with people complaining about cheaters.\n\nJust save your money.

I spent 60-ish hours on the story, thats with taking proper breaks between story missions and clearing out entire zones of all collectables before moving on. Most people complete the game in 8 hours. But the sell here was the MMO style of endless game, frequent content pushes, and plenty to do at the end of the game to keep you busy in between updates. Simply put, there is no end game. There are no 'raids'. There is no real content that you get to enjoy once reaching level cap. Their first Incursion/Operation content push literally puts you in a single large room with the main objective of destroying an enemy that doesn't move. The single "tactic" available to complete said incursion requires you to eliminate 15 waves of super soldiers with ultra-bazooka-sniping-shotguns from hell that you truly have no actual way to defend yourself against other than hopefully killing them before they overrun you. That being said a vast majority of the player base has taken to using an endless variety of bugs and exploits to undermine the overall mechanics of the game. Hacking also has its expected place in the dark zone. In fact, right before writing this review i was mowed down by an aimbot-hero with a gun that shot so fast it looked like it shot freakin' laser beams. Yes, amusing.\n\nLook guys, this game is in shambles. It's beautiful to look at, and quite enjoyable at first.. but once the honeymoon phase wears off its just a frustrating pile of bugs.

I tried to make it work, you know I did. I dedicated a lot of time just for you. Time that maybe I should've dedicated to my family, friends, work and studies. What we had wasn't casual.\n\nI defended you against the initial negative reception. I accepted your graphical downgrade. I chose to ignore how absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed up your netcode is. I turned a blind eye on how almost all stats are calculated and stored on the client, and server just accepts it without any checking. I fell on deaf ears when realized you have no anti-cheat whatsoever. I chose to ignore the global networking architecture ♥♥♥♥up. I looked past your very limited character creation. I accepted that you could be boring at times. Even after i've done everything there is to do in the game, i kept on visiting you daily for several hours. I tried to convince myself, that the PvP would be the end-game, but yet again you disappoint me. The complete lack of end-game and limited content adds up to the recurring feeling there is nothing much to do in the game.\n\nMy friends kept asking me how could I go on with this. What they couldn't understand is that, although it was always hard to make things work between us, when they worked, it was something very special. I'm not rich, but still I bought new dresses for my characters. I bought the Gold Edition with Season Pass, even though i had no idea what would come with it. I trusted in you. I believed you.\n\nThe current state of the game is abysmal. Dozens of glitches ruined the player base progression. Clipping through walls, cheesy farming exploits all over, bugged weapon and equipment talents exploiting, Item duping, infinite money and infinite crafting materials. Not to mention the cheater infested Dark Zone, with free and paid hacks available on demand. Even a simple memory editor is enough for cheaters to give themselves infinite ammo, no reload, rapidfire, no recoil, speed hack and teleport. There is no light at the end of this tunnel, baby. It is a glitch-exploiting hack-infested ♥♥♥♥fest, it is a disaster. There is no in-game report feature, the only way is to record and manually report through the terrible support, only to have an answer many days later with a automated message, and later discover that the blatant cheater i reported still roaming the Dark Zone. How can a company that spent so much money on marketing, not hire a outsourced anti-cheat service such as FairFight and PunkBuster, at least to brake the cheating a little bit?\n\nThe time has come for me to change my review. I can't really recommend The Division for anyone in its current state. For my friends on Steam that see playing this game a lot in the past weeks, and might get interested in the game, i must warn you, the game is not worth your money or your time. Stay away from this game.\n\nI could keep dreaming of the day when the wrongs will get fixed, when the flaws will get polished. But we both know that this will never happen. I held on for as long as I could, darling. But it's over. I hold no regrets, at least we tried, and we had our fun times. I sincerely hope one day we can work out our issues and come to terms. Deep down, i'll always remember you.

Not a great sentence with which to begin a review but it isn't a matter of opinion, it is a statement of fact. The game has been broken since the beta and continues to be so.\n\nThe game is built around a "trusted client" system, typical of console games. This means that the servers take at face value your character's stats and capabilities. This means that this game is PATHETICALLY easy to cheat in, as all it takes is a simple programme to bypass the lone check and a memory editor. In a game built around gathering loot and a PvP free-for-all zone, this is all bad.\n\nAdd on top of this the PVP zone is poorly bracketted, meaning that people who have used cheats, glitches, and exploits to get the best gear will be there to utterly annihilate you with ease. Simply put the PvP zone is overrun with over geared cheaters bent on ruining the game experience, and they have succeeded.\n\nAll of this built on top of a miriad of graphical glitches, falling through the floors, constant connection issues, outright deleting people's characters, certain gear making your account literally unplayable, and most of the in game stats not functioning properly, this game is borderline unplayable. I'd say it is Ubisoft's worst effort to date, which is saying a great deal about a company that hasn't put forth a good effort in a very, very long time.\n\nPeople will respond with criticism that they are fixing the game and dealing with the issues, but this is simply untrue. For every issue they fix another five are discovered. As for the hacking and cheating, this is rampant in a game released earlier by this company, Rainbow Six: Siege. Considering their track record of doing nothing to alleviate the issues in that game, I would expect the same here. The console versions may be decent, but the PC version is worthless. Do not purchase it.","April 27","false","288.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I had a lot of fun, but it just lacks content. Like needing 2 major expansions lack of content. It's a great idea and thats all. Its like they built this great system for a game, and a basic way to test that system, but then never built a real game around it. Once you go through the single player story the only thing left to do is grind in the pvp zone. Grinding doesnt have to be a bad thing, but theres no purpose. You can do the exact same thing you could do with a purple set as you can with a gold item set. Maybe you can do missions on challeng mode then? The same missions youve already run, in order to get better loot I guess... These are things that work in most MMORPGS, but not in the Division.

The graphics are really nice and detail is amazing but that's about it. I don't like the relentless grinding that never really makes me feel like im accomplishing anything or at least getting my character's stats the way I'd like them to be. That would be somewhat forgivable if it weren't for the fact that this game is broken so many different ways. That's just my opinion though but here are some real reasons I have a problem with the game.\n\n-Hackers rampant in the dark zone\n-Loot in the dark zone never really being worth the struggle\n-Some stats on gear not working properly\n-PvP being extremely lopsided and gear based, means you'll likely never get a fair match\n-Random server disconnects\n-Lack of involvement in the community by massive or ubisoft\n-Random crashes\n-Incursion(s) being so difficult for little to no real reward\n-Season Pass not being worth it\n-Lots of random bugs/glitches\n-Lack luster clothing/character customization options\n\nThe list goes on but most other issues are small enough to be forgivable in my eyes. However after having put in over 100 hours into this game I just find myself getting very bored and fed up with it's problems. I REALLY REALLY want to like this game but this game doesn't want me to like it.

I mean, a guy doesn't like your name? Kicked. Doesn't like the color shirt you're wearing? Kicked.\n\nSo I'm trying to load into a random group on clear sky, ok used to loading screens that's fine. Get into the group everyone is having the bug where you run into the mission area and get transported to the beginning. Ok we all leave group. Another loading screen. Alright I'm going to be patient because I want to try the new content and give this a chance. my gear score is 197, I get it not super high, but it is doable, I know this because I went 20 minutes through the mission yesterday before everyone got spam dced and we gave up. Ok so I join another random group, loading screen, load, I've been kicked already, another loading screen, back in safe zone. Alright well I'm sure that guy was just anal about things, lets give it another go. Loading screen, load, kicked already, back to safe zone. I can't do this game anymore, been patient but even outside of the bugs, which i don't mind giving developers time to fix, this god power you give to random people in groups is just a bad design decision.\n\nThis game is unique, exciting and fun, when it works.

Yes a MMO is where you grind relentless hours for rare loot, crafting, earning in-game cash and building your character(s), but since they made the drops generous enough it spoils the chase of it and made it boring. The old missions you prolly would rarely play and just go for the top tier missions or go into the darkzone/pvp but the thrill, excitment and scared silly part of that is gone. Crafting is dead even though more supplies are needed, high end drops are raining in your inventory and flooded and the blueprints are lower tiered than the items dropped !\n\nWill still play cuz I already bought this and anticipate to see what Tom Clancy's Wildland brings so I can jump ship.","April 11","false","461.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In my opinion, this game had the potential to beat Destiny, but you start to realize after a while, the game gets repetitive and boring. Fight enemies, do this, grab this, fight these enemies and fight a boss at the end. It became a point to where me and my friends knew exactly what to do and didn't even need to worry about the final boss. Another thing that I would like to comment about is the dark zone. Good idea, bad execution. The dark zone is fun, don't get me wrong, but it is not fun alone. Sure you have the excitement of going rouge and killing enemies for really good loot, but I fall back to my last statement. Its repetitive. This game takes a lot of grinding to get some good gear, and sometimes that time is just wasted into doing what? Getting good gear, going back to use the gear in a mission and repeat the process? That's it. And of course like every game you're gonna find better loot and replace everything. It will repeat. To end this review, I do reccomend this for people who have time to grind and have friends to back them up. Sadly, I do not reccomend this to the community as a whole.","June 3","false","51.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I played both the closed and open Beta.Now that I have it its good but maybe a little too "Hyped" up. The story in my opinion could go a little more in dept( i havent beat the game yet, but what Im basing this off what i did play so far.)\n\nRate:9/10    Would stand in a line again\nThe good:\nThe game is ok/decent playing by yourself , but when you have a team working together in coordination and tactics its super fun and intense.Also having your buddies watch you back in the dark zone is very good. The graphics are good im not a fan of amazing graphics (mainly because my computer gets too hot) but the graphics are very good and not too badly optimized. Difficult and challening enemies throught manhatten, A fairly and decent Sized Map with ton of side missions to do as well as main missions.The perks and gunplay are pretty  solid there are also many customizations you can do to your character from the type for clothes he wheres to the equipment he uses and guns etc.\nThe Bad:\nThere is some not so bad bugs/flaws in The Division but can definitly be improved by Ubisoft. One is that the enemy spawning is not random they spawn in the same location but at different levels, it depends on your level. the dialogue between npc could also be improved and your overall interaction with civs should too. im not saying you should allow us to shoot civs but they do get annoying when they are in a doorway you need to get through......\n\n\n***NOTE*** There was a glitch/bug for me when I did launch the game for the first time where it was just a black screen and  I couldnt Alt-Tab ,CTRL-ALT-DELETE ,or ALT F4 and would require a force reset on your computer. A temporary fix is when you start the game press ALT- ENTER while on the black screen to turn the game into window mode then navigate to settings and put it back into fullscreen. After a few times doing this the problem automatically solved itself for me.\n\nAlso you know 2/3 of the population in New York is named Alex :p","March 11","true","214.3"," 210 of 397 people (53%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","53","210","397","11","5"

Here are the reasons:\n- Mindless farming for weapons and crafting components\n- Weapons modification (more on that later)\n- Good selection of cool skills that become absolutely useless in the hardest modes\n- Character creation is a joke\n- BORING\nOk so about this list. A lot of people have a problem with the lack of endgame content and while that is a problem for me, I would like to state that even while this game was in development long enough to have more, it is a newer game and we shouldn't expect miracles. That is the reason I did not list it in the reasons why this game lets me down.\nThe mindless farming of crafting components and gear is an extreme deterant for me. I hate MMOs for the most part. Why ? I'm glad you asked. Its because of the "best gear" and the absolute need for it. This game would have been far better without it. This also brings me to the hardcore MMO gun modding system. I like a little more realism in my games and even if you don't, this modding system is stupid. Adding a scope should do nothing more than allow you to see your target better at range. Not add stats to a gun that it wouldn't add to a real gun. A scope doesn't add range IRL so why should it here. Clips add more ammo, why would that increase rate of fire ? This also makes some guns even more powerful than some of their counterparts. LVOA-C can get over 1000 rpm. So can the Mp5. Why would you use anything else in PvP where crit and rpm are the gods of combat. Crit is a stupid mechanic in this game because again, it makes SMGs far better at PvP than any other weapon. The rest I'm sure you can figure out if you decide to play this game. For me to play this game again, The following would have to happen:\n1. Remove the modding system stats. Making the guns more realistic.\n2. Remove the game breaking crit damage system that ruins the game for people that don't want to use SMGs for PvP.\n3. Make cloth purchasable and remove them from the drop system.\nI guess in short this game needs to be far less MMO and far more realistic. It should not take 20-60 rounds of ammo to kill something. Player or not. There are far FAR more problems with this game but I'm not even going to go into that. Buyer beware.

The pve in the game is good, but after you get done with all of the pve objectives the game begins to get very bland and boring in pve. After beating everything outside of the dark zone you can only replay mission on different difficulties or do incursions. The pvp in the game is complete ♥♥♥♥ if you have not played in a long time. An example of this is I'm level 45 dz and a gear rank of 183 and I am constantly running into and being killed by 70 dz - 99 dz with 200+ gear score. If they add more things to do outside of the dark zone and balance the pvp a bit more the game will be a bit better. Over all they need to balance the game more, add in more content and fix the bugs in the game.","May 24","false","172.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Let's just say I'm not placing my interests in other games currently so I just use TCTD to kill time.\n\nReasons: (tl;dr below)\n\n1. Glitch/exploit heaven\nThe infamous 'mobile cover' exploit is already causing enough troubles to create a severe imbalance in terms of players' gear. If you exploit/glitch a few mission runs, you're already streets ahead in terms of gear, compared to those who play this game legit (assuming that you two have the same amount of hours devoted into the game).\n\nPlus, this game doesn't really have designated PvP gear separated from PvE gear. So whoever gets the better gear dominates the DZ, and the imbalance at the moment is so obvious that it disrupts PvP enjoyment.\n\n2. Blatant hacking\nThere are quite a number of hackers in this game, and they don't try to hide it as well. It won't affect PvE, but you pretty much have to enter the DZ to farm at some point, so you can't hide from PvP forever anyway.\n\nSome aimhack, some adjust stats so that they're invincible, some fly in the sky, some teleport when they're near death, and some shoot through buildings too. Now, I'm not saying that you'll bump into one every time you enter the DZ, but it's a frequent occurrence.\n\n3. Gameplay imbalance\nThe new gear sets render armour mitigation and HP count almost obsolete. Stacking health to tank PvP damage is certainly not the best way to go. With the new gear set bonuses, you can easily tear through a player running a tank build. It just doesn't feel balanced at all, compared to the beta releases.\n\n4. Lack of free-roaming encounters\nAfter you've reached PvE level 30, the PvE map is literally empty. There are some low-leveled minions at designated spawn areas, but that's it. They aren't even a threat to you if you're geared properly. They just tickle your HP. A huge waste of the map potential I must say.\n\n5. Un-rewarding loot system\nThe loot drops are way too trash for end-game players to have an incentive to continue grinding. It'll take ages before you get lucky with a rare item with good stat/talent rolls. If they don't calibrate the drop rates and system anytime soon, I'd be quitting the game as well!\n\ntl;dr\nDon't buy this game because\n- Hackers are everywhere in PvP, it's a joke right now\n- No effective counter-measures to deter glitchers/exploiters yet, rendering gear imbalance amongst players\n- PvE has little to no content after you reach PvE lvl 30\n- PvE loot drop system does not reward you with useful items often enough (words from a 400 hour player so it does carry some weight)\n- PvP is imbalanced, it doesn't feel tactical at all unless they adjust the ridiculous damage output offered by the new gear set items","April 20","false","603.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I can see Ubisoft making DLC and just focus on the story line\n\nCons\n- Everything not related to the campaign\n- Multiplayer\n#1  Flodded with exploiters\n#2  No concept of pvp or pve server.  This way, people can farm for their gears in the darkzone without getting killed while calling for extraction.  Anybody who wants to do pvp can join the pvp server. At least everyone knows what they are getting into\n#3 Banning of exploiters.  They ban exploiters but WILL NOT TELL you what you did wrong except that you should read the code of conduct.  So how does someone know that the reason you got ban is because you mapped your skill buttons to a logitech mouse that has at least 12 programmable buttons.  Does the code of conduct tell you not to use macro button enable mices?\n\nReally, this is a shame. Great game in the beginning and it just declines all the way down\n\n\nConclusion:  You are buying this game for the storyline period.

The pve in the game is good, but after you get done with all of the pve objectives the game begins to get very bland and boring in pve. After beating everything outside of the dark zone you can only replay mission on different difficulties or do incursions. The pvp in the game is complete ♥♥♥♥ if you have not played in a long time. An example of this is I'm level 45 dz and a gear rank of 183 and I am constantly running into and being killed by 70 dz - 99 dz with 200+ gear score. If they add more things to do outside of the dark zone and balance the pvp a bit more the game will be a bit better.

And the final mission SPOILER ALERT!!  is dumb as ♥♥♥♥. The bad guy, which is an ex military general with experience, has a chopper to fly away, get his people back together and strike back but oh wait no, he decides to just fly around the base he just lost to a bunch of medics and retired cops that decided to play soldiers by joining the JTM or however they are called, and just shoot you and your friends with a machine gun and a couple of missiles. Yeah, because that is the best thing to do being a general.\n\nOh and then we have the allies, a lesbian doctor who thinks she is the boss and talks to you through the comms in a very condescent way,specially in the Russian Consulate mission with her "Agent, the data has stopped!!!!" like it was my ♥♥♥♥ing fault that some dumb mother ♥♥♥♥ing nerd hacked the database I was hacking, you mother ♥♥♥♥ing dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ sucker.\n\nOh and the asian (nothing against asians, my weewee gets hard with asian chicks okay?, but she is asian) Division boss, with her "I wish I could be there having your back, but we do hell of a team anyways" like, yes, you are there in the base eating and doing ♥♥♥♥ with your pen on the desk while I am getting shot and hit with baseball bats. Sure we are a great team, uhum.\n\nHmm what else...oh yeah, SMG's are the way to go if you want to do some damage. No aks, no m4s, no lmgs, nope, just get a High End vector and just run and gun, ♥♥♥♥ some bullet sponges\n\nAdd to that the fact that the only thing they did to make the bots harder was adding 123409234234 HP and multiply the damage by 23904203948234 points. They are still stupid af. So at the end you got a level 32 bullet sponge with a shotgun running towards you and getting you downed with the second shot if you got high hp.\n\n\nOh oh and wait, one more thing, there is no anti cheat, they say there is code from Easy Anti Cheat software inside with 0 use but meeeeek, to fix the game they will have to re write the code and make it so that the game is ruled by the servers, which would be the ones deciding which bullet hits the target and which does not, how much damage each bullet does, etc..., and not each client on its own deciding how many millions of hp he has or how many 200k damage per shot he does as it is now. That is why people can hack this game with a notepad while playing. And lets be honest, you will not re write the netcode of a game you have been working on and over hyping for 4 years. did Battlefield 4 get really a netcode fix? No, they worked around it and blablabla it is still crap.\n\nThe marketing department of Ubisoft is top tier in the marketing world, over hyping games since 2012. If there was an overhyped game of the year prize, this would be the winner.\n\nSo yeah, this is a game you would buy on steam sales with a 70% discount or third party sites right now with a 40% discount.

If you like to grind nonstop mindlessly, you may not mind the endgame, but the dropoff in quality was fairly pronounced imo. I only made it to around level 30 in the DZ before I hung it up. There just isnt any payoff and the random battles you'll have aren't very engaging or balance, both real player and npc.\nFew times I hopped on since updates, I was either falling through maps, or being kicked from groups for too low of GS (which didnt exist when I started) or kicked for not realizing they were using some exploit and aggro'ing the ai. Gave that up quick.\n\nGreat game, but not a long term one for those who hate the grinding. If you can set that aside I still think its worth playing the story at least once, ONLY with the half off sales from time to time.\n\nIn short, I'm glad to have played it and feel like a herb for buying the gold package(lesson learned), but truly wouldn't recommend it if you're really expecting longevity of play. Half off for the story? Not the worst deal.","May 24","false","98.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

OR something you did want and the stats are complete junk? Hell I have seen purples with better stats The worst is the horde mode where the devlopers themselves COULD NOT EVEN COMPLETE challenge mode and then it's laid upon us the consumer, and we are expected to do what a devloper couldn't when they already have the best stuff? I am just stunned they even thought this was a good idea. Grenade dodging simulator 2016? I like the idea of jumping around for half an hour without firing a single shot.\n\nCrafting after 1.1The 1.1 incurisons update is by far one of the worst changes i have seen in this game.

Theres really nothing to it. Thats literally it . Story is interesting but lacks content. Overall, the price tag on this game is really not worth it. Bugs and crashes are everywhere.\n\n\nCharacter CreationThis is the most awful and limited character creation I have seen in an rpg, all you get to choose between are 5 preset faces, 5 hairstyles, some neck tattoos, and accessories... the worst part here is the accessories, if you for example choose glasses as accessories you have to have them on FOREVER! They are become permanent on your character?? WTF LOL so basically  instead of accessories being in-game gear, they are considered a part of character creation. It's unbelievable how they made such a development decision. That means that if you choose any type of accessory for your characte you have to stick with them forever. You can't take them off. Ugly face-paint included.

Beeing rogue is not fun but rage-inducing and doesn't offer anything better than not beeing rogue. It is far too risky to go rougue if you are not within a full squad. And even If you are, without luck and good squadmates, everyone not rougue might just come to kill you and all other rougues. Not many people go rouge, because of the lack of any good reson to do so, but as soon as someone starts shooting other people, they tend to hunt the only rougue squad in the whole, wide world down. When some random peasant stole my items after I died against an NPC and shot him and his friend, the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ family rushed back to kill me. Just because off this f***ed up Rouge-System, overall mediocre gameplay and incredable clunky controls, I won't play this game for some while. And the Server- and Connectivity Problems at launch were unaccaptable for this day and age, Ubisoft. I just can't recommend this game to anybody with certain demands of quality.

The graphics are 2016 standard. However, The textures, especially of the environment (buildings, cars, etc) are really low res. (I have a GTX980Ti running everything on ultra)\n\nThe first 10-20 hours or so the game was really thrilling.\nAfter doing all the main missions and side mission (basically 4 different types repeating) and collecting all collectibles, the game gets boring really fast.\n\nAfter you reach lvl30 there is not really anything to do.\nYou can grind DZ ranks (I gave up at around rank 60) which takes forever and is boring as hell because basically you just do the same farming route over and over again.\nThere is so much running involved. The enemy density should be much higher.\nImagine you have to walk 2-5 minutes to get to a pack of enemies. Gunfight for maybe 30 seconds. Done. Run another 5 minutes. Repeat. That is your basic dark zone gameplay.\n\nSame (4 different) NPC types. Same mission types.\n\nThe first incursion also lacks really good ideas.\nBasically, it is a big closed hall where you are forced to move out of cover all the time and swarmed by enemies that spawn all over the place (of course behind you) in 15 waves. Great idea.\n\nThen there are the cheaters!\nIt seems that nobody really cares, it seems everybody is doing it. The game has no anti-cheat mechanism.\n\nI almost forgot the bugs. The game is full of bugs, glitches and exploits. It is unbelievable.\nJust as an example: You enter matchmaking, teleport to the instance and the doors are closed (meaning you cant start the mission). I could not find out whether there is any way to fix this except for re-trying to enter for 10 times.\nAnother one: You just fall through the floor of the game world, then you are teleported to the safe house, bleed out and die.\nAnother one: You shoot and your SMG gets "stuck" at 1 or 2 rounds left in the magazine. You cannot shoot nor reload. Great in PvP.\nYou have to change your weapon and switch back. Then for some reason your magazine is half full.\n\nThe game is fun for a while if you consider it as a single player game, but as MMO it completely failed in my view.","April 17","false","112.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well like every good gamer I chose to cap my character becouse then the game really starts, right? Something starts alright, the PVP that is the most unwelcome I've yet seen. You get the extraction zone camping and griefing (and in the worst case scenario if you actually happen to have any loot, it get's ninjaed). Problem is, there is really not a lot to do in the PVE area so you are proned to go to the PVP are (DarkZone), get griefed, redo, griefed (even corpse gank)... I've heard good things when you are grouped up but don't have experience of that. Don't really know many that play this and have learned way back when that PUG is not an option. The game offers pick up group action if one wishes to go that route but we all know from our mmorpg days how those options are so let me know if you give it a try. Might I add that the economy of the game has already collapsed (yes peeps farm way too much) AND partly the game seems even unfinished (for example, changing not so good material into better you have to do manually one by one).  Positive note, the game looks VERY sharp and pretty. If you have a high end machine and extra 60 bucks that you really really don't find any other place to spend, go for it, it'll knock you on your butt the first time you get at it. After 3 hours don't expect anything new, though.","April 10","false","250.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gltzxp/recommended/365590/","gltzxp","Your Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gltzxp/","49 products in account","I was so excited for this game when I first found out about it. The graphics are great IMO if you have a computer powerful enough to play at max settings. The story is pretty fun honestly... but once you finish it (you can probably finish it in 3-4 days if you have a life outside of computer games), its pure repetition.\n\nIf you don't have time to play this game everyday for a couple of hours (I don't) this game is simply not worth it. You have to keep playing the same bosses over and over to get decent gear. The best weapons are found in the DZ, but whats the point in even trying to go to the DZ when you constantly encounter people with way better weapons than yours? You'll get shot down by a--holes with gear scores higher than 200 who purposely run around the DZ killing everyone with lower gear scores since it takes them 5 bullets max to do so, however, its takes you at least 2 full clips (if not more) to down them ONLY if you're lucky enough that they forget to use a health pack. I'm talking about legit players too, don't get me started on hackers who use RPM, no clip, no spread and teleporting hacks to steal your gear. Ubisoft and Massive's claim that they are doing something about hackers but in reality I don't even think they can because to my eyes its only getting wrose everyday. On top that you are rewarded so few DZ funds and Phoenix Credits that even if there were no hackers and there were better ways to separate people with higher ranks from lower ranked players, it still wouldn't be worth the amount of time it takes to grind through this game to get the best weapons. There are a lot of other problems that I just don't care to list right now but I'm sure there are plenty of other reviews on here that address them.\n\nWith all that being considered, I can ALMOST see why people would want to hack to play this game. However, IMO, if you have to hack just to feel like you have a fair chance, then the game simply is not worth playing anymore.\n\nAt the end of the day I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for pre-ordering this game though. I fell for Ubisoft's and Massive's gimmicks, so all I can do is congratulate them for fooling so many people like myself yet again. Do yourself a favor and skip this game.\n\nAlso, stop pre-ordering video games in general, let dumba--es like myself who can't learn their lesson tell you what to expect after a few weeks so you can make the right decision.","May 11","false","164.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, Ubisoft/Massive did more bad things than good things.\n\nI was very happy with how the first two weeks went with this game as there still were problems, but nothing that can't be fixed. After two weeks cheating took over and more and more glitches/bugs/broken elements have been found which ultimately led to the point where players either glitch and abuse bugs and errors or simply get ♥♥♥♥ on in the DarkZone.\n\nAfter Patch 1.1 with the incursion "Falcon Lost" ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan. Multiple cheaters a day, sometimes on every freaking server which made the DZ unplayable. Extended glitches and mistakes in the game code broke talents/perks etc.\n\nThe stat "Protection from Elites" should usually decrease damage taken from said enemies but actually increases it. There are at least 20 gear talents and weapon talents that were bugged and have been abused. With the overwhelming amount of cheating and glitching fair gameplay is no longer given. I spent a lot of time with this game and I even ended up buying the Season Pass two-three weeks after release, just before all those glitches etc were found.\n\nWith the recent findings about the client-server structure and the netcode, there is no way The Division will be playable on PC at any time in the future unless Massive/Ubisoft pull a miracle.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\n","April 26","false","401.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is actually quite fun for a few days, though be warned, it's a different Tom Clancy game. Forget realism and logic, think Fantasy cRPG with shooter mechanics.\n\nAnd no, not RPG as in roleplaying, just RPG as in levels and stats and things like that. You're actually a mute without any saying or decisions to make what so ever. The leveling curve is quite steep (but fast) so be prepared for bullet sponge enemies (sometimes taking up to a mag per foe with at least half of the hits to the head) and wierd unrealistic stats on your gear. Diablo style! (My protective kneepads actually give me 120 bucks everytime I kill with a headshot. True story. That's Tom Clancy nowadays kids).\n\nThe open world is quite linear since you'll have to level to venture further, and once you clear encounters and open world missions the will never spawn back. The only thing you can repeat are the handful static instanced storymissions that will play out the same every time you play them. No randomization to be seen in gameplay. The same enemy waves spawn at the same place every single time.\n\nWhen you've played through the story there's very little reason to stay. There's a open pvp area to grind, and as mentioned, you can repeat the story missions. The sole reason to keep playing is to find better loot, but the economic and RNG mechanics are quite uninspiring making this somewhat frustrating and boring rather quickly. If you want a long lasting game, look somwhere else.\n\nThe game also suffers from bugs (some of the reported in beta, but still around), gamebreaking exploitable glitches and on the PC also active cheaters. Ubisoft support does very little to help players in need and patches from Massive are minimalistic and far between, mostly breaking more than they fix.\n\n\nTL:DR\nFun arcadish game for a while, but with short a lifespan due to limited content and glitches.","April 27","false","201.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Ubisoft/Massive suck too much a** to fix anything. The cheating ranges from all different kinds of PvE exploits to actual 3rd party programs allowing cheats in the DZ(PvP). From forcing the respawn of a mob that isn't supposed to respawn(PvE) to teleporting(Mostly PvP) and being instantly killed by a guy one block over, through a building(PvP), this game has seen it all. Many of the cheats are still running rampant. They've fixed a few but those fixes have just lead to the discovery of other exploits/cheats.\n\nThey speak of swinging the ban hammer but I consistently run in to cheaters in the DZ who express very little worry about being recorded while in the act of cheating. Uplay was also set up so your Uplay name is your ingame name. You can change your Uplay name as often as you want. They can cheat around the DZ then just change their Uplay name and move on. I'm also thinking(not sure) there's a 3rd party program out there that allows them to mask their real Uplay name/account. The absolute lack of worry from ALL of them that I've come across is very unsettling. I'm convinced their lack of worry is justified as Ubisoft/Massive has just completely failed up to this point and will probably continue well into the future of this game.\n\nI know it's not a real, complete review of the actual game but this was all I could focus on as the cheating is EVERYWHERE.\n\nI posted a video in my profile of my most recent encounter with a cheater. It's at least worth a chuckle if you want to check it out.\n\nEDIT: Jumped into a challenge mode Falcon Lost(endgame, if you can call it that) with some buddies(all of us have done it multiple times) and we just quit because our signature skill effects wouldn't activate when we used the skill. Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. This game is an incomplete POS. I'm usually ok with a game not being perfect for a bit after release as long as the dev team is on top of it. This team isn't even trying.

Then the glitches set in. After the glitches its the story that sort of becomes background noise to a more interesting pvp mode/dark zone. After the pvp mode/dark zone loses its appeal its the zero end game content. After the end game content....you get the picture.  The two note worthy mentions about this game are the combat and loot system. The combat system is semi realistic and can leave you with a sense of accomplishment after taking down a hard boss or troubelsome group of badies. There is ALOT of loot in this game. Different weapon and armor stats help you customize your characters abilities and help transform what at first is alot of walking with boring encounters into a virtual warpath of chaos and destruction. The Co-Op is an honorable mention because when it works it really works. However if you are grouping with people you dont know and cannot communicate properly they can royally screw a mission or encounter up. This is the case in most games but I thought I would mention it for the simple fact that I have had enjoyable succesfull moments of Co-Op. Its no praise the sun feeling but you get it. I wanted this game to be amazeballs. I feel a little let down after all the hype and awesome gameplay reveals. I wont say that this game is unplayable but I cannot recommend it. If you are going to get the game wait for a sale or for the game to drop in price. Its not currently worth 60 bucks.

Where should I start? How about with something I can actually enjoy about this game? There is a great multiplayer aspect to this game called the Dark Zone, a free for all PVP area where the NPCs are beasts and the players are jerks. It's a kill all, loot all, bullet-fest and I absolutely love it when I get my 2 buddies with me and we go hit rogues.\n\nThat's the only nice thing I can say about this crap heap. Here comes a page worth of notes I've taken on how this game is absolutely god awful. And by the way? I didn't buy this game. My friend got it for me, and as much as I love the guy, I really wish he hadn't.\n\nSo I said the multiplayer is good. That's IF your friends all start and play the game with you, together, all the time, because this game religiously punishes anyone attempting to group out of their level range. And I don't mean something like 10 levels, no, the best range you can hope to be functional together at is about 2-3. If you encounter an NPC who is 4 levels over you? Your ♥♥♥ is grass. And guess what every single enemy, from the open world to your instances, is going to be? The level of the highest level person in the group. So forget about joining your high level friend. It won't happen. It can't happen, unless you're some kind of masochist.\n\nAnd then there's the content you'll be going through. Lackluster is just the tip of the iceberg here. You've only got the most basic of "go for" mission types. It's either go here and press a button, or guard this or that. Like they try to sell it as something else, for example you might be guarding some JTF personel or some supplies. But, the JTF guy never moves, so it's just guard the point. And the supplies? Well this ties in to the stupid AI I'll bring up later but they just shoot the supplies instead of trying to steal them, so it's guard the point again. The only one that is honest is the arms deal. In this one, you're trying to keep one doofus from planting a bomb on the stolen weapons. The problem is he is truly a doofus, and will blindly run towards said arms while you are shooting in the face. And right after the guy before them died the expected way. So all you do is sit there and let them run right at you, one after another. This is further compounded by the uneven spawn rates of enemies. Often you'll find yourself swamped in the first half of a mission, just to be boredly waiting for the clock in the second half.\nThis game is also painfully a console port. Every time you need to pick something up? Hold the button down. Confirm your action? Hold the button down. Craft something? Hold the button down. And no, there's no other option. No one-click or one-press for those of us with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard. It's a major pet peeve of mine. Why do I have to pause and wait for every little thing? Oh right because it's easy to press the wrong button by mistake on a console.\n\nAnd crafting. Crafting is a sad thing. It's honestly a rather interesting system. You can get blueprints from missions, or buy them from Dark Zone vendors. There's three tiers of crafting materials, with a fourth special one from the Dark Zone, and lower tier materials can be made into higher tier materials. The materials are sometimes dropped by enemies, and you can break down loot for parts, but more often than not you have to hunt down the special resource zones on the map that restock periodically. All in all it's a nice system...\n\n... which is a real pity seeing how it's completely useless. You are guaranteed, and I'm not exaggerating, to get a better item than the one you just crafted within a couple of missions or levels. which ever comes first. And the shops will always sell something better than you could ever craft. Oh, and the 1.1 update coming out? It's going to completely trash what little appeal the crafting system had by doubling or even trippling the cost of converting low end to high end.\n\nThe NPCs. Good lord how I hate them. I sometimes think the only good feature in this game's control is the power to turn the dialogue in this game OFF. See, here's the thing, they've got maybe 4 or 5 things to say at any given time. That wouldn't be terrible, IF THEY DIDN'T CYCLE THROUGH THEM CONSTANTLY. I'm not even kidding. Every 5 seconds, they have to say something else. And what's even worse is that if you happen to be in combat they appear to develop dementia. They'll yell RIKERS when you're fighting looters, or LOOTERS when you're fighting LMB, and the enemies too! They would always yell "Watch out a turret!" whenever I deployed my medical station. Or yell how they were going to flank me as they, guess what, ran straight at me and ate bullets with their face.\n\nOh, and let's not forget: Every single NPC, down to the last one, is a 2D, boring and overused stereotype. Every. Single. One. They're either some flavor of New Yorker or a more 'basic' stereotype. You've got the conspiracy theorist on the radio who is played in EVERY safehouse as if hearing him once wasn't brain melting enough. You've got the angry, down-talking chic with daddy issues. You've got the grisly, patriotic 'real man'. Oh, and remember the guard the JTF guy mission I mentioned earlier? Every single time I got one of those missions? The JTF officer was a black guy. I'm not even going to entertain that racist stereotype with an explaination.\n\nAlso, the non-combat NPCs you occasionally come across? Every single one of them is gun-scarred. They will say, "Oh no he has a gun!" "Careful where you point that thing!" and so on. Okay, I get that New York has really stupid gun laws, but, that rather clashes with the fact you are 1. Living in a post apocaplyptic destroyed city and 2. Apparently New York had enough guns to arm every single looter in the city, a mad cult of flamethrower toting city workers, and every single felon that escaped from prison to the point where even Texas would be saying "WHOA there partner! You got too many gosh darn guns!" And they never relent. It doesn't matter how many good deeds you do, how many lives you save. Everyone is convinced that you are some gun toting maniac from start to finish.\n\nNow before I move onto the dumb AI, I do want to put the nail in the coffin about these overly chatty, bonkers NPCs: I honestly crafted a lot, I liked the system as I said, but a major problem I ran into? Would be these idiotic NPCs who patrol the area inside your base. They would stop, stick to me, and start their little cycling 5 second interval dialogue. FOREVER. And if that wasn't bad enough,  occasionally there would be this one civilian NPC crying to a guard, right next to the crafting table, and man when you have to listen to that over and over and over again you really sit down and analyze just how fake the crying is. I wanted to be able to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and yell, "I GET IT. YOUR VOICE ACTOR WASN'T PAID ENOUGH TO CRY. STOP ALREADY I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BLUE!!!"\n\nSo, the AI. This is supposed to be a tactical, cover based shooter, right? Well, the AI kind of breaks that deal. Barring the elites or the named mobs, none of them match the element very well. They can't hit a moving, random target to save their butts, AND YET they can more often than not shoot small parts of your character sticking out from cover. So, what's the best tactic in this cover based shooter? Ignore cover, run around like a loon and spew bullets, of course. They don't even begin to show any form of tactics until you fight the LMB, who, if you are foolish enough to try and use cover, will actively try to suppress you and then flank you. This tactic falls apart when I utilize the bomb man's failed tactic of running straight at them. The irony of that is thick enough to be served in a hearty sandwich, isn't it?\n\nContinued in comments.","April 23","false","77.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","5"

As someone with a decent amount of time on record playing and someone who was initially happy playing this game, take it from me, this game is broken in its current form. At the time of writing this, there are numerous glitches and exploits that allow players to have infinite ammo, ridiculous amounts of DPS, and constantly replenishing health. On top of that, there seems to be a decent amount of hackers roaming the Dark Zone as well. I saw all of the hate the steam community has for Ubisoft before this game came out but didn't really believe it. Well now that I've see that every time they intervene, and it gets worse, how bad they really are. And, there are problems that have been around since the game came out that havn't been fixed or took so long to fix that they can't undo the damage. So, unless Ubisoft gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, the pvp is broken and therefore the game.

Where should I start? How about with something I can actually enjoy about this game? There is a great multiplayer aspect to this game called the Dark Zone, a free for all PVP area where the NPCs are beasts and the players are jerks. It's a kill all, loot all, bullet-fest and I absolutely love it when I get my 2 buddies with me and we go hit rogues.\n\nThat's the only nice thing I can say about this crap heap. Here comes a page worth of notes I've taken on how this game is absolutely god awful. And by the way? I didn't buy this game. My friend got it for me, and as much as I love the guy, I really wish he hadn't.\n\nSo I said the multiplayer is good. That's IF your friends all start and play the game with you, together, all the time, because this game religiously punishes anyone attempting to group out of their level range. And I don't mean something like 10 levels, no, the best range you can hope to be functional together at is about 2-3. If you encounter an NPC who is 4 levels over you? Your ♥♥♥ is grass. And guess what every single enemy, from the open world to your instances, is going to be? The level of the highest level person in the group. So forget about joining your high level friend. It won't happen. It can't happen, unless you're some kind of masochist.\n\nAnd then there's the content you'll be going through. Lackluster is just the tip of the iceberg here. You've only got the most basic of "go for" mission types. It's either go here and press a button, or guard this or that. Like they try to sell it as something else, for example you might be guarding some JTF personel or some supplies. But, the JTF guy never moves, so it's just guard the point. And the supplies? Well this ties in to the stupid AI I'll bring up later but they just shoot the supplies instead of trying to steal them, so it's guard the point again. The only one that is honest is the arms deal. In this one, you're trying to keep one doofus from planting a bomb on the stolen weapons. The problem is he is truly a doofus, and will blindly run towards said arms while you are shooting in the face. And right after the guy before them died the expected way. So all you do is sit there and let them run right at you, one after another. This is further compounded by the uneven spawn rates of enemies. Often you'll find yourself swamped in the first half of a mission, just to be boredly waiting for the clock in the second half.\nThis game is also painfully a console port. Every time you need to pick something up? Hold the button down. Confirm your action? Hold the button down. Craft something? Hold the button down. And no, there's no other option. No one-click or one-press for those of us with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard. It's a major pet peeve of mine. Why do I have to pause and wait for every little thing? Oh right because it's easy to press the wrong button by mistake on a console.\n\nAnd crafting. Crafting is a sad thing. It's honestly a rather interesting system. You can get blueprints from missions, or buy them from Dark Zone vendors. There's three tiers of crafting materials, with a fourth special one from the Dark Zone, and lower tier materials can be made into higher tier materials. The materials are sometimes dropped by enemies, and you can break down loot for parts, but more often than not you have to hunt down the special resource zones on the map that restock periodically. All in all it's a nice system...\n\n... which is a real pity seeing how it's completely useless. You are guaranteed, and I'm not exaggerating, to get a better item than the one you just crafted within a couple of missions or levels. which ever comes first. And the shops will always sell something better than you could ever craft. Oh, and the 1.1 update coming out? It's going to completely trash what little appeal the crafting system had by doubling or even trippling the cost of converting low end to high end.\n\nThe NPCs. Good lord how I hate them. I sometimes think the only good feature in this game's control is the power to turn the dialogue in this game OFF. See, here's the thing, they've got maybe 4 or 5 things to say at any given time. That wouldn't be terrible, IF THEY DIDN'T CYCLE THROUGH THEM CONSTANTLY. I'm not even kidding. Every 5 seconds, they have to say something else. And what's even worse is that if you happen to be in combat they appear to develop dementia. They'll yell RIKERS when you're fighting looters, or LOOTERS when you're fighting LMB, and the enemies too! They would always yell "Watch out a turret!" whenever I deployed my medical station. Or yell how they were going to flank me as they, guess what, ran straight at me and ate bullets with their face.\n\nOh, and let's not forget: Every single NPC, down to the last one, is a 2D, boring and overused stereotype. Every. Single. One. They're either some flavor of New Yorker or a more 'basic' stereotype. You've got the conspiracy theorist on the radio who is played in EVERY safehouse as if hearing him once wasn't brain melting enough. You've got the angry, down-talking chic with daddy issues. You've got the grisly, patriotic 'real man'. Oh, and remember the guard the JTF guy mission I mentioned earlier? Every single time I got one of those missions? The JTF officer was a black guy. I'm not even going to entertain that racist stereotype with an explaination.\n\nAlso, the non-combat NPCs you occasionally come across? Every single one of them is gun-scarred. They will say, "Oh no he has a gun!" "Careful where you point that thing!" and so on. Okay, I get that New York has really stupid gun laws, but, that rather clashes with the fact you are 1. Living in a post apocaplyptic destroyed city and 2. Apparently New York had enough guns to arm every single looter in the city, a mad cult of flamethrower toting city workers, and every single felon that escaped from prison to the point where even Texas would be saying "WHOA there partner! You got too many gosh darn guns!" And they never relent. It doesn't matter how many good deeds you do, how many lives you save. Everyone is convinced that you are some gun toting maniac from start to finish.\n\nNow before I move onto the dumb AI, I do want to put the nail in the coffin about these overly chatty, bonkers NPCs: I honestly crafted a lot, I liked the system as I said, but a major problem I ran into? Would be these idiotic NPCs who patrol the area inside your base. They would stop, stick to me, and start their little cycling 5 second interval dialogue. FOREVER. And if that wasn't bad enough,  occasionally there would be this one civilian NPC crying to a guard, right next to the crafting table, and man when you have to listen to that over and over and over again you really sit down and analyze just how fake the crying is. I wanted to be able to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and yell, "I GET IT. YOUR VOICE ACTOR WASN'T PAID ENOUGH TO CRY. STOP ALREADY I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BLUE!!!"\n\nSo, the AI. This is supposed to be a tactical, cover based shooter, right? Well, the AI kind of breaks that deal. Barring the elites or the named mobs, none of them match the element very well. They can't hit a moving, random target to save their butts, AND YET they can more often than not shoot small parts of your character sticking out from cover. So, what's the best tactic in this cover based shooter? Ignore cover, run around like a loon and spew bullets, of course. They don't even begin to show any form of tactics until you fight the LMB, who, if you are foolish enough to try and use cover, will actively try to suppress you and then flank you. This tactic falls apart when I utilize the bomb man's failed tactic of running straight at them. The irony of that is thick enough to be served in a hearty sandwich, isn't it?\n\nContinued in comments.","April 23","false","77.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","5"

Which is basically a single area with 15 waves you fight, sounds like fun no?\n\nThe content is grindy as hell, and rather boring, it's really lacking, and only got worse with patches.  For a post apocolypse version of new york there sure is a hell of a lot of ammo around to supply a ton of armies.  Overall the game can be fun with a few friends, but exploits, zero punishment for using exploits (and any 'punishment' is really just a slap on the hand), grindy content, mixed with content that is just Bullet_Sponge_Who_One_Shots_001 x 8.  It becomes a boring experience quickly.\n\nMaybe after the full game releases, much like Destiny, in a year and a half from now it'll be worth the playing, but as it stands it's a stale generic TPS, with some MMO mixed in, and slight PVP.  For 60$ I got the content/playtime out of it, but it just died quickly.\n\nOptimization is a horrid god awful mess, one of the worst optimized AAA games i've played in a while, but overall i'd say avoid until there is more stablization to the community, as well as proper exploit and punishments, not to mention removal of said exploits.","April 28","false","98.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They release only a small amount of end game content coupled with the ability to completely grind your face off for gear means you can be "done" with the end game rather quickly.\n\nThe gear is also set up terribly. It's the worst parts of Diablo and WoW gearing set up into one system where you may be looking for a specific piece of gear but there's no concrete way to obtain that gear and even if you do RNG plays a heavy roll in determining it's stats. You may reroll one stat per piece of gear but it gets insanely expensive to do so after only one roll.\n\nThere is a good base game here but Massive needs to fix both the way they handle end game and how buggy and easy to exploit the game itself is.

The graphics are 2016 standard. However, The textures, especially of the environment (buildings, cars, etc) are really low res. (I have a GTX980Ti running everything on ultra)\n\nThe first 10-20 hours or so the game was really thrilling.\nAfter doing all the main missions and side mission (basically 4 different types repeating) and collecting all collectibles, the game gets boring really fast.\n\nAfter you reach lvl30 there is not really anything to do.\nYou can grind DZ ranks (I gave up at around rank 60) which takes forever and is boring as hell because basically you just do the same farming route over and over again.\nThere is so much running involved. The enemy density should be much higher.\nImagine you have to walk 2-5 minutes to get to a pack of enemies. Gunfight for maybe 30 seconds. Done. Run another 5 minutes. Repeat. That is your basic dark zone gameplay.\n\nSame (4 different) NPC types. Same mission types.\n\nThe first incursion also lacks really good ideas.\nBasically, it is a big closed hall where you are forced to move out of cover all the time and swarmed by enemies that spawn all over the place (of course behind you) in 15 waves. Great idea.\n\nThen there are the cheaters!\nIt seems that nobody really cares, it seems everybody is doing it. The game has no anti-cheat mechanism.\n\nI almost forgot the bugs. The game is full of bugs, glitches and exploits. It is unbelievable.\nJust as an example: You enter matchmaking, teleport to the instance and the doors are closed (meaning you cant start the mission). I could not find out whether there is any way to fix this except for re-trying to enter for 10 times.\nAnother one: You just fall through the floor of the game world, then you are teleported to the safe house, bleed out and die.\nAnother one: You shoot and your SMG gets "stuck" at 1 or 2 rounds left in the magazine. You cannot shoot nor reload. Great in PvP.\nYou have to change your weapon and switch back. Then for some reason your magazine is half full.\n\nThe game is fun for a while if you consider it as a single player game, but as MMO it completely failed in my view.","April 17","false","112.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

After 15 levels you realize how limited the game really is and how limited the options are what's around the corner. Well like every good gamer I chose to cap my character becouse then the game really starts, right? Something starts alright, the PVP that is the most unwelcome I've yet seen. You get the extraction zone camping and griefing (and in the worst case scenario if you actually happen to have any loot, it get's ninjaed). Problem is, there is really not a lot to do in the PVE area so you are proned to go to the PVP are (DarkZone), get griefed, redo, griefed (even corpse gank)... I've heard good things when you are grouped up but don't have experience of that. Don't really know many that play this and have learned way back when that PUG is not an option. The game offers pick up group action if one wishes to go that route but we all know from our mmorpg days how those options are so let me know if you give it a try. Might I add that the economy of the game has already collapsed (yes peeps farm way too much) AND partly the game seems even unfinished (for example, changing not so good material into better you have to do manually one by one).  Positive note, the game looks VERY sharp and pretty. If you have a high end machine and extra 60 bucks that you really really don't find any other place to spend, go for it, it'll knock you on your butt the first time you get at it. After 3 hours don't expect anything new, though.","April 10","false","250.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

End game content was  just the usual carrot on a stick gear grind.  I had high hopes that this game was going to be for hardcore twitch shooter but it turned out to be a bullet spongy grind fest for gear.  I do not like gear grinds for the sake of gear grinds. Darkzone combat is mostly gank fests and a grind the best gear and then the best gear wins.  Players can take larges amount of bullet damage in pvp, multiple clips, which  takes away from the realism of the the awesome city massive built.  I just don't find it fun as a competitive shooter.

In its current state this game is unplayable, constant bugs like falling through the ground, getting stuck on walls and of course the constant glitches associated with the skill mobile cover, not to mention all the exploits like switching skills for 5-10 minutes to get infinite dps, an extreme abundance of hackers with things like 300% movement speed, fully automatic bolt action rifles and the dudes that can shoot you through walls from 200+ meters away. and the best part about the hackers is half the time you cant even report them because in Ubisofts infinite programming wisdom added characters that arent recognized by the game yet are possible to make a name with, so hackers run around with names like llIl.II.llIl.Il or llIllIIIlIlIl - There's no spam filter in the game so people just setup bots and leave them for days and most of these bots also have these unreportable, unignorable names. all on top of the ever amazing Delta Errors, I was playing with 3 friends the other day, got to wave 14/15 on Falcon Lost Challenge which is currently the hardest thing in the game for the best loot, took almost 45 minutes to get there and right as wave 14 ended we all recieved a Delta Error simultaneously and the instance restarted because it counted as a wipe.

I've put roughly 300-400 hours on this game and I've tried to look for every positive. Unfortunately there arn't many. So let's get the positives out of the way first so i can get to the point of this review.\n-Nice graphics\nThat's it and that is all it ever will be, just nice graphics. Being a level 30 PvE and a Dark Zone rank of 90 i found this game to be grindy. So then i tried the PvP aspect of it and nothing but hackers and exploiters. I've seen it all now guys, the flying to the teleporting right on top of you just to kill you and teleport away. The best part is, these guys can kill you (not down you) IN ONE SHOT and what's funny about this is that they only get a slap on the rist for hacking Massive's game and killing you, taking your xp and loot. Before getting this game, look up youtube videos on the division hacks. Now, just imagine these guys in every server taking your ♥♥♥♥ everytime they just simply look at you. They have a multistep process for reporting guys like these (all of this has to be done in order for them to get banned)\n1. Record 3 instances of them hacking\n2. Type /report *Hacker's Name* in chat (you won't get to see their name half of the time)\n3. Post it to one of their forums (either reddit, facebook, or other means)\nNow after you have completed all of this you may go continue back to the game and get ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped by the same hacker until the next game-update (its when they ban people).\n\nSo that was only the tiny segment of what hacking is currently in this game. Sounds bad right? Want to still buy this game? Don't, go do something better with your money because by the time you hit 30 in this game, you already can't refund the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Now on to the glitches. They have already announced patches for a bunch of bugs in the 1.2 update. Will it fix them? Unlikely. In the 1.1 update which you can read the patch notes somewhere online, they announced a bunch of bugs would be fixed... They didn't fix them, because the community went right back to doing the exact same ♥♥♥♥ a different way. If you don't abuse these glitches in the dz, then you're good as ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nI'm a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at what Massive has made this community into, but then again they don't care about what the community thinks. I bought the game for retail for $60 and played the PvE aspect of it (which the PvE is just long enough for you not to get your refund back) and i thought this game would even get better in the future. So i ♥♥♥♥ing bought the season pass. Now this game is infested with hackers and the devs don't care. They've already made their money. If you buy this game then i wish you the best of luck.","May 5","false","544.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There were plenty of bugs to be found, but I figured release would be alright, since most everyone was having similar bugs. It wasn't, almost nothing had changed. My second review was probably a little unfair to Hamish, so I deleted that one.\n\nSo that brings us to review three. Written on the day I uninstalled the game.\n\nPros\n-Stunning graphics.\n-Cool concept.\n-Gunfights are fun if you aren't trying to kill/fend off a hacker.\n-I actually can't think of any more, the more I try, the more I realize I didn't like this game very much after completing the campaign the first time. Up until that point, it was fun.\n\nCons\n-Broken. Everything is broken. You fall through the floor constantly, graphics glitch out, displayed stats are a joke, they constantly change even without equipping new gear, and have all been that way since beta.\n-Broken. It's bad enough that it deserves a second one.\n-Hackers. Sure they banned some, But I went into the DZ for two minutes today and saw one, so, yeah.\n-The devs think that increasing difficulty means just adding more grenade spamming enemies and giving them more armor.\n-Every mission is the same. Not similar, the same. There are like 3 or 4 variations, and they are all boring as hell.\n\n\nThis game could have been awesome, the concept and the Tom Clancy name should have delivered a much better product with more depth and nuance, but instead the devs gave us a clown car filled with bags of dogsh*t.\n\nThe story is worth a playthrough if you get it on a deep, deep sale or as a gift, but not any other time, in my opinion.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI tried to like it, I put my time in to make sure I wasn't just in a funk, but this game is broken on nearly every level, and the devs seem totally incapable of (or indifferent to) fixing it so far.\n","May 5","false","184.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Upon hitting level 30 ( max ), we discovered the end game content was simply repeat the exact same missions you did for the story and grind to level 30 over and over and over again.\n\nThen we decide to go to the Dark Zone where we were not constantly encountering hackers and cheaters, but several times we were mowed down while behind cover by 1 guy who seemed to be able to shoot through the cover. New patch also introduces 'Dark Zone Supply Crate drops' and we get quite a few of them, only to find that the ♥♥♥♥♥ in them is completely useless and rarely gold. ( gold is the only thing that matters now with the crafting nerf - see other reviews that detail this hoax by Massive ).\n\nThe journey to 30 was great, and provided over 200 hours of fun, so I can not say it wasn't worth the money, but the idea that it is supossed to keep you playing is a joke. Massive needs to learn the #1 rule in a server-client relationship: Never trust the client. Ignoring this rule leads to Aimbots, shoot through walls, walk through walls, flying, whatever the client wants. Dumb asses that thought it would work LOL.\n\nAnyway, as you can see for yourself there are a huge amount of people very disappointed at the state of the game today, and unless it changes ( I estimate a 10% chance of that ) I will not be playing.\n\nEarly game = 9/10\nEnd game = 1/10\nPvP = 0/10\n\nOverall = 5/10\n\nIf it is your kind of game, then it should give you plenty of fun and be worth your $60 ( currently ). I do not really regret buying it. But do not expect it to hold your interest after hitting level 30.","May 5","false","278.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's simply too hard to get upgrades at this point. The gear ceiling is too low. Reaching DZ rank 50, 75, and 90 takes a hell of a long time and even when you do reach them, the 204 blue prints you can buy will probably end up with weak rolls or if they are an upgrade, they aren't better by much. Most of us don't have the 240 gear because Falcon Lost CM is nearly impossible to do with a matchmaking group and it is the only way to obtain it. 240 gear is too hard to get for the average player.\n\n204 gear is also too hard to get for the average player. 204 items show up once a week in the BoO and in the DZ. The 204 items in the BoO statistically have a very rare chance of being useful. Once you have Sentry gear then the only pieces of 204 gear that are useful are reckless chest and savage gloves. We got lucky a couple of weeks ago and had that 204 brutal Aug. Its unlikely an upgrade to our weapons or gear will show up in the BoO. In the DZ the 204 blueprints aren't enough of an upgrade to grind for the DZ level and credit requirement. I don't think, like many others do, that the cost and level requirements are too high. It would be cool if the blueprints unlocked at lvl 75 were huge upgrades because then it would be exciting to grind towards that goal. But even god rolls on 204 items aren't much better than 182 items with a good roll.","May 11","false","259.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There are so many little things like footprints in the snow where you've stepped and bullet holes on anything and everything you shoot.  It is just lovely to look at.  The mechanics of the game are very solid.  It has a great cover system, combat works rather well, and there are a fairly large number of talents and skills to choose from.  The possible weapons you can have with their talents and the bonuses that you can get from your gear.  It's like some crazy love child of Diablo and Borderlands.  10/10 "It's a blast!"\n\nAll in all there is a great framework for a great game here that I would be more than happy to dump hours into without a moment of regret...\n\n...that is when it works.\n\nA large number of the talents and skills in the game are bugged, and have been since beta.  talents and skills for your character, gear, and weapons either doing the opposite of what they should or stacking with themselves to give unimaginably high bonuses.  There are even ways to make yourself near unkillable indefinitly.  But the worst doesn't come from the game, it's the player base that still plays.\n\nGear and weapons have terrible drop rates from loot tables that have almost every other piece of gear/weapon on the same table.Pair that with everything having so many different talents and stats that can be rolled on them, that getting anything useful, much less good, is nigh impossible.  Kill a boss at level cap and you're gonna see a 'high end' drop.  Problem is that you're gonna just use it for crafting materials and not because it's a good piece of gear.  There is a way to reroll a stat on your armor pieces, however it's only one stat, so if two are bad it's back to either hoping rng will give you another drop at all or trying to craft another.\n\nThis is a loot shooter, where the vast majority of your loot is instantly deconstucted for crafting materials to allow for a few more attempts to craft the loot you want.  Not because you are ever given anything that is just that good, but because you need the either the luck of the gods or limitless time to grind crafting materials.  Drops don't reach the highest item level where crafting does, and even then you need to venture into the 'Dark Zone' to get the ever elusive division tech.  I crafted a few pieces of gear upon reaching level 30, the current cap, and didn't get any upgrades to them until they added a few new blueprints to be purchased after their first major update several weeks later.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if you could actually get anything of value from their hailed Dark Zone (DZ for short) game anything worth while.  There is great potencial for the DZ, and I've honestly had a lot of fun running around the dark zone even if it is a pvpve area.  I'm usually not a big pvp gamer, but I actually had a good time going rogue and hunting rogues in the division, at least until the it became infested with hackers as of recent.  I've walked into the DZ only to have someone teleport in front of me, 1-shot me with their pistol, and teleport away.  The worst part is that this isn't that unusual for me recently, it's completely normal to enter the DZ and be killed withing a minute or so by someone outside the map or teleporting around.\n\nThe upright, honest players are all bailing and the ones that remain are the ones that are hacking, cheating, exploiting, and griefing.  There is no end game pve with the closest thing being the joke that is the incursion.  I'd love to say something to give reason to play this game that holds such potential, but I've run out of excuses to even log in myself.  Save your money, there are far better games to drop $60 on, and if things turn around there might be something to see here.

The end game is entirely based around a forced PvP area(to acquire crafting materials referred to as division tech) that is plagued with hackers who upon killing you can cost you up to a half hours worth of gameplay in progress(since the PvP area has penalties for death whether or not you have killed another player).\n\nThe hackers themselves are not the reason I cannot recommend this game, it is the complete lack of transparency or visible effort by Ubisoft to crack down on the hackers.  They are more concerned with punishing individuals who abuse the glitch filled PvE "raid/horde mode" in a verbal and visible manner, than they are with fixing their forced PvP hack fest.  The evidence of this lack of effort to crack down on hackers is evidenced in the sheer prevalence of it.  If hacking was being properly tracked and punished, hackers would not be so prominent or easily identifiable in the manner that they currently are.\n\nThere are hackers that literally stream and post on youtube that are still playing the game even though they are open and provide evidence themselves that they are hacking.  There is no fair play system that provides after startup checking of game files, and while this measure is not a fool-proof prevention method, it is a deterrent and can help track and more readily identify hackers to the game developers.\n\nThe companies(Massive and Ubisoft) claim to be banning hackers but if any true form of punishment was being handed out there would not be such an open and blatant disregard for the games ToS.\n\nI thank you for reading this entire post if you have done so, and while the PvE aspect of the game is enjoyable, it is not feasible to play solely in the PvE area and be competitive with individuals that venture into the dark zone.  I personally have 600 hours of gameplay invested, and in my personal experience the hacking issues are only getting worse as the game progresses.  I encounter 6-7 hackers a day while trying to gain valuable dark zone levels, and in total have lost 367k dark zone experience to these individuals which equates to gaining levels 1-32(roughly) in the dark zone and (based on efficiency in farming DZ experience) roughly 20 hours of gameplay progress.\n\nI urge you to add this game to your wishlist, but abstain from purchasing until the hacking problem has been fixed or they provide a viable end game solution to allow players to be competitive in end game PvE progress without a need to travel into the Dark Zone.\n\nI have endeavored to provide a detailed explanation of why you should abstain from purchase at this time, and I hope that should you buy the game you are not disappointed when your end game DZ time comes and you begin to encounter hackers.","April 27","false","579.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The developers say the dark zone offers the best loot, well in my experience the dark zone loot is on par with the stuff you find on the outside. The only incentive to go into the dark zone is to grind dark zone levels to buy blueprints because the random loot that drops from mobs and bosses within the dark zone are all worthless crap.

I'm eager to see what the DLC will bring.\n\nTHE GOOD: It's a fresh take on MMO-ish FPS mechanics and gameplay with lots of attention to detail in the general environments.  With an interesting Tom Clancy-esque storyline as a backdrop, the game has great potential to become more interesting / enjoyable.\n\nTHE BAD: The new Incursion isn't very much fun to play, if it is an indicator of what the game will have in store for us later, then I'm dreading the expansion content.\n\nAdditionally the game has been historically muddled with cheaters and exploiters making the DZ an unfair and precarious place while additionally causing server instability.  (but recent mass suspensions and bans have helped address this problem with great success)\n\nTHE UGLY: The general chats are still cluttered with auto chat spamming bots advertising assisted leveling posted by names that no one can ignore or report that auto re-spam whenever anyone else types in chat.\n\nFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: I'd say it's worth between 30 - 60 bucks for the core game + DLCs, but until these issues are cleared up it's hard to say its worth any more than 20-40 bucks just for the single player / PvE experience.\n\nMaybe after all the DLC is out and the game can police itself, it might be worth its initial asking price of 100 bucks again... (core game + season's pass / Gold Edition cost)  we'll just have to wait and see...\n\n\nUpdate May 6th 2016:\n\nThe DZ seems to be clear of hackers and Griefers, good on Massive.\n\nBut on the bad side there are still auto chat spammer bots trying to sell lvling services in the Pennsylvania Avenue District and Stuyvesant, (the Falcon Lost Area)  which really annoys me.  This should really be ultra simple to fix guys, like easier than ridding DZ of cheaters...  Why are we still bombarded with spam in general chats???\n\n\nUpdate April 29th 2016:\n\nOk, so today I barely worked up enough motivation to play, so I started on a Daily Mission, in this case Grand Central Station, and about 1-2 minutes from completing the mission the server dumps me...  I continually try to connect over the next 4-5 minutes but the server just keeps dumping me after it loads, which people can tell you can take a couple to several minutes sometimes...  only to find myself outside the mission area, my team completed it without me...\n\nWhich means I would have to do the mission all over again...   So I switch the game off, frustrated I did something else ... (anything else) for a few hours, then being the masochist I am I load it up again and go to complete the same daily, since my character was conveniently saved right outside the mission area I hold G to set the difficulty and redo it...  then the server punts me again...\n\nFine Ubisoft AND Massive... I won't play your broken game, le sigh...  I still wanna play it though...\n\n\n\nPosted circa April 23rd, 2016\n\nThe end-game mechanic Dark Zone is filled to the gills with glitchers, cheaters, and script kiddies, doing anything from shooting you through half a block of buildings with precise accuracy, one shotting you, flying in the air, to running around with the speed of the flash.\n\nNot to mention that if you are an honest player who doesn't strive for scripts or ill-gotten gains, then you'd best prepare yourself to lose anything you might gain stepping into the Dark Zone.\n\nAnd what is the game without the Dark Zone?  well, some fairly decent shooter experience until you complete the story, which should only take the casual player maybe a week or two at most to complete, then all you have left to you are the dailies which seem to be identical every day.  (is it assigning due to the zone you are in when they pop?  Has ubisoft realized almost everyone goes back to penns [base of operations] at the end of the day?)\n\nThe server seems to be regularly punting groups of players, as when I go to load back in I suddenly find myself in a que between 100 - 400+ long waiting to get in, are the exploits crashign the server now???\n\nAs a regular player of the division, I'm feeling abandoned by the devs, could it really be so hard to put 1 dev or chatbot into the server to clean up the spam?  Would it really be so hard to implement code that would block a player after posting THE EXACT SAME THING hundreds of times a minute???\n\nAnd on a similar subject would it really be hard to put a dev or a bot into the Dark Zone that could log and identify suspicious killings?  I mean most of the cheaters go rogue as a matter of course, would it be so hard to monitor the dps / headshot accuracy of a rogue that is plowing through other players and then scan their gear to see if what they are doing makes any sense according to how the game should be functioning?   Or tracking how quickly a player is covering ground / running / flying???\n\nThe Dark Zone is a good end game mechanic for players to parkour through after they've tied up the story, but if you allow people to destroy the experience at the expense of your fair and casual gamers you've allowed the cheaters to negatively impact the game overall, forever tainting it for the majority of players, and even forcing some of them to cheat themselves just to attempt and keep up.\n\nAll in all the game is currently not worth the asking price until these problems are addressed, and certainly not worth the total $100 price tag if despite content additions the cheating and spamming are perpetually ruining the game for people.\n\nThe devs should come up with more clever AI enemies going forward (instead of just making them all more bullet spongy) as well as maybe offering characters some kind of bonus for focusing on a certain skill branch, maybe char classes?\n\nThe Dark Zone should have more PvE optional content, why isn't there anything to investigate in there?  Why couldn't there be public quest-ish areas?  offering rewards if all agents in an area work towards some kind of greater goal, (like retaking the pit) and give agents the option of turning Friendly fire on / off in the quest, and making those with FF off still able to shoot rogues in the quest area etc...\n\nAnd maybe even do something similar for Rogues, like a few neutral areas in the DZ that can be controlled ultimately by Aaron Keener and player rogues vs Faye Lau and non rogue agents fighting over a multi part area, giving DZ $ rewards and gear for retaking an area.  (just make it so it can only occur every 2 hrs after the area has been taken etc.)\n\nAdditionally Incursions should be more immersive instead of forcing a near impossible multi wave defense scenario, maybe where there are NPCs involved and if you can protect them while they do something the mission is easier, and make it so it only defaults to something like Falcon Lost, if the players aren't doing what they should...  otherwise it's all just a tedious slog...","April 23","false","208.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's simply too hard to get upgrades at this point. The gear ceiling is too low. Reaching DZ rank 50, 75, and 90 takes a hell of a long time and even when you do reach them, the 204 blue prints you can buy will probably end up with weak rolls or if they are an upgrade, they aren't better by much. Most of us don't have the 240 gear because Falcon Lost CM is nearly impossible to do with a matchmaking group and it is the only way to obtain it. 240 gear is too hard to get for the average player.\n\n204 gear is also too hard to get for the average player. 204 items show up once a week in the BoO and in the DZ. The 204 items in the BoO statistically have a very rare chance of being useful. Once you have Sentry gear then the only pieces of 204 gear that are useful are reckless chest and savage gloves. We got lucky a couple of weeks ago and had that 204 brutal Aug. Its unlikely an upgrade to our weapons or gear will show up in the BoO. In the DZ the 204 blueprints aren't enough of an upgrade to grind for the DZ level and credit requirement. I don't think, like many others do, that the cost and level requirements are too high. It would be cool if the blueprints unlocked at lvl 75 were huge upgrades because then it would be exciting to grind towards that goal. But even god rolls on 204 items aren't much better than 182 items with a good roll.","May 11","false","259.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There were plenty of bugs to be found, but I figured release would be alright, since most everyone was having similar bugs. It wasn't, almost nothing had changed. My second review was probably a little unfair to Hamish, so I deleted that one.\n\nSo that brings us to review three. Written on the day I uninstalled the game.\n\nPros\n-Stunning graphics.\n-Cool concept.\n-Gunfights are fun if you aren't trying to kill/fend off a hacker.\n-I actually can't think of any more, the more I try, the more I realize I didn't like this game very much after completing the campaign the first time. Up until that point, it was fun.\n\nCons\n-Broken. Everything is broken. You fall through the floor constantly, graphics glitch out, displayed stats are a joke, they constantly change even without equipping new gear, and have all been that way since beta.\n-Broken. It's bad enough that it deserves a second one.\n-Hackers. Sure they banned some, But I went into the DZ for two minutes today and saw one, so, yeah.\n-The devs think that increasing difficulty means just adding more grenade spamming enemies and giving them more armor.\n-Every mission is the same. Not similar, the same. There are like 3 or 4 variations, and they are all boring as hell.\n\n\nThis game could have been awesome, the concept and the Tom Clancy name should have delivered a much better product with more depth and nuance, but instead the devs gave us a clown car filled with bags of dogsh*t.\n\nThe story is worth a playthrough if you get it on a deep, deep sale or as a gift, but not any other time, in my opinion.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI tried to like it, I put my time in to make sure I wasn't just in a funk, but this game is broken on nearly every level, and the devs seem totally incapable of (or indifferent to) fixing it so far.\n","May 5","false","184.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've put roughly 300-400 hours on this game and I've tried to look for every positive. Unfortunately there arn't many. So let's get the positives out of the way first so i can get to the point of this review.\n-Nice graphics\nThat's it and that is all it ever will be, just nice graphics. Being a level 30 PvE and a Dark Zone rank of 90 i found this game to be grindy. So then i tried the PvP aspect of it and nothing but hackers and exploiters. I've seen it all now guys, the flying to the teleporting right on top of you just to kill you and teleport away. The best part is, these guys can kill you (not down you) IN ONE SHOT and what's funny about this is that they only get a slap on the rist for hacking Massive's game and killing you, taking your xp and loot. Before getting this game, look up youtube videos on the division hacks. Now, just imagine these guys in every server taking your ♥♥♥♥ everytime they just simply look at you. They have a multistep process for reporting guys like these (all of this has to be done in order for them to get banned)\n1. Record 3 instances of them hacking\n2. Type /report *Hacker's Name* in chat (you won't get to see their name half of the time)\n3. Post it to one of their forums (either reddit, facebook, or other means)\nNow after you have completed all of this you may go continue back to the game and get ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped by the same hacker until the next game-update (its when they ban people).\n\nSo that was only the tiny segment of what hacking is currently in this game. Sounds bad right? Want to still buy this game? Don't, go do something better with your money because by the time you hit 30 in this game, you already can't refund the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Now on to the glitches. They have already announced patches for a bunch of bugs in the 1.2 update. Will it fix them? Unlikely. In the 1.1 update which you can read the patch notes somewhere online, they announced a bunch of bugs would be fixed... They didn't fix them, because the community went right back to doing the exact same ♥♥♥♥ a different way. If you don't abuse these glitches in the dz, then you're good as ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nI'm a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at what Massive has made this community into, but then again they don't care about what the community thinks. I bought the game for retail for $60 and played the PvE aspect of it (which the PvE is just long enough for you not to get your refund back) and i thought this game would even get better in the future. So i ♥♥♥♥ing bought the season pass. Now this game is infested with hackers and the devs don't care. They've already made their money. If you buy this game then i wish you the best of luck.","May 5","false","544.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are so many little things like footprints in the snow where you've stepped and bullet holes on anything and everything you shoot.  It is just lovely to look at.  The mechanics of the game are very solid.  It has a great cover system, combat works rather well, and there are a fairly large number of talents and skills to choose from.  The possible weapons you can have with their talents and the bonuses that you can get from your gear.  It's like some crazy love child of Diablo and Borderlands.  10/10 "It's a blast!"\n\nAll in all there is a great framework for a great game here that I would be more than happy to dump hours into without a moment of regret...\n\n...that is when it works.\n\nA large number of the talents and skills in the game are bugged, and have been since beta.  talents and skills for your character, gear, and weapons either doing the opposite of what they should or stacking with themselves to give unimaginably high bonuses.  There are even ways to make yourself near unkillable indefinitly.  But the worst doesn't come from the game, it's the player base that still plays.\n\nGear and weapons have terrible drop rates from loot tables that have almost every other piece of gear/weapon on the same table.Pair that with everything having so many different talents and stats that can be rolled on them, that getting anything useful, much less good, is nigh impossible.  Kill a boss at level cap and you're gonna see a 'high end' drop.  Problem is that you're gonna just use it for crafting materials and not because it's a good piece of gear.  There is a way to reroll a stat on your armor pieces, however it's only one stat, so if two are bad it's back to either hoping rng will give you another drop at all or trying to craft another.\n\nThis is a loot shooter, where the vast majority of your loot is instantly deconstucted for crafting materials to allow for a few more attempts to craft the loot you want.  Not because you are ever given anything that is just that good, but because you need the either the luck of the gods or limitless time to grind crafting materials.  Drops don't reach the highest item level where crafting does, and even then you need to venture into the 'Dark Zone' to get the ever elusive division tech.  I crafted a few pieces of gear upon reaching level 30, the current cap, and didn't get any upgrades to them until they added a few new blueprints to be purchased after their first major update several weeks later.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if you could actually get anything of value from their hailed Dark Zone (DZ for short) game anything worth while.  There is great potencial for the DZ, and I've honestly had a lot of fun running around the dark zone even if it is a pvpve area.  I'm usually not a big pvp gamer, but I actually had a good time going rogue and hunting rogues in the division, at least until the it became infested with hackers as of recent.  I've walked into the DZ only to have someone teleport in front of me, 1-shot me with their pistol, and teleport away.  The worst part is that this isn't that unusual for me recently, it's completely normal to enter the DZ and be killed withing a minute or so by someone outside the map or teleporting around.\n\nThe upright, honest players are all bailing and the ones that remain are the ones that are hacking, cheating, exploiting, and griefing.  There is no end game pve with the closest thing being the joke that is the incursion.  I'd love to say something to give reason to play this game that holds such potential, but I've run out of excuses to even log in myself.  Save your money, there are far better games to drop $60 on, and if things turn around there might be something to see here.  Until then, I'm out...","May 3","false","286.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Upon hitting level 30 ( max ), we discovered the end game content was simply repeat the exact same missions you did for the story and grind to level 30 over and over and over again.\n\nThen we decide to go to the Dark Zone where we were not constantly encountering hackers and cheaters, but several times we were mowed down while behind cover by 1 guy who seemed to be able to shoot through the cover. New patch also introduces 'Dark Zone Supply Crate drops' and we get quite a few of them, only to find that the ♥♥♥♥♥ in them is completely useless and rarely gold. ( gold is the only thing that matters now with the crafting nerf - see other reviews that detail this hoax by Massive ).\n\nThe journey to 30 was great, and provided over 200 hours of fun, so I can not say it wasn't worth the money, but the idea that it is supossed to keep you playing is a joke. Massive needs to learn the #1 rule in a server-client relationship: Never trust the client. Ignoring this rule leads to Aimbots, shoot through walls, walk through walls, flying, whatever the client wants. Dumb asses that thought it would work LOL.\n\nAnyway, as you can see for yourself there are a huge amount of people very disappointed at the state of the game today, and unless it changes ( I estimate a 10% chance of that ) I will not be playing.\n\nEarly game = 9/10\nEnd game = 1/10\nPvP = 0/10\n\nOverall = 5/10\n\nIf it is your kind of game, then it should give you plenty of fun and be worth your $60 ( currently ).

The hacking and exploiting is so rampant that if you are not doing one or the other then you are being left behind. The developers say the dark zone offers the best loot, well in my experience the dark zone loot is on par with the stuff you find on the outside. The only incentive to go into the dark zone is to grind dark zone levels to buy blueprints because the random loot that drops from mobs and bosses within the dark zone are all worthless crap. Also, the developers like to quickly patch things that people enjoy (such as receiving 4 High End gear from Challenge mode boss) while taking their time to fix major exploits and hacking.","April 27","false","276.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm eager to see what the DLC will bring.\n\nTHE GOOD: It's a fresh take on MMO-ish FPS mechanics and gameplay with lots of attention to detail in the general environments.  With an interesting Tom Clancy-esque storyline as a backdrop, the game has great potential to become more interesting / enjoyable.\n\nTHE BAD: The new Incursion isn't very much fun to play, if it is an indicator of what the game will have in store for us later, then I'm dreading the expansion content.\n\nAdditionally the game has been historically muddled with cheaters and exploiters making the DZ an unfair and precarious place while additionally causing server instability.  (but recent mass suspensions and bans have helped address this problem with great success)\n\nTHE UGLY: The general chats are still cluttered with auto chat spamming bots advertising assisted leveling posted by names that no one can ignore or report that auto re-spam whenever anyone else types in chat.\n\nFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: I'd say it's worth between 30 - 60 bucks for the core game + DLCs, but until these issues are cleared up it's hard to say its worth any more than 20-40 bucks just for the single player / PvE experience.\n\nMaybe after all the DLC is out and the game can police itself, it might be worth its initial asking price of 100 bucks again... (core game + season's pass / Gold Edition cost)  we'll just have to wait and see...\n\n\nUpdate May 6th 2016:\n\nThe DZ seems to be clear of hackers and Griefers, good on Massive.\n\nBut on the bad side there are still auto chat spammer bots trying to sell lvling services in the Pennsylvania Avenue District and Stuyvesant, (the Falcon Lost Area)  which really annoys me.  This should really be ultra simple to fix guys, like easier than ridding DZ of cheaters...  Why are we still bombarded with spam in general chats???\n\n\nUpdate April 29th 2016:\n\nOk, so today I barely worked up enough motivation to play, so I started on a Daily Mission, in this case Grand Central Station, and about 1-2 minutes from completing the mission the server dumps me...  I continually try to connect over the next 4-5 minutes but the server just keeps dumping me after it loads, which people can tell you can take a couple to several minutes sometimes...  only to find myself outside the mission area, my team completed it without me...\n\nWhich means I would have to do the mission all over again...   So I switch the game off, frustrated I did something else ... (anything else) for a few hours, then being the masochist I am I load it up again and go to complete the same daily, since my character was conveniently saved right outside the mission area I hold G to set the difficulty and redo it...  then the server punts me again...\n\nFine Ubisoft AND Massive... I won't play your broken game, le sigh...  I still wanna play it though...\n\n\n\nPosted circa April 23rd, 2016\n\nThe end-game mechanic Dark Zone is filled to the gills with glitchers, cheaters, and script kiddies, doing anything from shooting you through half a block of buildings with precise accuracy, one shotting you, flying in the air, to running around with the speed of the flash.\n\nNot to mention that if you are an honest player who doesn't strive for scripts or ill-gotten gains, then you'd best prepare yourself to lose anything you might gain stepping into the Dark Zone.\n\nAnd what is the game without the Dark Zone?  well, some fairly decent shooter experience until you complete the story, which should only take the casual player maybe a week or two at most to complete, then all you have left to you are the dailies which seem to be identical every day.  (is it assigning due to the zone you are in when they pop?  Has ubisoft realized almost everyone goes back to penns [base of operations] at the end of the day?)\n\nThe server seems to be regularly punting groups of players, as when I go to load back in I suddenly find myself in a que between 100 - 400+ long waiting to get in, are the exploits crashign the server now???\n\nAs a regular player of the division, I'm feeling abandoned by the devs, could it really be so hard to put 1 dev or chatbot into the server to clean up the spam?  Would it really be so hard to implement code that would block a player after posting THE EXACT SAME THING hundreds of times a minute???\n\nAnd on a similar subject would it really be hard to put a dev or a bot into the Dark Zone that could log and identify suspicious killings?  I mean most of the cheaters go rogue as a matter of course, would it be so hard to monitor the dps / headshot accuracy of a rogue that is plowing through other players and then scan their gear to see if what they are doing makes any sense according to how the game should be functioning?   Or tracking how quickly a player is covering ground / running / flying???\n\nThe Dark Zone is a good end game mechanic for players to parkour through after they've tied up the story, but if you allow people to destroy the experience at the expense of your fair and casual gamers you've allowed the cheaters to negatively impact the game overall, forever tainting it for the majority of players, and even forcing some of them to cheat themselves just to attempt and keep up.\n\nAll in all the game is currently not worth the asking price until these problems are addressed, and certainly not worth the total $100 price tag if despite content additions the cheating and spamming are perpetually ruining the game for people.\n\nThe devs should come up with more clever AI enemies going forward (instead of just making them all more bullet spongy) as well as maybe offering characters some kind of bonus for focusing on a certain skill branch, maybe char classes?\n\nThe Dark Zone should have more PvE optional content, why isn't there anything to investigate in there?  Why couldn't there be public quest-ish areas?  offering rewards if all agents in an area work towards some kind of greater goal, (like retaking the pit) and give agents the option of turning Friendly fire on / off in the quest, and making those with FF off still able to shoot rogues in the quest area etc...\n\nAnd maybe even do something similar for Rogues, like a few neutral areas in the DZ that can be controlled ultimately by Aaron Keener and player rogues vs Faye Lau and non rogue agents fighting over a multi part area, giving DZ $ rewards and gear for retaking an area.  (just make it so it can only occur every 2 hrs after the area has been taken etc.)\n\nAdditionally Incursions should be more immersive instead of forcing a near impossible multi wave defense scenario, maybe where there are NPCs involved and if you can protect them while they do something the mission is easier, and make it so it only defaults to something like Falcon Lost, if the players aren't doing what they should...  otherwise it's all just a tedious slog...","April 23","false","208.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I really did.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to give it a negative review. I'll save you a lot of reading and say 3.5/10. Do not buy.\n\nThis game is visually beautiful, but that is about the only redeeming quality of it at this point, as it is a buggy, repetitive, duck and cover style shooter. Not quite as open world as they would have you believe. The story missions are pretty much the same as you progress through the game. Recovering stolen shipments, killing mindless AI, and the occasional instance (that you inevitably repeat at max level ad naseum).\n\nThis game is poorly managed, as every step of the way there is some game breaking bug that people are taking advantage of... early on, it was bullet king (which took them over a week to fix...) granting players pretty much infinite phoenix credits assuming they were able to put up with repetitive grinding of the same "world boss" for long enough.\n\nThere is also Dark zone XP farming exploits where you can go off the map and basically kill your friends for ridiculous XP gains,...\n\nthe Incursion? what a joke... Not only was it not as it was advertised, a raid instance where the players will need to work together in ortder to overcome a challenging mission.... it was a single room with 15 waves of one shot mobs that chase you down, and on top of it all, easily exploitable by phasing through a wall. and how does Ubisoft respond to this? not by fixing it immediately, but by threatening to ban their playerbase... Why not invite these people to be your beta testers and find issues like this before you release a buggy, not-as-advertised piece of ♥♥♥♥ to the public and label it as an amazing free update... this update was a massive failure in my opinion.\n\nNOW there is a new explot, where you can take advantage of a weapon talent and 2 shot any enemy in the game...

The end game is entirely based around a forced PvP area(to acquire crafting materials referred to as division tech) that is plagued with hackers who upon killing you can cost you up to a half hours worth of gameplay in progress(since the PvP area has penalties for death whether or not you have killed another player).\n\nThe hackers themselves are not the reason I cannot recommend this game, it is the complete lack of transparency or visible effort by Ubisoft to crack down on the hackers.  They are more concerned with punishing individuals who abuse the glitch filled PvE "raid/horde mode" in a verbal and visible manner, than they are with fixing their forced PvP hack fest.  The evidence of this lack of effort to crack down on hackers is evidenced in the sheer prevalence of it.  If hacking was being properly tracked and punished, hackers would not be so prominent or easily identifiable in the manner that they currently are.\n\nThere are hackers that literally stream and post on youtube that are still playing the game even though they are open and provide evidence themselves that they are hacking.  There is no fair play system that provides after startup checking of game files, and while this measure is not a fool-proof prevention method, it is a deterrent and can help track and more readily identify hackers to the game developers.\n\nThe companies(Massive and Ubisoft) claim to be banning hackers but if any true form of punishment was being handed out there would not be such an open and blatant disregard for the games ToS.\n\nI thank you for reading this entire post if you have done so, and while the PvE aspect of the game is enjoyable, it is not feasible to play solely in the PvE area and be competitive with individuals that venture into the dark zone.  I personally have 600 hours of gameplay invested, and in my personal experience the hacking issues are only getting worse as the game progresses.  I encounter 6-7 hackers a day while trying to gain valuable dark zone levels, and in total have lost 367k dark zone experience to these individuals which equates to gaining levels 1-32(roughly) in the dark zone and (based on efficiency in farming DZ experience) roughly 20 hours of gameplay progress.\n\nI urge you to add this game to your wishlist, but abstain from purchasing until the hacking problem has been fixed or they provide a viable end game solution to allow players to be competitive in end game PvE progress without a need to travel into the Dark Zone.\n\nI have endeavored to provide a detailed explanation of why you should abstain from purchase at this time, and I hope that should you buy the game you are not disappointed when your end game DZ time comes and you begin to encounter hackers.","April 27","false","579.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I will not waste your time talking about my skills or anything like that...im just a person who plays a LOT of games and really waited to play this one ever since I saw it at E3.  This and Fallout 4 were the games I was dying to play.  Opening day had some trouble but soon I was playing with friends and leveling up.  We were having a great time...shooting dogs and going through missions.  Then the darkzone trips.  I found that most people in DZ01 - DZ03 were like me.....just wanting to grab gear and get out.  We were always in the DZ with the same approximate level people so if we did accidently go rogue we had a good fighting chance.\nThen we beat the game and reached level 30.  The game seriously went downhill from there.  The PC version of this game is riddled with hackers and glitchers.  After trying a few darkzone runs and having moderate success I found roving gangs of poachers that were killing people for nothing.  I found the loot chests always empty because apparently they are constantly checked by everyone and its pure luck to find one with any gold tech in it.  The crafting system update is a total joke...its astounding how hard it is to craft now.\nThe solo or PVE coop is great from levels 1-30 and the basic game is good.  The enemies are mindless but thats ok in the scheme of things.  My main problems deal with the serious lack of quality control on the release of this game, and the hackers arent making things any better.  Its becoming a "hack and have a fighting chance" type of game and for people that honestly do not hack or glitch and play the game as it was installed this is not a fun game after level 30.

Unfortunately, the developer & publisher failed to forsee the security flaws, which allow hackers and exploiters to thrive in the darkzone (PVPE).\n\n**Hackers begin to be banned, but damage to the  player base numbers is significant.\n\nAt first there were few hackers and the exploiters couldn't out gear folks to bad, but with the expansion a gear gap is significant and hackers have become numerous. Additionally, the developer thinks AoE spam increases the challenge of the incursion level, which takes place in one large room with mind numbing waves of NPCs. Also, the developer continues to set crafting and material ratios based on exploiters, which kills these actions for average players. It's nearly impossible to perfect a character build due to the RNG (random number generator) loot system, which only allows you to adjust one stat category.\n\nThe first month will probably be the best the time the player base has had with the game due to the minimal population of hackers. This game has stunning eye candy and solid third person shooter mechanics, but it falls flat in security and therefore is untrustworthy of steady entertainment as it developes.\n\nBuyer beware!\n\nEdit: 29May2016\n\nGame updated to 1.2 this week and the patch broke as much as it fixed. There's a new 201+ Gear Score DZ, which is set primarily to teams of four players and isn't worth solo players time as they're just a DZ ATM for teams to rogue unless a titan build or have above average reflexes due to the higher level NPC.\n\nWhen teamed with seasoned players, I've observed Meta-teams of 6-8 rogues work a server over with player limit of 24 without serious challenge. The game's playerbase is condensed to the overgeared and/or the highly skilled and those players to stubborn or to clueless to quit in the GS201+ DZ.\n\nMight makes Right in the DZ per the design. Unfortunately, the Metagame usurps any end game intentions the developers have for the DZ.\n\nOn PVE side the once a week HVT (High Value Target) rewards stagnates interest and character developement.","May 28","false","639.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are just too many cons to make this game worth buying full price, given its current state. More and more publishers are turning to these types of tactics of anticipation, and promise, only to deliver an un-finished, giant piece of s***.\n\n\n-- Cons\n----------------\n\n- Bugs/Glitches\n-----------------\nUbisoft can't even release a legitimate  patch to fix all the crap that is wrong with this game. From the release this game was broke as all f*** but waited over a month to release a patch that still broke the game. Fix your damn teleportation of enemies as well. And I have never in my life seen a game where an enemy can run to cover, and then instantly be on target and some how teleport to a vehicle. I laugh every time.\n\n- Weapons/Gear Sets/Loot\n-----------------------------\nWhile there is copius amounts of loot to pick up, it's the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over with marginal to no gains no matter how much you grind. I have grinded over 200 hours into this game and still have yet to see what exactly is the best gear/and or weapons. Weapon balance is a joke. Ubisoft's ability to try to introduce real world weapons into the game turned into a joke. A real world KRISS Vector .45 SMG sprays out over 1200 rounds a second, but the top in the game is 900? Get your s*** straight with real world weapons before you put them in a game.\n\nGear Sets were introduced and completely ruined the game. Half of them are pointless and are worse than high-end items. I highly doubt this will ever be fixed because lets be honest, Ubisoft doesn't care.\n\n\n- Dark Zone\n--------------------\nYou had one job and you half-♥♥♥♥♥ it. Oh way to introduce a server-side anti-cheat system, LAWLZ. Hackers pretty much run rampent in the dark zone, so I suggest just staying out of there, otherwise you will want to break everything you own. The risk of going to get loot out of the dark zone has been marginal and honestly not worth dying a million times for.\n\n- Incursions\n-----------------\n\nI get the idea behind incursions, but you have literally made it impossible to complete on ones own. If I want to complete the incursions on my own, I shouldn't need a tank to win. You could have the best gear in the game and still get destroyed. And lets be honest, one incursion a month? Did you cut your team down to 5 people and said go create this retardness?\n\n- Season Pass\n-----------------\nGiant waste of money. Wait till everything is out, because for $40 US, I have yet to see anything worth the money or wait.\n\n- End-Game\n---------------\nThat end-game will be the worst ever created in the history of gaming if Ubisoft fails to add more to the story or to the single player campaign.\n\n\n++ Positives\n----------------\n\nOh s*** there are positives to this game? Yes, but very few.\n\nThe game had a lot of potential and has a decent story. While the there are plenty of single players missions to accomplish along with side missions made it enjoyable to play for a little bit but that is about it.\n\nThanks for the profits when I cashed in my stock on your company Ubisoft, as that's about the only thing profitible out of this entire mess. In all honesty, I would wait on this game until it's on sale or if you just want a time waster. Ubisoft should be more like CD Red Projekt instead. At least they have a willingness to make their games right and know when s*** is broke.\n\nI honestly hope Escape from Tarkov destroys this game. Even DayZ is better than this POS and that game is still broke ASF.","May 30","false","221.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
