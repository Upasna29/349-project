The implemented gamemodes work, offline and online Multiplayer works, leaderboards and steam workshop work too :3\n\n+ postive\n- negative\no neither, but wanted to mention\n\nGameplay / Controls\n+ Car controls nicely\n+ Lots of obstacles to avoid. Placement of obstacles can make for great flow in levels, ranging from hectic dodging to smooth precision driving.\n+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers does not kill you. Instead it chops off a piece of your car, and you can continue with a few missing wheels, greatly impacting the car controls.\n+ Flying and rotational jets allow for a great amount of agility. It feels badass to just throw in a random backflip.\n+ Possible overheat from boosting too much keeps player on his toes. The best players will find ways to boost for entire levels by utilizing the stunt-system for heat-management.\n+ Checkpoints are optional, allowing for offroad search for crazy shortcuts.\n+ Sprint and Challenge gamemodes require a surprisingly different approach, making for nice variety.\n\no No AI vehicles, but to be honest who would expect that with such a powerfull level editor.\n\n- Main menu does not react to mouse input at all. Only part of the game that accepts mouse input is the Level Editor.\n- No way of saving ghosts or up/downloading replays. All that gets saved is the time / points (depending on gamemode) you got on the track. (Devs plan to implement this)\n- Game's physics are tied to the FPS, resulting in inconsistent physics below 60 frames per second. Can rarely cause going straight through solid objects unharmed or blowing up on steep quarterpipes that suddenly count as walls.\n- Stunt-system is lackluster, making both the Stunt and the Speed&Style gamemodes kinda "meh". Not a wide variety of tricks, no comboing, cooldown given for stunts doesn't value the aquired points / the stunt difficulty properly (One barrel roll cools 50%, two rolls cool 50%, three rolls cool 55%, so why would I ever do more than one at a time?).\n\nVisuals\n+ Bright, neon-y graphics style, somewhat reminding of TRON.\n+ Great futuristic racing atmosphere, scrating that itch the same way games like F-Zero or Wipeout do.\n+ Decently detailed car, which can be recolored for a feeling of individualism (said recolor will be shown in online multiplayer matches!).\n+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers can look entertainingly goofy.\n+ Looks great even on lower graphics settings, as long as texture quality is set high.\n+ A lot of graphics options.\n+ The entire HUD is on a screen on the back of the car, making the game more emersive.\n\no Activating Bloom is often overkill, causing you to get blinded frequently.\no The entire HUD being on the back of the car takes a bit of getting used to. HUD gets pretty much disabled when you get cut in half by a laser.\n\nAudio\n+ Catchy techno soundtrack that has something fitting for every kind of level.\n+ Music adjusts to surroundings, e.g. becomes muffled in tunnels or gets almost drowned out in zero-g.\n+ Futuristic soundeffects that always fit their origin (shrieking sawblades, low-pitched rumble for big drones hunting you etc.)\n+ Can set audio levels for several sources (car, music, environment etc.) independently\n\no Music can get old after grinding a level for a few hours, since musictracks are fixed for each level.\n\n- The sound of the car's engine is basically just a low-pitched buzz which gets old pretty quickly.\n\nMultiplayer\n+ All tracks are available in Multiplayer, plus tracks from multiplayer-only modes Reverse Tag and Soccer.\n+ Fully working splitscreen mode for 2-4 players (car collision is ON, so shove that guy off the track! :D ).\n+ Fully working online mode for up to 6 players per server (no car collision).\n+ Can connect to a server via serverbrowser or via IP, essentially enabling offline LAN play.\n+ Host can set password for a lobby, making it private.\n+ You can play all custom levels from the Workshop online, there even is an auto-download feature in case you're missing a level!\n\no Ingame chat and server messages (e.g. "x finished the race!", "y got wrecked!") share a chatlog, making it difficult to maintain conversation. But who has time for that anyway, gotta go fast VROOM VROOM.\n\n- No dedicated servers.\n- Soccer and Speed&Style gamemodes cannot be played online, they are local-only.\n- Reverse Tag mode suffers greatly under higher ping (does not affect other gamemodes).\n\n\nLevel Editor\n+ Big amount of functionality, tons of settings for each individual object.\n+ Can place, resize and rotate objects with high precision for seamless leveldesign.\n+ Splices on the ends of all track-like pieces, allowing for easy connection between trackobjects as well as intuitive manipulation of tracks.\n+ Can individually disable abilities of the car for a varied experience, or even set triggers for reaquiring selected abilities mid-level.\n+ Atmosphere triggers like music changers, skybox changers.\n+ All advanced hotkeys and shortcuts are also listed as clickable buttons under the 'Tools' tab, making learning the advanced functions less frustrating.\n\no You cannot import custom assets to the editor, like custom models or custom music.\no With complexity comes a learning curve. No "let's just put down some trackpieces" a la Trackmania, but not too difficult either.\n\n- UI sometimes a bit buggy, but can easily be fixed by saving, quitting to menu and re-entering the editor.\n- Some moving objects have strange behaviour under extreme conditions (like very high movement speed or very small size).","December 9, 2014","true","613.5"," 385 of 402 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","385","402","3","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakoresh/recommended/233610/","megakoresh","Megakoresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakoresh/","152 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's probably a good time to review now. The developers behind Nitornic Rush made Distance after a successful Kickstrater compaign, in which I was a backer. I played the game since pre-EarlyAccess beta and it's one of those titles that doesn't have a long-lasting attachment feature, yet immediately sinks in as being something unique and great.\n\nThe production quality of this indie racer made by 6 people is 100 times better than something like The Crew, which shows something... At the very least a clear ability to estimate the workload and project scope in regards to the team's resources. There is no question that the game will be delivered exactly as was promised, if not better, and completely bug-free with great performance. Because it already is. I have no qualms with recommending this even under Early Access because really it is complete. All features promised by Kickstrater campaign have been delivered in time and as advertised. It is strange to praise a company so much just for doing things how they have to be done, but lately so few have been doing so, that as sad as it is, Refract really do stand out as being exceptionally professional and honest about their goals. And having a solid vision to boot.\n\nNow the actual game. It's a survival racer where you can drive on tracks, under tracks, on walls, on roofs, you can fly, jump, there are zero-gravity sections and generally a complete and glorious cluster♥♥♥♥ every time you spawn on a level. No signle race will be the same because at some point, someone will decide "Racing on track is 2lame4me" and jump on a nearest skyscraper, ride on it's wall to cut, screw up the jump-off, fall onto a lazer and cut off his front wheels (the car doesn't die from that, as long as you can get it to a next checkpoint where it will regenerate any missing parts, it will keep going until it overheats or smashes into something). After that they will make a best attempt to use side thrusters to turn and sprint thruster to get more airtime, overheat, explode and everyone will laugh hysterically.\n\nThis game is one of those LAN party games that becomes and instant must-have. It is full of hilarious moments. But if Goat Simulator, which is similar in that respect, only has funny moments, Distance posses a huge mechanical depth and complexity unparallelled by any racing game other than Simulators. If you can get past the flying controls and master the "EveryTHING is a race track" mechanic of switching between tracks, walls, ceilings, portals, all the while avoiding obstacles and performing tricks to get cooldown and boost more or get more flytime, you will find a very satisfying experience due to the amount of ways every track can be completed in.\n\nYou can drive to next checkpoint. You can fly to it. You can jump to a wall, drive up, jump off, do a 180‘ flip to land on the part of the track above you and skip to the next checkpoint. You can fly off the track at any time and use building rooftops to skip track parts. And it's not cheating because it takes an enormous amount of skill and training to pull that off without meeting your demise and being reset far back. There is really nothing like this. Distance takes the "alternative route" of racing games to a completely new level.\n\nAlso a very advanced level editor, a ton of levels on Steam Workshop, incredible soundtrack, great graphics and atmosphere, fantastic production quality and a fair price. If you can find friends for a LAN party or organize a group to play in online multiplayer (because generally that part is pretty dead, if you don't organize and host, there are no random servers to join and race), you will have a blast. It is very difficult to properly master this game's 4-dimensional racing, but it's worthit and if you don't want, you don't have to do it. I had a blast taking 14 minutes to reach finish line, just because in those 14 minutes I discovered 34 ways to reach it. Also I love driving half a car. I mean look at my screenshots.\n\nTL;DR:\nRace\nWTF I can FLY?\nВitch Ima fly past whole track and finish in 15 seconds!\n*explodes and respawns*\nOk, Ima fly to the building, drive on it's wall and jump off 3 checkpoints later!\n*Does it all*\nI am so pro biаtches! *Accidently cuts off half a car while flying, with left thuster gone car spins out of the track*\n♥♥♥♥! Boost! Fly! Next checkpoint! *Explodes from overheat and resets*\nOk screw this, I am driving on track...\n...\n...\nWhat's that glowy thing over there? Can I get there? Oooh I can...\n\n10/10 would explode again.","January 18, 2015","true","7.4"," 159 of 164 people (97%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","97","159","164","46","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/233610/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere are few games that can sell me on the gameplay alone, and Distance is one of those titles. If you enjoy arcady racing games with friends with style and substance, then you might want to pick this game up now.\n\nOr wait until there is more to come.\n\nIs There Enough To Go Around?\nA common complaint about Distance is the minimal amount of creator made content.\n\nThere is a servicable "story mode" that is a good tutorial to wrap your head around the game's basic mechanics, but it's only halfway done. It also doesn't utilize all the game modes in it, so it's not a tutorial for everything. And if you don't screw up too much, you might get an hour and a half of substance.\n\nBut then you have to take into consideration the wide variety of user-created Steam Workshop maps right now. Currently there are over a thousand user-made content. Most of these maps are probably meant for solo so-hard-yet-so-fun players, not so much for multiplayer players. (Or it feels like it from what the devs showcase on their updates.)\n\nThe best way to think about Distance is to think about it as a game similar to Audiosurf. You can plug in your own tunes into the game, you can get tons of hours of enjoyment out of the game itself, and the amount of content is more to what is to your tastes.\n\nThankfully, you won't have to rely on crap-shooting for good user-made content. You can type in a custom search engine in-game to find the types of tracks you are looking for, whether it be thematic things like LIMBO or TRON or Super Meat Boy levels of challenge.\n\nI've only played a single game of multiplayer with one friend, so I cannot say anything about the merits of tis multiplayer longevity. We had fun doing challenge tracks meant for one player while racing one another. (We intentionally crashed into one another a lot.)\n\nOh, and best of all, the game's multiplayer can be online or split-screen. Leave it to an indie game from EA to bring back the couch.\n\nThe point of this section is to state that however much content is left to add into the game, which I sometimes wonder what is left to do other than better optomize the game itself, you will find as much content as you're willing to put into the game.\n\nYou Sold Me On the Car\nI'm not going to lie. When I saw what the car can do--fly, do barrel rolls for boosting, and for doing precise jump manuevers with antigravity tracks in Tron--I wanted to get into this game immediately. The inner child who played with Hot Wheels and who wanted to go drive around in Tron came out with this game, and I have no regrets for it.\n\nHowever, because of the complexity of the controls, I don't think everyone will find them comfortable on the keyboard. Doing the necessary tricks to hop off one track and continue on another requires a lot of quick-reactions. Sometimes the maps themselves will limit your abilities, so you need to be comfortable with your controls.\n\nIt's a little difficult to explain, but the gist of the controls is you steer with one thumbstick and rotate the car with the other. You have a button to boost, another button to jump, and another button to engage flight-form.\n\nThe game utilizes all of these in complex manuevers. Sometimes you'll need to do a ninty degree flip to swtich lanes, or you need to maintain your boost by doing tricks to maintain your energy. Or maybe you need to engage flight-mode to get back on to the track when you fall off. It feels all natural to use when you get a feel for the controls.\n\nYour car is also able to be split apart by lazers, buzzsaws, etc. It's a really interesting visual effect to cut your car in half--but you won't immediately lose if your car gets damaged. If you can sustain the car to the next checkpoint, your car will get auto-repaired. However, based on what gets hacked off, your ability to control the car is also changed.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but with all the different modes takes those mechanics into different manners of playing the game. You have a HORSE style mode, a time-trial mode, a Tony Hawk tricks mode, and a no-checkpoint-shorter-levels mode.\n\nThere is no weaponry or other arcady elements from other racing games if you were hoping for something like Sonic All-Star Racing/Mario Kart/Diddy Kong Racing in Tron. Nor are there AI opponents to race against like with those games. Distance isn't that kind of game.\n\nAt its core, Distance is a racing game with more flash and style. But with a really, really sick car.\n\nAre There Other Dents?\nThe game can run very shoddy at times because of all the visuals thrown into the game, so if you want the best experience you should close other applications for the best performance.\n\nOther than the optomization issue and the questionable amount of content, I don't know how else to criticize the game. The controls feel responsive enough; the gameplay offers more than racing itself; and the game itself is really, really good.\n\nYou'll have to ask yourself if that is enough to sell you on the game. If not the car, then check out the soundtrack too.\n\nRating of Completion/Competence\nHere is a detailed list of my scale:\n\n1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently.\n\n2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)\n\n3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.\n\n4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team.\n\n5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.\n\nThe simple raiting is a brief summary to describe the state of this game. The detailed rating goes into the nuances of what is available in Distance.\n\nSimple Rating: 3/5\nDetailed Rating: 11/20 (55%). A cautious recommendation only for the gameplay.\nContent: 3/5\n\nMultiplayer, all game modes, the second type of car (which gives a double-jump at the cost of no flight mode) and the Steam Workshop level editor are in the game. However, what remains besides the story mode is vague.\n\nQuality: 4/5\n\nThe core gameplay is refined enough that I would consider it in a complete state. The only thing that may hamper it are the optimization problems.\n\nOptimization: 2/5\n\nIf you wish to get the best mileage with Distance, then you don't want other programs to be in the background.\n\nProductivity: 2/5\n\nWhile I appreciate the community involvement from the developers making fan-made contests and showcasing their creations, I would appreciate more if they added their own content more frequently. Or simply finish the rest of the game to be in a playable state to get more interest.\n\nThe updates and bug fixes are frequent enough to let me know they are still working on the game. But I think so many people on the fence with Distance would buy this game if all the features were complete. We're nearing the first year mark of Distance--hopefully, as the devs state, we'll get the full product by 2016.\n\nYou can only get so far with selling me with the car before I start to question whether we'll ever reach the end.","December 3, 2015","true","3.3"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","66","71","0","16"

It is worth every penny the developers have put on it's price tag, and here's a lazy amateur breakdown of why:\n\n• It looks amazing. The game really is very atmospheric, with great sense of speed, and every level feels unique. It's arcade with personality, and pretty great graphics. Honestly, I don't need to say much when there's beautiful screenshots up there.\n\n• It sounds amazing. As with Nitronic Rush, the music is one of the greatest things about this game. Even if you don't like the genre as much, you'll find it fitting and very well crafted. Not to mention it interacts with the level, making lights blink to the beat and things like that.\n\n• It plays amazing. When we talk about controls in this game, it's important to note that you actually feel you're in control. Which is very important, considering this is survival racing. You often need to act fast, and everything is as responsive as you'd expect. Oh, and the delirious stunts you can pull make you feel awesome. And when you successfully recover from a mistake instead of resetting? That's the stuff.\n\n• The developers are extremely passionate, and very good at what they do. That combo means a handful of things: They are very thorough, listen to the community feedback with great care, and in fact get really involved with the player base. A chance to play with one (or more!) of the devs online is barely difficult.\n\n• It's got a powerful level editor. And people make the most amazing things with it. It's got primitives, which means you can basically create anything you think of, if you have the time. As a matter of fact, most of my play time was spent in the editor. Creating is fun, and sharing is easy.\n\n• Failing is often surprisingly fun to watch. Being suddenly flung out of the track, spinning ferociously, crashing into a nearby building, and exploding into many pieces, all in a matter of seconds... It can be a good laugh. Why be frustrated? It looks great even when you suck.\n\nThis is one early access game you can trust. It's the most polished and feature complete beta of a game I've seen, and yet it seems to only grow and improve further.\n\nBuy this game, buy this game, buy this game. Sorry, that's a bit pushy.","June 16, 2015","true","270.3"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","45","47","5","2"

I played the story mode, uploaded my own level ('[Challenge] Damnation'), started multiplayer and instantly met friendly players whom I played hours with!\n\nPros\nLevel Editor (Easy to handle; getting started tutorial; comfort tools like 'move along the track' or 'flip' makes it easy to decorate a track.)\nWorkshop with a lot (and by that I mean 'freaking grains of sand at a beach' lot!) of user created levels.\nCool driving mechanics like deployable wings for flying capability, deployable jet thrusters and hydraulic jumping to manoeuvre in zero gravity fields or to twist the car around for wall/ceiling rides.)\nKickstarter project with already unlocked goals which will be implemented when the game is out of beta: Click\nThose are for example: Replay/Spectate Modes (With fast forward/play/pause and driving against your Ghost.),\nCinematic camera angles/free camera and Random Track Generation Mode (create vast number of unique tracks at the click of a button with parameters for tweaking and capability to share specific seeds so you can show discovered tracks to friends. You shouldn't be able to workshop-up those!)\nVarious Modes like Challenge, Sprint, Stunt, Speed & Style, Free Roam..\nMultiplayer with easy to set up servers.\nGreat audio which makes the tracks colors pulse with the beat! (Importing custom audio is suggested.)\nNice, friendly and funny community\nSupport for various plattforms and controller.\n\nSmall team of devs who  are really confident to make a much more polished and professional game sequel to Nitronic Rush. They have key developers from Nitronic Rush in their team and bring much experience with them.\nGreat forum moderators who take every suggestion thread into consideration and give constructive criticism. There is also a thread with many already suggested ideas listed: Click[survivethedistance.com]\nMany of those got green light from the devs.\nModerators and some devs are playing the game nonstop themself and checking out on the workshop levels, too!\nCons\nNot a fan of the Unity Engine, but I start to like it when thinking about what Distance accomplished with it.\nBeta status is missing many promised features and is short on many Multiplayer Host options like kick/ban.\nAlso, Adventure Mode & everything is incomplete and subject to change etc..\nNot being able to import custom content (audio, textures, models, scripts) to the level editor yet. (But there're simple objects like cubes you can create objects with, group them and save them as "costum object".)\nMultiplayer is sometimes dead. No servers or anything. People come to live when it is getting midnight in europe.As you can see this game is pretty much worth a buy!\n\nThe next stable update will have better physics, better handling and a great cockpiet view!! I already tested it on the experimental build.","December 21, 2014","true","265.5"," 41 of 41 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","41","41","0","0"

Time to change that and get you invested into this wonderful game, I have tried to explain every aspect of the game after playing for 90hrs;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPROS\nDiverse tracks to play in the base game, bundled together in 'campaign' mode that'll teach you the mechanics of the game, serves as an  introduction to the game\n\nExtensive and tight controls; offer a complete and very responsive control over your car (all controls are completely re-bindable to your liking)\n\nNimble and flexible gameplay mechanics; not a typical stale A to B racer; obstacles, short cuts, loopings, riding on walls, skidding and jumping off walls, jumping from one platform to the next, rolling, traps and even flying!\n\nMultiplayer; with a fairly crowded community, at least 5-10 players online when I've tried, local ! split-screen multiplayer (whens the last time you've seen that?)\n\nExtensive level editor; to make your own levels for the game, you can create pretty much any kind of level you want, all the tools are there to be used, tracks, traps, decorations, lots of assets. All of them can be played in multiplayer.\n\nLearn from the workshop; there are already dozens of fun tracks to downloaded live (no need to restart your game) into your game and play. - See what mechanics will work for your own levels.\n\nMechanics react to your actions; sprinting heats up your car and you will explode if you use it for too long, 'cool-down' gates reset your heat, car reacts to damage taken meaning half your car can get chopped off, still you'll be able to get to the next gate, perhaps with greater difficulty\n\nAll the HUD, is on the back of your car, your screen remains largely uncluttered\n\nNeat futuristic sound track\n\nAbility to add your own music\n\nTense atmosphere; neat effects, futuristic surroundings, and diverse assets\n\nControl over many gfx settings, AA, shadows, film grain, borderless fullscreen... it's all there\n\nLeaderboards and scores, not really a pro but ups the replayability per level slightly- trust me you will want to replay a level and improve your score\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONS\nThe level editor; it is a bit of a hassle to get started with and the few tutorials are a good start but it will all be overwhelming to start with, I suggest taking a look at Niven511's detailed start on building levels\n\nThe main campaign offers too little, too few; It's a rather short, high quality intro to the game that will leave you asking for much more, you will need to re-route to community made levels and multiplayer [Dev has said campaign is already much longer in an internal build, update soon]\n\nThe game may feel light-weight; beneath all the flashy, innovation the game offers you may find yourself unsatisfied that there is little to do than to reach the end of each track, there isn't much sense of progress; the diverse traps, effects, the heating up mechanic and different game modes counter this con to an extent but leave the game feeling like it may be missing something after you have played it for several hours. The moves you can do remain limited, there is no AI to beat, the obstacles remain fixed as an 'add-on to the track', only 1 achievement currently\n\nThere is only one vehicle model; no other cars to pick from. You can customize the the colours of your car though [Dev has said there will be another car added soon]\n\nA bit of a learning curve; you might get lost quickly, find yourself frustrated with the little mistakes that punish you, the overheating and the controls you'll need to learn. You'll can get over this after you've played for a few hours\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONCLUSION\nDistance is a survival racing game, it combines the intense action gameplay into an arcade racing experience, speeding through a futuristic world. You have tight control of a speedy car that allows you to, boost, jump, rotate, fly and avoid obstacles through intense levels. An extensive level editor allows you to create any track you want to make and there are dozens of high quality tracks to choose from in the workshop that are all playable in multiplayer and local (split-screen) co-op.\n\nWhile you may find yourself exhausted by Distance's mechanics, there are different game-modes, sprint, speed and tricks, 'catch me if you can' and even a soccer game mode to play. The many different tracks will surprise you time and time again and challenge you to race on until you complete the track successfully. Currently 20$ is more than fair and you'll certainly not be bored quickly with DISTANCE.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI recommend you go the distance and buy the game!","April 30","true","92.7"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","42","43","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Californ1a/recommended/233610/","Californ1a","Californ1a","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Californ1a/","836 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGeneralI've been waiting for the right time to post my review for Distance, and the most recent update (build 3520, the workshop discovery update) provides the perfect time for me to do so. I bought into the late alpha backer stage in June 2014, and as my playtime would suggest, I've not regretted this in the least bit. Distance was well worth the almost 3x price to buy into that stage ($55), and it has only improved it's features and content since then. This game is a steal for the current $20 it rests at, and I am confident any cons listed in this review or many of the other reviews will be ironed out before it leaves the Early Access stage.\n\nEarly AccessYes, this game is still in the early access stage. For many games that may means bugs, few updates, lazy devs, and etc. but Distance, and its devs, are far exceeding those predispositions people may have about early access as a concept. It had a very successful Kickstarter campaign and it was also a Steam greenlight game. The game itself is in a fully working and stable state. The main reason behind staying in early access instead of going ahead and releasing is one thing - Features. The devs are very dedicated and have a laundry list of features they expect to be in their game before they consider it complete, and this is why it is in early access. The main features left to be added to the game at the point of writing this review are as follows: At least one alternative vehicle to choose from (+one other for kickstarter backers), an "announcer" similar to that of Nitronic Rush but in a different styling to fit the desolate Distance atmosphere, a full replay system (possibly with ghosts of replays to race against), randomly generated tracks, and a full adventure story mode (part of which is currently in-game). I'd encourage whoever is considering buying this game to look past the early access tag and see the game for what it is, a very complete experience with some major new features on the way.\n\nDevelopersThe developers are not treating this (early access) as a cash cow opportunity to make a profit and run, abandoning the game - they are very active within the community and are an easy bunch to contact if need be. There is no downside I can speak of when talking about the developers in the 9 months I've participated in the community thus far - they are an amazing team and I'm glad they are the ones to be making this great game. Anyone active in the Distance community has probably talked to them at some point, whether it be about a bug report, feature suggestion, or just discussing some of the many community workshop tracks. Occasionally they will host a livestream event to show off some of the community-created tracks on their Twitch[twitch.tv] and we have some great fun asking questions while they host a multiplayer server. All of their contact info is in the bottom-right corner of the Distance homepage[survivethedistance.com].\n\nLevel EditorThe level editor is very complex, and a few reviews have listed that as a con, but I see the complexity of it as a good thing. The more complex it is, the more can be done in it. Yes, it won't be easy to do, but the complexity means that it can be done. There are a few level editor tutorials in the works, so they should help new players learn how to use it more easily. If you have the patience to sit down with it for a while and just play around, then you'll find that it is a very extensive editor that allows you to create pretty close to anything you want.\n\nMain Pros ListI'll be stealing some of my pros and cons from other reviews, but we are all talking about the same game so the lists would be fairly similar anyway. I suggest taking a look through Icebound777's review for a comprehensive pros/cons listing.\nThe controls are tight, and the game supports many, many types of controllers including racing wheels and flight sticks.\nThere is a lot of track variety, and full Steam workshop support for the level editor.\nThe agility of the vehicle makes the game handle more like a platformer than a racer, giving it a "new" feeling to the racing genre.\nThere is no concept of "out of bounds" in Distance - any surface can be driven on and treated as a potential track. This leads to some crazy routes to get to the end of some tracks.\nThe competition on the global leaderboards is tight, even with all the off-road routes driving through buildings.\nThe community encourages players to use the vehicle mechanics to their full potential, and even publishes videos of how to complete tracks faster to help any players improve their times (people don't keep "fast" routes a secret).\nThe vehicle can be recolored with completely custom colors and those colors show up in multiplayer.\nThere is splitscreen with up to 4 players, fairly rare on pc games - as well as online multiplayer.\nExtensive graphics settings to be configured, including things such as "Film Noir" for a black and white look or "Stylized Outlines" for the Borderlands look.\nThe car can be cut into pieces by lasers or saws, making for some interesting gameplay trying to control the vehicle without a couple wheels.\nThe soundtrack. Seriously, just go listen to it[soundcloud.com].\nAll audio levels can be edited separately (music, car, environment, etc.)\nLocal custom music support to play mp3's and have the game lights react/pulse to it (Windows only currently).\nAll official and workshop tracks are available in multiplayer. The host needs to have the tracks locally in order to play them however.\nNot having a workshop track in multiplayer is no big deal, say hi to automatic workshop downloading!\nThere is the option of creating private, password-protected, servers, and a "connect via IP" to allow for offline LAN play.\nComprehensive and complex level editor allowing you to run wild with whatever crazy ideas you may have.\nMultiple gamemodes including Sprint (point a to b race/time trial), Challenge (similar to Sprint, but no checkpoints and no deaths allowed), Stunt (do stunts to get the highest score), Speed and Style (similar to sprint, but the score you get from doing stunts is subtracted from your time), Soccer (only available in splitscreen, it's soccer with a giant ball and nets), and Reverse Tag (capture the flag/king of the hill type gameplay where you try to hold onto a bubble for a cumulative 3 minutes and the bubble enlarges the longer you hold it making it harder to keep)\nMain Cons ListIf you've played Nitronic Rush, there is currently no announcer in Distance - It is planned.\nCurrently no replays or ghosts - This is also planned.\nNo option of a standard HUD apart from the back of the vehicle, making getting cut extremely annoying in some situations.\nCurrently no dedicated servers, the host has to be playing the game and picking which tracks to play - however this has been hinted at as something the devs want to be in.\nNo custom assets in the level editor - that means objects or music. Local custom music is supported, but no workshop support.\nDifficulty and skill curve could use some tweaking but if you stick with it, it is possible to learn the ropes fairly quickly.\nGeneral bugs/glitches","March 16, 2015","true","115.8"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/233610/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntro Distance is a racing game where your main goal is to survive and to get to the end of the level. It’s just you and the track. There are no opponents that can run you off the road, but there are many obstacles. But is it interesting enough to keep you going ?\n\nGameplay When you first start you’re put into the seat of a futuristic racing car where you have to race across tracks and just survive. Just. Survive.\nBut this is not just an ordinary car. Your car can, besides racing at insane speeds, also turn mid-air, fly, boost and jump. It’s quite spectacular to see your car appear, especially with the HUD being projected on the car itself. There’s no true HUD, because the car will show you all the vital information: the direction you need to go to, your boost meter, your speed-o-meter and a timer. The timer allows you to set a high score and I guess that’s the true goal of the game: repeating a level over and over again and hoping that you get better and beat your previous high score(s).\n\nAll of this is done while you complete random tracks. At the end of the track you’re being teleported to a new one where the whole process begins anew. Except that it gets more difficult with each new track. You’re gradually introduced to new gameplay mechanics and after about 10 tracks or so you should know exactly what to do when an object appears out of thin air or when a new part of the track suddenly appears beside or above you. That still doesn’t make it an easy game. On the contrary; it’s a hard game and you have to choose when and how long you want to boost and you have to perfect your flight and trick abilities at the same time. You’ll frequently crash and burn.\nThat’s partly thanks to the game itself (well, the game designers really), because it doesn’t always let you fly whenever you want to. For me personally it was very confusing because I had no idea when I could or couldn’t use it. Whenever I was about to drop down a track I just pressed the button and hoped that it would work. Unfortunately this didn’t work more than half of the time. When you’re playing a game where the goal is to get to the end of the track as quick as possible then you don’t want to have worry about if you’re being able to fly or not whenever you’re about to crash. It’s a small design flaw in my eyes. You either let people know that they will be able to fly during a track or you don’t. You can’t just change things up halfway through a track. But enough about that for now; it’s still an Early Access title and we must have faith that things can still change. And obviously I understand that the developers want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game this way.\n\nI haven’t yet talked about some of the things that will appear on the track so I’ll try to spend a minute talking about that. The game starts with introducing ramps and other basic/common things you find in most race games. After a while, huge, sharp rotating blades can be seen cutting into the tracks as well as laserbeams moving around trying to cut your car in half (which really does happen and you can then decide to either try and get to the next checkpoint or you can reset to the last one). Not much later you’ll also encounter blocks appearing out of thin air, rotating fans and spikes coming in from all sides. Plenty of stuff to keep you on your toes, as you can see.\n\nThe game has an Adventure Mode and an Arcade Mode. Adventure Mode is the single-player mode that I was just talking about where you follow a story (yes, there’s a story). Arcade Mode lets you play solo, split screen or online.  Solo gives you different choices than split screen and online so there’s plenty to do. I haven’t yet tried any of the modes except for Adventure Mode but unfortunately that one is incomplete and still being worked on. I’ve seen glimpses of the story but I’m not quite sure that I understand what it’s all about. Maybe soon.\n\nGraphics & Audio Graphically Distance is pretty impressive with dark lighting and a dark atmosphere in general, only brightened by colorful neon colors that appear on the tracks and specific objects (now I think about it; it’s shown on pretty much anything that can kill you). It has a cool Tron-like vibe but unfortunately the game uses a lot of basic geometry. Levels are kinda boring and the car itself doesn’t have much detail. I get that it’s futuristic but a little more variety in the tracks would’ve brought the game to life. But, since I don’t know if it’s part of the story I can’t properly talk about it I guess. So again, maybe we’ll know when the game finally releases somewhere next year.\nThe audio consists of sci-fi music with a somewhat frantic tempo. It fits the game completely so this is all good. Sounds like your car crashing and beams and blades closing in also sound great. No, the sound department is just fine.\n\nLength/Replayability Since this is an Early Access title the game isn’t yet complete. Still, the Adventure Mode can take you anywhere between 1,5-3 hours I think. After that you will probably have seen it all until the next part of the game releases.\nBut, of course, you can always spend some time with the Editor to create some new tracks yourself, or download custom made tracks from the Steam Workshop. That will add at least several hours extra to the total playtime.\n\nClosing Distance hasn’t entirely become the game that I initially expected. I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but I think that I was expecting a game similar to WipeOut maybe. While it doesn’t even come close to being that game this game is good in its own right. Partly thanks to the fact that it tries to do something different. I honestly can’t think of a game that uses these kind of mechanics so that’s absolutely a good sign. While it can definitely use some more polish and maybe a few changes here and there I certainly like what I’ve been playing thus far. And who knows what more we can expect in the near future ? I for one am looking forward to the final release. For now I’ll rate this as follows:\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","December 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","60","79","0","3"

A lot of the time you will be racing flat out, that is until your boost begins to overheat which cools at the next regeneration point.  You also get to jump obstacles, fly and wall/ceiling ride.  The game requires a high-level of skill and concentration, especially on some of the tougher levels!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fYKlaZSbPJI\n\nThe devs have included a track editor which mean there are around 1350 tracks at this present moment, and remember this game is still in Early Access!!  Not that you can tell this is a beta, it has the functionaly of a finished product and is extremely rich with features.\n\nOne planned feature not yet implemented that I'm most excited about are replays!  The game, as you can probably tell from video and screenshots looks absolutely gorgeous.  To have the ability to watch back (hopefully from external views!) a race in replay mode will be divine!  The engine appears extremely optimised and on my i5/970 runs extremely smooth, not even the smallest sign that any component is breaking a sweat!\n\nThe current campaign is quite short but also acts as a tutorial or introduction to the various moves at your disposal.  Although it is short it is extremely fun and very atmospheric.  The lighting rythmically flashing in time to  the dark techno pounding out your speakers and the weird static effects hurtling you through the environment really create for a highly enjoyable experience.  They are still adding to the campaign, but it's so fun I've replayed it a few times.\n\nYou've also got leaderboards, online play, time/score challenges to keep you more than occupied.\n\nOne problem I had initially was with the controls when attempting to switch surfaces to drive on.  Using the control pad to switch from floor to wall for example meant using the left and then right analoge sticks.  Previously this was my only apprehension about the game.  After perusing the forums a couple of other players recommended to switch the controls to advanced mode.  Now this frightened me a little!!  The game requires enough skill as it is without adding to it!!  Advanced mode meant that I now only have to use the left analoge stick to wall-ride.  So I can steer, jump off the road and then use the left analogue stick again to adjust my angle in the air to meet the wall.  Previously movement in the air would've been with the right stick and it felt extremely unintuitive.  Maybe this information can help someone else too.\n\nFull release is planned for later this year.  There's really no reason to wait, the game is an absolute stack of fun and a dream to look at.

Even the lowest graphic settings makes the game look pretty good. The visuals are also very very optimized, guaranteed to run on almost any machine, which seems to be quite rare with these Early Access Games. Very tron inspired and im a sucker for those kind of aesthetics.\n\nSound\nCrisp and clear. I was suprised at the amazing sound quality. From the woosh of passing large objects to the crashing sound effects everything about the sounds are just awesome.\n\nMusic\nOne of the games HUGE strong points. The music fits perfectly with everything. From the high octane Drum&Bass tracks to the chilled out electro you'll defenitley find yourself bobbing your head to the beat. Amazing soundtrack (If only they separately sold it)\n\nGameplay\nI personally play with a gamepad but keyboard and mouse feels excellent with little to no complaints. However it's prefered to play the game with a controller/gamepad to get the full feel of the controls. With it everything feels so much smoother and I also recomend using the advanced controls for more finer flips tricks and stunts! Wonderful controls\n\nMultiplayer\nThe "Distance" community is some of the best I've run into. I havent encountered a single problem with the people. The multiplayer gamemodes consist of a simple racing mode, to reverse tag (my personal favorite) and a challenge/stunt mode. All of which you can sink hours into, and theres even more gamemodes to come!\n\nLevel Editor / Steam Workshop\nPossibly the coolest part of this game. The level editor is so easy to pick up and learn and you can just upload to the workshop with a press of a button. And getting maps is even eaiser!\n\nOverall thoughts\nA MUST BUY. You have a unique racer combined with an explosive soundtrack, breath taking visuals, a friendly community, and a wonderful level editor.

As other people probably stated in other reviews, this game was based off of a college project game called "Nitronic Rush" (look it up and you could try it out for free). It stood out from other racing games in the way that you had to survive several deadly obstacles in order to finish the track. The biggest complaint about the game was that there was no multiplayer. So that's one main feature that they added into Distance. Another interesting feature that they added into the game (kinda shocked me) was a level editor with Steam workshop support. This definitely had me sold when It was finally released. So if you're finally board of track mania, give this game a shot.

It has that arcade sensation, high speed "must go faster" mentality while smirking at the wreckless destruction of your opponents' failed attempt at flying to the other side of the track when you need to change gravity. Pressing down the accelerator with the firm grip of your hands, cracking your controller/keyboard with the hopeful desire that the working half of your car, divided by lasers or saws, will pass the regeneration checkpoint so you don't have to redo that one part over and over and over again is a thrill like no other and when you do cross that line--it is a high like no other.\n\nIt reminds me of Rush 2049 with the wings on the car and the stunts; I am sure it had some inspiration to this game. The tracks are wonderful, the workshop gives it tons of replayability. Create your own tracks. Game modes like Tag, Challenge and Stunt. What else could make this game perfect?

This also makes me a bit bias, so stating this outright. If you wish for a Demo, search for Nitronic Rush. Over all it is a well-polished game with little to no bugs, and only increases in its polish and content.\n-----\nDistance is a survival racer; Get to the objective as fast as possible with minimal deaths.\nGo upside down, dodge lasers, and do it in style doing flips and tricks using small rockets inside the car, along with wings to fly through the map. By default these are controlled with the sticks on gamepads or wasd with the arrow keys.\n\nMultiplayer, co-op, a rocking sound track and Steam workshop make this game all the better, with new songs being added all the time and a massive dedicated community of map makers who have been around since the map editor was a hidden asset in the original game.\n\nCurrent complaints are no mouse compatibility for menus, and as of the time of writing, the campaign is missing quite a few levels, a bit of a steep learning curve for the level editor in my opinion and an inability to sort levels in menus when using the level selector, but both are easily fixable as the beta continues. In terms of difference from Nitronic Rush, flying is bound to space when in air, which I’m not a fan of personally but it's preference (and can be changed in menu).\n\nThe Developers have been very open with the backers through this process and have been providing plenty of updates to keep backers of the original Kickstarter up to date, I personally believe they will finish the project and it will be fantastic.\n","December 9, 2014","true","16.3"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","3"

The other is challenge, it's like sprint but shorter and no respawn, so prepare to fail quite a lot. There is also stunt, the least attractive game mode this far, where you are just suppose to do different stunts to gather a high score. There is also a multiplayer only game mod with the name "Tag" or something like that.\n\nTag works like the classic child game where one or more are chasing the others trying to "tag" them, however here it's the other way around, everyone is chasing the one with the forcefield, and you win when you've held the "tag" for three minutes. Quite fun.\n\nThe car is customizable when it comes to colours, I do hope they add more customization though, since it's always a plus. But for a early access game this game works really well! It never crashes unless you've tabbet it for quite some time.\n\nAll maps have a high score screen where you are not only competing against your old record, but also against all other players who play this game.

It gets difficult very quickly, but in Adventure mode there's no penalty for failing, you just restart at a checkpoint and try again. The additional Arcade mode, where you compete against others for the best score, time, or a combination of both, along with the user created levels, means there's almost infinite replayability. The graphics are gorgeous, as you can see in the screenshots above, and the soundtrack is incredibly well integrated with the action (although there's also the option for a custom soundtrack - which I have not tried - if you get bored with thumping techno). The sound effects are also really well done. The "whoosh" as you pass an obstacle really adds to the sense of speed. Well worth buying for anyone looking for a different type of racing game.","April 13","true","1.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/233610/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat is it?A futuristic racing speed/style game very much in the style of Space Haste and Megarace and other one-time futuristic racing classics, but without opponents and set in a dark, neon vibe.  Atmospherically, this is the best sci-fi racer I've played.  The game offers a single player story campaign, arcade racing mode, multiplayer and a fully fledged Level Editor in which you can build your own tracks.  The Steam Workshop is already integrated, offering an infinite resource of game content far beyond what is already offered in the game itself.  Best of all, you can specify any random phrase or word in the editor - and a track, with scenery and such as in the campaign will be added for you.  While it IS just as easy as typing a word and racing the resultant track, there is some sophistication built in: using certain words in your 'phrase' will add more sprint sections, particular effects, or more flight etc.  It's utterly brilliant and you don't have to be a boffin in order to use it (well, I used it - 'nuff said...).  There is also a full-blown track editor too if you really do want to craft your own by hand.\n\nHow difficult is the racing?The racing part has absolute precision controls and difficulty in the single-player campaign curves gradually.  There have been past similar titles where you can find yourself bouncing from one wall to the other, but not this one - it's lovely to play.  Jumps and flips are taught by button-prompts on-screen.  Flight sections can be a fair bit tricky however.  Straight flight is easy enough, but the roll mechanics of the vehicle are very strange and I find it very tricky to fly around corners without rolling uncontrollably and spiralling to death.  It takes some skill to play these parts, but practise does pay off and reaching the end of the campaign feels like a genuine achievement. Until then, expect a challenge - especially with gravity being a thing when you're not sure which way up you're facing!  Falling to crash UPWARDS is often the only time I realise I'm completely flipped.  It's crazy and it's silly - but above all it's fun.  Gamepad ninjas will blaze through it, and then roll around the floor laughing at the rest of us with our 50+ attempts to get through that maddening flippy dodgy section without burning up.\n\nThe game offers full controller support, including racing wheels and gamepads.  However, while the game can be played with a wheel, the best experience is experienced either with keyboard or gamepad for lighting-fast reaction play.\n\nA word of warning: if you suffer from any photo-sensitive condition like photo-sensitive epilepsy, this game might not be for you because there is a lot of flashing neon.  Watch the trailer videos first and judge for yourself.\n\n\nAbout that Early Access thing...The single-player campaign is rather short at the moment and, on its own, is not enough to warrant a typical AAA full game price.  However, there is a ton of content already in the Steam Workshop (some 700 new tracks the last time I looked) and these are seamlessly integrated with the game's 'Arcade' mode, plus the infinite possibilities of randomly seeded tracks, you'll never be bored.  As far as multiplayer goes, it seems really popular but check the game forums (I don't play multiplayer so I can't offer comment on this).  As a single-player product though, Steam reviews are giving an "overwhelmingly positive" for a very good reason: it really IS a great game already.  If you enjoy Wipeout-style games and not troubled by a lack of AI racers, then this should definitely be in your collection - it's worthy even as an Early Access title.\n\nHighly recommended!","January 10, 2015","true","16.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Buy it YESTERDAY, but don't expect a super-realistic driving game or even a MARGINALLY realistic one. I don't even think the cars have breaks--but if they do I've never used them.\n\nA pretty unique game that feels less like a driving or racing game(due in large part to the slippery and unrealistic car) and more like a sort-of... Sonic-y runner with survival elements. Irregardless of how the game feels however it is inarguably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. The game is challenging at times but for the most part is very fair, even in most of the workshop levels I've played, and it introduces a pretty cool universe(though one which reminds me too much of Tron to call it wholly original) that I REALLY want to learn more about, as well as some mechanics that I can't really say I've ever seen before.\n\nYou'll find yourself frequently and seamlessly switching from driving on the ceiling and on the walls, only to jump off two and a half seconds later and flying over an endless void. After a while, you'll land on solid ground again-- and if the planets align, you'll be actually horizontal on the GROUND and not on a wall or the ceiling, and nothing will be trying to kill you. At which point you'll probably make your car JUMP and do a couple flips for bonus points. This is the game's biggest asset, in my opinion. Everything just works--and works so very, very well. Jumping from a walll to the floor or vice-versa has some occasional hiccups, but otherwise the physics engine is constructed so well that the game just FLAWLESSLY and instantaneously responds to your commands in a way that I'm too illiterate to describe. The controls just feel so right... I'd even call them close to flawless. When you're a car, it drives like a car--a car that can jump, flip, and drive when half of it gets shredded by laser beams, but a car nonetheless. When you leap into the air and deploy your ♥♥♥♥ing WINGS, it feels like a plane. The game instantly transitions from a really solid(but floaty and weightless) arcade driving game into a really solid flight simulator--but it does it so well that you don't even notice most of the time.\n\nAnother huge plus is the striking art style. It feels reminiscent of Tron, but it has its own unique flare that defines it as its own, like most of the rest of the game does. It looks really overly shiny and neon and it's not something that I'm usually very fond of, but it works REALLY well. The screenshots and footage on this page seriously do not do the game credit in this respect.\n\nThe obsticles in the game are also pretty awesome, in combination with the car's damage model. Imagine Metal Gear Rising where Raiden's sword is a grid of laser beams, and you are the watermellon. Obviously your car does not like to drive as well if it is split in half, but it can take a lot of abuse as I recall.\n\nThe lore and universe in the game gives me mixed opinions. The developers have made it clear that they'll probably change a lot of the "story", but as of the time of this writing the game has a really solid universe and what seems to be the beginning of some AMAZING lore to build off of, but it doesn't really do anything with it. It attempts to almost tell the story through the tracks as you race through them, and while it translates pretty well in some ways, it doesn't really allow you to get a good idea of where you are, why you're there, and what the hell is going on around you, and it certainly leaves you drawing blanks for specific details. Story is by no means of any importance in a game like this and when the tracks are designed so well that they should make AAA publishers feel inferior, I really don't mind too much, but I simply can't help but lust for more lore. Hell, I'll sebtle for a two-issue tie-in comic for god's sake.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has its faults, but I'll be damned if I can name any of them. I'm too busy trying to beat my backflip record.\n\nIn a car.","February 10, 2015","true","3.2"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","28","38","3","0"

It reminds me of the classic Trackmania which I loved. It is really addictive trying to master a track by shaving off fractions of a second on every corner or just doing crazy stunts while avoiding over-the-top obstacles. Here is my experience with the Beta...\n\nDriving: Responsive, arcade controls for driving, jumping and flying. The game works well with a gamepad and provides sensible layouts for many controllers. It would be nice to have a button to reset the camera though. I like the way the car handles mid-air maneuvering. Sometimes collisions with obstacles can feel a little bit off. I also wish there were more obstacles that you can interact with, like the lasers - how about destructible surfaces or gravity fields?\n\nAesthetics: The world looks like it was partly inspired by things like Tron, but feels much more gritty. It features impressive lighting effects and a great soundtrack. You can get an amazing sense of speed through the visual and sound effects, combined with the track design.\n\nStory Mode: A good way to get accustomed to the controls and obstacles, as it has a very nice learning curve. It sets the mood with some awesome set-piece moments that don't feel tacked on.\n\nTracks: The track you choose determines if you are playing a race against the clock (Sprint), a hardcore platformer (Challenge), a Tony Hawk-like playground (Stunt) or all at once (Speed & Style - my favorite). The various tracks often allow multiple paths which require some skilled driving and creativity while making split-second decisions. If you get off-track, there is usually a way to recover. The ability to make your own tracks in the editor or download community ones gives this game longevity.\n\nMultiplayer: I have not tried the different multiplayer modes yet but I am eager to get into it now that the game is on Early Access.","December 9, 2014","true","25.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Not because anyone recommended it to me, but i stumbled upon it and thought. "hey. what the heck. looks cool". I couldn't have been more wrong.\nThis game is more than good. It's Absolutely Outstanding.\n\nFrom the moment I started the game I was greeted by disclaimers saying it was an early access game and may change. and to report bugs if I saw any. Off to the main menu I went and by goodness was I surprised on all the features it has!\nYou can change the graphics to black light, film grain. shell shaded. <- (which is my personal favorite) and you have a feature to pretty much bass boost your game into completely shaking the maps. which is. Let me tell you. Just the best.\n\nMy first few tries at racing were. pitiful to say the least. But wait.. racing would mean you have competition? In this game really the only competition is you. and multiplayer have you, but you feel so compelled to do better. to get gold.. (i've seen diamond but i'm just not that good yet) and I have to say that even though it's been years since i've played a racing game. I find this game to be one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. There is so much fluidity with all the functions of your car. and learning about them and hell. even mastering them makes you feel like a badass.\n\nThis game's artstyle is to die for. but the best part about this is that the music. dynamically changes the maps. not in obstacles or things it throws at you. but Interacting with certain colors. pulsing. and it's mesmerizing to say the least and albeit very distracting that it becomes an obstacle some in itself (not a bad thing mind you) and to top it all off it has VR support and you can add custom music, user made tracks. and even play splitscreen. all in an early access game.\n\nTL:DR Please buy this game. You will not regret it. It has something for everyone. <- i bought this game 1 day prior to this review. and haven't dropped it since.","May 10","true","20.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This may even be my favorite racer of 2014 (Although, to be fair, there weren't too many racers in 2014). The track editor seems really confusing to me, but apparently not to others because the tracks on workshop are ridiculous. Also, 3 hours may not seem like a lot of time for this game, but considering the short "campaign," most of it is workshop levels. Of course, keep in mind this is still an EA game and there are bugs (like being able to take advantage of flight and skip entire portions of track) but overall this is a fun, refreshing game.\n\nDisclaimer: I came into the game with absolutely no expectations. I had never heard of the studio or the previous game.\n\nSummary: Distance is a game that's reminicent of a combination of Trackmania and the Hotwheels stunt games. Even in this state, it's very polished. My one complaint thus far is the lack of content, however, like Trackmania, this game offers a full fledged track editor even this early in development. If you like survival racing games but you're concerned of the shortness of the campaign, wait until the full launch. If you like the aformented but enjoy creating content yourself/playing other player's content, just get this now.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay consists of survival racing, where you manuever your car around obstacles and flip the car to reach other surfaces. Very fast paced and fluid. Only complaint thus far is sometimes it felt like the car flipped too slowly, but it's minor. Also want to note the attention to detail here. When a lazer cuts the car in half, it actually feels like that half is missing and the car is considerably harder to drive.\n\nGraphics: Game looks pretty nice even now. There are more graphical options than most AAA titles that come to PC. Optimization is okay right now. On a 760, 3770, and 8GB of RAM, I'm getting 30-60 fps.\n\nStory: There is a story, but frankly I skipped the cutscenes.","December 12, 2014","true","5.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Named so, because that is the challange. Getting from point A to B. But really, so much more than that. Sure, you could say that time is the challange, or that it's other players in multiplayer, but really, it's yourself.\n\nThis game... I don't even know where to start. It's AMAZING. Most car-based games I've played are limited to racing, and driving on the GROUND. In this game, what even IS the ground? Sure, there's gravity, (most of the time) but you can drive freely on any flat or flat-ish surface you can get to. This game has NO invisible walls, no limits.\n\nMost games in Early Access are unfinished shadows of what they could be, lacking most gameplay, and just a proof of concept. This game is in a state that they could release it from beta, and it could be considered finished. Years of work have been put into this game, and I'm glad to have played it before it offically came out on steam.\n\nThe game has a level editor, and while it IS a bit tricky to use, it's limitless with what you can do. It has Workshop support, which means you have 100's more levels than the developers could make in the time they have. Already I've seen some pretty cool levels.  I've seen levels that look like Tron, and levels that looks like natural mountions.\n\nMy SINGLE complaint is the sorting system for the levels.

Were it not for my adrenaline-rushed self preservation instincts kicking in, I might have tried to land on one of the many cyber buildings dotting the landscape- in fact, i ended up doing just this by accident a few times during gameplay.\n\nThe campaign is still a work in progress, but I find that a short and sweet campaign for this game is the best ticket anyway. It doesn't explain much, and I'm still figuring out how I managed to "kill" the first boss, but I did find myself distracted several times throughout the first few levels, trying to read the signage and propaganda scattered across the map. Once again, it reminds me a lot of Tron, especially the internet levels, as it should.\n\nIn the background, you can see what might be planet Earth, but the geography is bizarre. In the distance I see what I can only assume are inhabited continents, but beneath there's only a maelstrom of some kind, with an ominous symbol in the middle that looks suspiciously like the "Alliance" symbol you encounter repeatedly through the game. Further on in the horizon, pillars are visible. What could they mean? Is this all a computer simulation, or is this our horrible future?\n\nBut if our eyes are real, how can mirrors be real?\n\n10/10, would go the Distance as many times as is automotively possible.","December 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","10","12","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dewdrop/recommended/233610/","dewdrop","Dew Drop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dewdrop/","189 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuality of early access game:\nVery high, the devs keep adding content and have the game already very polished from the get-go so you don't feel ripped off that it took them forever to finish the game.\nThis game has full workshop support!\n\nGlitches:\nTo be honest, it already feels like a finished game, it just has a few glitches here or there that are mostly User interface.\nThere IS currently a very obnoxious part of the game where you have to go to the workshop > collections > all collections and subscribe to all of them so the people hosting the multiplayer games can host pretty much anything.\nThis is the result of the fact that downloading host maps in-game is currently not possible.\n\nHave you played Nitronic Rush?\nYes?\nThen this is a better, faster, more polished version of that with multiplayer, fun new gametypes and the best damn level editor you've ever used.\n\nHaven't played Nitronic Rush?\nDistance is an (currently as of writing this) unfinished early access racing game by the digipen grads that made Nitronic Rush as their capstone project.\n\nGameplay:\nYou drive a car that seems to be a mix of an electronic sports car and a jet pack, as the car itself can not only fly but also has small thrusters on every section of the vehicle which are 100% necessary as the roads will end suddenly and this forces the player to literally jump, spin, and twist to another track section. The controls are tight and feel satisfying when you pull off a trick or make a perfect landing.\nIt's about going fast and avoiding MANY obstacles, which can range from pretty much anything and everything. If you get hit by a laser the game will remove parts of your vehicle realistic, and you can keep going to try and rebuild at the next checkpoint, it's often hilarious!\n\nGraphics:\nwow, just wow. The game is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen such amazing reflection (specular) mapping on anything in video games in, ever. The game has some CRAZY filters and lighting that results in areas having feeling to them. I.E. a VIBRANT red area that is very in your face with it's obstacles will make you tense up and concentrate as you dodge as much as you can. While a cool blue zone, even if it has more obstacles, might make the game feel a bit more relaxed.\nEven in multiplayer the game is very atmospheric, allowing creators of custom maps to be extremely creative.\n\nStory?\nThere IS a story, it's very abstract. Not as in it's trying to be artsy, instead it goes for a more vague, mysterious and atmospheric feel. Without spoiling anything, I think you'll enjoy the story if you like video games that don't shove the story down your throat. Do keep in mind, as it is early access, the story is not currently complete and only has about ten levels. Which will actually take you a good hour or so to complete them all, much longer if it's your first time playing it.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYes, it has multiplayer. Currently players cannot collide with each-other. Instead every player shows up as a real-time ghost, which surprisingly doesn't actually make the game less fun.\nThere are a few issues here or there unfortunately, as the physics for the game are connected to the frames-per-second, you may collide with walls or pieces of track even though you thought you landed just fine. Do keep in mind this has happened to me only two times in the over a hundred multiplayer races I’ve driven.\nThe other game modes are pretty fun too, reverse tag is just a big game of keep-away, It's pretty fun, and results in some silly moments.\n\nDifficulty:\nThis game is has a very subtle difficulty curve. It starts off easy and explains mechanics as you go by, then it gets surprisingly difficult. When you finally get used to the difficulty of the game it semi-mellows out to the point of making it easier but still challenging. Once you get good at it, you'll start trying new shortcuts and attempt tricks to skip parts of tracks. The custom maps however range from incredibly easy, to insane in how difficult they are. If you get a large amount of them and play with some people (or friends if you have those) you'll have a blast.\n\nConclusion:\nDistance is fun, REALLY fun. It breaks many of the assumptions we have for racing games and makes the game feel fresh and new with it's style and feel of originality. It's very atmospheric, and that personally is very appealing. The addition of multiplayer and custom map support is genius and makes the game feel fresh almost indefinitely. It may not be finished but it sure feels like a complete game at this point.\n\n9.5/10 One of my new favorite games. Can't wait for them to finish it!\n\n\nP.S. If you want to have a demo for this game, Nitronic Rush is the best way to do that, it's free; just Google it.","December 11, 2014","true","20.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I eagerly awaited early access, having been introduced to Nitronic Rush by one of my coworkers. My first playthough of the adventure mode left me stunned; in its incomplete state I still felt that I had just experienced a Portal game for the first time.\n\nAdventure mode ramps up the difficulty nicely, teaching you the skills you will need in multiplayer. After cutting your teeth on adventure mode, there are hundreds of community levels available on the workshop, and this is where the game is played. After earning a gold medal on all the official levels, and sampling the best that the workshop has to offer, it's time to start publishing your own levels. I've made six levels to date, and I have a seventh in works.\n\nThe Distance community is also extremely friendly and easy going :D\n","September 5, 2015","true","699.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Gameplay seems mundane at first but quickly increases in craziness. This game is more like an obstacle course than a traditional racing game, which is a lot of fun. Since its in early access, there aren't that many levels in the base game, but I've downloaded 100+ community made levels, most of which are absolutely phenomenal, so don't worry about a lack of content (and this is early access we're talking about).\n\nI highly recommend changing the control scheme to 'advanced' as soon as you load in, which allows you to move your car around mid air (sort of like in GTA V) without taking your thumb off the boost button.

Almost like TRON in terms of visual style. The techno soundtrack adds a very definite atmosphere and style that will propably either help you either hate or like this. I personally am mixed how to feel about this, I like the style and innovation, and for me the techno is no real deal breaker either, it adds to the genre. But there is something in this game that gives me an unnerving feeling. The levels are innovative but somehow it just does not feel enough in terms of longetivity or variety. And by longetivity I mean not how many tracks there are but the repetition gameplay wise. Your driving tracks, period. It never evolves beyond that. This is a bit like wipeout was on ps1 but somehow that game for me was more fun and entertaining than this one. This game looks and sounds really cool but I'm not really feeling it. Also there is this weird negativity to the general feeling of the game. Wipeout had this upbeat positive vibe. This feels like the opposite somehow. These are propably a matter of personal preference. I still recommend trying this one out. It's definitely either a love or hate type of game depending on your preference. I'm not really delving in to the details of this game because theres enough coverage of that. I just add my 2 cents in which is more about the way games make me feel, good or bad.

It has all the stuff that will keep you coming back for more, and for it's current stage in development, pretty much bug-free.\n\nThe game's mechanics are awesome - stuff that I've never seen in vehicle games before, such as your car getting parts sliced off wherever lasers pass through, and the ability to fly, flip, and drive upside down.\n\nThe inclusion of 4 players splitscreen, AND online multiplayer really makes this gem of a game stand out.\n\nThe best way to describe this game is probably TrackMania + Tron + Jet Car Stunts.\n\n\nIn my opinion, the only thing it's lacking is a battle mode (i.e, weapons). I understand that a lot of fans of the original Nitronic Rush want Distance to be very similar, but that's no reason not to add a separate battle mode - why not have the best of both worlds?\n\n\nIn all, definitely a "must own" in my books, and it's something that I'll always come back to for a quick 'fun' fix :)","March 6","true","37.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Some of the user tracks are a little iffy, with questionable layouts (there was walljump where the wall you're jumping to was bending away from you, which was no small annoyance, and another where you basically had to jump off the track, deploy wings, and then land back on the track slightly later because the walljump clearance was so small that you literally couldn't spin your car around unless it was perfect), but there are some good ones if you're willing to do some digging. Also, it plays your music for you, and since the devs have expressed an interest in increasing mod support (the way I understood it, at least), this is only gonna get better. As far as value for money goes, $22 CAD is a decent price if you like this genre of racing game, but I'd still recommend holding out for a Steam sale if one is reasonably close at hand.","June 28, 2015","true","29.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Nitronic Rush was basically Distance except with a different story, car, graphics, and music. Now the car mechanincs were exactly the same, this is obviously a good idea for Refract to do. I really liked the way Music played a big role in Nitronic Rush and it sorta does in Distance, though not as much. I can't tell if I miss the narrator from Nitronic Rush or not, it was pretty funny to hear him narrate all the tricks you did. ("Holy Teledo!"   "Sad Day!") Moving on, Distance is truly a unique and wonderful game, posing a challenge and new gameplay style. I haven't seen many "Survival Racing Games" Before, and Distance is a good one. Everything Feels really smooth and the levels are satisfying and Challenging at the same time, not to mention that multiplayer is a lot of fun. Even though the Adventure mode is really short, I can guarantee that you will have endless play time. This is because the game has a level editor, and "Trackmogrify", which is an element where you enter a word or phrase, and it generates a track for you to play.

It's not a bad game at all, but having owned it for the year it's been in early access, I was expecting more to be added I guess. I bought it wanting to see where it would go, and it hasn't really gone anywhere. It was kind of already done when it came out.\n\nI've had this for a year and all that's really been added is tweaking/bug fixes, workshop optimization, and new stuff for the level editor.\n\nThere hasn't really been anything major that's been added. All I can think of is a cockpit view and some new camera angles. And the ability to change how bright and intense the visual effects are. No new cars, no real customization like tricking out your ride, no new modes, no new mechanics. It's fun but you're just paying for community made content honestly. That's where the bread and butter is.\n\nIt's kind of like Trials Evolution in terms of base game + insane community created content. Only that game was finished when it was released.\n\nI guess I was just expecting this game to grow a lot more than it has.\n\nI wish there was a neutral option. It's a fine game, but my own disappointment due to my expectations has made me not want to recommend it. Maybe this will change when it's released. I guess judging it solely from a vanilla experience the answer is no.","December 28, 2015","false","10.1"," 73 of 134 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","73","134","6","8"

Why ? well we kinda seen it all... haven't we ?\nI mean.. what could they possibly do to impress us ?\n\nWell Distance did it...\nThe game features a fresh take on the trackmania recipe with pleasant Tron-ish graphics.\nThe soundtrack is ok but considering the way the actual game plays ...perhaps something a bit more "strong" would have been better.\nYou don't get to chose from X number of cars and have only one which is slightly customizable...a color here and a accent there. Strangely i never felt the need to change my car and i never felt like the game would benefit from a larger variety of vehicles.\n\nSo what is this game all about ?\nDriving as fast as you can and avoiding all obstacles as swiftly and as elegantly as you can.\nThe game features several game modes such as Sprint, Stunt, Speed and Style, Challenge etc...\nWhen it comes to multiplayer we have either split screen (up to 4 players, only one can use keyboard the rest have to use controllers, and in 2 player mode you can chose vertical or horizontal split screen) And then we have the online component for up to 6 players.\nThe game includes a full and very complete level editor and steam workshop support (for which you can already download over 100 tracks). Obviously this can ad a ton of replay value, and if you fancy yourself a hot-shot designer maybe you will make the next "epic track".\nThere is even a single player campaign which is used as a tutorial and introduction to this futuristic high tech world (full of sharp/pointy/blunt death-traps that are in your way!).\nDuring this campaign you will learn how to barrel roll, fly, hover and glide in zero gravity.\nThe games main mechanic is the boost. There is no recharge time for it like in most games but you do need to be careful not to overheat or else you go BooM! There are some gates which will either partly or fully cool and regenerate your car for all the damage taken up to that point.\nSomething i really liked was the way the HUD is done, it is mostly integrated into the game elements, which dose lots for the overall feel of the game. There are some who do not like this aspect because at times the HUD is not visible. In my opinion this is not a big deal because a game such as this should be played by.. "feel" if that makes any sens...\nAnother design element i really appreciate is the way vibration is done for the 360 controller. This is used to GRADUALLY warn you about how overheated your car is. This means that you can keep your eyes on the track and off your rear bumper.\nWhen it comes to the ugly "early access" tag i would go as far as to say that Distance dose not really need it. The single player campaign is not complete and the mouse is not functional in all menus... but these are all the early access "scars" i could find in my time with the game.\nI can go on and on about Distance but i don't wanna bore you to much so let's wrap-it up.\n\n"The Good"\n-The Track Editor- is not exactly user friendly but its a very complete tool\n-The Graphics- although graphics are a rather subjective topic in my opinion\n-Gameplay- rock solid, pure gaming, no nonsense\n-HUD Design- this is the way a HUD should be done in modern games, yes it has some issues, but its a big step forward from the classic and outdated designs.\n\n"The Bad"\n-Only 6 players in online multiplayer...How Could You ?!\n\n"The Meh"\n-Soundtrack- I believe there are much better options for a game that plays like this...but again this is a subjective topic by nature.\n\nWhat else is there to say ?\nDrop the clutch, boost to max, juke the spikes and i'll see you at the finish line...if you get there ;)\nFor a clearer view you can watch my first impressions video :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MCy1uIvL5o&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","December 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

As some of you know this is from a concept that was created in college by the guys, it was called nitronic rush. After what they have achieved from there to Distance is particularly amazing!\n\nMy first thoughts\nI had in my mind that this was early access (just released as early access on december the 10th). As soon as i got into playing the visuals are spot on, the gameplay is extremely fun and addicting and the overall concept is great. Yes, then i discovered the mechanics: Boosting, jumping, flying and wall jumping; crazy stuff like that!\n\nTHE POTENTIAL\nI can't even begin to explain the potential this game has, at the moment it actually is decently polished but not many official levels and progression pointers and goals, i'd imagine that to be fun. But there is the community making levels and there is a powerful level editor, it's nice that it has that. There is the Adventure mode which is short at the moment (and there isn't a story to it really). Arcade mode which has various gamemodes in it to play your community levels and official levels.\n\nSo, do i reccomend this game?\nYes, i do. If you'd like to support it at it's current state i'd definetley reccomend for you to purchase it. It also has multiplayer and a friendly community which is great!\n\nSIMILAR GAMES: Trackmania, LittleBigPlanet Karting.","December 22, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Figglefrabble/recommended/233610/","Figglefrabble","Manthony Higgs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Figglefrabble/","197 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDistance is an experimental survival racing game made by Refract, who previously released Nitronic Rush during their time at Digi Pen.  Nitronic Rush can be downloaded for free at http://nitronic-rush.com/.  If you are at all interested in Distance, play Nitronic Rush first, as they are very similar.\n\nIn Distance, you control a kickass sci fi car with thrusters, wings and a giant rocket booster.  You race through digital, TRON Legacy styled cities filled with lasers, buzzsaws and angry computer viruses.  While the new art style is very pretty, some clarity is lost behind all the bloom and neon lines.  In Nitronic Rush, obstacles and hazards were always a very bright red, while in Distance they can and often will be a similar color to the rest of the track, making it somewhat harder to see them at a Distance (heh). In addition, the world seems more lifeless compared to the 70's TRON world of Nitronic Rush.  While this seems to be a deliberate choice on Refract's part, given that Story Mode seems to focus on an abandoned world, this doesn't change the fact that the levels are rather sterile and samey.  With the exception of one song, most of the soundtrack, while great, is also very similar which is an odd change after Rush's varied beats.\n\nWhile the game is still in beta, it does have a slight lack of content when compared to Rush.  There are more Story levels, but fewer Challenge levels, and no Hardcore levels.  The overall level design is a bit more tame and safe than Rush's was.  There is both a track editor and a random track generator to make up for this, however, and many of the community tracks are incredible (and a good deal tougher than the rather easy official levels).\n\nThere are a few other game modes besides the races.  Stunt has you doing mad tricks in an arena to score big points, Speed and Style is a mix of Stunt and Sprint, Reverse Tag is a game of keep away/king of the hill, and Soccer is, well, soccer.  Stunt is rather boring due to the lack of an announcer, another feature missing from Nitronic Rush.  In addition, several stunts possible in Rush are missing in DIstance.  Speed and Style is good fun, as you have to win the race AND pull of tricks to win.  Reverse Tag is a fun game of wits, though the official arenas are all either too big or too small.  I recommend the community level "Pipe Plaza" for this mode.  Soccer is a mess, the ball is nearly impossible to control and  the levels are a cluttered nightmare.  It might be good for some couch laughs with 4 players (Distance features Split Screen for all modes) but should be avoided in smaller groups.\n\nNow, despite these complaints, I still highly recommend this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a racing game in quite some time, and is beautifully creative.  Even if you don't like traditional racing games, give Distance (or Nitronic Rush) a shot.  They're very different from the competetion.\n\nTo finish this review up, I'll make a list of little things that you probably don't care about\n\n-Default control scheme on controllers is flawed, thange LB to boost like it was in Rush\n-Bring back the announcer\n-Bring back wheelies and side wheelies\n-While you're at it, just port all of Nitronic Rush's levels into Distance","July 25, 2015","true","58.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Not only are all of these aspects well done, but they are also fantastically blended together - they compliment each other.

It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.\n\nThe Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the "Survival" or "Speed and Style" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.\n\nIt's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem. But as it stands though, the map-making scene isn't as vibrant as, say, most of Valve's games or Unreal Tournament, so the Workshop might feel barren, at least until the game picks up in popularity and creative level designers.\n\nThat said, this game, frankly, deserves a lot more of that popularity, because it's just an absolutely fun game to play, with the bonus of being a great looker with a damn fine soundtrack. Refract might be one of the new Indie kids on the block, but they are certainly no amateurs at making a great racing game.\n\nDistance is worth your time, your money, and your commitment to beating your own and your friend's high scores. In this day and age of more realistic, simulated racing games, it's time we had a game like this to come along and remind us we're playing video games for the overwhelming, exciting, and expansive possibilities of the medium and not needing to be bound by realistic settings, physics, and speeds.\n\nSo, can you survive the distance? You should jump behind the wheel and find out.","November 27, 2015","true","36.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

On the one hand -- excellent initial idea, simple but very "tasty" visuals, catchy gameplay and absolutely gorgeous soundtrack. On the other -- there's definitely very little of in-house made content, and this is the most serious issue.\n\nWhen I played Distance, it reminded of Trackmania in a way, an old one, without all the bells and whistles -- a 2007 Nations, for example, and while the physics here are, well, rudimentary -- the feeling is pretty much the same. But while Trackmania was intended to play online, it still had heaps of content for single player mode. In case of Distance, I was finished with its Adventure Mode in less than an hour.\n\nOnline mode is something else. Well, that if you'll be able to find public server. And if you'll be able to connect to it. Because there's no official servers or dedicated server software, people should host sessions from their own computers, and since pretty much everybody are behind a NAT these days, it makes a task of finding suitable server really difficult.\n\nPorts are okay at the very least -- as Linux gamer, I'm very pleased with how smooth and troubleless game runs on my not-so-fast-by-novadays-standarts-rig. As far as I know, Mac version runs pretty much the same.\n\nIf eventually campaign will be like four or five hours long, then I guess my money were well spent. I'd like to believe that this is how things will turn up.

The 'Adventure Mode' which is the campaign at the moment is quite short with only 11 maps which took me just under 2 hours to complete, but these maps were very good at introducing me too the game slowly and made the learning curve very small while still teaching me many new mechanics in each level. In addition to the Adventure mode there is Arcade Mode which allows you to replay levels over and over to get better times in both Official and Community maps.\n\nThe community maps in this game are very exciting and just as good as the official maps. Many dedicated people frequently make and upload new maps to the steam workshop which is great as it keeps the game new and fresh. All these community maps are playable Online aswell as single player.\n\nThe online mode is great, although there is usually only 2-3 servers up at a time with a maximum of 6 players you can easily set up your own through port-fowarding. With friends this game can become very competetive, even if you dont have any friends that buy this game with you the community is awesome, you meet new players everyday aswell as playing again with the ones you met the day before. Everyone is extremely supportive on those levels where you are the last to finish and everybody is spectating you but you just can't get past a bit, they say what you should try and even if you DNF you have the next map to beat them on.\n\nOverall it is a great game with or without friends even though it is currently in early access and i cant wait to see the future additional content to be realesed with the updates to come.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\n- Fun\n- Great learning curve with the Adventure Mode guiding you through\n- High mechanical skill cap\n- Competetive\n- 5 different game modes\n- Sprint (racing)\n- Speed and Style (racing but you do flips to get more points)\n- Challenge (racing or short very difficult tracks)\n- Stunt (do flips and get points)\n- Trackmogrify (random gen levels)\n- Supportive and nice community\n- loads of community levels uploaded\n\nCons:\n- Small player base leads to only 2-3 servers at a time (unless you host your own)\n- Is in Early Access","January 7","true","23.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The question whether you'd like it is depending on your taste of games. It's a racing genre that needs more explanation.\nSo here is my review with a comparison to the older, yet free game "Nitronic Rush".\n\nThe control of the car is great and is heavily improved upon since Nitronic Rush, where you'd fling around carelessly by accident (though this was a lot of fun). Small turns in Distance are not as easy to make though. A controller is nice to use in case you want to aim for a nice time on a track.\n\nThe story mode, despite being minimal, has an enjoyable exploration feeling; much like it's earlier version. Shame it's not finished yet, but it looks to be promising. Playing this with some friends by giving each other the controller or keyboard is a lot of fun too.\n\nThis all is nothing I was worried about when it came to purchasing Distance. What worried me and still slightly does is the replayablity of the game. As of now Distance, does not have this so much. Nitronic Rush was free and for me the joy was kinda out of it when I completed the storyline. You've kind-of seen it all by the time you're done with it. Distance's multiplayer aspect improves on this a lot, so does the custom levels and level-editor. If all this to improve it makes the game worth the price tag of 19,99 euro's; I'm not so sure.\n\nEventually after fully experiencing the Story Mode the game turns from survival exploration racing to precision racing. It's kind of the same thing as Trackmania actually. Although there's more control over your car and it's set in a whole different setting. If you're much into precision racing; I see you'll have a decent amount of replayability with this game. Yet if you're only in for the exploration, I think you're through the game rather quickly.\n\nGet this game if you like precision racing, otherwise wait for a 40% discount. 33% works if you're desperate to try it.\n\n:^)7.6*/10*grade improves as the game improves","February 21, 2015","true","19.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","4"

This game has brought the joy of racing back to me for the first time since Burnout 2-4, and it has a lot to do with the similar philosophy of expecting player to crash (that's part of the fun!) and letting them get right back to the challenge at hand as soon as possible.\n\nThe adventure mode, even in its current limited form is a non-stop ride of thrills, stunning visuals, and creative expression through racing. The first time I opened my car's wings and took flight I sat slack-jawed for much of the rest of the level and only stopped to laugh with pure un-fettered joy.\n\nThis game wants to challenge you, but it does not demand perfection. It wants to teach you, but it won't always hold your hand either. It wants to engage your curiousity and your creativity, in an activity that is so often highly regimented and finely tuned.\n\nThe community levels (so far) make more of a return to the familiar 'hard for hardness sake' design and don't always have such well placed checkpoints, but with the mechanics present in the game and the tools available I expect to find plenty of maps like the developer's who balance out elements of free running in a car (carkour?) and the already present intense eye-bleeding gauntlet runs.","June 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is absolutely gorgeous! I had to buy it the moment i played it in my friends PC. The visual, the gameplay, even the credits is a masterpiece! If i had to choose the top 3 racing games i've played this decade, i'm sure Distance would have made it second or even first position.\nEnough with the compliments, let's talk more about the game.\nDistance is a futuristic racing game like nothing else. You are in control of a car that can boost, jump and fly (yeah, it's a transform). The game has a storyline that feels a bit artistic. It has no narrative, just you, the stages and the musics (that i have to say, it fits just perfect with the game). Since it is still Early Access, it isn't complete yet, but i can already see it developing really good!\nThe arcade mode seems to be really good, even better when played with a friend or in online mode. And now with custom tracks made by the community, i can't even describe how big is the potential of this game.\nBUT, it has it cons (for now, it might change in the future). In current stages, there is no bots in arcade mode. I feel like this is needed in every racing game, mainly in this game! I want to play the arcade mode when my friends aren't avaliable and online mode isn't quiet what i'm looking for everytime.\nThe storyline NEEDS a narrative. Sometimes you feel a little lonely when traveling through the stages and the music is low. The storyline of this game shows potential and a narrative like the one in Portal games would fit just perfectly.\nIf i would recommend this game to everyone in this planet? OF COURSE! This game needs more attention! I would easily pay 60 bucks for this game when it gets out of early access. It really looks like a AAA game.\n\nPlus, spin my car in the air and land it like a boss IS SO DAMN COOL! 10/10","June 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It is a rare game that is exactly what you see in the trailer.\n\nThe level editor deserves special praise for being the one of the most powerful and well-designed level editors I've ever used.

It's still in Early Access, but the experience (in my opinion) is already extremely satisfying. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes or for hours on end. Currently, there isn't a whole lot of official content, but the amount of community maps is absurd, and most of them are amazing. For now, the (still in progress) story mode serves as a kind of tutorial which runs you through the official maps.\nWhen you go online, there usually aren't many (or any) hosts, yet invariably, within ~3 minutes of hosting your own server, people will quickly begin to join. I don't know why people are reluctant to host matches, but they're there, and "if you host it, they will join." Furthermore, the community is friendly and helpful.\nThis game is perfect to get your mind off of things, as you'll quickly be engrossed in the satisfying mechanics/gameplay. It has a strange ability to demand your attention, present you with mass chaos and intense gameplay, yet somehow be very relaxing at the same time. I've never been big on racing games, but I wholeheartedly recommend this game for people who have a need for speed and people who love skill & reflex-based games\n\n","August 21, 2015","true","69.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After a while It felt like I was doing something I was not soposed to be doing, and the hazards that appered were incompleat, like the track was tring to stop me, but the sounds that the track was makeing was what set the mood the most, every time a obsticle showed up it sounded like the track was screming. Then I just went on past feeling like I was doing something bad, but then out of no where, lazers and the dubstep was back like it was fine , but wanted me dead.

It's fast, it's flashy, it's gorgeous and it's as casual or hardcore as you like. Its main game mode, Sprint, is all about getting the best possible time to the end of a track, while dynamic obstacles are in your way, including lasers, buzz saws, etc. Community-wise, it is the follow-up to the outstanding Nitronic Rush, which you should try if you're not sure about Distance. (It's free.) Distance has a great community already, churning out several maps a week. That fixes all that I would have labeled damning about Nitronic Rush. Additional improvements are a better physics engine, updated graphics, customizable vehicle appearance, etc. Just an amazing game, and the multiplayer is very stable.\n","January 13","true","179.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also, the game has enough content (on it's own and with the level editor/workshop) already to justify a purchase and constant updates so a very good Alpha/Beta release.

There are other, better reviews that discuss game mechanics and what it has to offer, so I'm going to skip that and ask:\n\nDo any of you, like me, remember the show Acceleracers?\n\nFormed by Hotwheels, this was an animated series that was, in my opinion, one of the best to existance. Basically, the top racers from around the world are chosen to form a small group known as the Acceleracers. They use a portal to warp to other dimensions with prebuilt tracks that they can race on. Each of these dimensions had a different feel and driving technique needed to master it. If you got to the end portal before the one hour time limit and before anyone else, you gained an acceletron; a small card-like device that gives your car "superpowers", and is in line with the theme of the dimension that you gained it from.\n\nAnyway, the series was insane not because of the tension between the human racers, evil robot racecars that tried to kill them, a secret society formed by the main character's own dad, and the amazing plot, but because of the stunts that all the cars pulled off in the show. Vert, the main character, is known for his car's jets being able to give him a boost upward, effectively "jumping". Additionally, cars were souped up with things like nitrox (a glorified version of nitro) and things that allowed them to fly, shoot a grappling hook, etc.\n\nOne of the most memorable things is when, in the final movie, was when Vert was directed by Tesla (the guy overseeing all the human drivers) to go through one final test. I'm not going to spoil it, but anyone who's seen it should know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's a 1 on 1 race through every single one of the dimensions, and the thing is that Vert doesn't have any acceletrons. So, it's his pure memorization and skill that he needs to speedrun through the entire Accelerace before time runs out.\n\nThis game captures this perfectly.\n\nAlmost every game, I imagine myself as Vert driving, nimbly avoiding all obstacles, using boosters to jump, and maintaining a rediculous high speed while knowing that one slip up could destroy me and my car.\n\nAdditionally, in the series, there were always memorable moments of cars getting wiped out, flying out into rocks, smashing themselves off the road while the other cars kept it cool and just drove like life depended on it (which it did). There was even one scene where a car was lasered in half, and cars flying off the edge of the narrow track into oblivion. Sound familiar?\n\nAnyway, it was not the look or feel of the game so much as the fact that I had finally discovered an accurate representation of Acceleracers I had always been looking for. Whoever knows the show will be amazed at how many moments you've thought, "wow, just like Acceleracers", I know I have.\n\nNot many will know what it is though, I'm sure of that. But anyone who does, this is the game you've been waiting for.","February 8","true","36.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","20"

The sequel to Nitronic Rush is fast, intense, and a joy to play.\n\nThe graphics in this game are glorious. The tron-like style is perfect for this type of game and the amount of color on the screen is a treat for your eyes. The cars look great, with the ability to edit the car's color and glow - making each unique to the certain player when playing online. The graphics are also optimized well, making it run on lower-end machines.\n\nDistance at it's core is a survival racing game. Throughout the levels, you can do things like jump, boost, twist and fly. The levels have a directed path, but with the ability to fly - it adds an extra element of exploration and freedom. The game as of now has a strong amount of game modes. Adventure is Distance's story mode, it's short and doesn't really have a clear story; the levels are well designed and are fun. It's more so of a tutorial the first few levels which is good for those who have no clue what they are doing. In these levels, there are ramps, lasers, twisting roads, sawblades, and other things there to kill and confuse you. It requires a solid amount of skill, the boost has the ability to overheat and flying requires boost to actually use. It's a nice balance that doesn't feel restrictive. The sense of speed is fantastic, speeding past 3 lasers then twisting, dodging a pole and then flying over the sawblades just making it towards the regeneration checkpoint is exhilarating. There are also a bunch of other game modes as well - Sprint (time trial), Speed and Style (Time + Tricks), Challenge (Mini Challenge Levels), and Stunt (Tricks); there is also a reverse tag mode that I have yet to play. The amount of game modes are fresh and give players more to play. Lastly, is the integration of Steam Workshop. The community have already made some fantastic levels, one highlight is the replica of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart. The amount of levels and the quality of those are only going to grow. It's a match made in heaven.\n\nThe audio is solid. It's sharp and clear. Where the game's sound shine though is the music. It immerses you in the game and only boosts the intense nature of the game.\n\nThe controls are extremely smooth and responsive. I personally use a gamepad. If you do choose to use a gamepad, try using the triggers for both boost and jump as things can get awkward sometimes.\n\nWith the amount of developer-made levels, gamemodes, online play, and community levels - there is tons to do already. The best part is, the game is going to keep on growing. If you live fast, survival racing games, you must get your hands on this. At $22 (CDN), it's a steal.\n\nPROS\n+Fast\n+Challenging\n+Plays Great\n+Optimized\n+Responsive Controls\n+Steam Workshop\n+Gamemodes\n+Little Latency (Online)\n+Great Music\n+Colorful and Beautiful\n+Friendly Community\n+Accessible Level Editor\n\nCONS\n-No Story (As of yet)\n-Difficulty might be tough for some\n-Glitches\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS: 9.5/10\nGAMEPLAY: 9.5/10\nAUDIO: 9/10\nCONTROLS: 8.5/10\nREPLAY VALUE: 10/10\n\nDISTANCE: 9.3/10\nRecommendation: Buy it at full price.\nOne Word Description: "Exhilarating"","December 12, 2014","true","6.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattjeanes/recommended/233610/","mattjeanes","Dr. Mate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattjeanes/","392 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbsolutely fantastic. I loved Nitronic Rush and Team Nitronic (now Refract Studios) have definitely lived up to, and gone way past the fun and excitement of it with Distance. I've been in since the beta, and so far I've loved every bit of it.\n\nWhile this game is in early access, I highly recommend it even if the game never updates again (which it will by the way, Refract are cool guys)\n\nFirst, the level editor: Steam Workshop support and a built in level editor is a game changer for any game, and this one especially. The editors advanced features reminds me of such things as Autodesk Maya, but can be simplified down to the Portal 2 in-game map creator. Tracks in the editor snap together and can be automatically resized. They act like splines and the track automatically is generated along them, so you do not have to worry about that at all. Everything is very easy yet advanced at the same time which will make some really brilliant levels (and has already infact).\n\nMultiplayer: This was the most requested feature from Nitronic Rush, and they've implemented it right down to the core of the game. It is done extremely well and I couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe auto downloading of workshop levels to clients who dont have). It's really fun with mates or strangers on any of the modes: sprint, speed and style, challenge and reverse tag (shame they removed the football gamemode though).\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere of the game is clear from the start and I think it works really well. There's less of the really bright colours from Nitronic and the announcer is gone (for now at least). The world is dark and gloomy but mixed with flashing lights and exciting music makes for an interesting yet enjoyable experience. The soundtrack itself is incredible, Torcht and the team really have outdone themselves this time, it's much better than Nitronic Rush's music (and for the record, I loved Nitronic Rush's music).\n\nThere are only a few things that I think should be worked. The first is optional realtime portals, since right now they work like a static 360* image wrapped around it - but don't get me wrong they look great and aren't noticeable at high speeds, of course this should be off by default and as an advanced graphics option like realtime reflections since they would require a beefy GPU. Another thing would be mod support for custom gamemode types. My biggest issue currently is no mouse support at all, not even for menus - but I'm sure it's planned (we are in Early Access right now, after all), but these are more like feature requests than actual issues - and I'm certain Refract has more up their sleeve for us, so we'll see.\n\nConclusion: Get this game if you love any of these:\nA. Arcade racers\nB. Splitscreen games\nC. Sci-Fi games\nD. Racers\nE. Playing tag with your friends\nF. Games with an amazing soundtrack\nG. Calm driving\nH. Exciting driving\nI. Polished games\nJ. Multiplayer racing with friends\nK. Multiplayer racing with not friends\nL. Nitronic Rush\nM. Ex-DigiPen students\nN. Refract Studios\n\nOkay I'll stop now, but seriously, get this game - you will not regret it.","December 9, 2014","true","37.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But the first few stages are tutorials getting you accustomed to the game. Even though the game never actually gets any faster, the obstacles thrown in front of you creates a very real feeling of speed. Looking back at my LP, it does seem slow, but when I was playing, it was hectic.\n\nThere is a nice magnetic grip to the car. It's not way overpowered, it's tuned very nicely and helps with all of the crazy go-nuts car flipping to perpendicular roadways. I've already seen some speed runs and I'm excited to see what comes of it.\n\nThere are already UGC for the levels!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/workshop/ Which is NUTS!  Really cool that there is so much UGC on day one when the game launches.  Easily has to be some kind of record. I toyed around with the level editor at the end of my LP and I have no idea what I'm doing, but it seems fairly simple after you get the hotkeys situated in your head.\n\nLastly, I want to mention that there is a very real kernel of a story present in Distance.  Which is kind of odd, because you usually don't expect stories in racing games.

Maybe Trials Evolution but this game by far is better than that game. Distance brings the intense back to racing. I'm so use to racing on some real life tracks but Distance is so much more better than that. When you very first play it and can be a little difficult but once when you know what you are doing then it ends up being the greatest. I really feel like a game like this can really help your reaction to stuff around you while playing driving games. Probably only downfall is that you only got one car and it sounds like it doesn't have a engine. Probably in the future I would like to see something like that but other than those 2 downfalls this game by far is the best racing game on Steam and I am so glad to get this game in the Early Access stage so I can see this game progress.

Throughout the adventure you seem to move from a potentially busy vibrant city into a dark lost society. If you put your imagination to it I am sure you can come up with some interesting scenarios as to what happened to this world!\n\nArcade:\nArcade mode is where it really gets interesting. There are a few modes to choose from:\n\nSprint: Basically get to the end of the track as quickly as possible to get your name on the global scoreboards. Go through checkpoints to prevent the car from overheating. Reset if you screw up too badly and push yourself to the limit to gain the fastest time possible! (this mode counts towards global leaderboards).\n\nStunt: Try to do as many flips, flights and wall rides as possible within the time limit to gain the greatest score. This is played in an arena mode with plenty of ramps and heights to get the maximum amount of flips in before that inevitable landing, just be sure to land upright or the subsequent landing may be more of an explosion!\n\nReverse Tag: There is an orb which must be collected. Each player will compete to steal the orb from the other player. Whoever can keep the orb for the longest time will win. This is played in an arena style map which has plenty of cheeky little areas to try and trip your competitors up.\n\n\nWorkshop:\nFrom the date of writing there are over 200 community created tracks to try out. There are different tracks designed for each individual mode. Each track varies in length and difficulty with some sprints taking less than a minute, to first time tries clocking in at over 10 minutes.\n\nOne problem with the workshop currently is everyone must have downloaded the community maps themselves, they don't just download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a "subscribe to all mods" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.\n\nTrack Editor:\nThe game ships with its own in game track editor which provides all the tools you need to create some really exciting / wacky tracks which you can then upload to the Steam workshop and let others race and rate. There is massive room for some truly exciting and unique track experiences.\n\nLeaderboards:\nThe leaderboards are what help to make this game what it is. You can see times set by the top 1000 in the global community but also filter down to personal best times and friends.\nIf like me you want to be at the top of your friends leaderboards you should definitely give this game a try!\n\nController:\nThe front of Steam says the game has partial controller support although while using my Xbox controller it seemed to work 100% fine, I was able to re-bind keys however I liked, vibration function works no problems.\n\nIf you prefer to use the keyboard then this is fine too, again it has 100% re-bind capabilities.\n\n---------  CONCLUSION ---------\n\nAs mentioned at the start this is the best Early Access I have played in a long time. It works flawlessly without any crashes and very few if any bugs. One issue I have noticed is when watching another person finish a race it can get stuck playing the same loop, however this isn't game breaking and when they finish / the timer runs out the game will continue as usual.\n\nOne small problem with the community maps is every person wanting to race online must have individually downloaded the maps. They don't download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a "subscribe to all mods" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.\n\nThe game is still in beta and already I would say 8.5/10 I can't give it more because the adventure mode is not yet finished and the issues with online downloading of maps. But it is well on its way to becoming a fantastic game which could give hours of fun and frustration!\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxq5m4A3hVk","December 17, 2014","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This review was written as of 11/12/14. the game may have changed since then. As a spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, one of my favourite racing/driving games, I imagine it will be great when it's finished. Heck, it's great right now.\n\nThe story isn't done yet, but some of the elements I've seen in its current state are very promising.\n\nThe level design in this is pretty good so far, but I feel most of the levels are tutorial-level of difficulty. It would be good to see the next levels added have a higher difficulty.\n\nI've tested this with an xbox controller, and keyboard/mouse. Both seem to do the job well, but I do hope they add mouse support for menus sometime soon.\n\nThe graphics in this game look pretty amazing in their current state.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is great, and if it is going to be in any way similar to nitronic Rush, it can only get better.\n\nThis game supports the workshop, so once more people good with game design get on board  in the community you can be sure there won't be a shortage of levels to play.\n\nWhile this is an early access game, I do feel that the developers have proven themselves to be very competent and not just in it for a money grab. They dd private betas beforehand, and have already developed Nitronic Rush. I'm looking forward to the final product.\n","December 11, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I saw this game a while back when the Kickstarter was first started and I was hyped, however after a long while I lost track of it and forgot it altogether, imagine my surprise when a week ago I saw it on Steam, I immediately got hyped again and man I got to say I'm not disappointed. While it's still beta and it shows (the occasional physics glitch out or random death) I've really enjoyed the first two hours I've spent playing through the campaign.\n\nFirst starting out I got immediately reminded of Nitronic Rush mostly because of the visuals are very similar however visuals aside this one defiantly is worth the cash, the soundtrack features some of the best electronica I've heard in a good while and I do hope they sell it on steam sometime soon, however while music helps make a good game better the gameplay is the ultimate decider of worth and as I said previously this is worth every penny. The gameplay though similar to Nitronic Rush is much quicker and a lot more precise and I felt a lot more in control of the car however I would highly recommend playing this with an Xbox controller or a gamepad of your choice as it will make the button presses and general control a lot easier. Finally the visuals, this game looks stunning and it's pretty much like a racing game out of Tron, the heavy use of neon with lines going down the car, track and objects gives it a pretty amazing atmosphere all while the background pulses alongside the beat giving a bit more character to the world around you.\n\nNow, all that said I've got my problems with the game. While the driving is more precise when the car goes airborne being limited to just roll and pitch makes it just as frustrating as Nitronic Rush was and I can't help but feel the game would be just that little bit more epic with the ability to save yourself without having to fly out of a potential death and break the flow of speed. Finally I miss the old engine sound from Nitronic Rush, the car itself is missing the punch of sound the rest of the game so gloriously has and though it looks cool it's too quiet. Those two problems aside I adore this game already and I can't wait to see what's added later on, buy it if you have the cash because it's already worth it.\n\nFox out.\n","December 9, 2014","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The current build of the game under review (beta 4139), though only in Early Access on Steam - does contain PLENTY of content to keep gamers busy. The beta version of Distance houses a pretty barebones story mode called "Adventure." It definitely IS an adventure, and there is some story to soak up here - though not a whole lot. The beginning narrative introduces us to the idea of the protagonist - which is some kind of sentient platform-mobile that looks like a car. I say looks like a car: because you'll find out over the course of the "adventure" that you have a pretty substantial range of mobility options at your disposal. As with any platformer packing some advanced mechanics, Distance starts off by treating you like a toddler. You'll have an accelerate button and be able to steer... and that's about it. But the savvy driver is soon abundantly rewarded with wave after wave of new obstacles and mechanics with which to bypass them. You'll learn how to boost right away in order to get over certain sized gaps that you wouldn't normally be able to traverse. You'll then find out that your sentient platform-mobile can sprout some wings from either side and leisurely fly in any direction. This adds a HUMONGOUS amount of range to the options you have in conquering some of the tougher challenges, although I was both disappointed and understanding when I found out that flight would occasionally be deactivated in order not to break certain difficulty barriers in Adventure mode. Additionally, boost and flight work off of the same meter, and allowing this meter to fill causes you to hear an "Overheat" alarm. Overheating too long causes an explosion and a reset from the previous checkpoint. Luckily, however, checkpoints are very liberally placed throughout each map in Adventure mode.\nWithout spoiling any details of the very barebones "story", which is really more of a setting than anything, I would like to say that there is an underlying horror vibe present in this dystopian neon wasteland - but it's cool, and doesn't feel too heavy-handed or like any conceits were made in order for it to make it into the game.\nAt the abrupt end of the included 10 or so levels of the "remember, it's beta" story mode, you'll find that you feel prepared to march straight into some of the other gameplay modes Distance has to offer.\n\nJust in the beta version of the game, there is a huge amount of replay value already present. Distance offers a pretty well thought-out, though basically what you'd expect multiplayer mode that allows groups of (currently) up to 6 players to go all Sonic the Hedgehog in maps, either: created by the developers, created by the community using the in-game level editor, or generated by inputting "seeds" into the "trackmogrification" tool: which randomly generates levels based on strings of letters. Each of these categories offer immense replayability and are sure to keep anyone coming back again and again since the game provides such a high-level of "Wow, that was so cool" moments.\nMultiplayer is purely racing. There are several modes, such as a tag mode, a challenge mode, and a sprint mode. Tag mode consists of players trying to be "it" as long as possible, challenge mode consists of trying to clear tons of obstacles with no checkpoints turned on, and sprint mode is just good old classic "race-to-the-finish." Each of these modes is pretty spectacular, though the game misses out on achieving near-Mario Kart levels of competitive frustration since there is no collision detection between vehicles. You can see everyone else alongside you on the courses - you can even see when they SPLAT right into a barrier that popped up out of the ground while they confidently sped past at 500 miles per hour, but you can't bump into them at all. It's the equivalent of playing with a bunch of ghosts. That small complaint aside, the multiplayer is still very engaging - and the inclusion of text chat between participants allows for some nice banter in between matches. One glaring omission, however, is that there is no option when creating a multiplayer lobby on or offline to disable the platform-mobile's "plane" function. [EDIT: There is an option to disable flight, but it must be selected at the time of level creation rather than by the server host!] This created a situation for me where a room full of people called me a "track-skipper" because I flew from one tricky portion of the map to another (the equivalent of using a mushroom in Mario Kart to speed through rough terrain for a shortcut). Sure, this is probably common sense for most people, but I used the tools at my disposal, given by the game, and then found that this was looked down on. For good reason too. In some cases, because of the layout of a track - an opponent could finish a race in 30 seconds while the rest of us trudged on for a full 2 minutes, simply because he found an opening to "skip-track" to the exit. [EDIT 2: I have been assured by members of the Distance online community that "track-skipping" is very much a welcome part of the multiplayer experience as I originally hoped.] This, however, was a very small hassle - and the community seemed to be understandingly aware that the omission of an option to turn off flight in these multiplayer lobbies is an oversight simply not implemented in the beta phase of Distance.\nAlso, worthy of mention is that aside from the online multiplayer aspect, there is also the "highly coveted among PC gamers" option to play in splitscreen offline.\n\nAfter you've taken the community-created tracks for a spin, you may feel compelled to try your own hand at creating an amazing course filled with danger and explosions - and, thankfully, Distance includes a vast level editor - simple enough to get started in without much training, and advanced enough that you could basically create your own standalone story with the tools at your disposal. If you thought with the advent of Super Mario Maker that maybe an F-Zero Maker was around the corner - I hate to burst your bubble; but Distance may be the closest you ever come to realizing that dream.\n\nLastly, this experience is a visual delight and both audio and video build off of one another. The buildings pulsate in vibrant color to the resounding beats of the techno soundtrack. The environment moves in a showcase of sublime aural rhythm. I did notice that the boost sound coming from the platform-mobile was a little loud and kind of whiny when it hits top speed. Textures are clean throughout and obstacles on the track ahead of you are easy to see - even when they're flying at you in what seems to be an instant. There were a couple of times I felt a little turned around, but with clear visual cues - I found myself back on the right track quickly. As for optimization, I tested the game on my desktop with an nVidia 980TI and i7 2600k @ 1440p/maximum graphics settings and easily maintained 60fps throughout my time playing. I also tested the game at 1080p with my laptop packing an nVidia 860M and had 0 drops below 60 FPS - even when the screen erupted in a magnificent neon explosion in front of my eyes.\n\nDistance is one of the most purely fun games I've ever played. It can be very easy; it can be blistering difficult - but the undoubtedly adrenaline-filled excitement is sure to impress most. At a suggested price of $19.99, Distance is totally worth its cost right now: In Early Access. To sweeten the deal, it routinely goes on sale on Steam.\n\nGameplay - 91\nMultiplayer - 77\nVisuals/Art Style - 89\nSound - 82\nExtras/Modding Tools/Community Content - 71\nContent-to-cost at $19.99 - 88\n\nFor what it's worth, I give Distance on PC: an 83/100.","February 7","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

People are lost to the unrealistic stupid fun genre that is arcade racers, Distance by Refract Studios didn't only remind me of that same rediculous fun I used to have in arcades, but grew on it in so many wonderful ways.\n\nin 2011 the small indie studio released Nitronic Rush, a fun experiment using a physics engine built entirely by them in C++, and it was awesome. I got my friends to download it and they all loved it, it was such a refresher from the generic races that have been coming out in years past, the ammount of insanity involved is something I hadn't dealt with in a long time.\n\nThen came Distance, made by the same studio under the name Refract, and it gave me that same rush as the first game. The game has cars going at a rediculous speed, set in a world similar to that of Tron, with flying cars, stunts, an amazing multiplayer and one of the most challenging but entertaining single player's i've been offered in a long time.\n\nIf you're on the edge about this game, just know you wont be dissapointed, Distance is one of the most refreshing experiences i've had in a long time, and im confident Refract Studios can only make it better.","June 18, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, Distance is being developed as the spiritual successor (sequal) to Nitronic Rush.  And what a fantastic sequal it is.  Here are my opinions on the game as a Kickstarter backer (beta).\n\nPros:\n-Superb graphics/environment.  The theme of the levels is fantastic (almost Tron-esque), and the music goes with the environment very well.  Light will pulse along with the music, and the overfall feeling is just fabulous.\n-Excellent handling.  The cars handle beautifully, and really are easy to drive but hard to master.  Mechanics such as boosting (which has a heating system a la Motorstorm), jumping, and flying are all implemented very well.  The levels often utilize these too, creating for a unique driving expirience.\n-Challenge.  Distance is fun for just your average racer, but it has a suprising depth for speedrunners.\n-Level editor.  Have not used this much personally, but you can see by other people's fantastic creations that it works well.\n\nCons:\n-Content.  The game's in beta, so I can't be too harsh here.  However, at the time of writing this you can complete the story in an hour or so.\n-Level editor.  While very robust, it's not particularly easy to use.  Tutorials can be found on Youtube; they help.\n\nIf you enjoy racing games, challenging games, or speedrunning games I strongly recommend picking this up.  I have been anxiously awaiting this game since it was announced and it's been anything but dissapointing.","December 9, 2014","true","28.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A fast-paced, electronic-music fueled, somewhat story-based, flying, hopping, boosting, interdimensional, tricking, warping, and overall insane racing game of the future! The adventure mode campaign at the time of writing is pretty short, and they don't promise any kind of long drawn-out campaign but the official tracks that are in now are pretty high quality handcrafted and themed. There's also procedural tracks which I haven't tried out yet, seeing as currently there are over 700 community made tracks in the steam workshop - there's definitely no shortage of quality content. Add to it the ability to play your own music that the tracks' lighting and certain elements will sync to, and you've got an overwhelmingly positive game here.\n\nMy only complaints are the difficulty of adding your own music, you have to manually type in the path of the folder you want to play, and being that I use itunes for my ipod - some of my music are m4a files which are not supported by the game. It would be much nicer if there were a simple folder browser and some other formats were supported but it's not a huge deal. Could always make a separate folder just for this game and convert my files with dbpoweramp to mp3.\n\nI've never really been too much into techno but the music in the game is pretty good atmospheric semi-psychadelic. Music that I like that I think goes really well with the game is Infected Mushroom (I'm the supervisor and Vicious Delicious) , Shpongle (Nothing Lasts... But Nothing Is Lost), those are the few good psychadelic artists I know of from a much trippier time in my life.","June 21, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I played those games a lot over the course of a few years. Those games, however, made me create a standard for all racing games. If I felt a certain racing game did not meet that standard, I wouldn't buy it. In fact, In the past 7 years, I have only bought and played 2 other racing games besides Burnout. One of those, I didn't like, the other one is decent.\n\nWhen I saw this game, I was intriqued. It looked unique, but I still went by my standard. I decided that 10 dollars (on sale) was a fair price and purchased it. When I started playing, I realized this game did not meet any of the standards I had set. That was because this game was truly unique. It's nothing I have experienced before. I've only played this game for a few hours so far, and haven't even scratched the surface of what you can do in this game.\n\nThe graphics in this game are stunning and it is well optimized as well. I can run everything on ultra and get 50+ fps. Even though it says Early Access, I have not encountered any bugs. It's labeled Early Access mostly because they have more content to add. If you enjoy using a controller like myself, they have good controller support as well. It has a level editor, allowing you to make custom levels and then share them on the Steam Workshop. It has nearly unlimited levels, just type in a phrase, and it will generate a random level. It has multiplayer, allowing you to play with others on any map you want. It also has a singleplayer and split-screen mode. And to top it all off, it's only 20 bucks (not on sale), which makes it even better.\n\nTo be honest, I can't really think of any bad things to say about this game. If I encounter anything, I will update this review.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a unique racing experience unlike anything I've played before. There are so many good things about this game, and the developers are continuing to add more content. I highly recommend this game to support it as it develops.","June 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Soundtrack is quite good, actually, very fitting, and all the lights actually pulse to the music with a certain setting turned on. You can even give the game a directory, and it will play any MP3 music files you have there instead of the EDM/dubstep norm. Very creative and awesome special effects and innovative ideas I've never seen brought into the racing videogame world until now, including a gamemode that randomly generates a track and environment based on a random phrase that you input. This product is very well-polished, ESPECIALLY for a beta. All it's really missing is content.

This is the only early access game I've ever purchased and in spite of that, it still manages to deliver an amazing experience.  I have no idea what the story is behind the game and if you're like me then you'd rather not know simply because the sci-fi wasteland environment the game provides is so immersive that so you'll end up creating your own story in your head.  The electronic soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect: gritty, pounding tech-house that totally puts you in the game.  As for the controls, I played with an XBox gamepad and it worked perfectly with that.\nComplaints?  When you shift to drive on the ceiling, it can some times be rather 50/50 on whether or not it works.  Suggestions?  Well, assuming multiplayer is in the works, and the fact that there's already a booming custom map community, I would say let me customize my ride!\nBut enough of all that, the game is damn good.

Even if your taste is not in racing games, it is a good pass time if you're overwhelmed from playing that Multiplayer game you typically play when you wake up in the morning. God knows when I am annoyed after playing Rust or Counter Strike: Global Offensive that it's these games I like to turn to. Overall, Distance has very many wonderful mechanisms to it. Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly. Once you get the hang of everything, however, you start to receive a lot of enjoyment out of playing the maps that are preset in the game, and even custom ones made by the community. Not only does Distance have wonderful mechanics to it, but it also has a nice developmental structure to it, and what I mean by that is it includes its own level editor, and you can make maps, such as a Rainbow Road and a Mario Kart map I've already took the liberty of playing on. I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a "I have spare time and I'm not doing too much," type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.\n\nOverall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.\nWonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, "In early access" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often.

The same goes with racing sims. Though this isn't a racing sim. It's a Game. Something big "AAA" companies fail to grasp.\n\nIf this game had some Advertisment campaigns all over the net, it sure is going to generate hype.\n\nA video game from the roots of creative imagination, from the roots that we all hold true and dear to have fun with. Something this awesome deserves more praise and more hype with people playing it than the ruined "Games" of today. Riddled with "DLC." Riddled with violent bloodbath adjacent to murder and carnage, and of course, deemed "acceptable by today's standards."\n\nBut this Gem, this is a video game. sure it has action and some violent ones at that.

In fact, Distance is being developed as the spiritual successor (sequal) to Nitronic Rush.  And what a fantastic sequal it is.  Here are my opinions on the game as a Kickstarter backer (beta).\n\nPros:\n-Superb graphics/environment.  The theme of the levels is fantastic (almost Tron-esque), and the music goes with the environment very well.  Light will pulse along with the music, and the overfall feeling is just fabulous.\n-Excellent handling.  The cars handle beautifully, and really are easy to drive but hard to master.  Mechanics such as boosting (which has a heating system a la Motorstorm), jumping, and flying are all implemented very well.  The levels often utilize these too, creating for a unique driving expirience.\n-Challenge.  Distance is fun for just your average racer, but it has a suprising depth for speedrunners.\n-Level editor.  Have not used this much personally, but you can see by other people's fantastic creations that it works well.\n\nCons:\n-Content.  The game's in beta, so I can't be too harsh here.  However, at the time of writing this you can complete the story in an hour or so.\n-Level editor.  While very robust, it's not particularly easy to use.

This does not mean there is no more content because oh boy is there more content. there are random geniration maps so that is infinate fun and also challenge mode and user maps, so yeah there is a lot.\n\nBUT the game really leaves me craving more speed and more split secound decisions. i really feel that they should make the tracks a tiny bit wider and add more speed and faster handeling later on in the game. i love the game and i love the small challenges it offeres but at the moment after playing it for a little while i feel i have mastered it and i just really want more speed and variation.\n\nTLDR\nGame is fun with a lot of content\nfun to get good at, can bore when mastered\nneeds more speed with better handeling (only add better handeling if more speed is added)\nlimited variation\nshort tracks\n\nIm going to give this game a thumbs up, because i really enjoy it and its great fun to play, i just feel that it has the possibility to be a great deal better if it was made harder with longer tracks and more speed.\n","June 17, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Period. Nothing else even comes close.\n\nThere is a ton of community content, and more being created constantly, meaning that there is a basically unlimited number of levels to play. The game's community is super awesome, from Speedy Saturdays (a group multiplayer event that happens every Saturday), to the forums, to the subreddit. The workshop has tons of levels for all the game modes. The game has leaderboards, and people try to get the highest time on the global leaderboards, sometimes involving insanely hard skips through parts of the level.\n\nThe game has Split Screen and Online multiplayer, both of which work extremely well. The split screen multiplayer has the option to split both horizontally or vertically when playing with only two players. The online multiplayer works extremely well, even with a super high (2-3 second) ping.\n\nThe devs are quick to respond to reported bugs, and there is an experimental branch that is updated very frequently, containing the newest bug fixes and content.\n\nThe game is very supporting of all types of controllers, from the Xbox 360 controller, to the keyboard, to joysticks. It is super easy to customize the controls to work exactly how you want them to. The game seems to detect and have default settings for all the controllers that I've thrown at it.\n\nI very much recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun racing game, to play by themselves or with friends. Distance is fun, competitive, fast-paced, and full of action. I don't believe that there is a better racing game in the world right now.\n\nCurrently (Mar 2016) it's looking like they are about to significantly change the game's physics in a VERY bad way...","June 5, 2015","true","643.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I also will say that I can't stand the keyboard controls for the game, but that's just me. Try it yourself.\n\nThis game's main issue (in my opinion, of course) is its level editor.\n\nDon't get me wrong- lots of great levels have been made with it, and there's quite a lot of functionality in it. It's just too bad that that functionality is buried behind a userface I could generously describe as "unintuitive", and the fact that sometimes, trying to perform what ought to be simple actions is made into a frustrating experience by the simple fact that the editor, for some unknown reason, does not want to play along.\n\nAnd before you say "There are guides available," I will say that I should not have to go search the internet to figure out how a crucial function of the game works. It would be one thing if I was doing it to see what nifty things others have thought to try or to get ideas for my own designs, but it's a very different matter when I have to do it just to figure out how the editor works. That said, I don't think the problem is unsolvable by any means; I just think the current level editor is not up to scratch.\n\nOverall, I would buy this game to race. The level editor makes building what should be very simple things into an ordeal much too frequently for me to consider it particularly enjoyable.\n\nBut the actual racing, flying, jumping and whatnot feel fantastic - though I prefer a controller for it. Then again, apparently top-tier players love the keyboard controls, so I might be in the minority.","November 9, 2015","true","37.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Alright, lets see if i can make it a uni wheeled car and find out the distance i can travel that way.\n\nThis games "campaign", more like 12 mission tutorial, teaches you something new every mission, every song, every km/mi. It truly does take you the distance of learning what racing games should have been. But travel no further, because this one is it.\n\nThe best part is the learning doesn't stop in the campaign, with the fully featured workshop and level editor you too can create your own maps, like a 50 second speed run when you constantly have to jump off walls, fly through space and of course, i know super cheesy, travel the distance.\n\nSo look no further, and set up that steering wheel and paddle box, *Don't forget to set up correct controls in settings!" Because this is the game that will take you to outter space and back. Something something it'll bring you the distance you desire.\n\n12/10 Most fun i have ever had in a racing game.\n2/10 wish the soundtrack was real, and no midi files on loop.

Even if your taste is not in racing games, it is a good pass time if you're overwhelmed from playing that Multiplayer game you typically play when you wake up in the morning. God knows when I am annoyed after playing Rust or Counter Strike: Global Offensive that it's these games I like to turn to. Overall, Distance has very many wonderful mechanisms to it. Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly. Once you get the hang of everything, however, you start to receive a lot of enjoyment out of playing the maps that are preset in the game, and even custom ones made by the community. Not only does Distance have wonderful mechanics to it, but it also has a nice developmental structure to it, and what I mean by that is it includes its own level editor, and you can make maps, such as a Rainbow Road and a Mario Kart map I've already took the liberty of playing on. I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a "I have spare time and I'm not doing too much," type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.\n\nOverall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.\nWonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, "In early access" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often. Yes, that was a shot at DayZ. Sorry!","June 16, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The mechanics already in place make it a blast to drive through already.  The track creator and what people have already done with it is awe-inspiring.  This game has the potential to be what Mod-Nation Racers wanted to be: The racer that can be whatever its community wants it to be.\n\nSome things I'd like to see in the future would be player collisions, something of a traditional lap-mode, and some mouse-friendliness through menus.

You know that in reality, it's the indy developers that are going to move this industry.\n\nIt's a shame for such a brilliant game like this to not have at least half of fame of what the generic bloodbath COD and, Battlefields and, WAR WAR WAR games have to offer, complete with ZERO innovation. The same goes with racing sims. Though this isn't a racing sim. It's a Game. Something big "AAA" companies fail to grasp.\n\nIf this game had some Advertisment campaigns all over the net, it sure is going to generate hype.\n\nA video game from the roots of creative imagination, from the roots that we all hold true and dear to have fun with. Something this awesome deserves more praise and more hype with people playing it than the ruined "Games" of today. Riddled with "DLC." Riddled with violent bloodbath adjacent to murder and carnage, and of course, deemed "acceptable by today's standards."\n\nBut this Gem, this is a video game. sure it has action and some violent ones at that. But there's no Blood splatting all over the place, there's no Russia vs America here.\n\nThis is a video game. The action we are all looking for from the folly big names "AAA" studios........\n\nCreativity doesn't come from "avoiding risks", creativity comes from freedom of imagination. And this game is nurtured plenty from the mind who created it.","June 17, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I also will say that I can't stand the keyboard controls for the game, but that's just me. Try it yourself.\n\nThis game's main issue (in my opinion, of course) is its level editor.\n\nDon't get me wrong- lots of great levels have been made with it, and there's quite a lot of functionality in it. It's just too bad that that functionality is buried behind a userface I could generously describe as "unintuitive", and the fact that sometimes, trying to perform what ought to be simple actions is made into a frustrating experience by the simple fact that the editor, for some unknown reason, does not want to play along.\n\nAnd before you say "There are guides available," I will say that I should not have to go search the internet to figure out how a crucial function of the game works. It would be one thing if I was doing it to see what nifty things others have thought to try or to get ideas for my own designs, but it's a very different matter when I have to do it just to figure out how the editor works. That said, I don't think the problem is unsolvable by any means; I just think the current level editor is not up to scratch.\n\nOverall, I would buy this game to race. The level editor makes building what should be very simple things into an ordeal much too frequently for me to consider it particularly enjoyable.\n\nBut the actual racing, flying, jumping and whatnot feel fantastic - though I prefer a controller for it. Then again, apparently top-tier players love the keyboard controls, so I might be in the minority.","November 9, 2015","true","37.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Too many bumps, camera shakes, unpredictable sudden changes of motion, spins in every direction, visual refraction and color distortions, All that very fast. The abstract tracks that curves vertically are nice, but in VR you feel every polygon collision.\n\nAgain: the game is great and you should play it, but you do not want it just to increase your VR library.\n\n(disclaimer: please use this review only if it applies to you)","May 14","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The general goal is to reach the finish, go fast and avoid various hazards on your way. Your space car comes equipped with a nitro boost that refills when landing stunts or driving through checkpoints, a set of wings that also use your boost meter to fly and a killer suspension system that makes sharp turns and airborne maneuvering easy. The stunt game mode deviates from this general goal as you only rely on GOOD STUFF like doing as many ASTOUNDING stunts as possible in a set amount of time to get you GOIN' THE DISTANCE.\n\nDistance is still in early access but it's already perfectly playable, there just aren't many official levels yet. However, thanks to the level editor and Steam Workshop, you currently have 885 custom made levels at your disposal... plenty of gameplay. So far I've tried several of the higher rated ones and they were all great.\n\nThere's also a neat Transmogrify game mode that creates a random map based on what you write. Try "super long never ending ride". Spoiler alert: it ends and it's not even that long but it's got a great, sinister atmosphere about it. Everything fits.\n\nThe kicking soundtrack fits the game perfectly. There's also an option to import and listen to your own music while you play. There are a lot of options.\n\nThat said, I have a few minor complaints. I think the beatbox sound mode would be better if there was no screen shake and just a bigger emphasis on the blinking lights. I also miss the over the top announcer from Distance's predecessor - Nitronic Rush. I understand that the game is a bit more serious, lonesome and mysterious this time around. In fact, I really dig the whole space neon-machine atmosphere but If they added the announcer as an off by default or at least stunt mode only audio option, that'd just make the game BETTER THAN SLICED BREAD.","September 14, 2015","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music is amazing, visuals are extremely good, the game is extremely smooth, as are the controls. There are multiple Game-modes, a level editor and Steam Workshop support, meaning you won't ever run out of levels to play.\n\nThe games story and challenge levels are also extremely well designed, with shortcuts, unique levels and a story (which though isn't complete yet is still awesome). If you're like me and enjoy trying to get the best time and rank on each mode, then you will enjoy it. Distance is one of few games that i genuinely enjoy speedrunning levels on.\n\nThe game states that it is in early access, so there are some bugs, and the story isn't quite finished. I personally, haven't encountered any bugs, and there are enough levels on the workshop for me not to care so much about the unfinished story. If anything, i look forward to playing new story levels.

You can play in two ways: 1. race and come in first place or 2. destroy every other car. You have a damage bar and a power bar. the more power you have, the faster your car would go and the stronger it would be but it's constantly draining. so there's ramps all over the map and to fill it back up again you need to do tricks much like in distance.

Why did I do that? Simply because I've fallen in love with its prequel, nitronic rush. You can check it out, i think it's 100% free to download.\n\nImo, compared to NR, Distance still lacks these perfectly designed, not-so-trivial campaign levels. In return we get unlimited amount of tracks from the community, and some of them are really beautiful, some quite surprising, some surprisingly creative.\n\nMultiplayer works and it's pretty fun, haven't checked splitscreen yet (but it is there).\n\nAlso, I can't really imagine playing this game without gamepad. My friend played on keyboard and, while he still had really good time with the game, he couldn't micro his movement while freefalling (or in 0G) that well.\n\nSo, my recomendation: Download NR, try it for yourself if you like it, and then throw some money at these guys, because I think they really deserve it.","June 7, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has workshop support so there's a whole bunch of user made tracks to download for the various game modes, which I think is one of the best parts of this game. You won't get bored with a lack of tracks any time soon.\n\nThe only slight problem I have is that there don't seem to be very many online servers (4 is the most I've seen, 3 being passworded) but I imagine this will be remedied once the player base grows.","February 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a reaction that I think a lot of players will have at first. But after getting used to the controls, and discovering the random level generator and edited tracks which extend gameplay considerably, I quickly went from disappoint to gleefullly enjoying this game.\n\nIn fact, I think I have played this game in VR for longer play sessions than what I usually tolerate with a headset on, including relative to stuff like Elite Dangerous. I could probably play this for an hour or two even with a headset on, if I had the time, as it's easy to lose track of time playing random tracks and seeing what other crazy tricks the game can throw at you. For my part, I did not experiene nausea or stomach churning in VR, and the game does not induce my fear of heights as much as a game like Radial G can.\n\nThis isn't to say that the VR implementation is better than in standard establishing games like Elite, cause it's not. In fact, the VR adds less to this game than some others like Elite or Radial G, which feel more like VR can be an integral part of the game, rather than an add-on. But if the VR feels like a nice but not revolutionary addition to this game, it's well implemented enough to at least add to the immersion, and may even make the game a little more playable as you can look up to see oncoming parts of the tricky tracks more easily. Just don't expect the same level of presence that some purpose-built for VR games have.\n\nThis is not like other futuristic VR racing games with some obstacles and the occasional surprise, like the excellent Radial G. It's also not like traditional racers such as the also excellent Project Cars. At least for now, there don't seem to be computer controlled opponents, which is a bit of a disappointment. But what keeps the game interesting is that the game's tracks are, essentially, trying to kill you.\n\nWhile you generally have a chance to respond to things as they occur enough so that absolute track memorization is not necessary, things do start to feel a bit like a puzzle game all the same as you learn to navigate using a mix of odd car abilities from jumping to even flying. Yeah, flying. This game forces you to try all kinds of crazy stunts in order to survive each track's tricky obstacles, including lasers, saw blades, moving walls, and the need to wall climb or fly to reach other levels. At first, this can be frustrating. But it can soon become quite engaging as it all starts to make a weird sort of sense. A gamepad is recommended.\n\nAnd the tracks really are trying to get you. In one random level I generated, a bot-like moving wall hovered above me, following my car until it could pounce down in front of me at just the right moment to score a kill. That's one tricky obstacle! You quickly learn not to take anything for granted while playing this game, as it's more of a survival challenge rather than a conventional racing game. Not all jumps are good to take, turns that look sensible can get you killed, and there are tracks where, instead of only being able to turn left or right at a fork in the road, you also have the option to take a jump right down the middle. Which path is right for you? You can play repeatedly to find out! Come for the pretty colors and Tron-like graphics, and stay for the addictive gameplay.","October 18, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art design and music are great so far, the city has a distinctly Tron-like aesthetic and the music in each stage really brings out the atmosphere. Despite having no story to speak of it's stages string together a visual narrative that not only keeps you from getting bored but brings out a modicum of emotion as well. The tracks are well composed, nothing is unfairly unforgiving and one is rarely left scratching his head while stuck somewhere wondering what he's supposed to do. All in all I'm excited to see the final product.\n\nMy only major complaint is the controls, or rather the way the game introduces you to them. Early on if you are using an XBOX controller it instructs you to use A to boost and X to jump. And early on this is fine, later you also need to quickly use the right stick which proves difficult. What the game doesn't tell you is that you can also use the shoulder buttons for boost and jump freeing your right thumb to do the tricky bits. But relearning the controls half way through the main game is kind of annoying.

I just experienced a crazy section where i was warped through the same section a couple times by some tear in time or something, around some sort of experiment that appeared to go wrong, at times leaving the world in ruins ... pretty amazing stuff for what on the surface appears to be just a tron-esque racing game.\n\nEven at its Beta status it's looking to be a winner and plenty worth the chunk of money to help support a really cool project. I'm glad I gave it a shot ... i've got almost 200 games in my Library awaiting my hard won attention and I HAPPILY downloaded and played this game moments after purchase.","December 12, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe the best racing game on Linux. If you ever wanted to race with a futuristic car in a very futuristic world, this game is for you! Its racing with a twist, your car can perform various new functions such as jumping, wallriding and even flying! All this makes for very interesting race courses where the quickest way sometimes requires a lot of creativity. Something like extreme-G mixed with Trackmania.\n\nGraphics and sound are excellent, but my favourite part is the gameplay. The car really controls so well, it is even possible to play with the keyboard. Good control is important as the game requires lighting fast reactions.\n\nNote there are no AI oponents, hopefully this is something that will be added later. I had a lot of fun playing with random people through multiplayer though. The split screen option is also a very welcome addition and this can very easily be a fun game to play when having friends over. Just make sure to find an easy level pack first as most of the default levels take a lot of practice to master.","March 14, 2015","true","78.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The story of an Australian and his American friend.\n\nKidding. While I would like to write out a short story on that, it's just a case of this game still being early in development. What's there is already great, and you're buying what's advertised. Flashy neon graphics that make me feel like I'm playing a GOOD Tron game, if one ever existed. A snappy electronic soundtrack to go with it. Gameplay that needs reflexes just as quick as the car you're driving (exaggerating just a bit, it's actually very forgiving but you'll need to be good with your reactions, because once or twice the game throws an obstacle in your face like a friend tossing a basketball at your face and shouting 'think fast'.)\n\nAll in all, fun, but STILL IN PROGRESS. The single player is short, but we are told this is because it is incomplete, simple as that. Even then, the developers tell us that they want the campaign to be short, so if there's not meant to be much more beyond that, then likely the game will focus on user generated content (rather interesting level editor and steam workshop support! The editor may be difficult to grasp, not out of difficulty, but out of the sheer amount of options) AND its online mode.\n\nWhich leads me to the next thing to talk about. Upon selecting the online arcade, the game tests your network capability. Both me and my American friend were told our networks weren't too great (limited connectivity to NAT servers), and his works eith every game imaginable. Clearing up a few ports to host a server is one thing, but being unable to connect to any server at all is another. If we knew which ports or remedies would solve the Network Capability test, then we'd be having a blast. Until then, we can't connect to any servers whatsoever. So beware of this if you're buying the game with a focus on its online.\n\nUntil it gets fixed, I'll have to shelf this for now. Great game! Can't wait until it improves.","December 11, 2014","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But I have to say this is one of the few gems inside of this program. Distance is just plain addicting. I can just spend hours on end replaying the same levels (Or going through the library of community made tracks on the workshop! ) over and over again. The car itself is amazing allowing you to boost, jump, fly and rotate giving you many options for sick tricks that you can do. The teleporters I have to say is another one of my favorite things about this game, nothing is as  cool as doing a flip through a teleporter and dodging multiple blades and lazers before landing it or suddenly being taken to an area with Zero Gravity or where you're upside down. Did I mention that the car also lets you ride on walls and ceilings? This game is fast paced, and very awesome if you can stay up to speed and stick to your reactions as you dodge anything that blocks your path. It has multiplayer already in the game from the get go which works pretty well for an Early Access game so far. The game also lets you customize your car to a limited extent along with an easy, but deep level editor. Also if you were wondering, you can go first person as well! There's no interior just the front of the car but holy ♥♥♥♥ it's tough but cool as hell to drive in that view. Recommend this game to any of your friends if you own it, this needs a larger community to support it!\n\ntl;dr: Game is like hotwheels, and trackmania with it's own little twists (Teleporter, and the car.) Very fun, awesome tricks. If you've been hesitant on buying it, don't hold back.\n\nI'd give this game personally a 10/10. Can't really find anything I don't enjoy about it. It's one of those fun, addicting little games you find that you can't put down and keep coming back to. Going from highspeed races, to doing sick stunts with your friends, along with making a level or two if you have the creativity and time. This game has quite a bit of content and love put into it for only being out for just under two months.

I think i counted like 7 or 9 people who made this game, really good game for a small bunch of people.\n\nIt has potential of being one of the greatest car games imo. The visuals look stunning, the physics is realistic and fun. For what it offers as a beta feels as though its finnished (ignoring adventure mode).

I've never had so much fun in a game that involved just driving before. Completely stunning visuals, trippy elements and unique tracks and obstacles will take your breath away. There was actually a point in time where I felt like the game gave me an artificial high, that's how intense the game really is. I also find that you probably don't have to like racing games in order to like this game, I myself enjoy very few racing games. Distance also has a huge sense of freedom, for there is currently no countdown timer and no limited amount of lives. Checkpoints are plenty and there's also plenty of room to recover from mistakes, if the mistakes aren't disasterous. A superb soundtrack, similar to that of Tron: Legacy's sets the perfect mood for this cyberpunk, dystopian simulation. I highly recommend anyone to at least try this game while the price is still low.\n\nKeep in mind that it is still in Early Access, but after finishing the currently built Story mode and some Online Arcade, I haven't really seen any bugs.\n\nCurrent Overall Early Access rating: 9.5/10","January 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a lot of the feeling of speed you get from other high speed racing games. I really like the addition of the wings which allow short flight. In a game that is difficult and requires highly precise manipulation of the vehicle, this is a godsend. However, the game is still quite difficult to keep up the challenge. As of the last time I played, the story mode is not yet complete, but it is still longer than I thought it would be in Early Access. There is also still a lot of community content that I have not played yet, but look forward to playing soon.\n\nPlaythrough and first look at the story Mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs360hQsos","January 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I have to say this is one of the few gems inside of this program. Distance is just plain addicting. I can just spend hours on end replaying the same levels (Or going through the library of community made tracks on the workshop! ) over and over again. The car itself is amazing allowing you to boost, jump, fly and rotate giving you many options for sick tricks that you can do. The teleporters I have to say is another one of my favorite things about this game, nothing is as  cool as doing a flip through a teleporter and dodging multiple blades and lazers before landing it or suddenly being taken to an area with Zero Gravity or where you're upside down. Did I mention that the car also lets you ride on walls and ceilings? This game is fast paced, and very awesome if you can stay up to speed and stick to your reactions as you dodge anything that blocks your path. It has multiplayer already in the game from the get go which works pretty well for an Early Access game so far. The game also lets you customize your car to a limited extent along with an easy, but deep level editor. Also if you were wondering, you can go first person as well! There's no interior just the front of the car but holy ♥♥♥♥ it's tough but cool as hell to drive in that view. Recommend this game to any of your friends if you own it, this needs a larger community to support it!\n\ntl;dr: Game is like hotwheels, and trackmania with it's own little twists (Teleporter, and the car.) Very fun, awesome tricks. If you've been hesitant on buying it, don't hold back.\n\nI'd give this game personally a 10/10. Can't really find anything I don't enjoy about it. It's one of those fun, addicting little games you find that you can't put down and keep coming back to. Going from highspeed races, to doing sick stunts with your friends, along with making a level or two if you have the creativity and time. This game has quite a bit of content and love put into it for only being out for just under two months. I can't wait to see where it goes.","January 29, 2015","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Refract's strategy of utilizing their growing fanbase really makes this game unique. There are hundreds of tracks for this game from different people and their different ideas, rather than a team of a few people making tracks for their own game. The game is also really easy to learn, even if you haven't played their first game, and it is more than a racing game. There are other exciting game modes. There is a fast-paced survival aspect to each race with tons of obstacles that you need to avoid or your car will be torn to shreds. But each race is only as hard as you want it to be!

Five Stars!\n\nIf you're thinkin about getting it, get it!\n\nThis is actually my first time posting a review of any kind, and that should say something.  I saw this game on the store page, bought it, and it was worth every penny.  This game is perfect for someone who is looking for a racing game but wants to step away from the traditional stick-shifter, and move in the direction of a sci-fi obstacle course where your pilot a highly advanced supercar equipped for land, air, and zero gravity travel!  It made me think of Sonic All-Stars and maybe the baby of Kario Kart and Portal or something.  I've never seen anything like it, very original gameplay and you can even make your own levels.  I just recently purchased the game and I've spent seven hours on it.  Refract did an amazing job and I wish them the best of luck! If I could make a request for the next update; pick up items for versus style gameplay, and a shuffle option for maps! That would be pretty radical.\n\nOne last thing, the introduction video was very exciting and I actually saw a huge potential for storyline development.  I'm eager to see where it goes, I know you guys won't disappoint!\n\nP.s., It was awesome.\n\n\nEdit: I noticed the design for the car would actually be usable design for an all terrain sports car.

If you've never played nitronic rush before, I would highly recommend giving it a try because it shares a very simmilar playing style. this game features racing at 999999999 Km/h, Being cut into five peices and still being able to get to the next checkpoint, various gravity shifts, flying a car, super mega turbo jets of doom and last but not least, customizable car... colours. (I really hope they add in a actual custom cars thing though.) This game was a great experience for me. There's also a great active community supplying levels left and right. Is it worth 22 bucks? some people will say yes and some people will say -Eesh-. Like I said, there's not much to the game as of this review, it is still in a very early state of developpement but has the potential to grow.... SO much.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter playing more, I've realized that there is some severe problems in terms of taxing a GPU. for example, on some levels I get sub 50 fps though I clearly should run that slow considering I have an overclocked Radeon 7970 that can run almost anything at 60 fps no problem. this game shouldn't be an exeption especially with it not that stunning graphics. IN SHORT: people with low-end graphics solutions should wait this out until there is some better graphics optimisations.","December 14, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zotarian/recommended/233610/","zotarian","Zotar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zotarian/","49 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo a note before this review, at points I'm going to reference "Nitronic Rush" which is the previous game that the devs created and it's pretty much an alpha of this game.  (Even though I call it an alpha, it was well enough to be one of my favorite games)\nLet's begin (TL;DR version at end)\n\nGraphics:\n-In general: The graphics are very nice. And the options on the graphics are very nice as well, letting you customize them to a good extent which should make this playable on most machines.\n-In game: The levels have very contrasting colors and a good variety of them in levels making it fun to see what's next.  The timer, speed, and boost gauge are on the vehicle, which works even though it might seem like it wouldn't.  I have not tried out the custom music option yet, which is supposed to change the graphics even more in time with your music (which actually sounds really cool).\n\nPerformance:\n-For some reason and I don't know why, this game seems a little slow to me. I have put my graphics to a good spot, but it still seems just a bit slow. I am comparing to nitro in this case, and I'm not sure if it's because of a new engine or some other factor, might even just be me, but it does seem like it runs slightly slow with the graphics settings on par with nitro.\n( I have been informed that the future builds are going to be more stable, and that the slowness is due to added physics and sensitivity changes)\n\nThe Gameplay:\n-This is a survival racer, not a standard racer. Most levels have you going through a level past numerous obstacles, lasers, and more to get to the goal. Compared to nitro rush I have to say that Distance really upped the gameplay. Lasers don't kill you now, instead they slice apart your car into a bunch of tiny pieces which is actually really fun to mess with. The flying is utilized a LOT more, in much more entertaining ways. Certain areas disable the wings so you can't cheat through them which utilizes more skill. Enemies do actually change depending on how you move (one actually stopped me for a whole minute because it kept tracking me). There was even a spot with zero gravity and I can't emphasize how much I actually enjoyed this area. It's something unique and I haven't seen something like that in a racing game before. I'd really like much more of that area in the game. The levels at times are confusing, and I got lost at at least one point.  All in all, just from playing the adventure mode, I can say that this is quite the improvement to Nitro.\n-The only thing I'd actually suggest for an improvement is having more wall riding and ceiling riding areas similar to hardcore mode from nitro. Those are a lot of fun to drive with\n\nControls:\n-Controls are pretty good, not as sensitive as I'd like standard, but overall good. I have learned you can customize the controls and fix them to however you like. (I would not overly reccomend customizing the controls, but it's more of a personal choice.)\n\nLevel Editor:\n-This thing... this thing is... amazing. I haven't seen a more customizable level editor. It looks very much like a full 3D modeling program. I thought you could add custom models, but apparently the maps so far have been using the in-game items which is very nice. Here's an idea, someone make a drivable map on a heavy from TF2. Overall it is a little intimidating to newcomers, but it should be fun to use and it is very cool.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed playing this game so far and it's not even fully released yet. Once it's fully released, the bugs should be fixed (there aren't that many bugs to begin with) and there should be some new features to play around with.\n\nI have learned there is a car color customizer in the options.\n\nI do highly reccomend this game, and it's not even fully released yet. I look forward to the full release of this game.\n\nThanks to Californ1a for giving me some info to make the review better and clarifying some things I mispoke on.\n\nTL;DR: Flippy car game with lasers, booms, flying and more. 10/10 would race","August 31, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.\n\nGraphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.\n\nSound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!\n\nLast Words\nDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.\n\n8.5/10 - Give it a go, especially if you catch it on sale!","March 12, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never had so much fun in a game that involved just driving before. Completely stunning visuals, trippy elements and unique tracks and obstacles will take your breath away. There was actually a point in time where I felt like the game gave me an artificial high, that's how intense the game really is. I also find that you probably don't have to like racing games in order to like this game, I myself enjoy very few racing games. Distance also has a huge sense of freedom, for there is currently no countdown timer and no limited amount of lives. Checkpoints are plenty and there's also plenty of room to recover from mistakes, if the mistakes aren't disasterous. A superb soundtrack, similar to that of Tron: Legacy's sets the perfect mood for this cyberpunk, dystopian simulation. I highly recommend anyone to at least try this game while the price is still low.\n\nKeep in mind that it is still in Early Access, but after finishing the currently built Story mode and some Online Arcade, I haven't really seen any bugs.\n\nCurrent Overall Early Access rating: 9.5/10","January 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just experienced a crazy section where i was warped through the same section a couple times by some tear in time or something, around some sort of experiment that appeared to go wrong, at times leaving the world in ruins ... pretty amazing stuff for what on the surface appears to be just a tron-esque racing game.\n\nEven at its Beta status it's looking to be a winner and plenty worth the chunk of money to help support a really cool project.

The story of an Australian and his American friend.\n\nKidding. While I would like to write out a short story on that, it's just a case of this game still being early in development. What's there is already great, and you're buying what's advertised. Flashy neon graphics that make me feel like I'm playing a GOOD Tron game, if one ever existed. A snappy electronic soundtrack to go with it. Gameplay that needs reflexes just as quick as the car you're driving (exaggerating just a bit, it's actually very forgiving but you'll need to be good with your reactions, because once or twice the game throws an obstacle in your face like a friend tossing a basketball at your face and shouting 'think fast'.)\n\nAll in all, fun, but STILL IN PROGRESS. The single player is short, but we are told this is because it is incomplete, simple as that. Even then, the developers tell us that they want the campaign to be short, so if there's not meant to be much more beyond that, then likely the game will focus on user generated content (rather interesting level editor and steam workshop support! The editor may be difficult to grasp, not out of difficulty, but out of the sheer amount of options) AND its online mode.\n\nWhich leads me to the next thing to talk about. Upon selecting the online arcade, the game tests your network capability. Both me and my American friend were told our networks weren't too great (limited connectivity to NAT servers), and his works eith every game imaginable. Clearing up a few ports to host a server is one thing, but being unable to connect to any server at all is another. If we knew which ports or remedies would solve the Network Capability test, then we'd be having a blast. Until then, we can't connect to any servers whatsoever. So beware of this if you're buying the game with a focus on its online.\n\nUntil it gets fixed, I'll have to shelf this for now. Great game!

They have been putting out consistent updates and improvements to the alpha and beta stages over the past year or two, and it is easy to tell that they are very passionate about this game. They also are very supportive of the community, evidenced by the fact they acknowledge and support the user created levels in the workshop.\n\nIf I hadn't helped kickstarted this game, I would definitely purchase early access.

Includes a level editor (Haven't played around with it much, but I love to see that, and from what I've seen it looks very good). Well optomized, runs nicely.\n\nCons: At a certain point in a certain level, for some reason that I have yet to figure out, the flight mode controls get really iffy, on keyboard at least.\n\nOther thoughts: I run the game on max settings with a nice 75 - 112 FPS, however, if I even turn the real-time reflections onto LOW, the highest my FPS will go is 45. I assume however that this is most likely becuase that feature is very resource intensive, and not due to poor optomization.\n\nOverall, THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY, great game, if this was a finished game I would be happy with the purchase, but it's still only in beta!! I can't wait for further updates, and I wish all the luck in the world to the developers.","December 9, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A rare thing for me to enjoy this genre, I really enjoy this one. An absolute must buy. Also, I have to say for being "early access" this feels "nearly done." So, if they are in fact still adding and making things better than I can not wait! If you like arcade classics such as WipeOut and you don't own this then you suck at life. A big plus for being cross-platform, for the most part completely painless controller setup (even on Linux). This dev team needs a hug, a cookie and even a sticker.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/recommended/233610/","chronicles5","chronicles5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/","335 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is really, really fun. I'm not big into racing games, but watching the trailer wowed me enough to buy this one without hesitation, and I don't regret it. I was psyched to see the game run perfectly on my Nvidia Surround setup without any tweaking, and this made the experience all the more immersive.\n\nI started with Adventure mode which moves you through the levels, learning the controls a bit at a time. For the most part, they're very easy to pick up on, and extremely fun to put into action. You can boost your car for added speed, jump over obstacles, and even sprout "wings" and start flying, for limited distances. You're also able to flip the car 90 or 180 degrees onto other tracks. All of this while racing at breakneck speeds on a psychedelic course full of deadly lasers, blades, and other obstacles. Checkpoints cool your car down and save your progress, and there are some other cool effects that I won't spoil. The game kept me constantly surprised and I was on the edge of my seat, thrilled after surviving obstacle after obstacle, going faster than ever. It's seriously exhilerating to play. The soundtrack only adds to this - driving beats that match the style and pace of the game perfectly. I would like to find out where I could buy the soundtrack, though I was able to find a previous album for the original game on the artist's Bandcamp page. Really excellent music!\n\nThe one downside that I've found to this game is that some of the flips you have to do are pretty unforgiving. I thought I was doing well with them in one particularly flip-heavy track, only to reach a point where I died dozens of times trying to get it right. Gravity was just not allowing me to reach the other side of the track before falling into oblivion, and I think it's because I had lost my speed from earlier in the track, so continuing from the checkpoint wasn't working. I had to back way up and speed up from there, and then I made it. Throughout the levels, there are a few particularly difficult moments like this, and while I've gotten better at them, they can still take you out of the exhileration and into frustration, if only until you get past them. But just like any game, you learn a bit more every time your car explodes, and mastering those techniques and pulling it off feels really, really good. I would boil it down to this - if you think you would enjoy the survival part of "survival racing", than this game is for you. If the thought of watching your car explode over and over while you lose any chance of beating your best time sounds annoying, you may want to look elsewhere. But you'd be missing out!\n\nNot all of the traps are a bother. The lasers and blades are awesome. Not too hard to avoid with some deft maneuvering, and even if you do get sliced, it's pretty cool when your car is cut in half but you still make it through the checkpoint (and your car regenerates). Great concept, and it adds to the excitement of the racing by making you think, how the hell did I just survive that?\n\nI've started on the time trials and those have been fun too. There are also a few other modes, plus custom levels that others have built, and that you can build yourself. I look forward to checking those out. For $16, I feel this game is a steal. Definitely has a lot of replay value and would be a fun game to share when friends come over. I'm happy to see that the devs plan to release this on PS4 next year. It's definitely worthy of a wide audience.","December 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like that you will like this.\n\nDistance is a Tron-esqe racing game where you speed along floating roads and fly through obstacles at very high speeds.\n\nGameplay-10/10\nThe gameplay in Distance is absolutely flawless. The controls feel fluid and are very responsive, and I know that I am in control of my car at all times. The gameplay consists of driving along roads at high speeds while dodging obstacles like buzzsaws, lasers, walls, spinning cylinders of death spikes, and so on. While you usually just drive along roads, you also can fly. Everything about the driving and flying is great. There is also a boost system that reminds me of Excite Truck, which was my favorite racing game until I got Distance. Also, if you get cut by lasers, you can still drive with half of your car. That's probably my favorite thing in Distance.\n\nStory-N/A\nThe adventure mode isn't finished yet, so I can't really review it right now.\n\nMultiplayer-10/10\nI haven't encountered any lag in multiplayer yet. You have to get to the finish as fast as possible, trying to beat the other players. However, the other players appear as ghosts and cannot effect your vehicle, making the race into more of a synonomous time trial.\n\nGraphics-10/10\nThe graphics remind me of Nitronic Rush, but have a glossy new feel that fits with the atmosphere very well.\n\nOverall-10/10\nFor what it is, Distance is a fantastic game. Even though it is essentially a remake of Nitronic Rush, it does everything right. It runs well on lower spec PCs, you can play it on Mac and Linux as well as PC, there's a level editor with workshop support.

It's like TRON meets Blade Runner\nmeets Black Rock City at night. It's hard not to get lost in the visuals.\nGraphic are breathtaking, even at lower settings (for those of us who don't want to turn\nour slow laptops into molten metal). Speaking of molten metal, the lasers are merciless,\nand thoroughly awesome. You can slice your car in half down the plane of symmetry and\nstill recover if you can steer your glowing hunk of car thru a green regeneration hoop.\n\nGameplay is intense but forgiving, even for the casual gamer like me who's a novice at\nracing games and flight simulators. Skills like the 90° wall jumps, mid-air rotation, coming\ninto and out of a glide, etc. take practice, but they won't frustrate you into rage-quitting.\n\nMy only complaint is that it has all EDM/techno-style music, which can get droning and\nrepetitive (in my opinion). That's part of the ambiance that the artists wished to convey,\nand I respect them for it, but I leave the music turned off.","April 15, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I usually don't play racing games (I have none on my steam account), but I decided to pick this one up. The atmosphere, the colour, the mystery, and the overall mind-bending aspects of this game make it my favourite game that I've gotten so far.\n\nAt first glance, it will just seem like a colourful driving game, but seriously, I have found EVERYTHING that I've wanted in a racing game here, it's fast paced, challenging (but not too difficult once you get into it), and certain aspects like spinning around to jump on upside-down surfaces, or suddenly having the gravity turn off and learning to adjust your playstyle make it super addictive\n\nThis game is also packed with lore, but it's never explicitly shoved in your face. The story mode seems to be about some kind of society that released... something, but that's all I've been able to figure out so far. I don't want to spoil anything either, but every detail of the adventure mode is packed with information about what happened. The adventure mode makes me feel like I'm delving into the past, trying to uncover what happened to this society. I've actually played the adventure mode three times now just because of how awesome it feels, it's so fun, and there are a lot of parts that feel so ominous, like I'm watching the end of the world but I don't entirely understand how it happened. The starting cut scene, that just shows the car starting, gives tons of information on the story, but you won't realize it unless you play it through again, and even the loading screens give you a glimpse into what is going on\n\nOverall I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Every aspect of it comes together to make a masterpiece. One thing I'd recommend is making sure you have the right hardware to be able to run it, because the game is just so freaking awesome and having any sort of lag would take away from the experience (you can change the visual settings and that does help, but again the game looks so amazing on full quality)\n\n10/10, I can't wait to see this game when it's completely finished, despite how polished it is already","April 19, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tools on the car are great fun and also allow you to recover in incredible ways that would otherwise make this game a demanding test to always play perfectly.\n\nThis game runs great and the only minor issue I had was with the keymapping on my logitech gamepad.\ncore i7-860\nradeon 5770\n\nIf you want a racing game that gives you incredible tools to use with skill, this is worth a look.","July 18, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played from the alpha stage up to now, and the game has shown significant progress.

They have been putting out consistent updates and improvements to the alpha and beta stages over the past year or two, and it is easy to tell that they are very passionate about this game. They also are very supportive of the community, evidenced by the fact they acknowledge and support the user created levels in the workshop.\n\nIf I hadn't helped kickstarted this game, I would definitely purchase early access. I really trust Refract with creating a quality game, and I can tell you with certainty that this won't be an early access game that crashes and burns like a lot of others out there.\n\nAlso, if you're not sure you like arcade racing games like this, you should download Nitronic Rush, which Distance is the sequel to.

Controls are tight for both Keyboard and 360 controller. Good ammount of single player and local Co-Op game modes. Very challenging. The adventure/ story mode builds up the difficulty at a nice pace so there is no terrible difficulty curve. Includes a level editor (Haven't played around with it much, but I love to see that, and from what I've seen it looks very good). Well optomized, runs nicely.\n\nCons: At a certain point in a certain level, for some reason that I have yet to figure out, the flight mode controls get really iffy, on keyboard at least.\n\nOther thoughts: I run the game on max settings with a nice 75 - 112 FPS, however, if I even turn the real-time reflections onto LOW, the highest my FPS will go is 45. I assume however that this is most likely becuase that feature is very resource intensive, and not due to poor optomization.\n\nOverall, THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY, great game, if this was a finished game I would be happy with the purchase, but it's still only in beta!! I can't wait for further updates, and I wish all the luck in the world to the developers.","December 9, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a unique and really fun racing game with beautiful visuals, tight controls, awesome stunts and level editing, atmospheric music. It's got the works.\n\nI'm a beta backer of this game, so I got it for 15 euro. This game right now ( with the -15% 16.99 sale ) is a bargain! If you've ever loved racing games, I don't see any reason to not get this.\n\nIf you want to play the "demo" version of this game, go play it's prequel, Nitronic Rush. It's a little different, but mainly the same game.\n\n8.5/10 - Lowered the score simply because it's still early access, so it's lacking some optimization, options and more importantly ( to me ) the old narrator from Nitronic Rush and the music tracks. They have announced that they plan to add the narrator with the original voice actor as an option in the game in the future though, so there's that!","December 10, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is quite polished for an Early Access Game, and the community is very friendly. I highly recommend giving it a shot if you like high speed racing. Extremely high replayability makes this game worth every penny.","September 7, 2015","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe the best racing game on Linux. If you ever wanted to race with a futuristic car in a very futuristic world, this game is for you! Its racing with a twist, your car can perform various new functions such as jumping, wallriding and even flying! All this makes for very interesting race courses where the quickest way sometimes requires a lot of creativity. Something like extreme-G mixed with Trackmania.\n\nGraphics and sound are excellent, but my favourite part is the gameplay. The car really controls so well, it is even possible to play with the keyboard. Good control is important as the game requires lighting fast reactions.\n\nNote there are no AI oponents, hopefully this is something that will be added later. I had a lot of fun playing with random people through multiplayer though. The split screen option is also a very welcome addition and this can very easily be a fun game to play when having friends over. Just make sure to find an easy level pack first as most of the default levels take a lot of practice to master.","March 14, 2015","true","78.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
