"http://steamcommunity.com/id/utilizator404/recommended/113400/","utilizator404","420 NoScope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/utilizator404/","167 products in account","After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.\n\nApb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)\n\nSo what are these fundamental game design flaws?\n\nMap designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.\n\nMission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams.\n\nAlmost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.\n\nTheres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.\n\nNo one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.\n\nThey will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.\n\nI also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.\n\nIf you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.\n\nIf all of this wasnt enough, G1" is "working hard" to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the "car surfer" character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.\n\nA car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.\n\ni also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.\n\nSo yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSerious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs.\nMaps designed for the wrong game.\nMissions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is.\nRude community, especially on the forums.\nCamping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions.\nThis game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind.\nBalance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.","August 19, 2014","false","189.6"," 1,265 of 1,487 people (85%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","85","265","1","93","48"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmight/recommended/113400/","vesmight","Vesmight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmight/","86 products in account","After two years of playing this game, I have finally come to a point in which I can review it in full for what it is. And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives.\n\nAPB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.\n\nAs a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.\n\nBack a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items.\n\nBut, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.\n\nThe combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.\n\nAll in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say "nah...". It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.\n\nGame Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.","April 11, 2014","false","264.9"," 752 of 886 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","752","886","0","44"

The only problems I have with the game is its toxic community (aside from some hand-picked few), the fact you have to pay for everything, and the graphics get worse each year.\nI still do come back to it to make some friend's custom symbols for when they ask. This game was great for what it was at the time. A F2P multiplayer Grand Theft Auto for the PC in which you can customize just about everything you ever wanted. But for the community and the company that hosts the game? I'd be taping a huge DO NOT CROSS banner on it if you're looking for a game to main. Play this game only if you have a bunch of friends to join in to kill time.\n\nThe game is great for what it delivers as a 2008 (or around that?) game.\n- You can lean around corners and you're allowed a wide-range of weaponry consisting of but not limited to: On-Impact Grenades, Light-weight Snipers, Rocket Launchers, IRL Paid-For Legendary Pistols that do better than any of the F2P rifles in the game (I'm looking at you Nano <3), half a brick, and even snowballs.\n- The Vehicle system is great allowing you to buy a bunch of epic looking cars that (for real life money) you can modify just like Need For Speed Underground with the body kits, car seats, dump valves, radio waves, and monkeys.\n- You can run around two different pretty big cityscapes ranging at 1k+ meters and traverse it the way you want by either running around or driving cars (or surfing on em).\n- It contains one of the best character and car customization systems out there, allowing you to make symbols by the use of manipulating random shapes/vectors and placing them on a vast amount of character clothing and vehicles.\n- You're also able to change the music people hear when you kill them, music that gets played out your car, and music that you can play in a portable stereo system. (Yes I know, its as epic as it seems)\n- And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.\n\nAll-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game. However you practically have to pay to get everything, otherwise have fun spending thousands of hours trying to unlock everything.\nAlso don't play this game if you get mad really easily, that's my final word on this.","June 27, 2015","false","787.2"," 494 of 579 people (85%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","85","494","579","100","23"

We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nOne team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.\n\nAt that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.\n\nWe respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all  in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.\n\nMy passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.\n\nThe two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.\n\nJust as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.\n\nPeople came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.\n\nAn RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: "♥♥♥♥♥ n00b fa*gots".\n\nNeedless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.","February 8, 2015","false","124.0"," 784 of 947 people (83%) found this review helpful 1,162 people found this review funny","83","784","947","162","47"

There's just simply no other game that actually has a detailed character editor that lets you put custom symbols on your character/character's clothing. Symbol and car customization are pretty weak on the other hand, due to the high limitations of the editor (Up to 100 layers for a symbol, annoying customization bar for cars doesn't let you place more than a couple of complex symbols without preventing you from saving). However, to get the most out of the editors, you'd have to buy premium otherwise your customization options are extremely limited (25 Layers for a symbol/3 symbols for clothes and character/7 symbols for cars). Also, a good amount of clothing options are locked away unless you pay a certain amount of money for them (Some things cannot be bought seperately and requires you to buy things in packs that can go up to 2099 G1C/US$26 because it includes a 30 day gun).\n\nAPB's gameplay is horrid. Most of the weapons work most effectively in one area but work poorly in other areas, which means you'll be spending half the match switching guns(which takes forever because you'll have to firstly go to an inventory area, then click a bunch of things to change your weapon, then wait to restock the weapon's ammo completely) to suit the situation that you're in, The driving has input lag for people with high ping, and most of the cars drive like their on ice (skidding everywhere and poor traction), The matchmaking is completely horrid, APB uses a "threat" system for matchmaking to show a player's skill. In late 2011, the threat system was changed from 30 threat levels(Bronze 1-10, Silver 1-10, Gold 1-10) to 4 threat levels(Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold). With the new threat system, it just throws in random people of different threats and gives the losing team the option of backup (Example[i.imgur.com]), which means that missions will normally always be one-sided. There's also not that much to do in the game, the only game types you can play are missions, fight club, and social. Missions are normally 4v4 objective based matches that lets you level your character's rating level up that takes place in different parts of the map, Fight club is a fixed section of a map (Waterfront's Baylan Shipping/Asylum (Beacon was removed for some odd reason)) that's more focused around killing people instead of doing objectives, social is where you go to customize things/use the marketplace/go AFK for no reason. The missions are really repetitive, mostly either involving you defending an area, or go to a place and press the action button, the placement for objectives is another thing that causes missions to be one-sided, as objectives can sometimes spawn in easy camp spots.\n\nOne of the things I dislike about APB the most is the cash shop. Before anyone makes assumptions, No, the cash shop guns are not overpowered, as a sheer amount of the cash shop guns are just re-meshes of a gun that's available for free. Most of the things in the cash shop will cost you a lot of money, with prices going up to US$50+ just for a pack containing one car with kits, one outfit and one gun for one character. The cash shop even goes to selling ludicrous items such as a "friends and ignore list extender" which adds 50 capacity to your in-game friends/ignore list for a hefty US$12.5. Sure, the devs have added a F2Per's option for obtaining cash shop items via the Joker Store, but the prices are pretty expensive. It will cost you 1000 Joker Tickets to buy a 3 slot cash shop gun for 7 days. However, the maximum amount of Joker Tickets anyone can earn within a week is around 1000, which means you will have no Joker Tickets to spend if you want to save up for something neat on the Joker Store.\n\nOver the years that I've been playing this game(even though I left the game between mid 2012-late 2013), this game hasn't gotten any better. Sure, you might say that the new anti-cheat(Fair Fight) is pretty cool, right? But then, Gamersfirst began to unban people off the ban list and straight up silencing people who bring up the matter(Read more here[social-district.com]).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyc/recommended/113400/","kyc","Xander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyc/","76 products in account","APB Reloaded is an interesting type of creature. On one hand it is a brilliant way to spend time with your mates and have a laugh, and on the other hand it is annoying beyond belief.\n\nAPB Reloaded is Cops vs Criminals taken to a much larger scale. 100 people (50 Enforcers vs 50 Criminals) are in one instance of part of a city. By no means is it as large as Grand Theft Auto's expansive worlds. The city isn't too convincing either, as the AI is nothing to be proud of. The driving AI is horrendous, like, horrendous. If their path is blocked by a car in the middle of the road, one would assume that they would pass it. No. They stay there, waiting. This leads to queues of AI Cars. The AI out of the car is not too pleasing either.\n\nThe cars in this game handle as if they are on ice. Many of the cars slip and slide across the road with little control. This can prove a challenge to overcome at first.\n\nThe starting guns in APB Reloaded, the 'STAR 556' and 'Obeya FBW' are good enough for those who are starting up in APB Reloaded. However, the others guns within the game are more powerful that the starting weapons, so this proves an unfair advantage against the beginner.\n\nThe game works around a system of in-game purchases. After completing a mission you are given Cash. Cash can be used to rent guns, buy outfits, buy cars, customise the look of your character/cars and so on. The cost of a relatively good weapon is around 5-8 mission's worth of Cash. Missions tend to take from 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. So around 2 hours work will get you a new gun for one week. After the week expires, the gun is removed from your inventory. If you wish to buy a permanent gun you have to get one through the Armas Marketplace. G1C, otherwise known GamerFirst Credits must be bought through real life money. The guns that can be bought through the Marketplace are high end and pack a definite punch. Some guns on the Marketplace can be trialled for one hour to give you a taster before purchase. The system works well, when it isn't against you.\n\nThe matchmaking system in APB Reloaded is dependant upon your Threat Level. Depending on your ability, you will be graded from bad to good, Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold. You may be teamed up with a Bronze fighting a Silver, or a Silver against a Gold. It sounds as if it could not go wrong. But unfortunately, the system does not factor in what guns the user is currently using at the time. Two Bronzes might have bought weapons from the Armas Marketplace and a Silver is using the stock weapons. It doesn't work.\n\nAnother major flaw with this game is the amount of hackers that are within the game. Since the game is using the PunkBuster Online Countermeasures, the game tends to contain a fair amount of hackers. This ruins the experience for a new player, and possibly puts them off APB Reloaded.\n\nOverall, APB Reloaded is a mixed bag of fun and straight up annoyance. Just make sure that you play with mates, or else this will prove to be more of a chore to play than fun.","November 25, 2013","true","73.0"," 748 of 957 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","748","957","0","16"

After watching it "evolve" over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading.\n-   Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players)\n-   Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves.\n-   Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws.\n-   They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill.\n-   The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols.\n-   Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game.\n-   Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons.\n-   Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort.\n-   Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making "improvements" slow to never fix issues and glitches.\n\nOverall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10\n\n**update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement..\n\nI WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!","October 13, 2014","false","680.0"," 401 of 512 people (78%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","78","401","512","17","30"

On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures.\nA decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.\n\n\n\nThe BAD:\n\nIts really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...\n\n\nThe FRIGGIN' UGLY:\n\nOf course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either...\n\nA) someone is having money trouble\nB) Cash cow circle jerk\n\nThis game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t go look...\nAll this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items.\n\nTHIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN. UNATTRACTIVE.\n\nThis was a major issue for me but other uglies include.\n\n-low pop\n-meh ranking system\n-has been almost the same since beta.\n\n\nTake it or leave it folks. Thumbs down but take a peak anyways. You might not care about the advert spam. Maybe its changed.","December 19, 2014","false","225.1"," 267 of 335 people (80%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","80","267","335","31","6"

I have quit, come back, quit, come back, etc. in a cycle that's really hard to break. Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.\n\nThe game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just ♥♥♥♥ing stop you can't.\n\nSome pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.\n\nThe cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs & GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.\n\nAs much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a ♥♥♥♥ and actually fix the damn thing.\n\nTL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.","May 10","false","552.7"," 116 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","91","116","128","24","10"

Elistist were few and in between, Game mechanics were nice, Customization was awesome.\nI tried picking it up again, hell, put 20 more hours into it, but I can't get past the Huge, absolutely Huge elitist base it has now. As a silver, it would make sense to be on a server that is meant for silvers (A silver server) and fight people at roughly my skill level, as that's how the rating system goes. However, Max Rank (255, I'm 96, takes about an 2-3 hours a rank) Gold players with over 2000 hours of playtime are your only constant enemies. They claim that they can't fill their own servers so they play on our silver, when they have a gold server dedicated to them, but In truth they just want to waste their lives away absolutely stomping anyone trying to enter the fanbase of this game.\nThe greatest curse is not the pernament weapon p2win, but it's the community devouring itself with inbalance of skill.\n\nIf you knew you would lose absolutely every single game, why would you bother staying in the game? That's this games motto. The Golds act like Jerks to everyone, with heavy elitist attitudes, and are unstoppable because they have 1000% (literally) more game time then you do. There's no reason to play or join into the game because you can not win no matter what you do. On top of that, They complain because the fanbase is dwindling in numbers (about 100-200 people on at once, which is very small,) and in that, they justify their mad stomping out of weaker, much less experienced players.\nThis game deserves to be condemned and shut down because of it's terrible Elistist structure.\n","June 1, 2015","false","217.4"," 197 of 242 people (81%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","81","197","242","17","10"

The reason being that new players have almost no chance of beating a good, long-term player and are forced to fight against them because of the small amount of new players and poor matchmaking.\n\nMany people complain about an "abundance" of hackers, I believe it is simply players that are too fast and familiar with the game for newbies. Doesn't mean it will be a good, fun or balanced experience though.\n\nThe gunplay is very fast and unbalanced and requires an itchy trigger finger, high situational awareness and map familiarity to win, so be warned, shooter conservationists.\n\nThe new weapons that are being released are typically only able to be purchased with real money. (You're talking $30 to $50 for a permanent, account-wide weapon.) These weapons are considered Pay-2-Win, although I find that every weapon is bad, until it is placed into the right hands. Especially shotguns.\n\nI believe the game only shines through it's beautiful customisation, allowing players to create amazing, intricate articles of clothing, cars and player models. People's creations in the game could even be seen as a form of art.\n\nHowever, despite this feature's potential, it simply asks too much from the real-life financial standpoint. Free-To-Play players are restricted to very small amounts of customisation and even people that spend stacks of cash on the game are forced to simplify their creations for inevitable reasons like hardware constraints and server storage limits.\n\nI do not recommend this game at all, unless you have LOTS of cash to splash and/or are feeling compelled to play it for whatever reason...

G1 has implemented some excellent and much needed changes, but so much has been broken in the process that I don't enjoy the game anymore. As I post this, server lag is worse than ever with rubber-banding ocurring every 5 minutes. Cheaters are still rampant and unchecked, and probably G1's biggest real-money customers to boot. New content that gets added is either nigh exclusive to max rank players or only on the ARMAS marketplace, meaning more casual players have no chance to even learn the strengths and weaknesses of new weapons. Let's not even mention how any semblance of gun balance went out the window as they kept pumping out more and more weapons to bloat the already full roles that the original content filled.\n\nI could go on and on. Sure, APB gave me some of the best gaming moments I've had. Sweet bloody victory ripped from the jaws of a thousand snarling hellhounds, friendships forged in the hottest flames known to man, hatred so pure it would make a sith lord weep. The underlying mechanics are what I search for now in other online shooters, and the customization is still unmatched to this day. But all that said, let this poor old dog die.

From RTW(Retail, which I picked up at around July 2010) to Now and later.\n(Excuse typo errors and any strange sentence combinations, fast typing and letters get mixed here and there and I really don't care enough after typing all of it to fix things) Deal with the fact I put a lot of time in the game, it just means my information is more backed then others.(oh man I'm boasting about it, now I'm uncredible)\n\nHere we go.\n\nFreemium! This game is heavily dependant on you paying for Premium to experience anything good, not like there's much to experience good cause really the only good thing about this game is the customization, but you need to unlock symbols (random mission reward that gets fewer and fewer the more you have) and the tutorial is terrible might I add so you'll get a lot of people making the experience that much more unpleasant.\n\nArmas is a mess of Limited Time items(as of this review), far too many that it's laughable of how much content is limited time only and just recycled to fill in voids of no new content. With the new dev people, it seems that content is more frequent at points, but how long that can last till they just sit around and bank it up with limited time offers and resells? Who can say? It's all Pay for crap anyway, including items already in the game when it sank back in Retail like, goggles, desert scarfs and some others. The Uniform Jacket(Javez wears it and he's a criminal so there's no excuse) is still ENFORCER restricted for no good reason.\n\nServer Performance(Not Client Framerate)\nHoly crap, the amount of problems you'll face is ridiculous, even the newer server hardware they're using isn't good at all for this type of game, you'll experience inconsistent handling with your car (due to handling being server side. Any spike, you will feel it and see cars smash into walls, people unable to control them as they exclaim in District chat "Jesus take the wheel".\nThe amount of hitreg issues you'll face(taking into account IT IS hitscan, the ol I aim at this and the shot is instant) the slightest amount of spread on your weapon can really screw you over from how wonky the game takes the your information. You'll face many inconsistencies in fire fights that accuracy is blatantly thrown out the window witbh the issues and you're better off squeezing.\n**You'll see people using HVR Scouts and jump shotting with it (Pin point accuracy while doing so) to avoid certain problems with how bad detection can be.**They removed jumpshotting apparently from vanilla scouts.\nMost people you will come to find out, will use full auto weapons(OCA, ACES, PMG, NTEC/CR5, Stock STARs and whatever new dumb gun there is) just to beat the awful hitscan system by firing as much as possible and not having the issues of shot registrations and bad bloom math from the game (ghost shots and magical bullets not hitting)\nI'll stop it there cause it's the biggest problem in the game(cause you're gonna have to deal with it to progress) and there's far too much to talk about relating to it but you can figure it out.\n\nFramerate\nIt's pretty on and off cause it's a bad version nof the Unreal Engine, your frames can drop for no reason so I'd suggest a FPS config even with decent hardware cause this game spits on it while not looking at all decent. They got rid of the pristine texture quality from RTW and a lot of the bloom to amke the game look more lively, to help "performance"(I'm just gonna assume server load cause it hasn't done ♥♥♥♥) AND lessen game size (which who the hell cares about 4-8 extra GBs anymore? There's games that are larger then this game and have less content in the grander scheme. More excuses.)\n\nGun Balance\nGun Superiority here is a big thing, expect to see the same weapons over and over dominating.\nFull autos and high damage weapons rule over others and that's that, there's nothing interesting to the weapons at all, they all feel terrible(bad sounds, generic recoil) and with the server performance it's just not fun playing at all when you feel like you're hitting people with marshmallows, and you're gonna have to do a lot of things in action districts just to enjoy the best side to it which is..\n\n~Customization~\nIt's great but not without it's own issues. Certain features aren't there like snaping angles and what not so you're gonna be moving your mouse slightly back and forth to get that perfect position as well as ugly jagged outlines and darkened ones making masking over things difficult if you aren't using black to mask over brighter colors on a black background. (Makes sense when you start doing it, don't worry about how I tried to word it, you'll find out if you get into it)\nTexture projection is really bad, certain items can just cut off something on your shirt when overlaying it, causing ugly outlines. (Wearing a blazer/bomber jacket over a designed shirt)\nYou HAVE to have Premium to enjoy customization cause there is a lot of restrictions if you want to make your own things. Use to be 5 layers free on clothing, and in CB they changed it to 3. ♥♥♥♥ knows why.\nTattoos are buggy, very...very... buggy. Some randomly duplicating, disappearing or just not layering properly. It's a nightmare once you're over 30 tattoos out of 50.\nYou'll remove a tattoo, but it'll really remove something COMPLETELY different when you leave the kiosk, then you'll have to re-add it and it's just a never-ending nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of your tattoo designs in one go to avoid most issues if you start removing tattoos.\nYou're gonna have to do missions to unlock most of the basic clothing you might like, and symbols (if you aren't buying them off armas.)\n\nArmas\nSome weird ♥♥♥♥ed up child of limited offers and high pricing.\nDO NOT buy weapons from Armas. NEVER do it, you can perform just as well with a stock weapon if you care enough to brave this game, and just to hopefulyl make them learn that pricing weapons that high(40-60 dollars sometimes) is stupid. Just stick to Premium, Clothes(they like doing stupid bundle ♥♥♥♥, be wary that jacks the price up), and Cars if you are going to put money into this dying game\n\nThat's all I really wanna put down, I got a lot to put off my chest about this disappointing game that I thought was gonna be great back in 2010.\nSummary\nThis game is terrible for a shooter, don't take it serious. Get points and if you lose, so what? You got standing and cash anyway, this isn't a game that has any rewarding skillful gameplay, you get your rewards and you progress to get what you want. Grindfest it up!\n\nThey tried to eliminate Idling the missions as much as possible, you'll have to do some work to get rewards, which means if you just get unlucky, and don't perform well, you might not even get anything cause that's how bad the system is.\n\nThe Community is a bunch of autism filled 4*channer kids who are all about the memes, that's all I really should put for those guys.\n\nHave fun?... Or don't. I'll be in Social District for most of my APB time if I ever launch the game again.\n\nI'd like to touch, this is not a competitive shooter game. There are dumbasses actually doing  clan scrims in a poorly done game. Team Fortress 2 deserves more of a competitive scene then this game.\n\nTL;DR: Game isn't good and probably won't be further on. There's no direction in where it's going. Gun Play, grinding progression is not fun, and in which it's basically pushing you to buy Premium to even go at a decent pace, which late tier contracts are just insanely inflated and slow.\n\nExample on Customization from a stream of me making someone an outfit -\nTwitch is dumb and removes stuff that's months old.","December 1, 2013","false","972.4"," 264 of 355 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","264","355","0","14"

The game was, and still is, full of potential that is intentionally not being maximized by a lackluster, underexperienced dev team that is simply greedy.\n\nThe mechanics function purely to benefit the only few solid loadouts in the game, no matter how you play you will be forced to use certain loadouts if you wish to compete with other players of high skill. (I'd really enjoy seeing any of the majority of the community utilize something like an OSCAR vs a Joker, which does its job better 10fold, provided both players are excellent at the game.)\n\nThe community is full of vile ♥♥♥♥♥. Since APB's release, if you stream you can expect this to happen in this order. Stream > Streamsniped > DDoSed > If you react, enjoy being stalked no matter where you go. The game hosts not only unscrupulous individuals, but also developers. Developers that would much rather help their friends rather than do something for the benefit of the game or talk to cheaters on steam on a regular basis. In the past, I can think of Neume claiming "cheaters are customers" and resulting in another developer quitting. I can think of two developers that said the other employees did not foster a good working environment and had questionable design decisions. I can think of the fact  that support replies to all tickets with scripted replies, you will not get a serious answer and if your ticket category is deemed questionable you can be replied to with something that is completely irrelevant to your ticket. That support team fostered older devs, such as Revoemag, or Jericho, who spoke to players directly and they became biased with how they handled those players and those players recieved special treatment.\n\nThe GMs the game has have always been questionable. There are a few videos of GMs running around using things such as invisibility during player missions, GM's banning players such as Sluttles and Argan and a few others for beating their friend in the arena mode, Fightclub who were then forced to go to support, which had no reply, and the only way to actually get them proper support was for the people receiving special treatment to bombard the developers with steam and forum PMs. This has happened many times, hell Shini recieved a 3-day ban for inquiring about an ARMAS purchase he didn't recieve so they could "investigate his account".\n\nTo prevent myself from going on any further, ill just sum up my issues with the game.\nVile community\nUnsupportive producers and development team\nQuestionable design decisions and lack of any truly produced content (95% of all the content they have released was content that was stripped from RTW's version of the game.)\nPoorly optimized\nGreedy producers and development team\n\nHell, this could go on for hours with examples and just listing SUMMARIES of my issues. I legitimately regret every hour I spent on this game and any smart player would quit and attempt to get their money back.\n\n","February 17, 2014","false","610.0"," 169 of 220 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","169","220","0","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/recommended/113400/","Laisaniah","Fruitbowl M.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/","154 products in account","To help you put things in perspective, I came from a VERY long hiatus. In fact, back then I played it outside of Steam before I did the 'change' over to Steam's installation.\nBut now, in what I call a flurry of foolishness, I decided today to give the game another whack.\n\nThis is the point where you insert an audible 'sigh'.\n\nAPB: Reloaded, in it's early days, started off well enough. In fact, I'll go as far as to say I bought a shotgun from their Armas store (not even a great one...) which should be indicative of the hopes I had for it.\n\nAPB, simply put, pits you as either a Cop or a Crook. Crooks make money by commiting crimes such as crash-robbing store fronts, robbing pedestrians, doing missions... Well, their main source of income is mainly robbing storefronts. Crash a car in and get away with what pops out.\nCops, well... All they can do is do missions or try and spot anyone committing a crime and then busting their chops for it. Any loot is returned to the evidence locker, which basically is as imbalanced as it sounds in terms of methods of profit.\n\nIn it's base concept, this sounds like a great idea for a game. The execution is fairly okay too, but there are some snags and other things that collectively ruin the game as a whole.\n\n- I'm just going to kick in the door with the biggest sin: GamersFirst has a serious pest problem, in the shape of so-called 'Hackers'. Calling it Aimbotting is probably specific enough and self-explanatory. It was a pest when I left, and it was a pest within the first ten minutes of actual combat when I came back.\n\nThere's always going to be that controversial argument of 'maybe they're just really that good'. This might be a viable stance to take. But mind you, I've endured Aimbotting for an extended period in APB before I finally said goodbye to it. These Aimbotters may attempt to 'simulate' some more realistic response times. But let me tell you this: Back in those earlier days, I had someone admit he was using an Aimbot hack, which gave me a solid benchmark that allowed me to compare my previous experiences.\n\nI have gotten a very solid impression of it, as well as an expertise to recognize Aimbotting and there was no doubt in my mind that in the brief period I played again, I was being subjected to it. GamersFirst has always claimed to come down hard on these things. But if they can't solve this problem within the two years that I left, then they seriously need to rethink of using a different anti-hack shield. Because it's the same one, and it really isn't working out for them. At this point, I even wonder if G1 cares anymore.\n\n- The second controversial topic is the well-worn Pay-2-Win one. Funnily enough, if this game sins to this, it might be to a minor but still existing level. The Armas store has a range of special (and expensive) weapons for sale that for the most part have an improvement or exceptional trait over their regular counterpart.\nAt first glance, these improvements seem minor. But when you get to know the 'standard' weapons, you'll understand that the improved version actually greatly counteracts the shortcomings the regular weapon has. For example, the SMG is a pretty great weapon that is only halted by it's short range. The equivalent that you can find in the Armas store has extended range.\nThe changes are subtle and you won't really notice them until you are familiar with the weapon and have bothered to put 'two and two together'.\n\nNot to mention that the Vehicles generally are very souped up in speed (even with a lot of weight in the car) and have either a series of useful mods installed or all mod slots unlocked. Either of which would require you to spend ginormous amounts of in-game currency AND level your character near maximum. If already possible with some vehicles.\n\n- The 'normal' weaponry is a bit of a nuisance itself. More primarily in the way that you 'own' these. Now, APB isn't the first to 'rent' their guns and certainly won't be the last. But so far, this game is the only one that insists on only renting these for a set period of 10 days. No more, no less. You can't rent it for one day, or for one month. The only upside  is that, in case of a rented weapon that has mods slotted in, you can simply 're-rent' it. Certainly isn't a redeeming factor, though.\n\n- When it comes to missions, they will seem fine to the naked eye. Every 'mission' has a certain structure of stages to it. But the weakness in these lies in it's exploitations. There are two big examples of this.\n\nSome missions end with a 'tug of war'. Everyone's position will show up in the HUD, and you need to constantly kill the opposing team's members to advance your 'pull'. Sadly, what has become common practise is that one team gets the advantage of even just 1 point, and then flees altogether. Going far enough so there is no way the opposing team can catch up and try and even the score. Allowing the aforementioned team to win by time-out. This is an extremely cheap way to gain victory and sadly has been practised by both Cops and Crooks. Especially since... well, if they'll do it, why shouldn't you?\n\nThe VIP ending is a touch worse. One member of one team becomes the 'VIP', which the opposing team has to assassinate. What common practice has become here is that there are set locations on the map where you can perfectly bunker down or 'camp' where the VIP can hide and all the defending team members have perfect defensive locations. Making it an impossible task for the opposing team to win.\n\nThese are exploits that have been around for quite some time. And while I skimmed the changelog of APB's update blog, I have no reason to believe this has changed. GamersFirst does not have a reputation of listening to it's playerbase.\n\n- And as a final complaint... the fact that there's a serious lack of new content. The only difference I saw between now and two years ago is that every weapon now has a set of unlockable or purchaseable 'skins'.\nIn fact, one of the other changes is a detriment. The 'Fight Club' serves are now locked to certain requirements, such as achieving rank in this and that. Funnily enough, I actually achieved these ranks long before I left APB, but apparently the game does not consider these as valid any more.\n\n\nThe bottom line is, APB is an IP that was bought over by GamersFirst to be turned into APB: Reloaded. It became Free To Play, but in return became a straight cash in through it's cash shop. Everything ties in with laying down more cash. Why just spend money in the Armas store if you can get a discount for being Premium? Why rent guns with in game currency if you can permanently have them for the price of three Indy Game titles!? (yes, the earlier mentioned shotgun actually set me back 12 Euros. The prices may have changed now, but that doesn't change much)\n\nGamersFirst has one heck of a PR Team to make us believe that they are still actively developing this game and making significant updates. But realistically speaking, all this game updates anymore is the guarantee the Armas store works and you are still encouraged to buy some Premium time.\n\nPlease, I ask you: Don't play this game for a serious experience. And if you still play it, be it to have some stupid fun with friends (which is a perfectly viable reason), then don't purchase anything from the Cash Shop. The prices don't add up to what you'll receive, and it only helps fund this atrocity of a business plan behind this game.\n\nIf anything, it's slow death should only be hastened.\nAnother great game, ruined by corporate greed and short-sightedness.","March 20, 2014","false","9.6"," 182 of 243 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","182","243","0","0"

I played this game with a very casual attitude but over time it becomes less and less fun for several reasons\n\nThe biggest reason of this is a mixture of bad game design and the community. Often enough you just see players abusing every aspect of the game to get an advantage. Some of them can be very hostile and unfriendly as well.\n\nThe biggest problem in terms of the game itself is the matchmaking. People are seperated into 4 different threat Levels, Gold, Silver, Bronze and Green. There are several instances for each threat level to play in. Each threat level is allowed to go into instances one level below their own level which results in the fact that Gold instances are almost always empty, becasue all gold players decide to go to the silver instances.\n\nThe distribution of threat levels is set so that the top 20% of players are given the gold status, but becasue inactive accounts aren't taken out of the equation (which means that every silver that quits this game out of frustration is still counted towards the silver group) it rather feels like 70% of people are gold, menaning the being a gold status is easy to achieve.\n\nThis results in the fact that average and casual players that turn gold are deemed to play against the super pros in this game a lot of times, giving them an experience of this game that is not fun at all. I might seem to you like a good player when you look at the time I played, but I was mostly on the border between silver and gold, meaning that as long as I play in silver instances I have to play a lot against people I don't stand much chances against. Since it is not that obvious for new silver players how enter a bronze instance they will most likely end up being put in the silver districts as well and end up being farmed a lot.\n\nWith this game being free to play there's not much wrong with giving it a try, but don't expect too much of a pleasant experience. I seems like a game with a lot of potential, but doesn't live up to much of it.","July 6, 2015","false","862.6"," 131 of 168 people (78%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","78","131","168","14","2"

I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game.  For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..\n\nBad things after the change:\n-Good palyers have become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...)\n-The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..)\n-The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...)\n-The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year..\n-Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..\n\nGood thing i can still say:\n-One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart.\n-Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.\n\nThere are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible.

There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks.\n-The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence. It's depicted so well on the criminal's gear, wild and more punk looking. The Enforcers however, look very rough and beaten, but very strong.\n\nCons:\n-Connectivity issues are a huge problem when it comes to their servers. Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning.\n-Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers.\n-The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter "T" next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away.\n-Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers. I have a fully decked out character after spending $40 in the marketplace because everything is so overpriced. Overpriced weapons for overpowered players.\n\nI really wish I could reccomend, but finally, I cannot because of the frustrating issues that this game not only displays as "learning the ropes and playing with a great community" but disagrees and actually begins to kick new players from parties who say anything bad about the community or the game.","May 12, 2014","false","78.2"," 106 of 132 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","106","132","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryuwex/recommended/113400/","ryuwex","#/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryuwex/","227 products in account","UPDATE: More ARMAS crap added, still no news about the engine update and console ports, playerbase is declining.\n\nI've been playing this game for a while as my playtime suggests. Started it like 4 years ago, and kept me around for 3 years.\nNowdays i just keep checking out if it had any mentionable updates, or something that would make me play it again...and as you have guessed, it doesn't have any.\n\nThis was a relatively good Free to Play game that i could enjoy back in the day. Great concept, mediocre execution, still fun.\nThe problem is that the devs just don't care about it at all. There hasn't been anything new added to this game in the last 2 years other than ARMAS weapons, cars and skins (ARMAS is the marketplace of items being sold for real money, and everything is ridicilously expensive) No new contacts, no new unlockables, no new maps, missions, nothing.\nThey said it's hard to make new stuff with the current engine, so they are going to update to Unreal Engine 3.5, that will make it easier to update the game with new content. This was announced like 2 years ago. Since then, all we saw are a few screenshots of Social District, and a shorter video of it with a bit higher foilage density.\nThey promised the engine update and console release for last summer. Then they said the update will be available this summer. Now there are rumors about prioritizing the console versions first, than they'll port it back to PC with the new engine. That will be a beautiful result, i'm sure. Especially when looking at the past failures the devs and the publisher has made with updates, patches, etc.\n\nThe clientside perfomance is terrible since the game has been released, the servers are sometimes working properly, sometimes a complete mess.\n\nMatchmaking is non-existent, the few newbies who want to give a chance to this game will get put into mission against full-ranked gold players in premade groups whom are using Teamspeak. The missions themselves are seriously unbalanced most of the time, not just because of the garbage matchmaking, but the locations of objectives, their placement, etc are seriously flawed. Perfect example would be the Financial district's "Auschwitz", aka Ferjando Shipping, a building complex with a seperate rooftop, that has only ONE way to it, but overlooks the whole courtyard and the other rooftops, so basically if the defense get there, (and they know the place) it's instawin most of the time. Other great example comes to mind is planting bugs on telephone booths in the middle of the street, with line of sight spawns.\n\nThe weapons are mostly balanced. The most viable weapons, which are really powerful can be achieved/rented for ingame money, like the STAR (G36C), PMG (UZI), HVR (Sniper Rifle), OBIR (3-burst mid-to-long range weapon) Back in the day it felt straight-up P2W (when nano -aka Tec9- first came out, or the Scout that did the same damage as the heavy sniper rifle, but you could sprint with it as well), now it's a lot better. There are still some anomalies, like the ATAC rifle, that can basically beat everything up to midrange, or the DMR, which has two versions: the "free" for ingame money, and the item shop one, which is basically the same, only it does way more damage against cars. So technically it's P2W compared to it's free version, but it's not a really viable weapon even with this little buff. Majority of the item-shop weapons are just reskins of what's available for ingame money. Some of them are from crates called Joker Mystery Boxes, and players can trade/market this type of guns between themselves. And last, there is a special currency called Joker Tickets, which can be achieved by completing certain goals/events in the game, and they can be used to rent some item-shop weapons for 7 days.\n\nThe community is a cesspit, one of the most toxic ones i've ever seen. People will constantly complain, swear, rage-message, tbag every time they manage to get a kill, streamers getting streamsniped and almost everyone generally uses every kind of shorcuts they can to get an advantage. Some examples for this;\n- Item hold mission, basically a capture the briefcase. The map is never limited to some smaller segments, so people can still move around at the whole district while playing. Sometimes they just grab the case, and start running away with a car. As a lowrank, you have no carsurf, no explosives, nothing, except a crappy light machine gun that may or may not help you stop them. If they are highranks with said equipment, it's instawin for them.\n- Deatmatch mission. One team has to reach certain number of kills to win. They get the lead, and run away. See above for the other details.\n- During missions, even if they can't shoot you, all the other players in the district still can interact with you, see you, make contact with your car, etc. Some might just block entrances, objectives, ladders with a car, to help the other team, or simply out of boredom. Or they can follow you around and give out informations about your and your teammates' positions to their friends/clanmates. Seen this crap several times as well.\n\nIt's been stagnating for years, and i don't see how it would get any better in the future, so i can only recommend this to the masochistic, experimental type of people, or for those who are seriously bored.","October 23, 2015","false","845.7"," 77 of 92 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","77","92","7","0"

I know what I'm talking about. I have about 400 hours on my main steam account followed by about 1000-1200 on my G1 Launcher account. A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately\n\nThe Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game\n\n- The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined.\nI'm just speechless.\n\n- Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers\n" The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer " -  a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer\n\n- The last 15 ♥♥♥♥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update\n\n- I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're ♥♥♥♥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the ♥♥♥♥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.\n\n- Corrupt developers. Proof : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrxikKHAe8\n\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization, however most mid- high spec computers wont have problems ONLY because this game is old.. no other reason. the code is an absoulute disaster.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrJ0qw3mDDc\n\n- No updates\n\n- Graphics have progressively gotten worse since 2010. They were a bit outdated in 2010, and here we are; 5 years later with even worse graphics then the outdated 2010 ones...\n\n- The most amature developers who break something while trying to fix another\n\n- No events. The few " events " are absoulute crap and I wouldn't even consider them to be events.\n\n- Hackers. Even with Punkbuster and Fairfight, Punkbuster has not detected new / recoded cheats for a good 2 years now  unless it has been detected since then on and not updated. Punkbuster NEEDS to go and has GOT to be replaced by VAC or BE. Fairfight on the other hand.. it's a bit controversal and I'm still on the fence about it. Some people claim they need to turn it up and start banning more, but then they complain about too many legits getting banned. They do need to turn up what it takes to get flagged, especially against higher  ranked " edgy " players, but at the same time, they also need to be more careful with who they ban.\n\n- The servers :  Probably fixed now, but servers are sometimes laggy and crash. They had no DDoS Protection before and it was nothing short from nightmare. Every 15 minutes, the server would get DDoS'ed and crash. Absoulutly unplayable.\n\n- The population is declining ( For good reasons, this game just needs to die )\n\n- Grindy as ♥♥♥♥ after level 140\n\n- They can't properly balance guns even though the balance is OKAY\n\n- Too many broken promises. Been waiting for over 2 and a half years for an " engine " update and console release.. Let me break it to you.. this wont come around for ATLEAST another 12 months. Who knows where this game will be in 12 months? The community doesn't know for sure since we rely on G1 to tell us, and the truth is G1 has gotten their heads so far up their ♥♥♥ to even tell for themselves. Everything they'ved promised us has been broken. Hey G1 remeber about that racing district? LOL\n\n- G1's infamous money making startegy - Make an OP Gun and wait 8 months to nerf it after you made the big bucks. Then, a couple months down the road have a fair balanced game ( gun balance wise ) what it should have been in the beginning, but then you nerf the DECENT in game cash guns, and release an OP Armas real life cash gun. Rinse repeat rinse repeat etc\n\nThe pros :\n\n- The gameplay is admitedly fun. I like the mission objectives even though they are 90% of the time unbalanced, random, casual, and EXTREMELY repetitive.\n\n- Customization. So hard to explain how good this is.\n\n- Is not pay2win. I'm a bit skeptical about it since itt's grindy as hell, and I feel like theyre sorta leaning towards that direction since they have been releasing exclusive guns but it isn't that much of a big deal since theres only about 10 of them and the rest are reskins and they're not OP Other then the troublemaker which has been nerfed AFTER 8 MONTHS.\nIn my book, a game is pay2win if they offer you guns that aren't avaible with in game currency, but honestly this is an exception. this game is not pay2win.\n\nOverall this game is like a 4/10:\nIf it wasn't free, had bad customization, this game would easily be a 2/10.\nONLY Play this game if you yourself are a hacker looking for an easy game to hack or are willingly putting yourself up for a stroke. There is nothing good in this game other then the customization, which even if youre an artistic person, Please don't do it PLEASE. You'll be much happier drawing then putting up with the endless, frustrating grind to unlock decent customization without emptying your wallet. By emptying your wallet, I don't mean 20$, I mean 300-400$\n\n-Update 1/8/2016- I got banned until January 21st, 2016 because I POLITELY asked a GM twice if nudity symbols were allowed. The first time he ignored me, so I asked again and then he banned me saying he was going to give me time to think about spaming next time. He's very professional indeed; what makes him even better at his job is the fact that he was playing with a blatant aimbotting Shaw on his team ( 180 degrees snaps, never missing, 20-0 on his first game on that account ) and admit he knew he was 100% cheating, however told us to let FairFight handle it, and yet here we are 3 days later and he is still aimbotting unbanned.","November 17, 2015","false","203.9"," 71 of 83 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","71","83","9","0"

The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.\n\nMechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.\n\nThe matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.\n\nAPB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.\n\nThe Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.\n\nI personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.\n\n\n\n","January 1, 2014","false","074.0"," 89 of 112 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","89","112","0","3"

Low level players instantly against high level ones, over and over again, and level makes a difference in this game, both in skill and gear.\nBuggy gameplay, with bad shooting mechanics based around spread AND recoil, with few guns being able to perform more than one singular task.\nHorrible players who alternate between hacking, griefing, and acting like total tools to the rest of the community.\nAnd a game company managing it who doesn't know what the word manage means. Literally has let the game get worse and lag more and more over the past year and a half.

While it still retains a good feeling for the gunplay mechanics, the prevelance and overzealous pushing of the cash shop along with annoying players with "subscribe now!" advertisements tends to get in the way.\n\nOver time weapons have been tuned in such a way that significant advantages (especially in lower threat levels and ranks) are outright purchasable with real cash, and these aren't cheap. Permanent weapons can cost upwards of a full $40 if not more, but at least now they're able to be applied to all characters on an account for a premium.\n\nCheating is a very common problem these days, be it via hacks or gaming the threat/matchmaking system. With no real appropriate ladder, and the overwhelming amount of people who feel that if they aren't winning they aren't having fun; we find that more and more players will use every and any trick in the book and out of the book to win with illegitimate results.\n\nIf you can get over those issues though, and play APB:R without too much invested in  it with a few friends, you can have an absolute blast be it chasing down criminal players or resisting arrest from enforcers.\n\nThe question here is whether or not APB:R is good enough to warrant still being alive, and that's a debatable answer.","July 8, 2013","false","85.5"," 340 of 517 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","340","517","0","2"

I have never seen such a hateful community anywhere else which directly affects gameplay as you will find many people griefing your mission and other missions just for the fun of it for them. This is also why it is almost impossible to stream this game and have a remote amount of viewers, as many will target you for griefing.\n\nThe development behind the game is barely there, and they also do very shady practices. They falsely ban players with zero evidence of them cheating or the like, or simply ban them because they receive too many reports about the players without checking into their playstyle and seeing if they are good, or cheaters.\nGMs are non-existant, they are very few and very rarely around - even when they display themselves, they hardly do anything against blatant cheaters.\n\nThe development team has zero clue about the metagame, what should be fixed and what should not be fixed, along with pretending some things are not an issue - server issues being a particular subject they prefer to avoid.\n\n\nIf you have a severe case of masochism, it is worth trying out. I have played it for many hours, and I have an entire channel dedicated to the game on YouTube. If you want a game that is as new player hostile as Dwarf Fortress without one ounce of it's depth, this is it. This game breaks friendships faster than Mario Party 2.\n\nIf you want to play a third person shooter that's free to play and something to just calm down to, I would probably keep looking elsewhere.","December 14, 2013","false","914.1"," 169 of 247 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","169","247","0","12"

I played this game at least 300+ hours and have a 178 ranked character.\n\nNow, I have started playing this game a few years ago and I have always had troubles with it.\n\nIt is a game you really want to love but you can't and I will tell you now why.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n+ Character creation and customization\nThe game has an amazing character creation and plenty of customization options that I have yet to seen a better version in similar games.\n\n+ Cars\nThere are enough number of cars to keep the variety and they can be customized as well.\n\n+ Customization and personification\nThe game both in its character creation and car customization offers enough tools to create your own unique look in the game.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Lack of new content\nSince the time I started playing this game, it hasn't changed much at all.\nIt has basically only a few game modes that have stayed the way they are for a very very long time.\n\n- The story\nThe game does have a story at the beginning but it is non-existant through out the rest of the game. Of course you can't expect a rich story from this kind of a game but since it doesn't have much else to offer, it could be nice to at least have a story.\n\n- Server issues and lag\nThe game has been and still is barely playable with its sever issues and constant lags. It has suffered from these problems for a long period of time and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. This makes especially driving a horrible experience since they are server based.\n\n- Premium membership and cash shop\nThe game suffers from unbalanced premium weapons which are overpowered compared to in-game weapons.\n\n- Graphics\nThe graphics are not too bad and could be overlooked if the game had a solid gameplay and at its current state they look dated.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe game has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't do muchto explore the possibilities both in its gameplay and story. Apart from having an excellent character creation and customization, the game unfortunately doesn't have very much to offer with its repetitive gameplay.","June 20, 2014","false","15.6"," 78 of 110 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","78","110","0","1"

You come back hoping everything has changed and the game has gotten better over the past year or so, but all in all it's still just a bad game deep down inside. Bad analogy? Let me explain why.\n\nAPB: Reloaded is fun but extremely hard to get into due to the fact that when you start out you get paired with people WELL beyond your skill level, and not even the tutorial city can prepare you for the assraping you recieve once you get into a real server. Going into a Bronze server? Prepare to get rekt by recently upthreated Golds and on-the-border upthreating Silvers as you get called a noob and eventually booted for not knowing what to do. Sure, Golds are banned from Bronze threat servers, but the only thing they have to do is de-threat to silver and it'll be no time before they start pounding your innocent virgin pucker back to submission. The thing that really shines in the game, however, is customization. You can customize your character to your hearts content to make them look like the baddest flipping cop or the finest looking criminal, but unfortunately that's where the positives really end. Missions are tedious "capture the flag", "hold the point", and "team deathmatch" modes, weapons that are way too overpowered to be in the game are easilly obtained throughout the first few hours of the game, and "pay to win" elements are painfully obvious. Furthermore, the community and social aspects of the game are absolutely horrible. The only thing you'll see someone type most of the time in-game are either insults or hacking accusations, and most of the time your teammates will be doing solo kill runs while rarely focusing on objectives, inevitably resulting in loss, and consequentially, more rage. Compared to the last year, opposed from previous reviews by others, hacking has (almost) been abolished by Reloaded's new anti-cheat engine, named "FairFight". Whether hacks for the game still exist or not are unknown, but you'll rarely find a person using a script in the game nowadays, lest they get caught, publicly shamed, and banned by their automatic anti-cheat program.\n\nI've installed APB two times, and tried my hardest to get back into it. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but unless you've got some balls and a good trigger finger, or a team of friends backing you up, it's not worth the download. Overall, APB: Reloaded has not aged well since it's initial release.\n\nSummary:\n\nGameplay - 4/10\nCommunity - 1/10\nGraphics/Visuals - 7/10\nReplayability - 5/10\nImmersion - 4/10\n\nOverall: 4/10","October 4, 2014","false","116.4"," 117 of 174 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","117","174","11","0"

Where Realtime Worlds failed to deliver a perfect product, however, GamersFirst has slapped on a number of band-aids and made the best of a bad situation. And we thank them for it.\n\nThe main issues of APB Reloaded are in its very particular hardware requirements that will cause the game to hang and crash unless you can work around them - and the deplorable and oft-buggy implementation of the mostly useless PunkBuster service, which has a bad habit of kicking players for its inability to function without initializing services on your PC that often won't load, or can't be found. However, if you can power thorugh, find fixes for and look past the game's shortcomings, the game itself is a blast to play.\n\nThe game offers a small but well-designed pair of open-world combat maps wherein you are randomly assigned missions through their well-implemented matchmaking system and battle it out on the streets with handguns, shotguns, fully automatic weapons and much more in what is essentially games of "Capture the Flag," "King of the Hill," "Deathmatch" and many more orthodox PvP mainstays. You won't find a lot of new innovations in gameplay, but what the game does, it does well. Game balance is fine-tuned over many years of service, and more recently, it's far less common to see people using aimbots or hacking than it was even a year ago.\n\nThe game is at its most frustrating when you find yourself up against players who have, through microtransactions, secured weaponry or vehicles that are very difficult to acquire as a free player. At times, the game feels like a "Pay to Win" Freemium nightmare, but it still remains skill-based, and though the rich among us have an edge, a veteran TPS player will still find themselves winning as often as they lose. This said, those afraid of the Free-to-Play model, steer clear! This is not the game for you.\n\nThe shining point of APB is in its character customization. Peerless in multiplayer games, it allows astounding volume in character creation options, going beyond even facial generation and into custom-made personal decals on the abundant clothing options and tattoos, which you are able to project and position freely on your avatar. No two players look exactly alike, though there are a lot of less imaginitive people who prefer to make Marvel Superheroes or TV characters. And surprisingly, the game holds up graphically even today.\n\nIt is a flawed, but ultimately very fun game that you can easily spend hours on.","November 26, 2013","true","254.2"," 285 of 451 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","285","451","0","0"

It takes place in modern times more or less, in a city torn apart by criminals activity. You have the choice of playing as a Criminal (gang member) or Enforcer (law enforcement) and basically have to carry out missions depending on what type of character you're playing. Often you will have to team with other players and take out "enemies" as you carry out your mission.\n\nWhen you first play around with APB: R, it's actually kind of fun. It's like a lite version of GTA mixed in with a little Saints Row. As the action unfolds, San Paro's NPC citizens react to the action as it enfolds, sometimes crouching, screaming, diving for cover, or cursing, making the city come alive.\n\nYour experience As a newbie is pure chaos, frustration, and confusion. Go on the PvP missions and you will get blasted again and again and again relentlessly by extremely high level players or hackers/ cheaters. Slaughtered doesn't even begin to describe what happens.\n"Teaming" isn't at all like co-op, where you and a bunch of people interact and help each other out. Usually, it's more like a bunch of random people thrown together with no sense of teamwork who just "do their own thing" while carrying out a mission and ignoring you and other teammates. Ironically, while keeping silent throughout the entire mission, they'll suddenly grumble in chat about how much the team "sucked" after the mission is lost, and then angrily leave it. Team leaders will similarly keep quiet during gameplay and not give any guidance throughout, then kick newbies off their missions when things go wrong. But as for now. gamersfirst has fixed this and you no longer get kicked unless you have a demerit medal.\n\nExpect to be kicked/ abandoned during or after a mission a lot if you're a newbie. If you're not sensitive, you'll just become angered by the "kicking" because by being constantly dumped, you never gain enough experience to get better at the game or meet new friends who you can play with in the future. But if you're a sensitive player, the endless round of being dumped makes the game feel hostile.\nThe chaos is out of this world! You'll be on a mission minding your own business and suddenly a player who isn't part of your mission will just keep ramming the crap out of your vehicle over and over again or running you over. Sometimes even your own teammates will kill you by running you over with a car or shooting you for no reason.\n\nThis is exactly what the first few days for the newbie will be like-- slaughter, griefing, uncommunicative teammates, team leaders angrily kicking you off missions, teammates whining about how much their team "sucked, being abandoned by teammates during missions.\nRegardless of all that. when it comes to me. having a lot of friends in the game and enjoying every moment having fun while we're playing and laughing and ignoring all the bad in game community. it's all worth it.\n\nWhat else can you do in game rather than playing? Tons of thingies.\n\nIf you're a boy then you can be a "Girl" if you're a girl then you can be a "Boy" K-k-Kawaii-everybody wins.\n\nYou can stand 24 hours in a social district being busy or simply being afk all day.\n\nYou can be a business man or business woman and sell thingies.\n\nYou can be a designer and design thingies.\n\nYou can be creative and create thingies.\n\nOne of the best thing in this game is the Character customization. It's really great how possible you can get your in game character face to look like you in real life. which that is something people in game don't do much. usually similar/preset faces.\n\nOverall: As for 2014. The game is still getting even more better and will get a new solid engine and will get more content and more people to play this great game. Weather you're a veteran or new, make sure to give this game a chance and jump and enjoy the chaos.","November 30, 2014","true","565.1"," 142 of 226 people (63%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","63","142","226","22","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johncarver/recommended/113400/","johncarver","John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johncarver/","40 products in account","APB is a very...complicated game. Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and  maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.\n\nLet's weigh the Pro's and the Con's\n\nPro's:\n\n*The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.\n\n*The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.\n\n*The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena "Fight Club" mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.\n\n*The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.\n\n*The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa\n\n*There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.\n\n\nCon's:\n\n*The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the "low" settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.\n\n*The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.\n\n*One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as "Inconsistant." That's the bottomline.\n\n*Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.\n\n*There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the "Premium" system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.\n\n*The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.\n\n*The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your  level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.\n\n*The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.\n\n*Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a "TyroneFriedChicken" to muck it all up.\n\n*While the game likes to parade the idea of "FairFight" around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.\n\n\nIn closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely.

It's like driving in mud, turn two seconds before you want to turn and you will be fine.. well done there G1.\n-Sh*t load of hackers and triggerbotters. (Less since fairfight)\n-Pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most armas guns are reskins.\n-Bad graphics.\n-Bad optimization.\n-Matchmaking is complete sh*t.\n-Small development team and a very greedy one.\n-No new content since I started to play the game (2012).\n-Not very solo friendly.\n-Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer or spending hours of ram raiding.\n-Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population.\n-Combat is kind of sh*tty, hit the head or the legs, same damage.\n-Not really any new content announced for the future.\n\nBut overall I do love this game. Of course I wish it were better in so many ways. APB has so much potential but the developer are to blind and greedy to see and/or give a f*ck about it.

To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults.  No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight.  Still does too.\n\nFor now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.\n\nThe game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover.  There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it.  If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums.  There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program.  The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place.  OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process.  I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was "Gaming grade" unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R.  Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of "be what you cannot be" too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.\n\nPeople don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.\n\nThe game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker.  The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection.  The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control.  So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back.  The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as "Spray n pray" or "all out balls to the wall firefights" now, well now it's just depressing.\n\nThe game itself is the hacker...\nThis has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high.  I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get.  Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game.  Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!\n\nThe silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker...\nThis can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways.  However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is "take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community."  I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen.  Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails.  I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)\n\nThe company that handles APB:R aka "Reloaded Productions" or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking.  They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.\n\nThe base game though...\nThe game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect.  And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot!  Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on...\nNow if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to "fix" something.\nI cannot stress this enough...\nThe devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.\n\nThis game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system.\nAre you interested in playing the game?  Wait, just wait.\nDo i recomment you play the game?  Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine.\nIs this game worth it?  So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.\n\n@ Prιѕтιne™ and Crystal Castles: Thank you so much, I think you'll enjoy to know that this game is still playable, as a very elaborate VR Chat Program, and pretty much nothing more in its current state.","May 18","false","521.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","2"

I am afraid that it needs a new owner. It is stagnating. This is the type of game that relys on it's player base. Meaning that as numbers dwindle the problems are compounded. There is so much more that could be done with this system. We were promised an entirely new engine. Where is it? There seems to be no motivation with the executive powers to innovate and implement things people have been begging for. The districts only handle fifty players per faction. That may sound like a lot to some people but it isn't. This leads to all the complaints of the matchmaking system. There simply is not a large enough pool of players to choose from. If everyone were grouped up that means there would be about twelve groups of opposition that it could choose to pit you against. Chances are if they are grouped in the first place they have a decent amount of skill and threat if not extremely over-powering. I am afraid that G1 will wait too long to address the key issues and it will goto another publisher in shambles. Just like everyone else has said, there is amazing potential, but it is just being squandered. So many of us have fallen in love with this game only to become broken hearted and bitter over it. So much money piddled away on it. $$$$$$$$","January 11, 2015","true","743.3"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","28","40","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gehk/recommended/113400/","Gehk","Shudderfly Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gehk/","159 products in account","All Points bulletin: Reloaded was a game created by Realtime Worlds until they went under in 2010, and bought by Gamersfirst in 2011.  It has very many pros, yet cons that are very hard to look over. Let's review some of the bigger ones.\nPros:\n1 Very user friendly, doesnt try and complicate things more than it should. Shoot bad guys, do objectives, make money.\n2 INCREDIBLE amount of customization, it never stops amazing me the boundless amounts of effort you can put into the customization system, and the spectacular things these people create.\n3 It's very addictive. Once you start getting involved in this game, you really dont want to stop, it is a very rewarding game, saving up for that seventy thousand dollar car, then running over people without a care in it, is one of the many things that let you work hard, and feel good about it.\n4 The story is so well thought out. The universe of San Paro is a deep one, that you can spend hours reading along all the things the characters have to say to you, or all the lore about the city, and it's workings. No part of the story feels silly, or pointless. It's all very real in a sense.\n5 The way it pits you against players is very fine tuned, and well thought out. Seamlessly going from open world cruising to intense battles, and being able to see other players taking part in their own little missions.\n6 The banning system. You get banned if you break the code of conduct, and then it broadcasts to the entire game, to every single server, district, and player, that you've been banned, your name, and the server you play on. It's very nice seeing the occasional cheater get booted.\n\nNow, the Cons of APB!\n\n1 The playerbase is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. If you're not dealing with beatneck weaboos who wear cat ears, say "Rawr", and think they're the most Kawaii desu Planet earth has to offer, you're dealing with shartbucket tryhards who are treating this free to play game like it's their new religion.\n1.5 Furries. There are so many furries who play apb (Furries generally crowd around f2p's, most being poor and all) so if you don't like them, you'll get real upset, real fast. Usually, I don't mind furries at all, matter of fact, I like a good few. But the kind that I find in apb are usually 100% xenophobic transexual crazies who want to share their fetishes with the rest of the playerbase. And that gets old. You know who you are.\n2 It's very easy to be messed with. Either your teamates wont stop slaughtering you, or a bypasser driving a dump truck decides to push you up against a wall and blow you up. Making another player's day hell, even if they arent a part of your mission, is so, so easy.\n3 The combat can feel ♥♥♥♥ed. There's no fatigue system, so after someone sprints up to you with a fifty cal, gets a perfect shot on you three times, then sprints away, you start to see why stamina not effecting your aim is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥st\nAlot of the weapons, SMGS mostly, fire fast, do insane damage, and make all other guns humbled, while shotguns are unsatisfying and hard to master.\n4 There are no servers for people who speak other languages, you get tired of being put up with a bunch of latino gamers who dont speak a lick of basic english.\n5 The friend system is a bit odd, you dont send request, moreso you add someone to your list, then you can invite them to groups, whisper to them, and all that. But they cant do it to you, unless they add you to Their list. It's just odd.\n6 You'll start to run into the same clans, over and over again, and they wont get any less annoying, doesnt matter what faction, each has a few big ones that are downright irritating. For the Enforcers its WASP and HORNET, for the crims it's The Kriminal Kitty Kult, and Common Sense.\n\nBut overall? Do I like this game? Hell yes. Do I wish it were better in some aspects? HELL YES. Regardless of what I think, if you have the time, and patience to commit to something new, get it. You will not regret your desicion.

Whilst the ability to customise your character and vehicles along with themes and other things are very nice and have good variety, the controls for the vehicles are poor and tend to feel sluggish.\nOther problems that hinder it are poor mission opponent matching with it most often resulting in overpowered experienced people against newer, less well equipped people. This also is shown when a Gold Rank player is left to pay on a Bronze level server even when they should not be allowed to since they are far better skilled/equipped than what the server is designed for. Bronze should be for Bronze only, Silver for Silver and Gold for Gold so as to issue the best matching.\nAnother issue that is prevalent is the way characters ranking is scored, quite often I will go Gold Rank after having a good few rounds. However, this will put me against other gold rank people who are leagues ahead in equipment and skill and leave me feeling frustrated as I lose due to being put against an opponent that is clearly too high a skill level for my own skills.\nAlso seen whilst playing is the way the pay to play aspect causes imbalance in equipment levels. Whilst I do want to pay toward keeping such an interesting game alive, I feel it would be unfair to the other free to play players as I would then gain access to guns and equipment that are far better than anything F2P can access without having to grind multiple days worth of time to get close to having something similar. This is a clear example of Pay to Win.\nFinally, and most importantly, along with being the worst point against this game, there are just too many cheaters that uses hacks on this game, it's a well known issue but in the whole time playing this game, nothing has been done to stop it. Too often has it been the case I've gone to verse a team of criminals that quite clearly have players that are using hackers to boost there accuracy or take less damage when shot. This is quite obvious when you are two shot killed by a shotgun or pistol more than 100m from your opponent or open fire on said opponent first but discover that even after multiple direct hits they will kill you in three shots.\nOverall, a nice concept with some good ideas but poorly executed with too many bugs and hackers.","November 23, 2013","false","142.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glubbable/recommended/113400/","glubbable","Glubbable~ ❥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glubbable/","390 products in account","While this game does have its up and downs, probably the best part of this game is the customisation that can be achieved with the ingame editors, from recreating a certain song into a 5 second theme to making anime in the symbol editor. While the user generated content is amazing, the game does have a lot of downsides.\n\nFirst off lets go with the matchmaking system, first off, districts are broken down into threat levels, green being worst and gold being the best. The main issue with this is that the matchmaking is based on the threat level and doesn't take your rep level into consideration, which is actually the level you need to increase to be able to unlock and access better gear so in many cases during my playtime, I being a low leveled player have faced the hell fury of 200 plus repped golds using osmaw's and grenade launchers on people who are still fairly new to the game.\n\nAnother issue is certain cash shop guns, while none of them are that dramatically overpowered to be considered litterally pay2win (Like there's no sniper rifle that can kill someone at full health in one shot). Most of them will give an advantage over other players, such as a joker cr5 thats moddable from when you start playing to buying pre-made guns such as a whisper, although the beginning weapon known as a STAR by the community, was actually buffed or tweaked to make it not so useless.\n\nNow lets move on to bugs, like most f2p titles, a lot of bugs don't really get fixed until way later on in time, there are a few exploits in this game that allow players to get certain objectives stuck behind walls (This is common with capture the flag objectives) to players attempting to get out of the map (Mainly only in fight club). While those are exploits that players could abuse if they discovered them. There are also some bugs that will screw over your play experiance, such as random disconnects and crashes.\n\nI also do not recommend playing APB if you have less than 8GB RAM on your computer, this game loves to eat up memory, my guess is that APB reloaded loves to store texture memory within the RAM in order to allow fast loading, to be honest I doubt i'm right, but its my only guess as to why it'd hog up so much resources.\n\nAnd next off is the servers, laggy and litterally unstable, from horrible lag spikes when a district is full to litterally dropping client connections for no bloody reason what so ever, which is the main reason preventing me from playing the game propperly. Ontop of that is the slow and small patches applied to the game each week, while its good to finally see the game getting updates that were needed 6 months ago, this new movement by the devs to switch the games engine to a newer version of unreal 3 feels too late as the playerbase continues to decrease in size.\n\nBut I also forgot, punkpuster is litterally the worst anti-hack program I have ever seen, its just as bad as all those third-party or first-party anti-cheat rootkits most other MMOs force install onto your computer, it litterally doesn't do anything to stop hackers, the game has some pretty known active cheaters roaming around. Although personally imo, any anti-cheat tool that waits before banning doesn't work with any F2P title since these guys can just make new accounts every single time.\n\nOverall I feel APB reloaded does have the capability to be something amazing, I am willing to support the game aslong as the improvements continue, I just wish it was more than just 1 ltitle fix or one tweak every week, I also wish the servers wouldn't dc me constantly and I also wish new clothes packs didn't cost 40-50 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.","December 3, 2013","true","850.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

Recently I came back to APB because I remembered all the good times I used to have and all the fun it was. I launched it, I signed in, and I chose a district. It was good I felt all the nostalgic memories coming back to me and it felt good. Then I thought I should do a mission, I got into one and it started at this point I remember why I quit why I needed three new keyboards throughout one month and why I was such an angry gamer back then; this game just really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.The match making is bad, very bad, its real life counterpart would be a coach that coaches children to play football then there first game they go and compete in the NFL. The game is very much a pay to win, unless you feel like dedicating two years of your life to grinding levels by getting wrecked by the same players over and over again to get a gun that will change your 0.06% of a kill to a 1% of a kill, you’re going to have to pay about 100$ (but even then there is still some one that will have payed up more than you). The physics are not as bad as they could be but are still very bad. The game does not seem to think that cars, players, and other movable objects should be affected by gravity. The physics are the only thing in this game that is broken but because it is broken it is good and worth a couple laughs.\n\nLastly the pit of what very well could be the worst game ever created: GamersFirst. Their name is nothing but irony because that is the last thing they do, in fact there name should be MoneyFirst because it precisely what they live for. GamersFirst has owned APB for 5 years now I think, and in those 5 years what have they done?\nFix the game engine? No!\nFix matchmaking? No!\nUpdate game engine? No!\nImplement a better anti-cheat? No!\nFix servers? No!\nAdd new cars and weapons? Hell yes we have tons of those, but only for people that are willing to pay! GamersFirst have not added any free or upgraded content in the entire ownership in the game but instead will add content that is only those willing to pay 300$ for a new car. In fact the game is virtually the same game as it was when they bought it if you remove all the payed features.\n\nMy recommendation for this game? Don’t waste your time, instead go try a good free to play game like War Thunder, TF2, or War Frame. The worst part about it is the fact that for new players APB is quite addicting and if you start you have a good chance  to sink in a good hundred to buy you that shiny new thing you want, so just don’t even start.\n","October 24, 2015","false","293.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thial/recommended/113400/","Thial","Thial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thial/","32 products in account","Product received for free\n\nOk so this review will be based on my 2.5 year experience with APB.\n\nBasically it's a cops vs criminals open world game where 2 sides are facing each other during missions (you basically ready up while beind in the "out of mission mode" and you are being put in a mission with other random teammates or your premade group against some people from the opposite faction). You have a really wide selection of weapons and vehicles. You can even apply modifications to your character, weapons and vehicles. The game itself is great and the gameplay is really enjoyable after you become decent at the game. It contains lots of customization, you can change your character's appearance, you can create symbols and put them or your clothes or even on your body as tattoos, you can also design cars and get weapon skins, you can even compose your own songs and create death themes (people hear them when you kill them ;)). So basically you can customize to your heart's content. Overall one of the best games I've played so far and I will even risk saying that if APB was managed properly it could be as famous as CS:GO.\n\nBut then as a decent player let me tell you about the dark side of this game because I think that's what matters the most. The game is managed by a terrible company who is focusing only on getting sales on the in-game ARMAS Marketplace (yes you need to pay real money) the company promised us many many great features like improved match making or chat filtering or even the upgrade of a really outdated game engine. Years have passed and nothing has been done but yet new items on the marketplace such as clothing packs and usually overpowered broken weapons (which are of course being nerfed after the sales are dropping) are still appearing. Another really sad thing about this game is cheating. Yes the company added an anti-cheat called FairFight which was used in some other games as well and it was kind of working at the beginning but now the cheaters are going wild again. Some people still doubt if this anti-cheat really got implemented because of how poorly it works. This is a really competitive game so you need to spend years in it to be able to take down the top players and most of it depends on your dedication, skill and of course your gear, just like it is in CS:GO. While in CS:GO all that matters is your accuracy, ability to control the weapon and good awareness in APB accuracy and staying on the target at all times matters the most, there's no such thing as headshots or anything (one big hitbox) and people have more health than in CS:GO. People move really fast, they dodge to the sides, they camp the corners (you just need to overcome their chaotic movement and stay on the target). Back to the topic because the cheating is really really bad right now people tend to hackusate each other and that especially happens when you are a decent player (you will be getting tons of hackusations, you will be called names but it's kind of a good thing if that happens because you will know that you are improving and even though you are a legit player, other people are considering you a cheater) another bad part about cheating is that the game is free so even though someone gets banned, that person can just create a new account and keep playing. The game is basically full of toxic people, internet gangsters and kids but there are some nice people too. So now I should summarize. Really one of the best games I ever played, really solid mechanics, lots of customization and a really enjoyable gameplay (the con is that you need to spend an insane amount of time in it to become decent and be able to play on a decent level, most new players usually leave when they are getting stomped by old players but hey there are districts for players with lower skill level too, but even there you can encounter some smurfs from time to time),  the game is owned by a really greedy company that very very very rarely keeps it's promises and mainly focuses on getting more money. The last thing is a toxic unforgiving community which will ruin your mood within minutes if not seconds but if you are up to the task and you are not afraid to accept the challenge and sign the pact then its definitely a game for you ! ;) If you will dedicate lots of time to it and you will keep playing for months or years you will become decent at it and salty people won't be scary anymore ;)\n\nPros:\n\n+Great mechanics\n+Really enjoyable gameplay\n+Lots of customization\n+Big variety of weapons and vehicles\n+Big maps (districts)\n+Variety of missions\n\nCons:\n\n-As a new player you will need to dedicate months if not years to become somewhat decent\n-Game managed by a bad company\n-Toxic community\n-Cheaters\n-Unoptimized old engine (you will need a very decent CPU to avoid stuttering because APB doesn't use your GPU)\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥ lagging servers (sometimes)","May 13","true","492.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","2"

And did I mention that is just for one character? Not just that, but I've been playing this game since its Open Beta Phase during 2011, and that is even before it was released here in Steam.\n\n1. Background - The game was first released on June 2010 under the name "APB: All Points Bulletin", where in the game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto. During this time, the game was subscription based. But on November 2010, the developer has announced that the game will be shut down due to lack of development process, management focus, and the desire to make the game better. But on March 2011, the game was revived and sent to Closed Beta where 5,000 players were invited. Then it has been released on May 2011 to Open Beta.\n\n2. Graphics - The game is still using an old engine, therefore in its current state even if you can run Grand Theft Auto V on the highest settings, you're still going to face some stutters here. But the developers have announced a roadmap for this year, and it includes an engine upgrade.\n\n3. Content - Most of the contents are recycled, weapons re-skins are common, and some are just brought back to life from the old development. The team currently doesn't have anyone who can animate as well.\n\n4. Gameplay - I'll be honest, it may look like a Pay2Win game for those who are new to the game because of the weapons that can be bought from the in-game cash shop called Armas Marketplace. Other than that, the game also has a very steep learning curve. Yes, it is pretty easy to play the game but it's actually hard to be good at it. Most of the time you'll be thinking your oppositions are using aimbots or triggerbots. But if you give it time, learn the different uses of each weapons, techniques on how to take advantages of the situation, learn the different tactics to win, and etc., you will be more than rewarded. Because let me tell you, stock weapons can beat the hell out of this paid weapons.\n\n5. Customization - Given the old engine, some parts of the customization may hinder you from what you're trying to achieve. BUT! Never have I encountered a game like this, you can literally create any designs you have in mind. You have a shirt in your closet that you want your character to wear? No problem, you can! But the only catch here is... You have to be good at it. This is one of the reasons why I'm still playing this game, it's because I can be who I want my character to be.\n\nIf ever you're interested in checking out some of the clothes/outfits/vehicles I made you may check them out here.\n\n6. Micro-transactions - The only lifesaver this game has. The cash shop is pretty much expensive, why? You want a cool looking clothing pack that only consists of about 5 items, sure, just pay them 10$ for that. It even offers weapons that can be overpowered to those who are new.\n\nUpdate: They have released packs that includes tons of new items bundled into one. The pack actually costs 40$, but if  we're going to analyze the content, it's worth more than what they're asking.\n\n7. Conclusion - Even with my huge hours of playing this game, I also had some breaks. There are times that you just want to stop and get over it. But sooner or later, you'll find yourself searching for something to repalce this game. If you first thought that this is just another Grand Theft Auto clone, then you're wrong. I admit, at first that was also my first impression. Time goes by, I realized it is nowhere near it, it's a different breed of game.","July 19, 2015","true","069.4"," 68 of 118 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","68","118","5","3"

Definitely worth your time!\n\nI am a leader of a clan and i have 5 years of experience in this game. I make this review to proof to you that this game is worth your time.\n\n1) I never payed for this game, i'm gold for 3-4 years in a row now (In the first year i had a very bad pc and internet connection which was the reason me being bad mostly). I use free to play guns, mostly N-Hvr (Given or Bought with game money) and i'm winning against 85-90% of the players who are using guns they bought in shops for real money. Its true that i had some struggling moments at the beginning, but it was all worth it. Don't forget that i started 5 years ago... They made it more simple for starters now.\nI also want to inform you that there are many opportunities to earn real money (G1C) to buy stuff (guns, kits, ...) in the armas market for doing events which are explained to you in the forums of this game.\n\n2) The community in this game is awesome, i can't give it another word. In every game there will be som D**ks but that is inevitable, generally speaking, 8 to 10 of the people you will meet are very friendly.\n\nOther good points i experienced in this game;\n-Updating the game on regular basis\n-Good graphics.\n-Detailed character/car design capabilities\n-Can make nice music themes / songs\n-VERY good player support\n\nSome lesser points i experienced;\n-Some people out of your mission are preventing you from proceeding, keeping you from critical time (Happens rarely).\n-I myself do not have this problem, but some of my friends can't play the game cause of FPS lagg.\n-If your friend is silver and you are gold, it is highly possible you get 2 golden opponents matched against you (This is the only major problem in this game at this moment in my opinion). It is even possible that 3 golds are matched against 4 silvers. The 3 golds win easily cause they have more experience / team play. This is also the reason for the negative comments about people saying this game is p2w, which it isn't. The game itself is perfectly playable with f2p guns like i do. Its just the matching system which needs some more attention.\n\nHope this helped you :)\n\nP4wn - Enforcer- "Sharp" Leader - Patriot EU2","May 17, 2015","true","535.5"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","23","35","3","2"

On one hand it is a brilliant way to spend time with your mates and have a laugh, and on the other hand it is annoying beyond belief.\n\nAPB Reloaded is Cops vs Criminals taken to a much larger scale. 100 people (50 Enforcers vs 50 Criminals) are in one instance of part of a city. By no means is it as large as Grand Theft Auto's expansive worlds. The city isn't too convincing either, as the AI is nothing to be proud of. The driving AI is horrendous, like, horrendous. If their path is blocked by a car in the middle of the road, one would assume that they would pass it. No. They stay there, waiting. This leads to queues of AI Cars. The AI out of the car is not too pleasing either.\n\nThe cars in this game handle as if they are on ice. Many of the cars slip and slide across the road with little control. This can prove a challenge to overcome at first.\n\nThe starting guns in APB Reloaded, the 'STAR 556' and 'Obeya FBW' are good enough for those who are starting up in APB Reloaded. However, the others guns within the game are more powerful that the starting weapons, so this proves an unfair advantage against the beginner.\n\nThe game works around a system of in-game purchases. After completing a mission you are given Cash. Cash can be used to rent guns, buy outfits, buy cars, customise the look of your character/cars and so on. The cost of a relatively good weapon is around 5-8 mission's worth of Cash. Missions tend to take from 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. So around 2 hours work will get you a new gun for one week. After the week expires, the gun is removed from your inventory. If you wish to buy a permanent gun you have to get one through the Armas Marketplace. G1C, otherwise known GamerFirst Credits must be bought through real life money. The guns that can be bought through the Marketplace are high end and pack a definite punch. Some guns on the Marketplace can be trialled for one hour to give you a taster before purchase. The system works well, when it isn't against you.\n\nThe matchmaking system in APB Reloaded is dependant upon your Threat Level. Depending on your ability, you will be graded from bad to good, Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold. You may be teamed up with a Bronze fighting a Silver, or a Silver against a Gold. It sounds as if it could not go wrong. But unfortunately, the system does not factor in what guns the user is currently using at the time. Two Bronzes might have bought weapons from the Armas Marketplace and a Silver is using the stock weapons. It doesn't work.\n\nOverall, APB Reloaded is a mixed bag of fun and straight up annoyance. Just make sure that you play with mates, or else this will prove to be more of a chore to play than fun.","April 25, 2013","true","607.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","2"

After a while it gets repetitive with only 3 maps or called " Districts " in the game, Financial, Waterfront and Social. The driving mechanics is rather delayed and takes time to get use to. Customization is very diverse where you can make your own symbols that you can either put on your body as a tattoo, cars, and clothing. Gameplay is unbalanced and seems Pay2win. AI citizens are repasted around the districts and are dumb at sometimes. The two factions are the Enforcers and the Criminals, each faction have their own cars and contacts. Contacts don't have much peronality as they're just mindless AI characters with repetitive dialouge. Gun markets seem cheap, you can only buy them for a limited time for ingame currency.

It's just another Pay-To-Win grind-fest. You either shell out 30 bucks for a gun that probably isn't very good, or you play for weeks and weeks only to be able to buy some freaking shoes, or some other low-end customization thing.

The addition of new locations and the optimization of certain mechanics have certainly had the merit of making the experience more pleasant and multifaceted, and we must add that the outlay of real cash is absolutely not a requirement, especially not at the beginning They have high expectations and want to evaluate the product well. However a number of shortcomings is not insignificant relative to the controls, the feeling of weapons and, not least, the quality of the matchmaking and connection in general. It will therefore be interesting to see how and what APB Reloaded will be improved between now and a few months. As new beginning however, it is moderately encouraging.","May 1, 2015","true","88.9"," 37 of 64 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","37","64","4","2"

A criminal's limits of income is his fear of being witnessed by any enforcer.\n\nEnforcer: Pin down the Criminals as youre slowly stalking them, and as you see they get more and more dirty cash on them you witness them the last secound to take their loot and return it as edvidence for a big reward. As an enforcer youre not "allowed" to drive down neutral npcs nor destroy the enviroment such as a mailbox.\n\nThe Graphics: The graphical level of this game is also at its max, you can any time turn them down/off in case your computer sadly cannot run it fully, but everything in this game is beuatyful and highly detailed.\n\nWeapons: You will get a free permanent weapon called  STAR 556 its a lovely riffle, fully automatic and well balenced, as a secondary you get to carry the Obeya FBW, and there is two other ways of gaining new weapons by Leasing or Purchasing from ARMAS(APB:R shop) By leasing a weapon up to 7 days or use a (sadly) large sum of your money on some permanent weapons.\n\nVehicles:  This i cannot put down good enough but the cars are one of the most enjoyable features in this game! Theyre each very unique and offers a great pleasure as youre driving them around in San Paro, with a friend hanging out of the window or not :)\n\nEnviroment: In the streets of San Paro, you quickly figure out where to stay when youre ramming, or where to stay if youre mugging, and the same for enforcers, many enforcers have their little "route" they travel to see if anyone is witnessable (Means the criminal and enforcer get to battle for the dirty money). San Paro is a beuatyful city offering many wonderful places to visit, either youre at a dark alley runnning for your life, or at a contacts place having a blast.\n\nPVP!: This game is purely based on pvp, but not only do you need to focus on other players against you but also those who are with you because know what? FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON! :D that feature is out of our reach and we will have to deal with it, I am personally loving that feature as the game pushes you even further to take caution for your enviroment.\n\nOverall: This game is far beyond my belief of a good freemium game, but its balanced alot and well done! few for and against\n\n+PVP\n+Cars/Enviroment\n+Costumization\n+Wide amount of weapons be it leased or purchased.\n+Open world, freeroam\n+Balanced freemium gameplay, no-one is TOO overpowered *cough nano,colby,csg.*\n\n-Threat, once you reach gold, youre forced into suicide to regain your silver title. the reason i will put this here is. A gold can only join gold. but a silver can join silver AND gold, and bronze can join bronze silver and gold.\n-It can be boring to play alone, but as youre going into some missions you will be paired with others.\n\nLast thing i want to add is the community, it can be different from each day but MAINLY people are incredible, ive met a handful of people ive grown a care for. Thanks guys\nIf youre interested in playing with me as such make a Criminal on EU1 and join me :)\n\nI will rate this game a full 10/10\n\n\n","August 21, 2013","true","807.3"," 146 of 270 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","146","270","0","2"

The highs are very high, and the lows are very frequent.  This game is like heroin. Once you've played it for a while, it's very hard to quit.\n\nDespire what some people are saying cheating isn't as common as they say. Having spent 3000-3500 hours playing this game, I can say that from experience. There have been more than a few closets and quite a few blatants, that's true. But it's not nearly as bad as it seems. Most of the "cheaters" are people who've spent 1000+ hours and are in 3rd party VOIP (IE Mumble, TS, or Vent) communcating. I've been hackusated many times for things like that. As an experienced player you gain a sense of what your opponent is going to do, and if you react to what your instincs tell you, half the time you'll get a hackusation.  The game also has more than a few bugs. Sometimes you'll literally see players names through a wall for no apparent reason, Or a wall will simply not load immediately letting you see through it.\n\nWhile I'm not sure if I could recommend it to friends anymore, I definitely enjoy the game. The few friends I've tried to get into it have played about 20 missions and then quit because they ended up against premade teams that absolutely wreck them, over and over and over and over again.","March 6","true","818.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

Aiming always feels off, and you have to focus way too much on it if you want to kill someone far away or not injured at all. Missions in sandbox mode are not always fair since they could match you with someone 4 times your level. This game could've been great but the gameplay and controls are sketchy and cars suck too.

Apparently they erroneously banned over 2000 people when this happened. I got unbanned. Then got banned again the next day. Contacted G1; my support ticket was locked, I was banned from G1 forums after posting what happened, and all my accounts were locked. Over $100 down the drain, and my RTW character. Avoid this game. It had a time when it was good; that time is not now. Maybe when they upgrade to the next Unreal engine but besides that, avoid. Bad customer service, money hungry devs, rage-filled community, very PTW items and fair matchmaking does not exist. The Bronze Gold Silver tier matchmaking just doesn't work.

What is that idea? Make an online multiplayer game that somewhat seems to be based off of GTA. Does this idea work? I'd say it's a tad mix of both "yes" and "no".\n\nTo begin, you can choose from two "factions" and these are the criminals and the police. The criminals commit crimes and work together to cause as much chaos as possible. These can be as simple as stealing a car and ramming over many pedestrians or working together to rob stores and escape. Eventually, you will cause enough trouble and then you will become a target for the cops (who happen to be controlled by other players). While creating chaos can be fun, I found myself working alone and seeing many other criminal players doing the same thing. I hardly saw two criminals working together during my playtime. Being a target for the cops isn't much fun either as the main goal for the cops seemed to be just finding you and killing you. They don't try to arrest you or anything of the sort; they just chase you and bring you down with bullets. After you die, you just respawn and do it all over again. There are some sort of missions in the game but I wasn't given the slightest clue to where they were. I found a suitcase and was told to deliver it to some location but don't expect the map to get you anywhere as it wasn't much for help.\n\nAfter derping around with the criminal faction I played the cop faction. Problem is, I found difficulty in even finding my way out of the spawn area and, as stated before, the map isn't much for help. My best guess is that the cop faction patrols the city area and is given a list of target criminals to find and gun down.\n\nHere's a short list of pros and cons that include some points that were not covered:\n+ Vehicles handle differently in an appropiate manner\n+ Graphics look fairly good\n+ Creating chaos is enjoyable\n+ Fair amount of character and vehicle customization\n+ Basic free roaming is entertaining\n- Map is hard to deal with\n- Difficult to find missions\n- Little teamwork\n- Slight lag issues\n- Police only shoot down criminals\n- Community is known to be a little less than friendly\n\nEventually the confusion and constant deaths bored me and I can't recommend this game to anyone. It'll be nice to uninstall this game to make room for a more deserving one.","June 20, 2014","false","2.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","2"

If you try posting on the G1 forums they'll lock the thread and tell you to submit a support ticket, and if you submit a ticket, you'll get an automated-response that doesn't help you at all. The matchmaking is unbalanced, 9/10 times I get opposition that suck so bad they accuse me of hacking, apparently that isn't better than you will call you a hacker. There's a handful of exploits that people take advantage of. People will grief you constantly. There's only 4 maps total, 2 of them are pretty much just deathmatches. It's not pay2win but it the weapons are significantly better so in the right hands they can make a person unstoppable. There's a variety of missions but more or less repetitive.

So this is more of a reluctant unrecommended review. But anyways I'm pretty sure some other reviewer can fill you in better in the good stuff, so I think it's unecessary to talk about the areas where APB shines brightly with ease. So let me briefly cut to the chase.\n\nWhat I dislike about the game:\n\nMatchmaking is so bad it's laughable.\nIt's usually you or the opposition who is getting their arses kicked in the corner. A little less than occasionally there is a fair fight and well that's where the real thrill comes from it.\n\n"I knew it, i'm surrounded by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s." [Kudos to anyone who knows this quote]\nTrolls, Griefers, and Cheaters are pretty common around the servers.[Or perhaps i'm just unlucky?]\n\nGolden Cash-Cows\nIf you see someone with Gold Status, chances are they're premium wh**es armed to the teeth with premium guns, rocket launchers, and impossible superior accuracy[Hacker?].\n\nRidiculous Real Prices\n$50+ for your average/op virtual gun. $100+ for a friken tommygun. lol wut? I know that it's a free to play game, they have to get compensation, and I fully understand that. But ffs.\n\nThe small yet completely noticeable holes in customization\nWhile there are nearly limitless possibilites of customization in the game, little things like gender/faction only clothing is so ridiculous it's annoying. I mean seriously? They have licensed vigilanties protecting San Paro and exterminating "criminals" wielding automatics and rocket launchers, when it's CLEARLY the police and military's job, but a woman can't wear men-like clothing or look like a tomboy? One word, "Why?"\n\nWhat it says in the description.\n"Constantly evolving gameplay and events, with new content added regularly"\nNow that's a lie when I see one. Okay, yes they are in fact adding content, but really, it's usually just a small "fix", or some stupid limited-time weapons and customization items that nobody really knows or cares about. And I may not know much about the videogame developing world, but I think it would be very.....VERY wise to prioritise actually FIXING the game instead of just force feeding us this money grubbing bullsh*t. Now I don't care about the money grubbing because lets face it, everyone is unfortunately starting to it. F*cking Rockstar, is also doing it with it's stupid GTA: Online project. Oh yeah btw that reminds me, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THE HEISTS!? -sigh- The point is, fix your crap up FIRST, THEN advertise how greedy your company's wallet is.\n\nThe Publisher: Gamersf*ckingfirst\nThey're horrible at their job. Customer service is stupidly horrible, they are ALWAYS coming up with these annoying ideas of creating overpriced items and services to get your hard-earned money and let the rich little a-holes who pay, dominate us, and they just bring the cute little irony monster out with their cancer building name.\n\nIn conclusion?\nDespite the mentioned, I actually still suggest trying this game out if you're an experienced fps/3rdps or at least have a good aim. If you do not have any of these qualities, I still recommend trying APB: Reloaded out, the thing is what I have to say to you is that you should not expect too much and double check on what you're getting into.","June 11, 2014","false","318.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LETSREMOVEKEBAB/recommended/113400/","LETSREMOVEKEBAB","Dresden Decimator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LETSREMOVEKEBAB/","53 products in account","An extremely poor game, riddled with hackers and bugs. This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.\n\nTHE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.\n\nTHE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!\n\nVERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.","November 29, 2013","false","710.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiggerByte/recommended/113400/","BiggerByte","Rhigo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiggerByte/","353 products in account","After sinking alot of hours and money into this game I think I can review it. When I first started playing around 3 years ago it was great and I instantly fell in love with it, I spent money on G1C and made cars, clothing and bought guns and had fun designing different personas and because the customization is amazing you could make Miley Cyrus, make a tour van, get guns to suit her, make your theme when you kill someone her song and make your tour van blast out an entire song of hers. Or you could just make ♥♥♥♥♥ and hentai like 80% of people do there. The game in that sense is amazing but when it comes to combat it is still fun for the most part but has horrible matchmaking, hitboxes, ranking system. Lets say you are a Trainiee (The lowest rank and level 9) and you press K to ready up in a mission you will most likely get put against a Gold level 205 who has no fall damage, kevlar, fast car and a rocket launcher and that completely ruins the experience and they've even added a district with NO matchmaking so whoever presses K to enter a mission gets put with anyone and to me that seems like a cheap way to add stuff to the game without trying to fix anything and lets say you were to pull up next to your friend and run over his toe at 2mph he will die... INSTANTLY and that just makes the whole combat feel slow, broken and horrible.\n\nThere are three sets of money in this game, dollars, Joker Tickets and G1C, dollars are earned by selling on the ingame markey place, so cars and symbols, songs and themes and are earned by doing missions, killing people on bounty and such, its grindy to earn as a cop and ok to earn as a criminal as you can simply steal from stores on a low populated district and earn around 100k in a couple of hours but it gets broken by the fact that premium members who pay for membership get more money per mission and such and so the person whos talented at designing songs or symbols or who has the money to buy premium gets richer faster. Joker tickets are earned by completeling a set of objectives in Fight Club districts where its basically team deathmatch and you will get notifications like "Kill 5 people with granades" and you will get another after that and then you can earn Joker Tickets. These can be spent on getting temporary perks like car surfer to ride on cars or normally expensive weapons and cars, the next currency in the game is G1C this is real money in the Gamers First market place and its where the pay to win comes into play. You can either be like me and spend £350+ in the game and get 3 legendary weapons, alot and alot of cars, premium and symbols and stuff, or you can get lucky and buy a box for £4 and then get a legendary weapon worth millions in game but this marketplace is horrid, its all pay to win weapons and really makes the game not very fun to play when against someone with weapons from the store.\n\nCustomer Service from Gamers First is also horrible, I got banned about 2 years ago, maybe a year and a half ago for no reason, they said that I used an aimbot and such but i've never even downloaded one and after spending about £200 in the game at this point I was annoyed, I contacted them and explained my situation and even offered them to scan my PC using teamviewer or screenshots of my APB folders and game but they all said every time 'Theres nothing we can do, you are banned forever' and I gave up on the game and forgot about it for a month and tried to login and I was unbanned, so its very strange and I still dont have an explination for the ban to this day. Customer service hardly respond quickly and they always respond with an automated response, no real human so thats a massive dissapointment.\n\nThe missions consist of 'Capture this, deliver this, break this, steal this, deliver this, do this, go here' and you can do ALL of that, literally do ALL of that and then if your opposition has the better shot or gun you will lose the mission because at the end of EVERY mission it all comes down to who has the better car or gun. As a criminal you will most of the time be breaking into winwos and setting doors on fire to steal hard drives and deliver them, you can do ALL 5 set of missions before the end deathmatch and still lose the mission but if you are an enforcer and you stop the cirminal delivering the first hard drive congrats. You win. The missions you can for the most part live with but after a while they start repeating and get quickly boring so you'll find yourself in the Fight Club districts or the Asylum in team deathmatch just to spice things up or you'll find yourself in the very fun new dynamic missions that are present in the regular districts where they resemble the most recent Christmas event where you find a granade launcher and you need to kill 15 other players who try to kill you before delivering it to a contact, the granade launcher gives you buffed health and a buffed launcher.\n\nOverall this game is very fun at parts but very very annoying at times so if you can put up with the Pay to win, the small amount of hackers, the bad combat, the boring missions and the horrible customer support to play a game that resembles a bad GTA with AMAZING customization then this game is great. I can put up with it so I love it, its my favorite game of all time so far and it still is even though it has its flaws and faults I love it and theres rumors going around that G1C are making a new game engine with updated graphics, physics and such so maybe, just maybe if its true and released before this game dies it will change the entire game for the better.\n\nTL;DR: A very buggy game with awful combat, pay to win players, customer support, matchmaking, updates but its worth it if you like customization and want a game where you can make a million personas with cars, songs, symbols and clothes and if you can put up with the bad things you will fall in love with this game.","August 19, 2014","true","149.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","1"

The games character customization blew me away, and quickly became my favorite part of the game, and to this day is the only thing I genuinely care about in terms of APB's overall content.\n\nCombat is a different story. I can't even consider it to be combat much more than I consider it to be dancing. There's just a huge learning curve to this game. Back in the day, people use to jump and snipe. It was the most stupidest thing ever designed into a shooter. The game feels to be a bit ridiculous sometimes, that I just up and quit after about an hour. Along with that, I have a short list of complaints in my head with this game, and I'll just point have you read them here.\n\n1: The community can be sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to new players. Even I at once would badger these 13 year old kids who barely found out what a microphone was, but I learned that it didn't help with anything, except maybe my ego. There are so many new players who just get put down by all the grizzled veterans that they see no reason to continue playing this god-forsaken game, and they would be pulling a smart move. There is a huge lack of motivation to stay in the game, unless of course you meet certain people that you can have a good time with. Even then however, the game makes it very hard to maintain a positive attitude.\n\n#2: I use to part of a team of testers known back in the day as SPCI. It was a group picked by individuals who cared for the game, and also its testers. I admit I didn't do as much as others, but I was there when it came to the problems we faced. For one, whenever an upcoming patch needed testing, sometimes we were limited to only a day to do it. Now for most people, they couldn't test every day of the week, even me. Whoever could took a huge load of work. Once bugs and critical elements were reported, we'd expect G1 to be on top of these reports and fix them. This never ever happened in my experience. Sometimes these bugs wouldn't be addressed for months, sometimes never. It was this lack of action that made a lot of us question if what we were even doing was being appreciated. Eventually it all fell apart. Now there is a new team, whom I don't know, that either care about the game, or just want in on the upcoming content. In layman's terms, the new team to me feels like a bunch of complacant slaves who just want to have some "imaginary" form of authority in the APB community. So yeah, G1 just needed people to test the game so that they could say they have a test team, and that's it. So far, they don't seem to care.\n\n#3: This game is filled with people who use third-party software to get an advantage in the game (wallhacks, aimbots, etc). Not a single day goes by where I can play and all the opposing players play legit. Most of the time you can tell when your playing excellent players, sometimes it's a very thin line between legit and illegit. It's this thin line that makes people "hackusate" even legit people, and it even gets legits banned. And even when the illegitimates get banned, there's no preventing them from being able to reroll. They'll just come back to rage-hack and continue being their immoral selves.\n\n#4: This game will bring out the worst in you. It doesn't matter how much willpower you have, how much of a paragon/angel you are. This game will break you, no question. Most of the time, it's this reason people result in becoming illegitimates, because they either want to ♥♥♥♥ on people, or because they don't want to spend the time to get better at something, and will use shortcuts to get their way. For people like me, who take it day by day, it is a struggle we endure for reasons even we don't really know. Maybe we hope for a day when the game will become what we always dreamed it to be. Maybe it's because we invested so much of our time into this game, we can't bare to let it go. The game has introduced me to some really good people, some of whom are good friends that I've known for years now. It's people like them that I wish filled the game, but sadly, the game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, give or take a few.\n\n#5: The Grind is very VERY real in this game. It is literally a requirement that you have premium from the get-go if you even want to finish this game in a relatively quick amount of time, and unless you like me, who wants to spend nearly 600 hours of gametime getting to R195, your gonna want premium. I have a 1000+ hours on my main character, and he's only 246 at the moment. In the near future, when contacts need even more repect points from you, I might just die of old age.\n\n#6: Teamwork is something that people in this game ignore, which is funny, because it is literally the only thing that wins matches. Playing with a bunch of randoms does not help you in the slightest. Playing with people you know, people your on a voice chat with, is going to win you more games than just immitating a headless chicken (literally running in like a ♥♥♥♥♥, with no strategic plan). So if your going to play this game, make friends fast, or get friends to play with you, so that you can get somewhere rather than nowhere.\n\nIn conclusion, this game has a great concept, but it's maintained by a bad company, who's only reason for buying it was to milk the living crap out of it. You'll notice really quick that this game has very little content push, and more flashy ♥♥♥♥ with an expensive price tag on all of it. The clothes I like, but the guns and cars are G1's main source of income. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like had this game gone back to subscription based playing. I'd compare it to FFXIV, and say that more content would be added rather than ARMAS market items. In a way, I probably would have done subsciption over F2P. But it was never my call to begin with, so for now, I just go with the flow.\n\nMy score - 2/5\n\nI still have high hopes for APB, but until then, I am not going to recommend it because it's not fun once the raging begins. If your really willing to punish yourself, learn from your mistakes, and learn to laugh at them as well, because your going in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride.\n\nWord of warning: Be prepared to get ♥♥♥♥ on when you play.\n\nOn a side note, they should add some PVE to this game. Would help me relax a bit.\nAlong with that, enforcer activities (raiding a den, gathering intel, arresting drug dealers, etc.)","December 8, 2013","false","512.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Cheats have been an issue for years though, and only recently has there been any significant response from Gamers First to combat them.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the matchmaking system, although it may work on a high populated game there just aren't enough players to split across 3 threat levels. Gold ranked districts are seldom active so even if they do not wish to gold ranked players are forced to "de-threat" by playing bad till they become silver. Once these gold players are silver ranked they can play in the bronze districts till they log out and are not even forcibly removed once they reach gold again. As a result new players are thrown in at the deep end quite early in their APB career and quickly find they're out-matched and out-gunned.\n\nIf you're a hardcore first person or third person shooter fan you'll likely not enjoy this game. If you intend to play solo you will likely not enjoy this game. If however you have 1-3 friends to play with and are capable of not taking the game too seriously it's worthy of a download.\n\n8/10","August 11, 2014","true","606.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Why?\n\nWell there's a maximum of possibility to be done within this game. The possibilities of what you are capable of are the limits of your consciousness.\n\nThe character customization : you can make your own tattoos apply them where ever you want. You can decide to look like a brocoli with a green afro and a green skin tone by example.\n\nVehicle customization : Apply decals where ever it's possible in your field of view. Make it unique differ from the default style that you'll see in game. Make yourself noticeable while driving in the most well made customization. It takes patience but afterward you'll be rewarded for your efforts with positive comments in team chat while in a mission or group chat with your new friends you'll have created.\n\nClothing customization : Same as the others above..i've seen and met a lot of great artists in this game. Be kind with them they are argued and rushed by others to make requests and they'll get tired overall if you're abusing of them but other then that many of them are the most greatest persons i've ever seen in this game. Pleasant to talk with them.\n\nMany variant driving style : Most of all the vehicles you'll drive in this game as a unique handling with time you'll get to know every of them and be drifting around with style dodging rockets of your enemies perfectly etc etc.\n\nCombats: I've learned over time that you need to act wisely as you move towards your enemies. Detect their positions move with awarness of where they could possibly come from. Be prepared paranoy if you have to but not too much. Call their positions to your team it helps a lot.\n\nEvery players as a different style to attack their ennemies i'm the kinda guy to be sneaky.\n\nYou have an enormous amount of weapon possibilities in this game. You'll have to learn the time to kill of each of them. The time it takes to recuperate your bloom and so on you know where i'm going with that..\n\nOverall with the game my experience :\n\nI've appreciated every minutes that i've passed in this game i will never regret and will never be losing any of the good memories i had with any of you that might be reading this. No one will be forgotten for those that i loved and shared the most grateful gaming session of my first Online gaming experience. So many good memories..so many laughs..\n\n\nThis game is printed as a good souvenir in my memory for the rest of my life sadly haha.. ;)\n\nOh btw every games can get through  issues but i'm glad of the efforts that the staff did to resolve them in an order of priorities because they have a list of priorities that can be more important to respect in order to stabilize the game to make it suitable.\n\nI was glad to be a volunteer for this game as a Open Beta Tester for APB:Reloaded; APB:R Forum moderator & San Paro City Tester. For the time it lasted.\n\nI recommend this game.\n\nHave fun and hold on might be rough as you start but with time you'll eventually get better unless it's not your priority and you're just looking for a good time.\n\niHope you enjoy this game as i did.\n\n\n<3","August 19, 2015","true","679.5"," 33 of 59 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","33","59","9","19"

Keywords are 'used to'. Now it's just a circlejerk of hackers, rerollers - experienced players who make new characters 'cos can, troll characters - characters that are meant to look as hideous as possible, and a company that does a really poor job of not only getting rid of the hackers - they usually just ban innocent players - but making the game run well. It runs on an outdated engine and is poorly optimized. I have state-of-the-art hardware in my computer, and even with the graphics turned up to the fullest there is still aliasing, texture and animation problems. The company who owns this game, GamersFirst - they didn't make the game, but instead revived it from the company who originally created the game but had to shut down for some reason, can't even make good content for the game. The last, like, four weapons they've added have been reskins of existing weapons. But these ones you can only get by spending REAL MONEY to get, and it's not cheap either. Permenant weapons for a single character are forty dollars. FORTY DOLLARS. I could buy a completely new game with that.\n\nThe thing this game does well at is the customization, my God is it amazing... Only if you are a wizard at making symbols; otherwise you look absolutely stupid. The designers for symbols and themes - you can make a five second tune, usually an ear-piercing screech, that someone hears when you kill them or become MVP - aren't the most user friendly, and because of that there are only a handfull of people who can decently make them.\n\nThe gameplay is really repetitive and grindy; do the objectives and shoot the bad guys. The objectives don't mean crap, though. You can do all the objectives, but if you don't kill anyone you get barely anything. You level up at a snail's pace unless you, or course, spend REAL MONEY to get Premium, which allows you to get insane bonuses - something like 200% - to money and experience incomes.\n\nI started playing this game right around the time it came out, and it was fun for a while, but for the past year the only thing that has kept me playing is the hope that GamersFirst would do SOMETHING to fix this crap-heap of a game. I would not reccomend you play it. If you do play it, however, do NOT spend any money on this game - it's dying, and fast.","April 18, 2014","false","979.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codmister46/recommended/113400/","codmister46","Artaya CSGO-Crazy.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codmister46/","91 products in account","Figure its time for an update, I started playing apb about 2 years ago and in that time have put in around 4000 hours of gameplay. I really do enjoy this game and I feel people deserve an unbiased opinion before trying it out. So I present both positive and negative points here.\n\nFirst lets talk about hackers, everybody says hackers this hackerst that. No. period. Yes like any online game there is hackers, lets take any given day though, I do around 25-40 missions on any given day, maybe one or two of those missions will have a hacker in them. In fight club its a bit different, there is no missions its just the same stuff over and over kinda an easy place to farm kills close quarters and stuff so hackers go in there and use an aimbot but again thats not an all the time thing its just something that happens because hey its an online game.\n\nNext lets talk about "Pay 2 Win" some don't know the actual meaning of that phrase so im going to explain, P2W means that you can pay cash money for an instant advantage over others in game. Now to some extent I guess you could say its pay to win in that manner, the actual cash shop "Armas Marketplace" has various things, cars, guns, etc. The difference is you can buy them account bound, say you buy a 3 slot gun (slots being open for modifications that change guns ie: mag pull allows you to reload faster at the cost of a set ammount of ammo being short from the clip, where as extended mags has more ammo to a clip but takes longer to reload. They are unlocked in game and cant be used until you hit rank 40 which takes about a day or two) and you got it account bound, well you could have this gun with 3 slots on it on a new character, but that doesnt change much, all guns that you can get from armas marketplace are either reskins (same mechanics as the normal gun just different look and sound ultimately feeling different but having no advantage over the original gun) of the guns in game or they are available to buy with joker tickets which can be earned by doing daily activities and playing in fight club. Or you could buy a car, say you play as a criminal but you want a car from the enforcer faction such as the Jericho, you can buy that on armas with 4 slots and drive it on your criminal. There is also clothing packs/items and weapon skins/camos available but none of this changes the base of the game, however the game does have premium on armas marketplace as well which all that does is give a substantial increase to money and exp gain as well as allow you to have up to i think 100 symbols per item (not sure i dont customize often) set your clan name as a title so people can see it easier, and lowers the cool down on your active character mod by one minute. I personally have around 2,000$ (two thousand) in my account because its what i enjoy so I support them and will continue to. I have i think 35-40 account bound guns, most of the clothing packs, key to the world, key to the city, and almost every car as a 4 slot through armas on my main character.\n\nMoving on, next topic, the game engine is currently unreal engine 2 but they have been working on a new engine for a few years and it is almost ready for release, read into it more on the forums and blog posts.\n\nCustomization, its a big deal in apb and I have honestly never seen another game with such an in depth character customization.\n\nIm honestly too lazy to continue this review and would rather just go play the game instead of talking about it, however if you have any questions feel free to add me and ask, or even watch my steam broadcast im playing 70% of the time.","January 15, 2014","true","570.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ponyxslayer/recommended/113400/","ponyxslayer","World","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ponyxslayer/","270 products in account","APB Reloaded is a cops and robbers MMO that couldn't quite pull it off. The game has SO much potential that it almost makes me angry when they fall short on almost every game features. The lack of locational damage means accuracy is not needed. Combat often ends in a jumping match, and corner camping is one of the few strategies thanks to the third person camera.\n\nThe games micro transaction system and F2P model are majorly flawed. When buying guns in game you rent them allowing you to use it for a set amount of time before you have to rent it again. Buying an account bound weapon costs more but allows any of your characters to use it. This will run you anywhere from 20-55 dollars. You can also purchase character bound weapons for less, these cost about 10-40 dollars. When buying cars you can do the same rent, or own. An account bound car will run you about  15-35 dollars.\n\nAll of these prices can be discounted by owning a premium subscription.\nOther premium benefits include a 20% off the cost of premium subscriptions, up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains, 125% bonus to all Cash gains, 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace, 50% reduced cool down on activated abilities (Field Supplier / Nitro Booster), advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol), removal of in-game premium subscription advertising (which pops up at the end of every other mission), extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.\n\nPremium costs about 10 dollars for 30 days and gets cheaper the more time you buy. All in game prices are set in G1C which come in inconvenient amounts to make you buy more or additional packs. An example of this is a non-premium 1 month subscription costs 999 points. You can only get 999 points by buying spending $15 (1200 credits) because $10 is only 800 credits.\n\nThe best part of this 3rd person MMO shooter is the customization. While it is extremely limited as a non-premium user you can still add some flavor to your character or vehicle. Premium allows for you to create a truly unique look with 50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. At 100 layers per Symbol.\n\nThe in game missions are not over exciting and after playing for about 2-3 hours you will have played all of the available missions. Other players not in your mission are still in the world and can interact with you. They can do things like ram your vehicle or block you in buildings, but it is difficult for them to directly kill you.\n\nThe favored anti-cheat system of APB is Punkbuster. This program doesn't work very well at all and allows hackers to run rampant. In my short amount of play time I had encounter roughly 1 hacker per hour.\n\nOverall this game has such a great idea, yet such terrible terrible execution in nearly everything the developers tried to do.\n","December 22, 2013","false","20.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It has some pretty awesome customization, but thats honestly about all that keeps me coming back. The matchmaking is terrible, and there has only been cash shop item releases (no new real content) since G1 took over. They say proper new content will be possible once they finish the engine upgrade, but they've been promiseing the upgrade for 3+ years and it still seems it'll never be here. They also plan to overhaul the matchmaking system, which will definitely help keep new players around, as the system they have in place now is often exploited by veterans, and will end up matching them against newbies. With the fairly steep and long learning curve the game has, few will stick around to get the hang of it after getting steamrolled constantly.\n\ntl;dr\nI would recommend this game once the matchmaking has been overhauled, and the engine upgraded, but in it's current state, it's skippable.","March 26","false","594.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

All I have to say is that this game is slow on delivering substantial content. With only 2 major maps to explore and play on and 2 smaller traditional arena type maps (one of which is just a slight modified version of an area that exists in one of the 2 large maps.) There is a nice selection of weapons, character customization options, vehicles and skins. Down side is, is that most of these "cool" items must be purchased from the store with real currency. Only thing about this game that kept me playing this long was the character customization. It was fun and very in depth compared to other online shooters customization choices. Gameplay is decent, but nothing I would write home to about. Some weapons with some upgrades paired with character upgrades can combine to make some very "OP" loudouts. My point of view on this game would change if the dev team would address the rampant hacking issue and release new maps and maybe add a meaningful story.","May 23","false","029.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","4"

I myself have an Alienware 14 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, and 8GB of memory. To start with, this $1,000 laptop barely even runs this game on moderate graphics settings, forcing me to switch to low-end graphics just so the game can have a smooth, playable framerate. MAYBE this is something wrong with my laptop, but I think not.\n\nEven playing on the lowest graphics settings possible, the game still manages to lag and otherwise have random FPS drops that would often result in instant death in the middle of a firefight. The vehicle control feels a little too arcade-y for my liking. In addition, there is a rather alarming population of cheaters on servers. Utilizing a mathematical formula—100 missions played, averaging 4 players to each faction for each mission—I found that over the course of those 100 missions that a total of 89 people were hacking in some way, shape, or form. If we conclude that in 100 missions that you will encounter 700 people (800 minus yourself in each mission), there is an average hacker ratio of 0.127 (12.7%). While Reloaded Production's newest Fair Fight Anti-Cheat Technology should help reduce this number, I still can see a large population of hackers managing to bypass this.\n\nRegarding the servers, their software is outdated and faulty at best. Only the dedicated servers seem to run anywhere near smoothly, but even then their calculation systems and arithmatic formulas often result in a laggy experience.\n\nPros:\n\nDecent graphics\nDynamic gameplay\nENDLESS character customization\n\nCons:\n\nRequires a high-end gaming laptop in order to run smoothly\nArcade-esque vehicle handling\nCombat utilizes hit-scans, which often bugs\nOutdated servers\nHigh hacker population\n\nOverall score: 5.1/10.\n\nThis game USED to be fun, but sadly, they have moved away from their original roots of entertainment. The best that I can say about it is that it is merely a laggy, ramped-up version of cops-and-robbers that we all played as little kids.

Players using certain submachine guns can snipe players at long distance with ease.  Also, there are no scopes worth mentioning on sniper rifles, which makes them worthless beyond 100 metres or so.  This lack of sniping mechanics is further confounded with the lack of a head hitbox.  This leads to, you guessed it, NO HEADSHOTS!  This creates even less of a reason to use weapons besides submachine guns, because where you shoot makes no ABSOLUTELY no difference!  Not to mention, the time to kill in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low, you CAN and WILL die in a fraction of a second when a player pops around the corner using a VAS C2.   Now that we've talked about the gameplay, we can talk about the community.  APB's community is one of the most horrific, hate filled communities I have ever been a part of.  Any time I log onto a district, the chat is filled with players endlessly cursing one another out and accusing players of hacking.  Which brings me to my next point.  Hackers are extremely prevalent in this game, and despite the presence of an "anticheat" used by Reloaded Productions, it does next to nothing to dam the endless river of hackers flowing into this game.   When you're not playing against hackers, APB's horrendous matchmaker will be SURE to match you against players three times your level, armed to the teeth with weapons and armored cars.  This shouldn't be a problem, due to the so called "x threat level" servers.  The gold players are supposed to play on the gold servers, the silvers on the silver server, and so on.  This however, does not happen.  Gold players intentionally drop down to silver or bronze threat level, which allows them to run rampant on bronze servers and completely annhiliate the fresh new players, just leaving the tutorial.\n\nIn conclusion, I URGE you to avoid this piece of crap game, unless you're looking for a funny way to waste time, or have a fetish for bad games.","October 19, 2015","false","170.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","2"

Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!\n\nA big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.\n\nThe principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.","February 13, 2014","false","45.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being able to play the role of a vigilate cop or a hardened criminal is enticing, and the fully customizable characters, cars, and tattoos are awesome features to boot. However, when you download the game and play it for a day or two, you quickly realize that the grandeour of what was promised is simply just not delivered...\n\nWhile true the custimization is a very developed feature, the actual gameplay is less than desirable. Essentially missions are the same across the board, either defend somthing, or attack and maybe shuttle a car or an object (cocaine, evidence, ect...) to a specified area. During that time, it's a slugfest between the players who have no sense of cooperation, or are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in general. More on that later though\n\nThe guns in APB serve genaric roles, short, medium, or long range with the option of sidearms to compensate for weaknesses. The guns are generally ok, but the ones bought from the ARMA shop (paid with real cash) offer significant advantages to the vanilla guns, such as longer range, higher ammo capacity, and faster rate of fire. Now, the vanilla guns have the capacity to rival these weapons, but it takes an incredible amount of experience with the gun of your choice (SMG, Assualt Rifle ect...) to gain access to the mods that will alter the weapon.\n\nSo it can be argued that this game isn't pay to win because the players who don't pay can EVENTUALLY rival the people who do pay, there is a very noticable difference in power, and you'll see it too. The weapon I most often see against me is the "Whisper" submachine gun varient. It is designed to hide muzzle flash and noise while also boosting range at a negligible difference in stopping power. This weapon is only available with real money, and while you can mod a submachine gun to get some benefit, the silencer is exclusive to the "Whisper". This gives a player an incredible advantage over other players who dont want to pay. This is just one example though, there are multiple weapons on the ARMA market that offer similar exclusive features not found anywhere in the vanilla game. It makes going against these players incredibly frustrating to go against, and unless you have significant skill and willpower, odds are they are going to kill you repeatedly.\n\nBesides unfair weapons, the playerbase in APB is terrible, and doing missions is nigh impossible, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NEW. Players, who are on your team, will kill you if they feel you are a noob or are slowing them down, they either think its funny to pick on you, or they just are really that upset at you. They will just kick you in most cases (Somtimes after killing you) without a second thought. If you get into one of their precious modded vehicles (to get a ride to an objective for example), they will either leave and go spawn their car and leave without you, get out of their car and demand you leave, (surprise!) just kick you from the mission, or a combination of all three. While it can't be applied to all players, I've met a few people who were great to work with, the majority of the community are in cliques and can be quite mean to new players or lone wolves, and I've seen it happen. Somtimes it even gets to the point where it could be considered cyber bullying, and I'm not joking or exagerating about that.\n\nAll in all, APB is a title that I wanted to be a good game. It just wasn't there though, and I feel now my time has been wasted. I suggest you avoid this game and spend your time and money elsewhere.\n\nSummary:\n-Gameplay gets boring and repetitive\n-Great division in power between F2P players and P2W players\n-Division in power between Free weapons and Pay weapons\n-Absolutely horrendous playerbase, rude, disrespectful, and uncooperative (Even Teamkilling for god's sake!)\n-Not even remotely friendly to new players","February 9, 2014","false","39.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However over time this game started to slip away from the fun side. The game was full of tryhards, and I could see it was a pay to win because of this I started to feel less pumped about the game. I started to think "Am I back in call of duty?". However I continued playing the game as I liked large amounts of it and that I'm not one to just turn my back on a game due to some 'errors'. Then on the 3rd or 4th day (after being stressed out from everyday life) I logged in to have a whale of a time only to find a lovely message "account blocked/ error 10008". After looking online I found many people have got this due to so called 'cheating'. I have not cheated. So why am I blocked from this game! I'm not saying people don't cheat but People have been playing the game for thousands of hours and kicked due to just playing the damn game! Some people have just got the game and blocked before they had even started playing the game. Sounds fishy? I also have problems logging onto they're website and I feel like I have wasted 44 hours. 44 hours I'm not getting back! I feel sorry for the people who have spent hundreds of hours on this! So no, I don't recommend this game. Sorry APB Reloaded but never again will I play your games or recommend this game to anyone else. Thank you to anyone who spent there time to read this and thank you to the people who have made and helped keep this game running for the hours of fun I have had but I think I'm ganna stick to the games that care about they're players.\n\nFrom your little friend MЄƠƜƓƠƊȤ","March 28, 2014","false","45.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Character customization reaches a whole new level with their persona, outfit, vehicle, and symbol editors and the maps themselves are created with great detail.\nThough the game can be difficult to learn at first, as the mechanics are quite different from most other open-world shooters, and the Armas Marketplace suffers from the same tragically over-inflated prices that most Free to Play games tend to this is a very solid game with a lot to offer.

It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the "support" and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using "malicious files". Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win.

It not only uses an old Unreal Engine, but has many limits, in terms of draw distance, fake bloom effects and jagged shadows.\n\nEven while having a powerful rig, this game will still run poorly, which may also explain the decreasing numbers of people playing the game. I know people who have played this years ago and are no longer able to handle the game due to terrible performance.\n\nTheres a poor choice of missions in this game such as: Defuse bomb, Ramming, Stealing which is basically all a click "f" to wait while this circle fills up to 100% and offers no challenge whatsoever.\n\nHowever, props to RTW for creating a game with such amazing customization, like i've never seen before, and may be the only reason why i play this.","June 29, 2014","false","119.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","6"

If you DO want to play this game, hide the chat. As it is constantly popping up with stupid kids and childish adults yelling at each other / falsely accusing someone of hacking / or just complaining about the game they are playing.\n\nIt truely is sad, this game has the best customization in a game  EVER.  But it is wasted on a cash grab like this game. GamersFirst is one of the worst companies of all time, worse than EA. Basically, what the did was this: They resurected this game, which was originally created by another company. Since then, they have done jack sh*t to the game, all new content has been added in the form of paid content. They receive a**loads of money from premium members, yet they can't even keep their servers going. This company took a great game (which caused the sad end to an original and innovative company) and turned it into nothing but a cancerous money grab.\n\nScrew professionalism. Do not give your money to this piece of sh*t game, it's f**ing terrible, and it can be like cigarettes to some people once you get too far into it, luckily I got out. Go play a decent and balanced Free to Play, like Team Fortress 2, Planetside 2, or even Blacklight: Retribution. Stay away from this piece of sh*t, and don't let the awesome customization fool you into giving it a chance, it's better to just ignore it and spend your time on a game that actually deserves it.\n\nPros\nAwesome customization (character and vehicle)\nGreat driving (can be a bit wonky at first, but once you get the hang of it nothing beats drifting around huge corners in the vegas)\nGreat asthetic style\nOriginal idea\nChallenging\nRequires Teamwork\nIntegrated Clans and Groups\nBuilt in Music player which allows you to broadcast your own songs to other players\nBuilt in Audio Workstation to create your own short theme(s) that play to other players after you've killed them. (If you produce music like I do you will have some fun with this one)\nBuilt in market for players to sell clothing, cars, weapons, themes and other in-game items.\nTwo Fun and Fairly Large Maps\nSharp on-foot controls\nGunplay focuses more on gun stats, range, and how many hits were landed, damage is not locational\nNo bullsh** gun-play, shots will hit where your crosshair lands, but their is recoil / shot spread\nCons\nMost of the new/cool content you have to pay real money for\nLaggy servers\nHackers\nTotal Grind\nOverpriced Premium Membership and paid items\nAbsolutely HORRID community\nNon-locational damage\nSome Pay2win Weapons\nHigh level players have an obvious advantage over lower levels, so you have to rely on the matchmaking to pair you against a team of similar levels, which it doesn't.\nSome features available for free in the past were cut and put back in as paid content (Vehicle Body Kits)\nEveryone in the social district seems like they're in a coma, everyone just stands around completely still and silent\nPlayer-bought/won billboards in social district almost ALWAYS has at least one containing nudity and or hentai\nSome absolutely awful missions. For example, in a VIP Mission, the VIP player can get in a car, BUT the car will have something like a 50% speed reduction, but it doesn't matter, because it may take a while, but the car will eventually get up to full speed. So, if VIP gets into a car like the Vegas (fastest car in the game) they can get up to full speed and leave the opposition unable to catch up, even if they enter a vehicle of equal speed, as long as the VIP stays at a steady pace they will continue on at the same speed, so the VIP will gain ground at the same speed the Opp will gain on them, running out the clock and granting a win the cheap, ♥♥♥♥♥-tactic VIP.\nGhosting / Ghosters. For example if you are chasing a VIP in the scenario above you will likely get rammed into a wall / corner by some random ♥♥♥♥ who isn't even involved in your mission. Ghosting is usually due to players wanting to take out their aggression caused by the piece of ♥♥♥♥ game they are currently playing, so instead of beating off or screaming into a pillow or punching a wall or breaking things like normal people usually do to releive stress, these toxic children will usually ruin someone elses game experience instead. Hell, they don't even have to be specifically ghosters either, ♥♥♥♥ing with people in this game is so easy when in a car people will even do it while on their way to / on a mission themselves. And yes, if you haven't played this game, people who aren't in your mission can still hit, ram, and push your car, damage isn't done to either car but if pushed into a wall at a high enough speed the victim's car will take damage from the wall or even explode regardless.\nDump Trucks\nDon't play this game.","July 11, 2014","false","490.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

In the case of apb,it's the balancing of the 2 factions,enforcers and criminals (=pigs and crims). While criminals are really fun to play,enforcers get a huge advantage over them by being able to "witness them" and pretty much 2shot them (the combat mechanics of the game are: hold down your mousebutton,the one with the better weapon or first hit will win.)\nThe problem here is that the notoriety system of the game lets the pigs witness any criminal with a high enough rating. This gives cops a huge combat advantage,since you can't shoot cops as crim unless they witness you and start shooting.\n\nIf you dont mind balancing and serious hacker issues,you'll have a fun time,especially when playing with some mates.","January 16, 2012","false","44.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The game was playable and enjoyable, FPS was good and there wasn't any lag. The game has cheaters but what F2P game doesn't?\n\nThen as time goes on you lost FPS with every patch, you can no longer play on ultra settings but need to play it on low with a special launcher that reduces textures even further, I have upgraded my rig since I've first started playing and the performance I get is absolutely laughable.  The servers, for more than a month, have been having aboslutely awful connection problems due to getting "ddosed" ( doubt it, probably just a lie) which result in constant ping spikes and people constantly teleporting around.\n\nBut as the game continues to go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee there will still be sales on the Armas marketplace so they can try and squeeze every last penny out of you before you get fed up and leave because of sheer lack of progress, transparency, and GM's that actually play the game.\n\nSave yourself the heartbreak, maybe if you could get in a time machine and play it early 2013 you would be happy, but the state it is in now is absolutely unplayable.

You play as Alyx Vance in his quest to eradicate all the jews and take over middle-earth, and along the way you meet many companions, like Milhouse Manastorm and Winnie the Pooh. Most of the gameplay consists of building various structures with blocks, whilst at the same time micro-managing an array of different pokemon through space, as you build and customize your very own spaceship. Sadly there is no multiplayer, but the multiplayer campaign was very enjoyable, even if it does run through uplay for windows live. There are in theory three different endings, but it's really just the same ending with different Hatsune Miku songs playing in the background. The voice acting is a bit weird, since only the player character talks whilst all the NPCs have to choose from a drop-down list of responses to everything the player says, ultimately leading them to accept your quest. If the NPCs complete enough quests, you unlock the ability to date Ragnaros the Firelord, which takes place within a bejeweled-like mini-game.

The mechanics in the game are very crisp, both shooting and driving and the customization options in the game are second to none. The avaliable maps to play in are fairly large and diverse so even though there are currently only two, you have tons of room to play around and explore.\n\nNow on to the bad. First up, a large percentage of the players in this game tend to come off rather rudely. The ridiculous customization can also sometimes be slightly annoying (So many drawn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game suffers from some coding errors as well, resulting in occasional frame drops though usually they aren't too bad. APB has a reputation for being full up of cheaters and while there are certainly a few, the problem is for the most part over exaggerated.\n\nBottom line is this; Play the game, it's free and you might fall in love. If you don't? No big deal, it's free.","June 24, 2014","true","228.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say that the game is full of potential and could be way better. Especially if there was more lore on the characters. Besides just being there some of the NPCs that you get missions from seem like a shell with no personlity. Like Double B or Seung Bloodrose.\n\nThe customization is very amazing and thats one of the key features that sells the game and that got me too play. Though I did hear about the game on a sims forum\n\nAfter a while the missions get too repetitive.\n\n____________\n\ntl:dr, I don't recommend playing the game unless you play it with friends otherwise you'll be amazed by the customization and then be bored to death because of the repetiveness.  :D","August 29, 2014","false","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago.\nAs for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission  due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.","October 4, 2013","true","573.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

If you prefer not paying for a game before you know it's good, this is not a game for you.  APB Reloaded is the most pay2win game I've ever seen. Just the fact that you only have weapons for 10 days is just... Awful. If you wanted me to pay for your weapons, I'd like to get to keep them too! why would I buy something I can only keep for 10 days?! When I played my first games in bronze servers, they were filled with gold ranked people! I played this with my friend and didn't get the grenade you're supposed to get(needs to be fixed). The pay2win aspect of this game is just huge. This is like a worse version of CoD where people with skill get better weapons but are still matched with noobs. Some of the weapons you have to pay for i.e. Joker weapons are just really OP. How is it even possible to jump out of your car if someone can blow it up in to seconds with a freaking MG?! The missions are bad too. Not to mention the storylines. All you do is press someone, maybe read what they have to say, click a button called "pledge" and do boring meaningless missions. i don't know how many actual missions there are. I'd imagine there's like 5 or 6. The moral is "if you have money, instantly get good at this game, if you don't, play for a long time and still get killed by people who pay fortunes for this free to play game!". It also requires a pretty decent PC (another money requiring factor) and has a bunch of DLC. Overall I think it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers.","March 26, 2014","false","42.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This is because the permanent guns have to be bought with real money and they are overpowered. Certain guns can be rented with cash u get from completeing missions and robbing people or stopping them but they are not permanent and it is hard to get good cash becasue it is quite hard for you to kill other 'buyers' who r with you in mission. Plus you cant kill everyone you see (which i want to lol).\n\n\nOverall, this game is quite enjoyable but then i cant recommend it to everyone.

Players tend to deny their use of aimbots and wall hacks but when you use the aimbot it tells you when someones aiming right at you through 2 or 3 walls. Also if your half way across the map and on a mission that does not directly tell you where another player maybe and your found, you know your dealing with something fishy.\n\nGood side to the game is you instally feel like your playing what would be GTA Online, or a close comparison to it any how. Lots of actions, great gun selection, and character customisation thats unmatched, and i really do mean that lol, you will not find another game that lets you be unique as this game does.\n\nAll that said, IFFFF people weren't raging and using hacks or perhaps just being a game troll. Lets say all thats gone (Hopefully some day) I would give this game a 9 out of 10 for a score or maybe even a 9.5. The games not perfect but its pretty damn good.\n\nIf you like cheating then maybe this games for you, but i promise you this game will get on your nerves so much after a bit so i can't recommend this to anyone thats wanting a fair game play experiance.","April 15, 2014","false","362.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The roles are quite self-explainatory\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite what you would expect from any other third-person game, run to cover, peep out, unload your guns, that or you could just jump out and spray your munition and pray that it lands on the target. The gameplay however isn't what fascinates me, it is the customization option that you apply to your ride or your player model. You can create your very own designs from scratch, whether or not it ends up as tattoo or a car decal, the endless possiblity of creation is simply just mind blowing (Provided that you unlock all the customization option). As someone who studies graphic designs, this is my nice cup of tea.\n\nNote: Premium players can put in more customization items on their clothings/car/tattoos compared to f2p players.\n\nOf course, since this is a free to play game there are in-game items that you can buy to give you an edge against your opposition. Personally however, I think this game is still reasonable even if you are a f2p player.\n\nThe only downside for me is probaly the community inside the game. I'm not sure about the other servers, but the server I'm currently residing in is just..just....  full of twelve years old who are uncapable of listening to reason and logic. Oh yeah. Also expect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Lots and lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.","December 29, 2011","true","138.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a much more in depth system than any other game out there. Everywhere else, APB is one of the worse games on the market. After spending some hours on it, doing customization, you want to run around and do actual missions. That's cool. Unfortunately everyone logged on is much higher ranked than you, has better guns, and 80% of them are griefers that will follow you around and screw with you after the game. Granted, if you wanted to spend the money on this game, you could have these overpowered guns that nearly make the game P2W, but the 1000 or less people that are actually playing the game, really don't make it worth it. Or the fact that the game is not optimized for really any type of PC, which means everyone is laggy, and driving at full speeds is nearly impossible without several random crashes, or becoming one with a building. In my personal opinion, do not waste any time of your life in this game. You'll spend most of the time you do customizing your character and thinking about how much you hate the rest of the gameplay offered. Save yourself time and frustration and do not click install.\n\nUpdate - 2/11/16\n\nThis game is still horrible. I got the random idea of reinstalling it and trying it again. The only thing worthwhile in this game, is still character customization. It's still plagued by morons and horribly repetitive gameplay. I'm... still confused as to why I thought it might have changed. The whole 'fool me once' quote comes to mind.

It's insane.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour.

Or do you want to be a minorty emo smoker who is depressed and wants to shoot great cops who protect the city? Well APB is the game.\nIt has a superb modding system where people put high zoom scope on a smg.\nIt has a great customization system where fat neckbeards pretend to be japanese school girls or a furry.\nIt has bulletin boards where a people post borderline porn of 12yr old anime girls and dogs. While everyone just goes on to social to fap to it.\nIt has vehicle customization where you can pretend to be pedophile with your free candy van. Or you can be the KK and pretend your on a lynching run.\nEither way APB is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, furrys, bronies or people who want to live out their anime fantsys in this cluster♥♥♥♥ city they call San Paro and I used to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now I realize i made a bad descion. However I had fun making bad descions when I didn't even know it.\nIn conclusion if you are looking to live out your power hungry days as a cop or your a social outcast in real life and want to pretend to get the man by playing crim you should play this game, this game is cancer if you want lung cance play it, i have decaying bone marrow problems after playing this game, lung cancer, lukimia, and anal parkinsons. Or ig your 12 and your mom blocked those naughty sites just sign up and play and then regret in three years time that you fapped to a a dog in social while you were desining a sonic race car.\nI rate this game 9/11 they need more muslim contacts. They also need an airport district where one of the missions is where you hijack a 747 and crash it into some towers.\n*Edit* : It's like meth and its like a descion you'll regret, but it's fun, and addicting.","March 9, 2015","true","091.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

Combat takes a suprising amount of skill, and this game is NOT noob friendly. It's very likely you'll lose your first few matches, very, very badly. What this game is, is a great game to play with a few friends, with some of the best character / vehicle / music customisation of any game I've played in a while.\n\nThe editors in this game are amazing, and there's no end to the level of creativity you find with what people make with the designers. The music studio is particularly good, and I'm a huge fan of it. I've found that with a bit of work, it's possible to create a HUGE variety of songs and music, and if that's something you enjoy, I would very highly recommend this game.\n\nThe gameplay is actually pretty good once you get the hang of combat. Matchmaking is not always the best, and sometimes it takes a bit of time to actually find a mission, but they tend to be good fun.\n\nVehicles in the game are quite hard to handle in some cases, which I see as a challenge, and a nice way to seperate those who are good at driving and those who aren't (I think I fall into the second catagory xD). There's also a nice variety, although it takes a lot of time to actually unlock any sort of body customization options for cars, and people who care a lot about that sort of thing might be forced into buying body kits with real money...\n\nCharacter customisation, now that I get to it, it very thorough, and allows you to have a pretty good go at making whatever character you can think of. Designing outfits works really well, and is by far one of the best systems in the game other than the music editor.\n\n-------------------\n\nLong review over, I'd recommend trying this game... so far I've played w̶i̶t̶h̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶n̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶n̶e̶y̶ (I've bought a̶ ̶f̶e̶w̶  far too many items from the store, although these are not really necessary to enjoy the game at all, in fact a few of my friends have spent nothing), if you're a bit of a car customisation fan, you may find yourself spending a bit, other than that, the game can be enjoyed a lot for free!\n\nIf you haven't tried this game yet, give it a go, you might be surprised :)","January 14, 2012","true","087.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a much more in depth system than any other game out there. Everywhere else, APB is one of the worse games on the market. After spending some hours on it, doing customization, you want to run around and do actual missions. That's cool. Unfortunately everyone logged on is much higher ranked than you, has better guns, and 80% of them are griefers that will follow you around and screw with you after the game. Granted, if you wanted to spend the money on this game, you could have these overpowered guns that nearly make the game P2W, but the 1000 or less people that are actually playing the game, really don't make it worth it. Or the fact that the game is not optimized for really any type of PC, which means everyone is laggy, and driving at full speeds is nearly impossible without several random crashes, or becoming one with a building. In my personal opinion, do not waste any time of your life in this game. You'll spend most of the time you do customizing your character and thinking about how much you hate the rest of the gameplay offered. Save yourself time and frustration and do not click install.\n\nUpdate - 2/11/16\n\nThis game is still horrible. I got the random idea of reinstalling it and trying it again. The only thing worthwhile in this game, is still character customization. It's still plagued by morons and horribly repetitive gameplay. I'm... still confused as to why I thought it might have changed. The whole 'fool me once' quote comes to mind.

Ok, maybe I'm in no position to start "hackusating" others- I have no proof whatsoever- but when people maintain *perfect* accuracy at long distances/whilst jumping, know where you are, whenever you are and come to kill you no matter how many walls there are between you and them, then maybe, just maybe, there's something to be suspicious about.\n\nThat's all I have to stay.

God, I was excited. It was a fresh formula combining typical 'GTA sandbox' with MMO elements. I followed every pre-release video, trailer and so on. When It finally came out on the market (Funny thing, APB was meant to be free-to-play from the beginning. As we can see now - the chance for everyone to play was only for fabricating the hype) It wasn't really THAT bad...\nI think that creators of the game condemned their game for failure just from the beginning. They didn't mentioned anything about the REAL formula of APB - 'cause APB isn't a GTA MMO - it's an online shooter with a really big arena and cars. Media and gamers called this game a 'GTA Online'. Back then, the developers didn't deny it.\nAPB had mostly technical issues, bugs and strange gameplay solutions. But it still offered much fun through customizing your car, your own character and shooting other people with this char. The game was fun to play, but had some unforgivable issues.\nNow, about so called 'Reloaded' version. ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE. After so many years the new developers didn't removed 4 YEARS OLD bugs and technical issues. Seriously. What's more - practically, they have created more. The game may not even work on some PC configurations. I managed to launch original 2010 APB on Intel Core 2 Duo + GeForce 8600GTX, but for some reason, after many hours of fixing up the problem, APB:Reloaded won't last played for 0,5h on Intel i5 + Radeon HD7870. Because f*ck the player.\nThe game is fun to play itself, but after slow progress it can get bored for a while. Especially when you fight those Premium players. The disbalance of Premium and non-Premium characters is very big - in cash, in weapons, in experience and so on. There is even a limit on a graphics that you can put on clothes or cars. Seriously. Because f*ck the player.\nCustomization is still good, even after 4 years. What a shame, that it's so limited for a regular player. But you can still create something similar to your character of a dreams. You can slowly earn up for a car and car's modifications, but it is much longer process.\nDriving a car is not very good because of server's delay. When you turn left, you send a signal to the servers of APB to make you drive left, and that causes some lags if you don't have a really good internet connection. This delay may be a bit similar to 'Hollywood car chase', but it's still a technical issue. Still not removed. Because f*ck the player.\nShooting is k, most of the time, sometimes your character will not shoot to your crosshair location, because s*it happens. It still fun, and that's an advantage of APB:R's gameplay.\nThere is a good variety of missions, as well as arenas, so you won't get bored in ~15 hours, at least I was still interested to play even, when I get to know all the game's missions.\nIf you get APB:Reloaded to work properly - it may be a fun and interesting experience, depends on your liking of 'GTA like' games. Otherwise, you will get upset many times, for sure.\n\ntl;dr\nStill fun to play, but with tons of technical issues and bugs, much disproportions between premium players and non premium players, try it out, 'cause it's free, darling, my final rating is 3-/6.","July 13, 2014","false","37.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have some good and bad points that I would like to share with you but first you may notice my hours on the game don't seem like I have much experience. I can assure you that I have been playing APB: Reloaded for over 3 years now.\n\nAnyway, onto the good points, this game has a wide-range of customisation options for pretty much anything from weapons to cars and everything inbetween (Mostly just cars, characters and weapons though). The wide array of customisation is what seperates the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) styled game from others such as APB: Reloaded.\n\nAs for the game itself it has a sort of "unique" fighting style as a shot from a weapon does the same damage to the foot as it would to the head which draws in a much more casual audience who would prefer this fast-paced massive open world of carnage and mayhem. There are all kinds of different weapons in APB; High Velocity, SMG's, Rifles, Stun guns, Pistols, LMG's and even High Explosive weapons featuring the OSMAW (RPG type weapon) and OPGL (Grenade Launcher). This open-world environment is ideal for the casual gamer who's looking to get a "thrill" in playing something like GTA, just without the cost.\n\nAnyway, this game can't be all good and fun. As mentioned in my first paragraph, the developers rely a lot more on the money in their pockets rather then upgrading the game a lot faster. APB: Reloaded is heavily pay-to-win which in the end forces you to hand over your money to get something a lot more powerful in-game.\n\nWith my personal experiences in APB, they have probably one of the worst Anti-Cheat systems around, also known as punkbuster. Random kicks on innocent players and one of the slowest anti-cheat detectors allows hackers to walk right into the game and play as they would a normal player.\n\nThis is where I end, I could go on and on about the bad things that happen in this game but I would prefer for you to try it out, and just a quick warning. It can get highly addictive, incredibly fast.","May 23, 2014","true","74.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

They unfortunately lock the ability to make cool characters and cars behind tons of paywalls, level gates, and arbitrary progression. The only way to get anything is through missions and gunplay.\n\nAnd on to gunplay. It's terrible. It's like a shooter from 2002.

I love this game for many reasons. One reason being that it has an EXTREMELY wide array of customization features. You can customize pretty much everything from weapons to clothes to cars to custom themes to play whenever you kill someone! Another reason this game is so amazing is because of the gameplay. It never gets boring or bland (especially when playing with friends!) It is also so much fun to pop out and shoot someone down that is about to score the last winning point to cause you to lose the mission. The game has awesome and  hilarious physics that will cause your car to literally FLY in the air whenever you hit a ramp! The game is overall very smooth, extremely fun, and very versatile and different. I like to think of it as if GTA and a Cops and Robbers style game had a baby.

Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wepon system\ni can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models.\ni give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)","November 4, 2015","false","60.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","8"

I do not recommend APB Reloaded. I put a lot of hours into this game and while it can be irritating it is really fun; but here's the kicker: once you're leveled up enough you then deal with hackers. In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable. The idea is great and the gameplay is great; but all the constant hacking done do this game ruins the fun. If it weren't for the hackers I'd highly recommend this game.","December 20, 2013","false","20.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Think about how revolutionary this game could have been.\n-Customizable vehicles, clothes and character (to an extent due to microtransactions business model).\n\nCons:\n-Play with the unfinished product of the original GTA creator, which really is the messy afterbirth resulting from the mismanagement of over $100 million dollars by the original game developers. Now deal with the Gamersfirst company that bought APB after the game's first official launch and subsequent bankruptcy of the original developer Realtime Worlds.\n-"Pay 2 Win." Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Gamersfirst is milking the game before it dies.\n-The game is dead. Only a few hundred people playing it compared to the thousands before.\n-"Progression 2 Win." Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Requires lots of character level grinding.\n-Poorly optimized. Requires a high performance computer to run subpar graphics.\n-Boring and poorly designed missions. Perform boring and menial tasks that are not attached to any real storyline. Experienced players (with or without Pay 2 Win items) will exploit the poorly designed missions and maps to win.\n-Ugly and lifeless city. NPCs don't do anything except walk around and yell during gunfire. They will occassionally glitch or disappear. The maps do not have enough detail and it feels like you're wandering through a ghost town. For a game about "cops and robbers," it makes you question the storyline and motivations of each side when the city and NPCs are lifeless like this.\n-rampant hacking issues since beta release 4-5 years ago.\n\nOverall:\n3/10 -Terrible. APB is still a broken game after 4-5 years after the first release. It was better during the Realtime World's beta, but somehow Gamersfirst made it worse. You may be curious and excited about the features shown in the trailers during the first hour of play, but APB Reloaded and Gamersfirst will suck your soul.

The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.","February 4, 2015","true","367.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It can seem like that when there are many full server, which leaves all the low populated ones but most of the time you can find a server with a lot of people.\n\nThe server ranks which are Bronze, Silver, and Gold really should have a requirement on them because Gold and silver threat players are usually on Bronze threat servers which makes it harder for a Bronze Player to become silver or Gold. And some of the higher threat players do say rude things to Bronze players, but your threat level doesn't necessarily mean that you above or below someone and doesn't mean someone is more skilled than other people. I've met many Bronze players who are better than Gold players, but i still don't think that it's fair for them to go on low level servers. It just so happens that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match making is what makes people stop playing the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is still really fun to play, but the match making is just horrible. I'm a bronze player and i got put with a bunch of gold players and ended being yelled at for dying so many times and coming in last place because my team mates would kill me each time i tried to complete something, i even waited for an oppistion and they were still killing me, but one of them did get banned because of Fair-fight monitoring.\n\nNot all silver and gold players are rude. In fact, I've met some really cool people on the game that happened to be gold players.\n\nI'm not trying to bash the gold and silver players but that's just a big problem for most people.\n\nThen there's the Armas Market.\n\nI personally don't care too much about it but if you have money that you can spend on the game, you can get better weapons, cars, and mods. I'm almost positive that you can't use game money in the market so most people are stuck grinding for guns and mods. And believe me it takes a long time. First you have to rank up and then you have to earn the money and some weapons are only accessible with certain roles that are completed. I actually prefer to do this since i don't feel like spending $10-$20 on a decent gun for a game i got for free.\n\nThis was not meant to be negative in any way but I'm just saying what should be said.\n\nSo despite the negativity in this review, I actually recommend this game.\n\nThe graphics are nice and the customization is pretty much limitless as long as you have plenty of decals and such. Plus it's fun to play with friends. I actually call up a few friends every now and then and do group missions with them because you can use your mic and talk to them.\n\nI also suggest that anyone who buys this game should friend anyone they enjoyed playing with and form a clan with them or join one. And if you liked the team you played with you can always try to group up with them.\n\n>u< I'm actually not a person who's an expert at giving reviews so if you would kindly refrain from calling me any rude names, that would be very much appreciated XD","April 7, 2015","true","357.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've done all this about 5 times i have also download the PBsvc to try and fix any errors within PunkBuster but have not found a solution that has done anything to help, So now i am on here begging for a solution to this pointless annoying problem, in the hope that someone smarter than me might no what i may have missed out on.\n\ni am having the same problem but i deleted it and download it again shut down my laptop and it worked a little bit like a few minutes but then it crashed and said the same thing again and was unable to log into it at all.\n\ni like this game its a really good game i played a little bit the shooting was good but in the video grenade  should of killed people throwing grenade should of killed people if they had no body armour .\n\nnot  being able to host your own game or host room is really bad and not being able to solo with out using matchmaking really sucks since if there no one online i have no idea but if you can't play with out matchmaking or players that is honestly stupid since this game looked amazing and creating your person very good programming and car programming and the aiming and the blood shoot dripping is perfect.\n\nthis game looks really good so far i played it a little bit but it needs a lot of love and lot of work it could be the best gta for steam.","October 29, 2014","false","12.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Nothing is really clear when you start the game, the map is confusing. Character Customization is good when you first start but if you want to customize further in the game with things such as weapons, or clothing then its very difficult and expensive. Combat is one-sided, with you being the lesser side and rather often dying and you're always resurrected way back at the beginning where you first started. Its gets a bit easier if you are playing it with friends but not that much. All in all out of 10, I'd give it about 4/10.","October 1, 2014","false","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Here is an example:\n\nIn Game Gun [apbdb.com]\nCash Shop gun [apbdb.com]\n\nThey have different 3D models, but if you look at their stats, they are exactly similar. Many newbies who got got killed by a remodeled gun thinks that the cash shop guns are more powerful, when the same results could be replicated with the in-game gun because they are basically the same gun.\n\n2) Epic customization\nYou get to customise your own set of clothings, cars and even posters! Make your own design on a 2D design editor in the game itself, and apply it onto your clothings! Take a look here at the creative designs our players have come up with!\n\nLink! [www.google.com.sg]\n\n3) Interesting gameplay as well as open world missions\nThis is basically a multiplayer GTA with objective based missions!\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who considers themself an avid gamer!","November 26, 2014","true","346.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I love it and played it like crazy. I bought several ingame purcases and spent several hundreds of dollars. And then, boom. I got banned. For no reason at all.\n\nThey say I have ben using third party tools. I say I havn't. I mean, I speak in skype with my friends when I play, but that's the only program I can think of.\n\nI tried to tell them that I hadn't cheated, they kept telling me that I had. It didn't matter that I had played hundreds of hours and spent hundreds of dollars. In their eyes I was just a lousy cheater that didn't even deserve a second chance. Even though I had done nothing wrong.\n\nThat was about a year ago. I still havn't gotten my account back. I have spoken with both gamersfirst and evenbalance (punkbuster) but I keep getting the same response.\n\nPlay if you want, but don't buy anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eqofromtwia/recommended/113400/","eqofromtwia","Eqo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eqofromtwia/","125 products in account","This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition.\n\nA wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of "kill all the cops before they kill you." Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!\n\nCustomization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.\n\nI have one complaint. This game is most definitely "pay-to-win." $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become.\n\nThe cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.","March 4, 2014","true","224.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's sad to see what happened to this game in 4 years even though a lot of things improved, some stayed the same and some other got even worse, like client/server perfomance which is mediocre for an online game in 2015. I'm hoping that Gamersfirst will try to fix the game with the long promised engine update (due 2 years ago if I recall correctly) and with the matchmaking update (which will also remove player threat levels).

What im gonna do is tell the truth. APB Reloaded is awful, the only reason its actually fun is to either troll or screw up the terrible physics engine, you go around in a dump truck and crush a player's cars and killing them, which is very fun, this aint no GTA rip off, it dosent even deserve that title, its a pay to win cash fest, buy a gun= real money, buy a car= real money, hell there is even gambling with real money! You go to a contract and then they give you a mission, its always the same, either bomb a car, steal a car or kill the enemy or graffiti some walls for some reason! Some missions no enforcers actually attack you, in some missions they do. And this is where the fun begins *sarcasm* the balance system sucks so much it could swallow a blue whale, it literally pairs you up with morons who just started the game, and the enemy are silver players with the best guns in the game, basically the game was pretty fun, untill it became pay 2 win, first started the OP guns, HEY PLAYERS PAY £40 FOR A GUN THAT KILLS IN 2 HITS! The game can sometimes be fun, but after a couple of hours it becomes incredibally boring and you wonder what would happen if this game wasent free? Maybe more gamemodes, maybe more stuff, maybe some actual fun.\nOh yeah, this game isent cops and robbers, the enforcers get the same guns as the criminals, they have different names but they do the same ♥♥♥♥, you go around in free roam and you cant start a police chase, the only time a cop can attack you is if they see you pick up a item that dosent belong to you (ram raid) and then it makes you go into this minigame where you have to put the evidence in a place and so does the cops, also the bag of evidence makes a sports car turn into a segway so good luck with that. The game would be alot more fun if the cops could actually do cop stuff, like arresting you, they should be able to spot you then have to arrest you for extra money and you go into this L.A Noire interrogation minigame, NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN, but nope the only way they can arrest you is if they stun you and arrest you then you disapear and respawn lol. 35/100 (btw if you want some real money, wait at a contract place for a ram raider to arrive to sell his stuff then steal his van full of items :D)","December 28, 2013","false","41.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","4"

I didn't cheat, I don't even have cheat related software on my computer (I know, you don't believe me and that's okay, but I'm speaking the truth here). The support won't do a thing about it (just sending pregenerated messages) and Punkbuster only tells you that someone else may have hacked my account and cheated.. which I don't believe.\n\nI then made another account on my Laptop and have played for hours there without getting a ban. Now I'm afraid to spend any kind of money on this game if I'll just get banned again without even getting a proper reason.\n\nSo watch out if you do intend to spend time and money in this game, I still don't know why Punkbuster issued a ban on me. It could either have been Nvidia Shadowplay (with the FPS overlay) or Borderless Gaming (which I didn't use for this game) or AutoHotKey (Which I use for my keyboard layout and have never had a problem in any other game yet). I heard there are ways to cheat with AutoHotKey, but I never touched any of those scripts.\n\nSo believe me or not, but I was a legitimate player and received a permanent ban after 15 minutes of playing. Support won't help a bit and Punkbuster won't tell me why they banned me, so I'll probably never find out what happened.","April 27","false","34.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

Really, I do.\nBut I can't help but feel that it doesn't want me to.\n\nThere is so much right with this game; customization, free-roam game play, thirperson shooter, all of which I like, but at the same time, so much wrong. Little has been added to the game in way of permenant additions, since the game has been acquired from realtime worlds. There have been seasonal events, sure, but other than that, not much else. 4 end game contacts a very long time ago, aside from that, the only regular updates are patches, to attempt to fix balance issues and performance issues and the whole lot, and to the infamous armas store (which is the game's premium shop where you can buy many things for real life monies.) I don't really agree with the way the game's premium shop works, and that's another major flaw to this game, for me. The community is just horrible. There is a clear lack of moderation in the chats and it is apparent as people often hold obscene coversations, or just spurt out vulgar comments to other players for no good reason. I'm not sure weather it's that the game attarcts the worst kind of people or rather it just brings out the worst in people, but there is just so much wrong here. Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat hit or miss. There are times where you can sit down and play and have a great time. Other times, not so much. There are alot of unbalanced aspects to gameplay that people will abuse just to gain a win. Weapons aren't at all balanced, there are clear 'good' and 'bad' weapons, which only further drags the game down.\n\nI can go on and on with all the reasons I feel that this game is not worth playing, but in a way, I somewhat do reccomend the game to people. If you have a group of friends, this game may be for you, but to just anyone looking to play by themselves, I would recommend to stay away.\nI feel that I have fully experienced all this game has to offer me, and no, I do not recommend this game.","January 9, 2015","false","635.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Let me just give you guys my opinion on this sad little potential wasted game. On the outside, this game looks pretty good. It's true, you get to customize your character, do some fun things around the city and play games in teams with different objectives. Sounds good right? Nope. This game will constantly pester you to become a "premium member", and if you do that, you get more money in game, and even get things like more tattoos. Premium members can have up to 50 tattoos. Guess how many normal players get? 3. THREE. And even if you do pay for premium, there are still other things you have to pay real money for if you want to enjoy the game, for instance, guns. The most important thing in this game. You'll find the guns you are given to start off are awful, but fair enough. You can buy guns with ingame money and "joker tickets", which are a pain to get hold of, and the gun expires in 7 days after you've bought it, so you'll have to collect the funds to buy it again! You could buy guns with real life money of course, which are overpowered and very expensive. I thought this game is decent enough to maybe pay a little more, so I decided to check out the store. I found this gun I liked for £5. I thought, maybe as a one off. Then I looked and it said I'd only have it for 30 days. There IS an option to keep the gun forever, but guess how much that would be? £25! You could buy a whole new, better game out of that! And this is just for 1 gun, out of the wide variety of guns you can get. And the thing is, this game is not "OUTSTANDING". It seems like it could be a decent game, fairly fun (if you weren't getting constantly killed by those who do buy over powered gun), and worth playing, and maybe paying a little for. But it's just ridiculous how much you'd have to pay if you wanted to have a good time with this disappointment.

I'm a real thug freal ma negros, and this game just brought about bad memories. One time I was flying around in my direct replica of my own personal drug dealing van and i saw this kid. his name was masterrapist59xXZeldaFanXx and he wasn't joking about his name. His knowledge of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Zelda was out of this world. But then it hit me: my friend's car. It broke both ma legs and then he honked his horn at me for hours and hours, but I refused to leave, for I am the dominant male. Then I went and begged mhy mommy for money so I could get a permanent gun. She said "YOOOOO CUT IT" and stabbed me in the stomach for the second time this week.","December 8, 2013","true","106.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Poundstheman/recommended/113400/","Poundstheman","Pounds ✓","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Poundstheman/","98 products in account","If you don't know me, I'm Ethica, or Sparkshot in Joker East.\n\nI countless look at this game as the game that gave me joy and my aim. But the trials I've had to endure to enjoy this game will never make it worth it. The amount of things wrong with this game out matched the pros 10 fold. I continue to amaze myself about how mad I can get at this game. The trolls, with the awful hit reg, the repetitive missions. I can't take it.\n\nVIP Missions\nThe main reason I'm writing this review. If you're not familiar with this game, there's a time of game mode called VIP, and it gives me a grey hair every time I play it. Basically, one team has a member whose labeled "VIP" and you have to take out just him, but if you die then they get a point, if the VIP dies, you get a point. It's at the point to where I want to quit every time I get into a VIP mission. Because the VIP can run while the other team can fight you, this game boasts about it's free roam but they take advantage of it. APB has tried to get rid of the camping spots, but people still camp, and run, and it's literally the worst game mode created. I wish they would take it out and leave TDM and capture points.\n\nGamersfirst\nI don't have to say much, they're greedy and never make good updates. It's always something new you can buy that only makes your experience worse when you realize how awful this game is\n\nCharacter Creation\nCharacter Creation was one of the main things that got me into APB. If you really want to look cool, you're going to need money or a lot of time unlocking all of the things. But Gamersfirst knows that some things are awesome so they charge 5 dollars for a backpack or a skateboard on your back. I can't stress how much money I've wasted on this god awful game.\n\nLag\nIf you don't spend 2,000 dollars on this game consider stutters or annoying spikes when people pump shotgun shells into you. This game uses an out of date Unreal Engine that makes everyone lag while playing. Doesn't matter how good your computer is, it will lag. I’m constantly saddened by telling my friends "hey, you can't play this game because of the horrible optimization." APB has told us that it's going to make a new engine. I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI used to really enjoy this game but there are so many things that ♥♥♥♥ me off I can't deal with it I have to rant. If you're looking into trying this game out, I would just look a different way. This one won't fulfill any of your hopes. Thanks for reading I hope I changed some minds.","August 17, 2012","false","996.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Free, open-world, full customization of your character, go on missions with new people; all this stuff makes for a pretty fun game...but the game is extremely unbalanced. Because of this inbalance, it has caused more rage than it has fun. When you are matched against players that are on your level, it is very very fun. But the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Chances are, when you are starting out, you'll be against so players with better skill, better weapons, and better experience. If you don't pay for the bonus weapons, you're going to fall behind and it'll take quite a while for you to catch up to the players that you get matched with. Often times when I play this, I think about how much more fun I could have playing something else where the matchmaking isn't so imbalanced.","October 9, 2014","false","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the trials I've had to endure to enjoy this game will never make it worth it. The amount of things wrong with this game out matched the pros 10 fold. I continue to amaze myself about how mad I can get at this game. The trolls, with the awful hit reg, the repetitive missions. I can't take it.\n\nVIP Missions\nThe main reason I'm writing this review. If you're not familiar with this game, there's a time of game mode called VIP, and it gives me a grey hair every time I play it. Basically, one team has a member whose labeled "VIP" and you have to take out just him, but if you die then they get a point, if the VIP dies, you get a point. It's at the point to where I want to quit every time I get into a VIP mission. Because the VIP can run while the other team can fight you, this game boasts about it's free roam but they take advantage of it. APB has tried to get rid of the camping spots, but people still camp, and run, and it's literally the worst game mode created. I wish they would take it out and leave TDM and capture points.\n\nGamersfirst\nI don't have to say much, they're greedy and never make good updates. It's always something new you can buy that only makes your experience worse when you realize how awful this game is\n\nCharacter Creation\nCharacter Creation was one of the main things that got me into APB. If you really want to look cool, you're going to need money or a lot of time unlocking all of the things. But Gamersfirst knows that some things are awesome so they charge 5 dollars for a backpack or a skateboard on your back. I can't stress how much money I've wasted on this god awful game.\n\nLag\nIf you don't spend 2,000 dollars on this game consider stutters or annoying spikes when people pump shotgun shells into you. This game uses an out of date Unreal Engine that makes everyone lag while playing. Doesn't matter how good your computer is, it will lag. I’m constantly saddened by telling my friends "hey, you can't play this game because of the horrible optimization." APB has told us that it's going to make a new engine. I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI used to really enjoy this game but there are so many things that ♥♥♥♥ me off I can't deal with it I have to rant. If you're looking into trying this game out, I would just look a different way. This one won't fulfill any of your hopes.

The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.\n\nGraphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.\n\nWould I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a "must play"? No. Is it horrible?

Some people argue that the only way to get better is to play against better people, but in this scenario its really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ =/  also if you are playing alone, this game could get really aggrivating due to non communicating or incompetent friendly firing teamates.\nGUN DAMAGE RATIO: there are tons of guns in the game but because there are a select few that are just OP as hell, it makes everyone HAVE to go to that cookie cutter build.  put it like this, if 2 people of completely equal skill start shooting at each other at the exact same time with assault rifles but the same person keeps winning because his gun kills 2 seconds faster no matter what, it kind of leaves the other player crippled, this plays into matchmaking as well because the high ranking guy will always have a waaaaaay better gun than the bronze player\nPAY 2 WIN: i agree that because the game is free, they have to make money somehow, but some of the guns in the armas market give you such an unfair advantage of anyone else and its complete BS, people will try to argue that there really is no difference here either, but those are the same people that payed for the guns and are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you with them, as a new player it takes you a long time to unlock a 3 slotted gun and the mods you need for it to compare to the market ones, so if you are new, you might as well just pay to buy a pre 3 slotted gun if you dont want to get stomped on.\nCHEATERS: wow, just wow, ok so a ton of people get banned for cheating all the time, however it is in waves so nothing is stopping them from creating a new account and continueing, also there are paid hacks which are non detectable for the time being. So, when you arent getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by the good players who dethreat(deliberately level down just so they can join noob servers) you are getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by cheaters. a small % are blatant as hell cheaters (24 kills 0 deaths and literally 1v4 a team, cooking grenades and throwing them at you before you are even in sight, jumping off a building and sniping you in mid air etc etc).  the other large % are closet cheaters that will actually pretend to be legit and let you kill them, but you will never win a match against them. i understand its a PC game and all pc games especially like this are susceptible to hacks, but damn it can sure f this game up from 0-60 in 2 seconds.\nMISSIONS&OBJECTIVES: maybe a little less than half of the time the objective will be extremely one sided, to the point where if the enemy team kills your team one time they will get such an unfair advantage to where your team would have to kill theirs 2 or 3 times, it goes both ways and its unfair no matter how you look at it, lets take the "keep possession of the suitcase final missions" for example, their team kills yours once and has enough time to put the suitcase in such an extremely hard area to access that even if you kill them all, they can all respawn and snipe you as you are trying to figure out how the F they put it on some seemingly impossible ledge to access, from that point its just waiting to lose because its bs. Or on occasion you will get the players who will get in the lead by 1 point or 1 kill, all get in cars and just run across the map, again, just wait till the time runs out to lose -_-\nEXPLOSIVE WEAPONS: If there is any game that they dont belong in (which is MOST games)   its this one, if your team has no grenade launchers and theirs has 2, the match becomes a nightmare because all they will do is sit about 80-90 meters away from the objective that YOU have to capture, and they just launch rockets at it and grenades. some people argue "well its easy to dodge" or "they will run out of ammo". No and No.  its easy to dodge if you see them comming at you , but when its being launched NONSTOP SPAMMED from 80m away and you are trying to capture an objective, go outside on a rainy day and try to dodge all the raindrops.  They dont run out of ammo because they carry ammo crates and just stand on them for nearly infinite ammo, bummmerrrr... or when you need to drive to an objective and there is that same guy doing NOTHING but launching rockets at peoples cars, it really screws with the fun, hes litterally not even defending the objectives, hes just being an A-hole.\n\nAll in all the game is definately worth a try, its pretty easy to get into and it doesnt consume a lot of time, you can play for 20 minutes then go to work, so its not something you have to dedicate your life to, to be any good. the game is pretty softcore and casual, you will have the players who boast they are gold and are super pro and make jabs on bronze players, but gold threat is super easy to acheive, its not special. the customization is a huge thing, it other games had the customization like this one does they would be soooo much better, im pretty sure its one of the biggest things keeping this game alive. You cant go too wrong on a free game so you might as well give it a try, like i said though before in the cons... prepare to get ♥♥♥♥♥ and frustrated by cheaters and good players who de level on purpose because they are A-holes, just to kill noobs. For sure though you can put more time in it than you would a $60.00 game, so id say its worth the time.\n","May 14, 2014","true","273.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is "cheating", most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.\n\nI recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies.

It's one of those games where you can always come back to, and feel welcome back when you do.\nI have over 500 well spent hours in the game, either raging, creating, whooping ♥♥♥, or just chilling with my online mates talking about the government or something stupid. There is a huge amount of freedom in the game. You start off with a car, gun, pistol, and one character mod. The start car also comes with a spawning becon, where you can spawn into a moving getaway car! Awesome right? It is a pay to win game though. Now with my amount of hours, you're probably thinking, I'm one of those payers? Well no, i wasnt all i baught was a car. But with practise, i started whooping ♥♥♥ big time, pay to win players where raging at me. There was only one character I was afraid of, but unfortunately i cannot remember her name. All i know, is if you want to practise your aiming ablity, dont go sniper first, go N-tec. Definately a gun where you can whoop ♥♥♥ with or without mods. You do need some processing power, pc and mind wise. Teamwork is key to beat anyone. Anyone with a good team, can beat a pay to win team.\n\nA good strategy, and keep your eyes on the map. Avoid sprinting in close corners, you dont always have to right click aim, you can shoot from the hip, dont reload around enemys, switch to primary. Remember to always try flanking the oposing team. Shoot in small bursts, aka dont hold the trigger, constantly click it. It does help! I reccomend not having auto ready on, as some people need to get ammunition, different cars, see someone etc before a new mission. You dont have to mission for money, you can ramraid, or catch raiders.\n\nIf you need to know more, just ask me and dont uninstall EVER! Because i guarentee satifaction with the game.\nIts not easy to start off, but once your driving skills has increased. Reduction of lag, and you've gotten decent aim, or decent teamwork you will be loving it!\n\nAlways make sure you join a clan/guild on the game. The wurst thing about this game is playing alone. Always try to go with people who you know are like in missions so you always know the best thing to do in the mission for the win.\n\nIt's not about the kills, It's about winning, aka stealing kills, is fine! sounds like a dicky thing, but the better gamers are like more help the better!\n\nI can't play the game anymore as i got my own pc now, and untill i get a motherboard that isnt made of stone, i wont be playing it, but untill then ill just be dreaming about coming back to this AWESOME GAME!!!!","April 18, 2014","true","743.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can find a group to do it with it's up there as one of my favorite shooters..  It's not a GTA MMO, more like cops and robbers-- strictly PVP.  The weapons are versatile, the scenery is beautiful and the customization is unmatched.  A word of advice though-- do not buy any weapon with real money. It's not worth it.  Buying clothes, sure? Buying weapons doesn't give you a real leg up, and they're all over priced and normally only last a few days.  I get why they have a rental system from a marketing standpoint. It's just kind of bull.  The driving is fun too....so so fun. The learning curve isn't steep, and generally they do a good job of keeping the bronze and gold players apart.","July 19, 2014","true","142.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The problem with APB is that it takes too many bullets to drop an enemy,  and the missions devolve into an impenetrable defense.  In order to do well at this game you have to know where these hideouts are, and be the first to get there,  which means playing like a lamer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyachup/recommended/113400/","gyachup","gyachup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyachup/","153 products in account","Seriously probably my favorite game on Steam right now.  The game world is insanely fleshed out, with literally paragraphs of text about every imaginable part of the city.  The city really feels alive, with people walking around and the dynamic of other players that you see everywhere lending to the feeling of really being in San Paro, and as an Enforcer, really wanting to protect the city.  The combat is awesome, and is literally the favorite of any shooter I have played.  The third person view makes for some intense fights, with vantage points, corners and a well balanced team helping out immensly, and making acting as a team extremely important.  The community is rich, vibrant and involved, with many members making amazing customs designs for vehicles and contributing to the game culture and story by customizing themselves and their cars with really intricate, professional-looking and amazing designs.  The cars and guns are all very unique and cater to many different play styles, with an LMG feeling very different and using a much different strategy than shotguns, and having one of each is extremely handy.  Character modifications also help, with each strengthening the specializations you can have, but are not necessary to winning or to playing, as both the starting gun and car are actually good enough that you don't need to buy the next tiers if you don't want (many high-tier players still use the Star (the first gun) later in the game).  Yet each new car and gun feels very cool, and are great incentives for increasing levels.  Each new contact has a unique backstory, and the new items are actually exciting, as some of the coolest cars and guns can be a lot of fun to unlock and use for the first time, and each new (and more prestigious) contact that you couldn't talk to before seem cool and exciting, and makes the sense of progression extremely satisfying.  The whole game can be played without buying anything with real money or having premium, and the game is nowhere close to a pay to win, with each gun and car always being balanced by another, and almost all can be purchased with in-game cash in a very reasonable amount.  The game is very, very fair, and paying money is usually just for cool stuff that could be unlocked anyways, with the aesthetic value serving as the impetus, not the over-poweredness.  Almost all can be unlocked in game, and the higher-tier premium players are indistinguishable from those that are free to play, as both have the same benefits for the most part and most of the elite items are unlocked with high-level contacts.  Everything about this game is solid, well thought out and rich in both depth, story, and game feel, and the controls of driving and shooting are seamlessly integrated into what is my favorite game of all time.  I've had hundreds of hours just having fun with friends, driving around the streets of San Paro having a blast racing, shooting and delving deeper into the amazing world Reloaded Studios has created.  This game is amazing, and I love it.  I can only give it the highest possible recommendation.  If you're thinking about getting it, get it.  If you're not, still do.  This is the most solid game I have ever played, and is also the most fun.  I love APB :D","January 8, 2015","true","737.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToxicPhoenix/recommended/113400/","ToxicPhoenix","Toxic Phoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToxicPhoenix/","468 products in account","To start, I am very on the fence about ABP Reloaded. The techniques used by Gamersfirst are not what I would expect from a dev, but I'm not them so I have no opinion from their POV.\n\nThe overall gameplay of it is quite fun and can bring you hours upon hours of fun...\nChasing after some criminals you just saw smash their van into a jewlery story and robbed it dry can be immense fun. Or perhaps you're the one who just mugged a drug dealer walking down the street, you now have to sell the drugs, and launder the cash all while avoiding the keen eye of the hackers you are playing against. Oops I meant cops... my bad.\n\nThough it lacks in variety during your gaming experience (Your variety of objectives is quite limited). It is still a cops vs robbers game. Like when you were a child, only now it is virtual. The amount of detail though, is rather high. It has a built in "photoshop" where players can fully customize and design graphics for nearly any item you can aquire. The game has a built in community auction house for buying/trading your cars and guns or anything you want, between other players.\nYou have the ability to import your own music (Or you could when I played last), which is refreshing. Listening to whatever you want.\n\nThe graphics, depending on your hardware can range from sufferable to quite fantastic. It's no farcry 3 but with a quality PC you will have a hard time not enjoying yourself atleast a little. Not including bugs/glitches that come with the game, you will come across your fair share of hackers... It does ruin the experience. Not to mention... but i'm going to... Gamersfirst has consistently released patches that were... broken to say the least and I feel on a personal level, that the attitude the devs show towards the game has possibly scared some players away. It has done that to me in the past.\n\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, It feels to me as if the game tries to lure you in. Once you've invested enough time and effort into hittting a certain rank, that the only way to further yourself is to become a premium member... I mean why not, you get not only almost double the Exp/$ per mission, but you also get a 50% reduced cooldown on your abilites (Wait... you pay for that passive skill?) plus a whole bunch of other junk to sweeten the deal, which in return will make you stronger. But then you will also need the premium guns, to match your bad-assness, which don't come with the premium service... but atleast you get a 20% discount in the micro-transaction store, to intice you to spend more real life currency. Sweet deal eh? Nah... I don't reccomend you buy premium unless you are truly going to invest time into the game.\n\nCustomization - 8/10\nStory - 5/10\nMusic - 9/10 (Import your own :))\nGameplay - 6/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone who has player cops vs robbers as a child and wants to expand that experience into a virtual one.","January 8, 2015","true","140.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The weapons are versatile, the scenery is beautiful and the customization is unmatched.  A word of advice though-- do not buy any weapon with real money. It's not worth it.  Buying clothes, sure? Buying weapons doesn't give you a real leg up, and they're all over priced and normally only last a few days.  I get why they have a rental system from a marketing standpoint.

I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest & I decided I was done with it.\n\nIf you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers & hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...","December 4, 2013","false","143.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.\n\nMuch like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars.

But it will quickly become aparent to any player that this game is a pay to win game. And the real money weapons trump any chance of fun, or fairness, greatly. This quickly becomes apparent when you get into a match where one or more players have a rocket launcher. A real money only weapon, these quickly kill anyone and anything they hit. Escort mission? Rocket launcher wins. Evade mission? Rocket launcher wins. Capture the point, King of the Hill? You guessed it. Rocket launcher wins. Sure you can argue that this would be how a rocket launcher works, but this is the only realism, as in any other shooter the player characters are able to take half a magazine of AK-47 rounds in the torso and still walk away.\n\nNow to not be all negative, I must say they do have an excellent character customization system.  One of the most in depth on the market still. Even a freebie player can have some decent threads after playing for a bit. Of coarse that does mean braving the missions and hoping your little lowbie doesn't get placed against a squad of max levels that have all dropped over $200 on the game. Sadly, no customizing the smear they'll turn you into.","March 28, 2015","false","86.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole idea is great, the customization is, by far, the best I've seen in any game of any kind, the vehicles are pretty cool and the mechanics work great. The contract-leveling based mechanics works really good and makes you want to keep playing and getting better.\n- Out of this world customization for clothing, tattoos, vehicle decals, etc\n- Really fun game, specially if played with friends\n- Perfect for recording fun moments of fooling around/chasing wanted people\n- Good leveling system\n\nTHE BAD- Matchmaking is seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up. You might be a total noob on your first mission and get matched against a top tier player with a gazillion P2W weaps.\n- Hacks everywhere (I really mean EVERYWHERE - and not even smart hackers). Since there are free hacks, people just  go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game and hack just because they can.\n- The game gets really frustrating when all districts are filled with rage hackers that even live stream their hacking rampages. At those times, you can only laugh or ragequit.\n\nTHE UGLY- No hack protection. FairFight is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.\n- Power abusive admins: My account was STOLEN by an admin.\nThis was quite some time ago. I was playing a game against a few dudes (one with the same in-game name as a forum admin) , I killed him like 6 times in a row while defending a point and all of the sudden I was kicked from the server (first time in over 2 years of playing), with a screen that said: "Admin kick - Reason: TROLOLOLOLO". I was unable to log in for a few hours and then I received a message saying I was banned. When looking up the code, it was because of "hacks".\nI had tons of gameplay recorded of me getting some really good scores and great kills with NO HACKS AT ALL, so I decided to post in the forum explaining everything. I was an active member of the forum and I instantly got support from the most "famous" players, but my post was deleted by the same admin I was playing against and my account was banned shortly after that. A few days later, my friends started seeing my custom decals/tattoos and cars for sale.\nI made a new account and decided to start taking with one of the admins in charge, the amazing Para.\nThere was an investigation already in progress because of several cases like mine, but Para left Reloaded/GamersFirst before accomplishing anything because the abuse was not only towards the players.\n\n\nTL;DRAmazing and entertaining game destroyed by hackers and piece of ♥♥♥♥ admins that abuse players and steal their accounts.\nIf you decide to play it, don't ever spend a dime on it You'll have fun unless forced to stop playing for a few hours because hackers decide to rage against the district making it unplayable.","March 24, 2015","false","655.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Think of GTA except in a massive multiple player world where you do missions throughout the city for money, you spend that moeny on better weapons, outfits, and cars. You can customize so much in the game. Free players get lots of features, you have to pay real money for simple things like bonuses in cash rewards and to be aloud to have more decals on shirts and cars.","August 30, 2012","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Even after almost 4 years I still enjoy it. And G1 is clearing out the closet hackers and all the new hackers pretty fast now. If the community would just clean up and be patient for the new engine, we've got ourself one hell of a game. The game isn't Pay2Win either. The default STAR is in the top 10 guns in the game due to its easy use. It's mainly skill, luck, and positioning. Take your time with this games immense learning curv, meet the positive community members, and have a blast with some friends while making new ones.","March 3, 2013","true","670.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
