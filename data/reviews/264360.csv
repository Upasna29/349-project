"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quickmanx2/recommended/264360/","quickmanx2","/FSnC\ Forte ∅","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quickmanx2/","74 products in account","I'm going to come back here and update this review. A lot has changed relatively fast, as it typically is in MMOs, so I feel like my old review is a little inaccurate. My first review of this game was posted slightly after 4th Jobs were added if my memory serves, and the game is just... so different now.\n\nFirst, I still recommend it. It's a very new player friendly MMO, and while that annoys me personally, I get the push to make games like this more rewarding to a new player. It's a great experience overall and the story translation is getting better bit by bit. The localization team is also getting a lot better about pushing updates through at a more timely pace - if you knew how long it took to get Season 2, much less the episodes of Season 2 vs Season 3 and then almost immediately Counterattack and Vagrant, you would think the localization team was replaced by gods.\n\nSo, what changed so much for me to think I need to come back and update a year and a half old review? Everything. Literally everything. When I wrote this review at first, there were six classes, the most recent being Soul... Lord? Master? Edgy Wizard. It was a pretty strong class with few noticable downsides, a stark contrast to the second most recent class at the time - Engineer, which is a class made of downsides and few noticeable postives.\n\nFast forward to now. We were treated to the introduction of a new class - the Card Master. Unleash your inner YuGiOh and throw playing cards at your enemies to destroy the forces of evil... and sometimes capture the forces of evil and use them to destroy the forces of evil! ... So yeah, less like YuGiOh and more like Pokemon. Maybe if the two met. Sounds like it would make a great anime. This class came along with Season 3, which brought tremendous change to the game's basic systems, simplifying almost every aspect of gameplay, and bringing out quite a few gripes from me personally.\n\nFirst and most notably, the weapons system was overhauled. Instead of having unique weapons that you can find from various enemies, each with specific stats to help encourage a particular playstyle, you get two generic classes of weapon - basic, and (S). Only a fool would ever use the basic weapons as they come with no bonus stats, never drop with an option (enchant) on them, and are significantly less powerful than the (S) weapons. Why weapons that aren't (S) weapons exist is well beyond my comprehension, because it doesn't add the same depth of gameplay that, say, having ten different swords to choose from did. Sure - towards endgame, everyone just uses the same powerful weapons from endgame dungeons, but there was a certain charm in seeing lower level players (and sometimes higher leveled players) choose a weapon because of its slightly unorthodox stats.\n\nWeapons weren't the only thing - class specific armor was removed entirely until level 180, forcing every class to equip themselves the same and reap generic stamina/strength benefits. It's worth noting that since luck has a semi-unknown effectiveness cap, there's not much point in stacking in, and since only three of now eight classes use magic primarily, it's sensible to just protect mages until level 180, but having to choose what armor you like the best based on the same principle of diversity that weapons once presented just feels better, like you're actually doing something, you know? An even bigger problem (for me personally, your mileage may vary) is how good the generic (S) armor is. They outshine the instance dungeon armor hands down, and protect even the squishiest classes against otherwise challenging boss monsters and huge mobs of enemies. To get the same challenge from low level instance dungeons that newer players would get in Season 1, they'd have to take their armor off entirely. The incredibly powerful weapons would probably still end the fight too fast for the boss to have a fair chance, though.\n\nSimplification isn't always bad though. Potions no longer come in health, sp, and combination, and instead only come in combination, and they heal huge. As a Savior main (tremendous HP), HP potions never did anything for me, but now I can get a full heal off of just one potion. Yeah, it's easier than it once was, but it's a welcome change to have potions that heal enough to satisfy every class' needs. Crafting was simplified as well, but it's a bit more double edged - it's easier to gather materials to make weapons, armor, accessories, and food, but crafting has been made generic - no one needs to find a refiner to get them to make cloak kits to take to an accessory crafter and have them make cloaks - you can do it all yourself now. Again, this is just a personal gripe because I prefer slightly more complex systems, and in the end, it really does make crafting a more enjoyable experience. You also level it up by paying in game currency instead of having to craft 10 billion worthless items.\n\nAs it stands now, you might as well consider yourself new until you hit level 170, and then the game actually starts. The problem now, though, is how much of a sharp increase there is in difficulty past that point. Dungeons go from extremely easy to unfair just like that, and for new players who aren't used to the steady climb in difficulty of Season 1 (and to a lesser extent, Season 2), it seems really sudden. Even to someone like me who's been playing for four years, the endgame dungeons seem poorly balanced to favor players who enchant their gear to get overpowered stats - and honestly these dungeons are all but impossible to complete without overpowered enchants. It seems like a poor choice on the developer's end to balance these dungeons to challenge the players who purposefully made the rest of the game too easy for themselves, instead of balancing the difficulty towards the middle of the road players who were taught by the game that they'll make it if they stay dilligent.\n\nJust to provide an example - the first true endgame dungeon is Velfa Library. The boss does almost exclusive magic damage (which most armors and classes do not defend against), but the generic mobs in the dungeon have reasonable HP and while they hit hard, they don't hit super hard. This dungeon is a reasonable challenge, and is balanced well for the level you're supposed to visit it at.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the newer dungeons, Road of Dream, is full of generic mobs that hit like a freight train and have health on par with the boss of Velfa Library, each. If you haven't come geared to hit for 100,000 at minimum and/or take thousands of damage per hit, you won't last here for more than a minute.\n\nI wouldn't complain about the unreal difficulty if anything in the game up to that point prepared you for it, but nothing comes close. Like I said, you go from "wow that was a great dungeon and a real challenge" in Forgotten Garden, to dead in two hits at Ymir, and you're hard pressed to even level up enough to face these challenges. Ymir becomes available to players at level 190, but at 197 I can't make it past the first room.\n\nOh, and before I forget, let's talk about Wanderer, the eighth class. Soul Man was Edge Magician, so now meet Edge Warrior. A class all about slinging a huge katana everywhere, but wait! The katana is actually a lamp. Like Card Master, this class forgoes the idea of an SP bar, and instead uses something a little different but exactly the same. Also this class is STRONG, like level 50 hitting as hard as a 197 Savior strong. It honestly annoys me to think about how rediculously strong the class is, and although I haven't played it, stats-wise I can't find a downside. I've been in parties with them though, and their average damage output of a few hundred thousand is exactly what the endgame calls for. Now if only they'd balance the rest of the classes like that.\n\nAgain, I still love this game and recommend it for its gameplay, but when you reach true endgame, it might be your breaking point.","June 18, 2014","true","101.4"," 372 of 416 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","372","416","0","11"

This will be a very long post, but I intend to provide clear, current information about the game so that readers might make an informed decision before committing to a download. Though I may not have put thousands of hours into Latale, I'm an old MMO hand and extremely picky when it comes to games  - the eighty hours of gameplay I've put in were enough to get a character to level 160, create a guild, and otherwise see everything the game has to offer. As such, I have some valid input - I encourage you to read everything I have to say.\n\nPlease note that the date of this review is Septemeber, 2015. The information provided should only be considered accurate up to this date. Drastic changes have been made to LaTale and more will undoubtedly come. Keep this fact in mind if you find this review at a later date. Tha being said, lets dive on in.\n\nCONS:\n\nGAME-BREAKING PROBLEMS:\n-Confusing quests/translations\n-Content is a year behind the Korean version\n-Content has been constantly and drastically changed\n-Content is broken or unfinished in some places\n-Community is lacking members, support, guides, and information\n-Gameplay is entirely quest-based and far too easy\n-Enchanting destroys your items gratuitously, despite the initial "95%" success rate (there are hidden factors that cause items to explode way more than they should - trust me, I did the math)\n-Crafting is limited, requires a huge initial investment to be able to use, and has depressingly low success rates\n\nMINOR COMPLAINTS:\n-The sub-class is useless\n-Sprinting mechanic is clunky\n-Players don't control passive stat point allocation upon leveling\n-There are many vestigial items left in the game (items that once were used for crafting, alchemy, or upgrades and currently have no apparent function)\n-FALSE DIFFICULTY (only time you die is when creatures render you immobile by "chain attacking" as a mob so you can't move, jump, attack... other features like this make it seem unfair to the player and is just frustrating)\n-Questing becomes unimaginative and repetitive\n-Certain consumables have extra-long cooldowns when they really shouldn't have one to begin with\n-Certain classes are clearly better than others (cardmaster) and yet others are clearly pointless to play (poor knights...)\n\nPROS:\n-Casual\n-100% free to play\n-There is no pressure or need to spend money on fashion items (which can be bought through NPCs or players with in-game currency)\n-Devs are generous and frequently give free cash shop items\n-Small, friendly community\n-Game economy is stable\n-Plenty of things to keep you busy after reaching lvl200\n-Beautiful art, music, and animations\n-PVP & PVE\n-Endless quests\n-Plenty of ways to add passive stats to your character (guilds, dating, item codex, monster images, titles, etc...)\n-Decent character customization\n-There is no real way to "ruin" a character build\n-NO HACKERS, SCAMMERS, OR BOTS\n-Despite being behind on content, devs seem to still have presence and update semi-regularly\n-In game achievements\n-Addictive combo-based fighting\n-GOOD  PVE equips often FOUND through drops\n-Nostalgic\n\nNow, let me explain some points a bit in further detail and then wrap it up. It may seem like there is a lot of bad here, but consider that a  lot of the content issues I have brought up only occur in specific situations. For instance, when I said that some of the content is broken or missing, I am not referring to abundant, general glitchiness. There were a couple situations where broken content clearly inhibited the gameplay. For example, at the water dragon boss - the portal to move to the third instance of the boss fight is broken. I could not continue the fight, so I was not able to finish the quest. This left a bad taste in my mouth because I had to waste a warp capsule and I left the dungeon feeling deprived of potentially awesome content. Things like this frustrate players (especially veteran players who might have nostalgia about that boss).\n\nFurthermore, there were several quests that frustrated me because they were confusing. So they ended up cluttering my quest log. Translation was extremely on-point for this game in terms of grammar. Yet, I found myself wanting more clear and detailed explanations for certain dialogues (which may be attributed to the inherent translational errors resulting from language differences).\n\nFor instance - the sub-class quest! If I hadn't done preliminary research on the topic, I would have ended up freaking out because it seems like your character gets demoted to level 140 and loses all its stats, skills, and equipment. I spent hours looking for resources that just werent there (I had to search forums and piece together little tidbits of info just to figure out what exactly the subclass was). If the quest dialogue had been just a tad more explanative and detailed, I would have known that a specific NPC (available in the Guild Hall *take the town portal*) allows you to change between your main class (which isn't lost) and  your sub class every -thirty minutes- (which is why the sub-class is utterly useless IMO) Yet another quest has you purchase a special warp capsule to enter a mario-themed 8-bit retro world and complete a series of jump quests. The quest dialogue says absolutely NOTHING about that fact.\n\nThe WORST error I discovered was a quest that told me to hunt "Humbaba 18+" monsters, which don't exsist. However, there exists a "Humbaba 14+." Naturally, I assumed these must be the monsters I needed... Nope. Turns out it was a completely different monster, with a completely different name, that I needed to complete that specific quest. That's the sort of error that makes gamers pull hairs and grind teeth. It was a clear content error, which when considered with all the other minor errors and frustration points, made me feel like I was playing an unfinished product.\n\nThe fact that the game is free means that I have no real right to complain about recieving a sloppy product. However, there are clear indications that this game was once an MMO giant with tons of features and content. There are vestigial items that indicate crafting was once intricate and involved. You have a mining action, and there are mining spots... but, mining yields no items and has no purpose in the game. There is the option to upgrade your items and add runes, but they don't work or require mining items you will never get. So it's obvious they already had a complete and AWESOME game. What is left is a fragmented ghost of a once amazing and addictive product. Why ruin a good thing?\n\nI gave it some thought and I decided that they ultimately changed the game for the better. If the game is involved and hard, it makes it really convenient for people to take advantage by botting, scamming, and hacking... So the community suffers. Additionally, if the game is so hard and involved that players never reach the level cap - there are so many people who will never get to experience the full game. There will be tons of worlds, quests and monsters they will never see because they refuse to hack the hundred-billion ely needed to create the overenchanted equips necessary to fight high level monsters. OGplanet took a stand against that culture and made the gameplay to where you can just kick back with a friend and have FUN. I feel like the changes targeted stressful time wasters like mining because they inhibit progress and encourage a negative community. Now, you don't even need enchants to PVE well... Just good skills. All in all, it's what I was looking for - a relaxing and colorful FREE MMO with friendly people to kill wild boars with :3 It would be better if it was complete and polished, but I can look past it. Hopefully this review provided enough info for you to decide whether you can look past its faults or not for yourself.","September 15, 2015","true","996.4"," 128 of 141 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","128","141","11","5"

I have to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this game. My experience has just been a mindless repetitive grind with little customization outside of appearance.\n\nSuppose I'll start with what I mean by "little customization." You earn a single skill point each time you level up. You use these to learn new weapon attacks and passive skills. Every weapon tree, however, only has 4 or 5 attacks that have to be learned in a certain order. There's no branching, no "this or that." Just straight up, "these are your five attacks that you'll use over and over for the rest of your days." All skills, including passive ones, are level-locked also, further limiting your choices of where to spend your points. Further still, some classes only have one weapon type available to them (Soul Breakers, and Engineers of the starting classes).\n\nAfter undergoing my first class change from Knight to Guardian, Engineer to Meister, and Explorer to Treasure Hunter, I noticed that of the three, Guardian and Treasure Hunter play very much the same as their first-tier counterparts. You start off with slightly flashier versions of the same five skills you had previously (in the case of Knight to Guardian, you lose the ability to use any other weapons besides knuckles), and not much else noticably changes. Meister was the only class of the three that played differently in that now instead of swinging around a fashionably metrosexual pumpkin man-purse, I now had a nifty yellow mech as my weapon. Unfortunately with the mech, every attack, even basic attacks, drain your SP. Having low SP to begin with, I was only able to fight one or two enemies before having to rest. Not sure if I was just doing something wrong, but needless to say, I didn't exactly see a whole lot of meisters rolling around.\n\nLeveling in LaTale consists of talking to one quest giver, receiving multiple quests to kill certain enemies, completing thosequests, then receiving more quests to kill those same enemies five more times until you move to the next area and repeat the process. It's incredibly tedious and gets very stale quickly.\n\nThere seems to be some sort of crafting system, but I could never figure out how to participate. It's not included in any of the tutorial quests. Further, equipment and potions drop so frequently, I question just how useful crafting would even be in this game.\n\nI have some minor issues with the interface also, such as the inability to increase the font size, and how your tracked quests disappear from your HUD whenever you log out or the game crashes. Again, rather minor.\n\nOne last thing...prirings are totally and unabashedly a ripoff of porings from RO.","September 16, 2014","false","133.1"," 181 of 250 people (72%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","72","181","250","17","4"

The original hotkeys are also sort of strange in comparison to other MMOs. You can set them yourself, but initially, will be a little confusing.\n\n- Quest UI:\nThe quest UI is a little strange in that, it has the story description of the quest on the first tab and then another tab for the specific quest description/reward. It's not a terrible feature, but it's not quite convenient either. You always have to click over to see the specifics. A quest bar on the side will pop up also to help you track your quests, but clicking on them doesn't bring up the quest in the quest log, so that's also not very convenient.\n\n- Quests are a bit boring:\nI normally love the grind on MMOs, but it just doesn't seem too fun in this game. You collect a quest to kill certain mobs and then after turning it in, you are asked to kill them again to collect items from them, and sometimes even asked to go back a 3rd time to kill the same mob to get a different quest item. It seems a bit too tedious.\n\n- Not much difficulty:\nIt's pretty easy. I guess the first 20 levels of any MMO can be described the same way, but I mean, I didn't really have to try too hard to be good at my class.\n\n- Limited Battle Customization:\nMaybe I was spoiled with WoW, but it seems like the battle customization is pretty low. I've gotten a few new skills and chose where to put my skill points in my own order, but they are still capped by levels. I suppose that's fair, but in terms of having unique skills, you kind of just put the points in your own order, but you're still dictated by the level system. I'm sure this won't be a problem in later levels, but for now, it does make leveling not very fun.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good game, but I couldn't see myself investing a lot of my time into this game. I'm glad to have gotten the experience so far and will probably grind a bit more just to see if my opinion changes. I wouldn't recommend the game as a long term game, but I would recommend it if you're looking for a friendly place to game,","February 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

For newer players the game can be more challenging without the money to add extra stats, but that's part of the fun. The playerbase consists of lots of humorous, nice people and the GAs/GMs are interesting when they are around.  If you like grinding, you can join in and have fun. If you like questing, you can do the same.  LaTale has a bit of everything for everyone to help satisfy the 2D platforming genre, whether it be focused in social or pure battling.  With a level 200 level cap and tons of content to come, as they arrise, I would recommend LaTale for anyone to try.\nIf you need help, I don't mind if you ask me: ♫\nIGN:  Chronophobia, Lagombi, Eventreur","October 3, 2014","true","17.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eighto/recommended/264360/","Eighto","Eighto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eighto/","691 products in account","0 playtime because I've played this game a lot off steam. Like, more than I'd like to admit. Probably 1000+ hours worth, or somewhere around that number. I was there when the closed beta for both OGP and Aeria games held this little treasure, and I was there when there were just 4 initial classes, and you had to get to 80 to rank up. Back when puzzle pieces were locked behind a paywall.\n\nNeedless to say, I've played this game a lot. Not so much anymore, what with real-world responsibility weighing down on me, but I can tell you for a fact that this MMO is definitely worth your time.\n\nThe animations are fluid, and the way combat works is very different from Maple Story, and I believe it looks a thousand times nicer too. Whereas in Maple you'll usually stick to a spot, throw a couple skills out at enemies, jump around to avoid an enemy or something then repeat, Latale has you constantly spamming your rather nice looking skills, stick-then move basis where enemies go down relatively quickly to  your power in a gratifying and enjoyable way. And the game rewards you for your quick movements and your quick attack chains with a hit counter (Which, by the way, increases your exp and ely awards the higher it is).\n\nSince it's many updates and balances, Latale has a total of 6 initial classes (since I last checked), the 4 main ones (Warrior, Knight, Wizard, Explorer) splits off into two paths each, while the other two (Engineer, Soul breaker) just change into their own new thing. These changes happen at level 40 (Used to be 80, that being a long and arduous journey to get there), and once you do get to that golden number, just about everything changes. Whatever class you chose to go into at that level gets massive buffs, new skills, sometimes even new playstyles (Like Engineer --> Meister, go from wielding a suitcase into a pilotable mecha. No, nothing in that sentence is a typo.), which radically either changes the game, or sets you on a new course with new skills and powers to try out on the masses of enemies just awaiting to die. And the class upgrades beyond that do just the same.\n\nLately, the game seems to have gotten a pay-to-win vibe to it, which is very discouraging to new players. But most of the items you can buy in the item shop, you can attain in-game through either some work or some of the many events that OGP seems to like to throw it's players. Stuff like the fashion items and the auto-loot pets, along with some other key items that makes life super easy is locked behind that paywall. It's fairly annoying, but the game's entertainment value for what it does and it's wild ride more than makes up for it. Plus, if you do so choose to spend money, you get some relatively good value for what you spend (Take advantage of the sales!).\n\nUnfortunately, like almost all MMOs do, it starts to get grindy once you start getting to 70+. Fairly late in the game, and at the point where you've already accomplished so much, and there's much more to go, that you'll either want to keep going, or you'll start to fall out and just play once in a while. I'll leave this particular part up to you to decide if you'd want to keep going from there. But even if you do play up until then, it'll be the best ~70 levels you've ever played in an MMO, I guarantee it.\n\nNot gonna lie, there is some pretty bad localization in this. They've had over a few years to get it right, and they still haven't, even some of the NPCs that have been in the game since day 1 of closed beta. If you're a grammar nazi, or if seeing silly sentences turns you off, be warned. There's some story to the game, and unless you have an open mind or you're totally cool with skipping all the dialogue and text boxes on the quests, you'll get annoyed quickly. There's some untranslated items sprinkled around too, though not nearly as common.\n\n\nTo sum it all up, Latale is a fantastic ride, with it's combat feeling fresh and exciting with each new skill and class one tries out, and continues to do so until the later levels. While the game is slightly pay-to-win, it's largely negligible unless you want to take a bunch of shortcuts or have that autolooting pet. The localization is at best passable, and at worst downright terrible, but if you can look beyond that, latale is a fantastic MMO to sink your teeth into.\n\n\nAnd no, it's not a Maple Story clone. IMO, I think Maple could take some lessons from Latale.","September 25, 2014","true","7.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

A few quests trick you into getting an item in the description while the goal of the quest is different but a careful eye can spot this out easily.\n\nIt is easy to pick up and play however I suggest researching the classes, watching game-plays to see which class line-age you want to start as because you cannot change it and sadly all names you delete cannot be re-used!\n\nYou can transfer ely and cash items through the bank/fashion shop to your other characters on the account however my only problem here is that pets cannot be transferred to other characters. Most likely to stop hackers stealing them but this can get annoying when you have to feed multiple ones every month which can add up to some costly ely in-game if your not a rich player.\n\nHighly reccommend getting this otherwise for the little nit-picks.

Eh, I give it a rough estimate of probably 200 hours+...\n\nPros:\n- Entertaining community.\n- F2P.\n> in game currency can get you some of the cash items.\n- Good amount of challenge in terms of gameplay.\n> Unique damage mechanic (Getting hit by multiple enemies punishes you vs Maplestory 1hit invincible iframe.)\n- Plenty amount of customization (even compared to JP, KR version.)\n- Storyline is pretty good.\n- Artwork is nice. Even the character models are not bad.\n\nCons:\n- Cash items isn't necessary, but grants you up to speed of progression.\n- Strange jibberjabber lags occurs once in a while.\n- Low player base. (Say hello to inflation!)\n- Outdated guides, and no known solid updated wikia page to help you.\n- Difficult gameplay:\n> Cooldowns galore, even your potions.\n\nThat's what I can only think of, I think this game is a good breath of fresh air if you want to play a new side scrolling MMORPG.","May 23","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has some things in common with Maplestory but it isn't a direct copy.\n\nThe tutorial is very confusing so far. You must kill a monster to complete a quest in the tutorial, while 50 people are trying to do the same thing at once. Bad first experience when you start playing!\n\nLooting manually is very tedious, althrough obviously, there's some microtransaction pets that loots your items if you're into that kinda stuff... The game is very slow paced ( at the beginning anyway. ) It also make use of X-Trap... There's only 1 server with 7 channels as far as I can tell.\n\nI think it has potential though, and the game seems like it has a good amount of content! The character customization is easy to use, the skills have some unique looks that i've never seen in other MMOs... Personally I do not like it too much, but it is free to play, you can always try it out! Just remember that there is a cash shop and it is slower-paced than most games i've played recently.","June 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 150 of 289 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","150","289","0","10"

More like 8,4/10\n\nUPDATE 2 : After La Tale : Infinity came the game got all laggy and stuff and had lots of problems with X-Trap. They fixed everything and reworked some of the arts, there is a new class with a really interesting story (Card Master). They fixed some translation errors and translated the stuff that was still in Korean ^^. Game has gotten much better and the new class is amazing. You can now level up faster too.

It has a cute artstyle, but the underlying game mechanics are a lot more complex than the appearance would lead you to believe.  There's tons of stuff to do in the game, from questing, to gathering up items and cards to build a codex of items/monsters, to instance dungeons that need eight players to do properly.\n\nThe recent season three update has vastly improved the game with lots of quality-of-life improvements, as well as making it significantly easier to get to high levels and reach end game.  The quest rewards have been significantly enlarged, making leveling, especially in lower levels quite simple.  Just do your quests and the levels will follow up till about level 100 when it starts to slow down.  (This slow down is temporary, as once you get another ten levels or so the amount of quests pick back up till around level 170/180.)\n\nGive it a try, it's free and a lot of fun.  I've been playing it since the closed beta in 2008, and made a new account on Steam just to have it on my account.

Graphics are cute, entertaining, and anime-like, but which may not appeal to everybody. The classes are diverse and various job advancements to choose and explore from such as a Warrior who will advance to eithier a Blader or a Warlord. Gameplay may be repetitive at times (I mean what MMO doesn't?), but keeps it entertaining with the animations of the skills. In my opinion, Latale has the best, if not, one of the best soundtracks which help shape the games atmosphere. Another great aspect of the game is the various emotions that keep the game diverse from other MMOs. Latale has one of the most friendliest community that I've experienced, which is probably another aspect on why I keep coming back to play.\nSo see for yourself about the wonders of latale\nNote: I've been playing Latale ever since 2009 on and off so I may not have any hours, or any on steam.","June 21, 2014","true","29.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think La Tale is a decent sidescroller mmo, and if you are into that sort of thing I would try it, but not on Steam. I dont know if it will be fixed by the time you read this but as of this review the Steam version of the game is so buggy a ton of people cant even play it with Steam (like me). Overall La Tale has all the things most anime mmo's have only La Tale is a sidescroller. It does do alot of things different, the combat is at least somewhat actiony, and you dont start the game with a quest to "kill 10 slimes" or a variation there of.\n\nThere is some pretty cool gameplay to be had in La Tale, if you can get it to work. There are tons of better games out there though, so no one will hold it against you if you dont like it. Feel free to try La Tale its free, Hopefully it will work better with Steam in the future.","July 8, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Leveling is pretty easy as well.\n\nThe downsides? It's riddled with bugs, there's broken translations and clunky controls. And considering this game is in it's 2nd season, something tells me a lot of it won't be patched. Also, some of the quests can get repetitive. Go to a town. Get told to this this and this. Done? Go to the next town. Do the exact same thing but with different monsters.\n\nIf you can ignore the bugs and the repetitiveness I totally recommend trying it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XxMeansKissKiss/recommended/264360/","XxMeansKissKiss","XxMeansKissKiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XxMeansKissKiss/","5 products in account","This is one of the best games I've ever seen. While mixing anime with an MMORPG, La Tale was born. This game is one of the best anime MMORPGs on Steam.\n\nThe game's community is ranged widley from children to young adults. There is much oppertunity to customize your character the way you like with Fashion Items, yet still functional as you can wear armor underneath. Event gift bundles give way to obtaining cute pets such as the Champion Wannabe Coco pet, a Christmas event reindeer pet.\n\nAs much as the community varies, I have not once seen any foul language or explicit topics in the chat. This is amazing and absolutley does make a more enjoyable game experience. Teaming up with other players is fun and a good way to handle Instance Dungeons. All you have to do is click on them and click "Invite to Party". Once they accept all the party members are listed on the left side of the screen, along with how much HP/SP they have. The Party Window allows you to see where all your party members are, so if you end up in a rather confusing Instance Dungeon you can all keep track of what's going on.\n\nEnough about the community, the game itself is an amazing place to play, even solo. The tutorial is quick, but still tells you what you need to know, giving you enough time to get started playing, even if you don't have hours. Equiping things is simple and understand the game's physics is easy. I'm totally addicted (and at this point at level 135 thank you very much). Leveling up is easy and grinding for XP is incredibly profitable in The Link Between Time, an area designed to give you high XP rates for your level, however quests are the best way to level up. I used to think the amount of quests was painful, but I've realised they're there so I can level up and get Guild Points. Monsters have their own sound effects and so do each classes special skills. There are different classes and class advancements for everyone. I've heard of subclasses, except I'm a Soul Lord so I don't know what those are. Most classes have four class advancements, or so I've heard. What I'm trying to say is: this game is just so original and cute that it's highly addictive.\n\nThere are a few more things I'd like to highlight:\n♥Fishing - Fishing is an incredibly relaxing and quite profitable thing to do, and the Rainbow Fishing Hole in Belos is exceptionally beautiful.\n♥The background music - The background music is simply gorgeous, and always fits the area it is used in.\n♥Guilds - Like-minded players, UNITE!\n\nAlso, another thing, the storyline is intriguing and complex, with many different characters, each with their own personality.

You do not need to spend money in game, as of yet, to progress in the game. However, I instantly fell in love with this game, within the first 3 hours of gameplay, I spent a small bit of money on it. £6 ($10). With this, I managed to get an awesome gothic themed outfit, an adorable pet and some special items which lets me finish my quest without having to speak to the quest-giver. Which I think is fairly reasonable considering other games I've played, the tokens have cost tons more and you can't get nearly as much as this. The basic armour is particularly fashionable and not an eye-sore. The weapons are also considerably badass-looking. I'm currently using a Staff (I'm a Wizard) which I think looks a bit like one of Sailor Moon's weapons.\n\nItems are relatively easy to retrieve via looting, however most drops are junk items - the game tells you this in a little note in the item's description. Lag is extremely minimal. I may have d/ced from the server once or twice in the course of 12 hours. The game has multiple channels with about 7 or so servers within each, which really helps the lag spread out and, well, not lag.\n\nOne thing that people will complain about is that this is a side-scroller. I am telling you now, it feels nothing like one of those. I know that sounds stupid considering it is in fact a side-scroller. But, it just doesn't really feel like one. The graphics are cute and very well done. I applaud the pixel artists and background artists that have put the effort into their job, it really shows. The music as well, extraordinarily beautiful. None of it is a slow, short and painful loop. Which I yet again commend, it never grates on your ears. Going back to the graphics, the attacks are fabulous. I feel as though some attacks aren't pixelated. The fire attacks I currently have don't look pixelated, which adds reality to the game. Some of the animations for the attacks are utterly adorable. For example, 'Bubble Bubble', your character uses a bubble blower to blow some bubbles. And afterwards their eyes go all wide and shiny. I love it. And something similar for 'Ice Spear', I think that's what it's called. The monsters are also very well pixelated, some of the pixelling in this game is gorgeous, and is enough to make you want to play.\n\nThis game has a combo system which lets you get attacks in quicker. All moves are AOE, apart from your regular attack which makes mobbing all the more easy. I play an RPG where a mage has extremely limited AOE moves, painful I tell you. As you increase the combo, you'll get more exp. Levelling up seems to be easy. I'm already level 30, but the levels do go ridiculously high, I think I've seen a level 192?\n\nWhat I've met of the players, they all seem to be English and friendly. Most higher levels are normally snobbish and frown upon lower levels, but they help you out and treat you as an equal, as it should be in all games.\n\nThe quests are very generic. Kill this, loot this, talk to this person. Which is one of the downsides to the game. I've already strayed from the quests as it is due to this. But I think most games are like this. Everyone eventually abandons the quests and goes off on their own. I think I've still got a level 3 quest there someone. Along with level 10s, 22s etc. You actually don't need the quests, however they do give you quite a bit of experience and 'Ely'. Which is the game's currency, much like most games is gold.\n\nThe pets in this game don't attack. The highest level for them seems to be 20. Apparently, which I had to find out from a higher level player because the help guide wasn't much help, the egg hatches at level 5, the pet matures at level 10 and it can change its appearance or something. I can't fully recall. Different pets have different abilities. My current pet can open a shop at level 5 and at level 10 it will increase my magic and luck. When your pet reaches 100% exp, you must go and buy a supplement to level it. There are 4 different supplements which increase in price. Lvl 1-4 which is 10k; Lvl 5-9 which is 30k or so and it increases accordingly. I think it eventually gets to 100k or something ridiculous like that. The first pet you get through a quest is useless, cannot hatch and has no abilities whatsoever. I would say it's there to look pretty, but it doesn't even do that. It's an egg with wings, called 'Handsome Egg'. Utterly useless.\n\nTo sum it all up, I would strongly recommend this game. But, remember my opening statement - 'I would like to start by saying that we all have our own preferences when it comes to gaming, so never 100% go off of reviews.'","August 31, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Love the combat combo system, where you can chain many skills together, has slightly improved from recently playing at 1st it was a touch tricky to get it right (might be lag, not sure) but works correctly\n\n2. The class system has imporved a great deal since i last played in 09/10, added some interesting classes that i would like to play\n\n3. Dungeons/Instances is slighty less difficult (at level) the first one you come to is some fire dragon (i forget the name @_@) with a good party and PLENTY of pots/cookies/candy, after a certain point you can go back and farm the place for money/equips that you would like for yourself or to sell off to other players\n\n4. The story quest may or maynot have improved as far as the translatations form when i 1st played didnt care to read it back then :P but it does have a spice of comedy to it\n\n5. In-game money comes fairly quickly, just depends on fast you farm or do quests\n\nCon:\n\n1. The cash shop pets do make it easier to quest, running in clearing a room and still get the drops, and farm for items while tryin not die misc. reasons the only issues is that for cash shop pets you need a cash shop pet revival item when it runs out\n\n2. Since the release on Steam there is no intergration between accounts, that im awear of so if you have a old account (like me) you cannot use it to play on Stream *insert rage emoticons*\n\n3. There is alot of kill this and collect that quest but i find that enjoyable, i cant say that for other people so it may effect other people negatively\n\nOverall i still enjoy this game alot and the new additions has my curiosity to say the least, and ill be diving back into it again, maybe yall will find me runnin around zerging quests :poohappy:","July 7, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the cutesy 2D anime graphics fool you, this game has tons of content that can keep you occupied for hours and hours.  I WILL say that the beginning of this game is quite tedious with the tutorial quest no lie, but after that it gets better as you level.    The thing that stood out in my opinion was the fact that there are so many classes to choose from, some that you would see in a typical mmorpg like Wizard or Warrior, and a few unique classes such as Soul Breaker and Engineer.\n\nEach class also has at most 2 advancements to choose from when you reach level 50, which takes less than a week, don't worry.  Examples of the advancements include Warrior's having a choice of becoming either Warlord, which specializes in the spear or two-handed sword, or Blader, which specializes in dual blades.  Which would you prefer if you were warrior?  Slow, but Powerful?  Or Fast attack speed with damaging combos?  You decide.\n\nI'm only talking about one class here too.  Even after 2nd Job advancements, the game takes it further with 3rd job advancements at lvl 100, then Sub-Class advancements at 140, and finally, the new edition 4th job classes at lvl 190.  Sounds like a long journey right?  It is.  However, with dedication and hard work, you too can gain 3rd job, and even 4th job too!\n\nMy highest level so far is Lvl 117, an Engistar (3rd job class Engineer), and im getting there, not giving up till I get that sub class! :)  Don't get me wrong, I don't play this game 24/7, I think of this game as a "pick up and play it for a bit" one.  Sure, you can just go all out and level to the max, but sometimes its best to take it slow, if you know what I mean.\n\nAND, of course, play with your pals too!  The game is enjoyable to its fullest if you have a full party of friends, heck, even strangers, duking it out on the Instance Dungeon bosses with healing support, tanking, and damage dealing as the perfect team comp.\n\nI Would talk more about La Tale, but, I'd just be going on and on xD.  So, with that in mind, see ya guys in game!\n\nIGNs on La Tale:  Valioa (lvl 140 Soul Lord),  And SacredBelmont (Lvl 123 Engistar)","July 4, 2014","true","123.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether your go solo or enjoy this game in a party of friends, you're sure to find yourself playing for longer than you'd think. As a Free to Play game, it isn't a Play to Win. You can put money into it if you enjoy it and have the change, but it isn't necessary at all to make an effective character.

It does take a while to lvl up but 2nd season has revoked the lvls for job advancement so it doesn't take as long as it used to.\nCons:\n- Good community even tho a little dead at high lvls\n- Grinding is fun and there's a lot of skills ingame\n- catchy songs :D\nBad:\n- most of the coolest customisation clothes require to be bought with IRL money.\n- takes a lot of time to lvl up at higher lvls.\n\nIt's a game you must try if you like 2D platform games or games that are grindy and have a "cutesy theme".

I honestly have never seen them and only heard of them in stories..\nBroken economy? No sir.\nBots? A few spam bots but the game has block features which mute players.\n\nNow for a review.\n\nIn short, You are a hero of the game (Not THE HERO... a hero), a young adventurer making your way in the world trying to figure out what happened to "Iris Livier" and her travelers. The story is in parts and along the way you unlock bits and pieces with semi deep quest lines and story telling (It honestly gets REALLY good towards end game). Like most MMORPGS you will be grinding and leveling. Questing and being challenged by dungeons and bosses (even special Time attack dungeons with bad ♥♥♥ music).

Why? Because after having seen this and having never played it before, despite having an OGplanet account, I decided to download it from Steam to give it a try. Now, long story short, I'm the sort who doesn't have alts. I have one main account I do my gaming on for every site, anything more being needed just seems unnecessary or boring to me.\n\nNow here's the thing. In order to play this game, since I have an OGplanet account already, I'd have to.. Make a second email address so I can make a new account. Why? Because Steam does not allow players to log in with existing OGplanet accounts.\nYup.\nYou legitimately cannot play this game through steam without making a brand new OGplanet account through steam.\n\nThat is why this game can't be recommended. The idea of such a massive gaping hole in the ease of access, and the hassle it requires. Maybe for new players who don't mind making an account for OGplanet, then it really doesn't matter. But its still a rather silly 'release' on steam, and quite honestly, shouldn't be released like that to begin with, regardless of any kind of company-side issues.\n\nAgain, this is just my review for 'La Tale on Steam'.

This entire game reeks of impending lawsuit.\n\nWhen a game copies like 95% of another game's content, you'd think the game would be at least good. Nope.

Nope.\nEither you wait forever to get good aesthetics or you deal and spend 1000000 in-game money to buy one piece of ♥♥♥♥ accessory that isn't all that great. Oh and I forgot to mention that the crafting system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you get practically no crafting items from any monsters unless you're super lucky or you don't get rid of any items ever.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that this game leads you on to something a little better, even as you're playing it and then after a couple hours of playing you wanna kill yourself because your character looks like a clone of every other character and you're mindlessly doing the same ♥♥♥♥ and never anything else.","December 26, 2014","false","23.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

In a desperate attempt to mix anime with MMORPGs, La Tale was born. Raised by Hades and and gifted to South Korea, this game is yet another horrible attempt to mix anime with anything.\n\nSeriously though, the game's community (can it be called that?) is of egostical children looting their parents' wallets for ingame-currency to buy random crap. What they do with said random crap is they stand around in the main area for players to feed their ego as players will (inevitably) shift their gaze to the players with the shiny horse-badger hybrid pet thing.\n\nEnough about the community, the game itself is an embarrassment. The tutorial is both vague and brief giving you not nearly enough information for the best game experience. To even equip things and understand the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics I had to be lectured by a friend (who's totally addicted and at this point probably at level 100 or something). I have nothing against the time it takes to level up but grinding for XP is the most horrible experience. After you've killed the first thousand gelatin cube enemies the sound of squelching becomes almost demonic. What I'm trying to say is: there's a low variety of monsters and enemies to battle.\n\nAnyway, don't get this game. Just take my word for it.","November 6, 2015","false","6.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The action is crisp and the controls are responsive, even during the very occasional lag. Classes are fun to play and varied between each other, and the stage areas are varied as well. The community is relatively helpful, and the world is beautifully done.\n\nThe main con is the fact that it is /poorly/ translated.

It is alot like maplestory but with much less classes to choose from. The combat is a little slower and more risky, as you lost XP when an enemy fell off a platform, but this may have been fixed. Also quests play more into leveling up than in maplestory.\n\nWithout friends to compete against, or play with, it could get old quickly, but thankfully i had a few good friends to play with in the past, and we messed around alot and even crashed the servers for a few days. No regrets, we lured flying enemies off the map with an emote glitch that let us fly off screen. And when we warped to town, the enemies stayed off screen. Any characters created after we despawned all flying enemies in the game, would become invisibile with floating armor. People could no longer loot items. They started banning invisible characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonicWraith/recommended/264360/","DemonicWraith","Cat Detective","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonicWraith/","31 products in account","La Tale Review\nFinally got around to write this review, this game is one of the few MMOs I actually like.\nDon't judge by my play time here.\nI've played for years on the OGPlanet Launcher.\n\nStory 	The story is rather simplistic.\nThe story is centered around Iris Reviere and her party.\nShe is an explorer with numerous adventures who made a name for herself.\nBut one day, she suddenly disappeared without notice and no one knows where she actually is.\nShe is the person that brings you in the world of La Tale and after that you are left on your own devices as you follow through her footsteps and in the process making it into your very own journey.\nThat's it for the story I guess, there alot more since the story is really big for an MMO but this is just a summary of what you should expect.\n\nGameplay	The gameplay in La Tale is great.\nThe combat especially.\nIt's dynamic, varied and fun.\n\nThere are plenty of weapons to use depending on your class and each one has alot of combo variety. Some are more focused on supporting fellow party members instead of hitting hard.\nSome focus on dealing damage with your spells and actives while others focus on raw damage straight from your basic attacks and tankiness.\nThere are alot of classes since every base class can go in 2 directions - either an upgrade of his defeault class or go on a totally different route with a completely new weapon.\n\nForgot to mention.\nThe game can get grindy depending on the class you are using\nIf you use Card Master or Wanderer you will have a great experience as they level up extremely fast but with other classes you will level up slower.\n\nThe game's level capacity is 250 if I am not mistaken. You could probably reach it in a month depending on the time you spent on this game.\n\nGraphics	The graphics are gorgeous in my opinion.\nCute anime graphics with great pixelated art and particle effects.\nAttention to detail in artwork is alot and is really appreciated.\n\nCustomization	Now, customization is really varied... that is if you are willing to pay ofcourse,\nYou can still look unique without really paying but it will require hard work so you can farm enough Ely - the ingame free currency in order to buy Astro items from the market and other people.\nHowever 90% of the Astro items are purely cosmetics and do not make you stronger at all.\nAstro is the premium currency.\n\nCommunity	This game has the friendliest community I've seen in a game.\nThe game advertises is self as the friendliest MMO and it does not lie.\nEvery single person I have met her - I have had great time with them.\nTelling each other dirty jokes or grinding together while\n\nMusic	Music is a joy to listen to, every track is beautiful and has it's own atmosphere.\nThe music is the thing that makes La Tale feel like La Tale.\nIt makes the game feel unique. (Despite being similar to MapleStory, lol... but judging how MapleStory is faring these days... you're better off with La Tale instead).","March 11","true","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/its0re0time/recommended/264360/","its0re0time","its0re0time","http://steamcommunity.com/id/its0re0time/","226 products in account","This game is not that horrible. Its for people who pull up youtube videos while leveling their guy up, not so much for people looking for a rich gameplay and story experience. Not that the gameplay and story is bad, actually its pretty good.\n\nUnlike Maplestory where if you just touch an enemy it registers damage, enemies have attack animations. This makes a huge difference because it allows you to dodge the attack and counter. People may think that this does not make such a difference, but it does especially when there is a combo system which rewards you with money and exp for high combos. You even get a light attack, strong attack, jumpings attacks, blocks, and more. However, leveling and killing certain monsters (ones that don't stagger) are much more difficult, but fun.\n\nEnglish translations are AWFUL like REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING BAD. Some npcs and items just have random symbols instead of words, however they are few and somewhat far between. Skills are pretty cool looking and interesting, however due to the lack of a LaTale youtube community, you will have to guess on what the skills does based on its description, which is sort of bad due to the translation errors.\n\nThere is a fashion shop and some items do give you stat bonuses, but the cool thing about this game is that you can actually pay for special points (not cash shop points) using in game money to buy those items for a limited time (however you can keep buying them). Also due to the amazing amount of events and dedicated staff, you can actually get permanent cash shop items and stuff just for free!\n\nNow the main downside of this game is the really bad tutorial. They really dont tell you very much and its a lot better to find a high level character and ask him or her for help.\n\nAll in all, 7/10. Get it if you like to watch youtube videos on the side while doing something somewhat productive.\nIf you say Maplestory is better, this game is much harder and has better staff, but somewhat smaller community.\n","July 31, 2014","true","152.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellipsai/recommended/264360/","Ellipsai","Ellipsis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellipsai/","21 products in account","I would play more of this game to get a better view of the overall experience but I would just like to talk about the new user experience for this game.\n\nWhen I started the tutorial it gave a ledge to give you something to learn jumping, however the message instructing you how to do this is off the screen until you go into the options and manually change the resolution, which for me made the window stretch below my menu bar. I could always play in full screen and probably get it back but for a game that starts up in windowed mode at the small resolution that doesn't show all the tutorial it's frustrating. (not to mention they don't tell you how to equip the 5-6 pieces of equipment you have from the start, but that might be my fault for not paying attention/ not playing long enough)\n\nI had issues with the game itself, such as not being able to end conversations with NPCs. I had to press the Escape key to exit  the conversation with the NPC literally every time I handed in or accepted a quest.  And after the first 5~ minutes the game became a quest per minute. obviously it would taper down after a while but for me it just made the quests become boring.\n\nFinally my last complaint is the movement is weird. It's like your character walks an extra step past wherever you try to go.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure despite these things this might be a good game but from my beggining experience I'm just not inclined to continue much farther. Not because I'm too lazy to learn how much I should move to get where I want or because pressing escape to end conversations gets annoying. It's because after 40 minutes I was so bored I just closed it and didn't want to open it again","July 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanitysbrink/recommended/264360/","sanitysbrink","HeartOfWolves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanitysbrink/","166 products in account","I wouldn't recommend ever even trying this. This game has some of the worse controls I've experienced. The normal walk speed is painfully slow. To run, you must double tap an arrow key. However, there is hardly a point to not be running, so why bother making the controls clunky when everyone just wants to run? Make the walk speed a toggle or something if you insist having two movement speeds. Aside from that, the skill trees are pretty flat and poorly laid out (hard to clearly see what skills progress into what other skills). Class descriptions in character creation are horribly lacking, so you don't really know what you're picking. The text they use for character names blends into the background, making finding NPCs a chore. Gameplay is pretty bland, though the possibility of comboing moves is there - so at least you have to mash more than one button to win. Quests are the typical kill x and collect y.\n\nHOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO GET STUCK ON A ROPE FOR IT TO WORK PROPERLY? I swear, every other time I climb up a rope I go past the top of it slightly and get stuck in a looping climb animation until I go back down the rope a bit, then back up. This ruins game flow horribly. Combine this with the running issue described above and it just feels horrible.","July 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Now that's all fine and well if you like such games of the side-scrolling 2D sub-genre, but it's really not my cup of tea.\n\nMore importantly, there was one major problem: I couldn't even turn in quests. Dialogue screens of NPCs just turned up empty with no complete option at all - not all of them, but it happened too often. Finding your perspectives was kind of troublesome as well and I caught myself more running and jumping around, trying to figure out where to go next, than actually making progress.","January 5","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","1"

When I actually did get into the game after going through the process of creating my character, I was barely able to move around at all and there was at least a 2 second delay between all my actions. I would press a key, wait, and watch my character move. That is incredibly bad since this is an action-platforming game which requires fluid movement. Also there is no controller support which is a shame since it would go perfectly with this style of gameplay. The worst part is I felt that there was lag at all times even though I was playing on a server with almost NO ONE on it. I'm still not sure if the game is supposed to be like this but if it is the control is terrible seeing as it took it a minute to recognize my inputs and I couldn't even climb a ladder which you need to do to get out of the first area of the game. I run, press jump button, my character jumps two steps too late. I had a hard time even getting out of the tutorial level. I didn't bother playing the game after that, not worth my time.","May 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Because the moment you do, the game will crash.

However, it has slower gameplay and more sluggish feeling attacks. While I do enjoy the Combo-like system it has and can make for great burst kills, that's pretty much all there is to it. There is more open ended character choices as some characters can have 4 different ways to be built; ultimately they will be lackluster as they aren't made solely with one thing in mind.\n\nIt's better than Wind Slayer but far from being better than MapleStory. 5.5/10","April 6, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","4","11","5","0"

Initally, the deep, cool, dramatic piano music in the background of the character creation screen left me with a good impression audio-wise. After creating my character, smart-assily named "ainsleyharriott", the game transitioned into a cutscene. There were no moving objects during the cutscene, but characters talking to one another, with speech bubbles and such, manga style. Poorly written English left me with little to understand about the initial conflict.\n\nThe beginning attack tutorial prompted me to press "z" for basic attack, for which I did. The character in the tutorial appeared to be fighting an immortal creature, exiled from both heaven and hell, apparently. Another character prompted the bow-wielding character (the character that you try to attack with "z" with) to leave the battle with the immortal creature. The game prompted me to tap the right arrow key twice in order to leave, for which I did. Twice. Nothing happened. Pressing the key did absolutely nothing, preventing me from advancing in the tutorial.\n\nGiving this 2/10 for the cool music at the beginning.

All of the abilities and attacks look appealing and feel satisfying to use.\n\nCustomization is limited, but you can still come up with something super kawaii.\n\nThe player base feels small, but you can still find people and likely make a few friends to queue up with for dungeons.\nI've never actually completed a dungeon, however, since I could not find the appropriate number of people; therefore, I can't talk about that much. What I can say, though, is that they are challenging and likely equivalent to your typical WoW dungeon.\n\nBut now flaws...\n\nFirst of all, there's this whole "you can only keep this item for x days" thing which is kinda disappointing when the item is a good weapon that you were given for completing a quest.\n\nSpeaking of which, quests are repetitive fetch quests and are the exact same in each zone. Collect special drops from x, y, and z monsters twice, rinse, repeat.\n\nThe game is also rather glitchy in that some text is buggy like once I had a staff that basically had glitchy text as it's name. There are also minor things indicating poor translation or a lack of polish like when your character shouts, "Icicle Fear" when casting Icicle Spear.\n\nWorst of all is that nothing is ever really clear. For instance, you might pick up an item saying that it does nothing when it is actually pretty important or is used in crafting. But you wouldn't know that until you just randomly discover it since there's no information online.\n\nLastly, I got some random virus which only appeared after downloading the game and disappeared after uninstalling, so players beware.\n\nThe game is fun, but if you're looking for a fun, anime RPG, maybe look elsewhere since this is honestly one in a thousand.\n\n5.5/10\n(Minus a few extra points for virus if you want)","June 22, 2015","false","15.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Otherwise, consider it.\n\n+ Nice concept\n+ Nice classes\n+ Less 'gayer' More manlier than other side-scroller games\n\n- Awful customization\n- Weird buttons\n- Lag! Delay! Lots of!\n- You can't play with your official OGPlanet account\n\n\nPROS\n\n1. Very good concept\nThe game itself has a nice concept. It's a sidescroller RPG just like MapleStory, Wonderking or WindSlayer (I think that's the name, lol), which means that although some monsters are strong you can regroup better on platforms and hit them better without having to look your back. That's fun and it's basically the concept I liked most. I'm not saying that non-platform games are better or worse, no, that's just my personal opinion.\n\n2. Nice classes\nThe game today has nice classes. About to five classes with small subdivisions between them (for example my class is an explorer but I follow the archer skill-tree pathway or I'm a knight that uses the shield, etc). It's waaaay better than Tibia some games that have about to three classes or MapleStory other games that have about to 31! This game classes amount is... enough.\n\n3. Nice visual\nThis game has a nice outfit if compared to other side scrollers. At most of them your head is quite big and disproporcional if related to your body and it looks like you're a child and the only difference between male and female characters are the hair (in some other games the female characters don't even have breasts). LaTale got a point in topic 3, characters seem more normal, less bizarre. I know that look like a useless topic but it's not, sometimes the game has to prove itself that it's worthy to play, even with those "useless" outfits.\n\n\nCONS\n\n4. Weird sprites\nYour character is awful customizable. You have about to 7 options of picking your hair, 4 options for your skin and so on. That's not bad if looked that way but sometimes in cities you face layers with extremely bizarre combination of sets. I know, it's their lives, not mine -- I know, but seeing that only makes me think that the developers are making all effort to earn money in all possible way. FFS I've seen a girl with a following shadow-skull beneath her, other time I saw a guy with a bigger than him sword. Maybe I'm too rigid with those things in games or maybe I'm right.\n\n5. Weird buttons\nThe buttons are somehow weird. You pick items up with the V button, in the bottom middle of the keyboard, making yourself get messed up sometimes and you don't pick it all! Neverthless when it's only one (ONE, I repeat) item laying in the ground a pop-up opens and it shows the SINGLE item and the options to pick it or not. Jeez, if I pushed V I want to pick it, no more asking, ok?\n\n6. Delaaay\nThis one made me sad. It was the only negative aspect of this game that didn't allow me to play normally. Although I've listed about two other negative aspects, I could play the game with them with no problem at all since the game's not that bad and it seems quite funny. Those problems were minimal. But the delay for me (I live in Brazil with a 15 Mbps connexion) was incredibly huge, very huge. Way to huge (no, really, huge). The delay was so big in a manner that I couldn't farm level 1 monsters precisely, I had about to 1500 ms ping! My character jumped right after the jump button was already released and I attacked right after I released the button too! OGPlanet probably has a plausible reason for allowing brazilian players play with so much delay but that's not the point. Delay is tolerable until a point (around 250 ms average) but, really, I can't play. There's no way to gather friends or a party to fight a boss if it takes more than one second for the controllers to respond. Sometimes it lagged too. It's sad to see a game with such potencial not being played due to delay. If OGP fixes this issue I promise I remove this ngative review but by this point I feel like I have a moral obbligation to warn anyone who reads this. Thank you for your reading.\n\n7. The needing of creating another account\nThis topic is somehow related to topic 6. I played LaTale in 2012 because I wanted to try the game and I had the same lag and delay problem. Okay, I quit and today -2014- I saw there was LaTale here on Steam and I downloaded it since it was free to play. But when I pressed play it said I couldn't because there was another account with my name and another e-mail registered as mine. WTF, that's MY account, I'm not hacking or stealing anything from anyone, I'm just accesing MY account. But I couldn't, I had to create a different nick and create a new e-mail to register the account to. Was it really necessary?","August 5, 2014","false","0.7"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

After being treated like a limp-footed mental case, to be then thrown into one of a million brightly coloured menus, characters, obscure quests and overly-attached Power Rangers, to say that I was confused and overwhelmed would be an understatement. Imagine listening to anything by Skrillex without being on some sort of party-drug.\n\nBetween the hundreds of anime look-a-likes forming a blockade between you and making sense of where you actually are, the glowing icons, incomprehensible menus and quests, the frankly bizarre dialogue and the somewhat disturbing music (clealy the result of multi-generation JRPG inbreeding), you'll find yourself wanting to commit seppuku at an alarming rate.\n\nIf you're 8 years old, a brony, or perhaps someone who enjoys self-torture, then this will probably be an epileptic treat. If you want to keep your sanity or dignity intact, then stay away.","June 21, 2014","false","0.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

Yep!\nStill terrible resolution options? Yep!\nStill that horrible input delay where it feels like your character is doing something half a second after you instruct them to? Yep!\nStill running really rubbish events that are in no way designed to reward the userbase, but are instead designed to try and claw money from you unless you're willing to pump an ungodly amount of hours into the game? Yep!\nStill an absolute chore of a grind? Yep! (even Maple Story's devs realised at one point that the grind was ridiculous and adjusted accordingly)\n\nOh wait, I'm guessing that finally you're realising that the game is all but dead, there are far better alternatives out there (ElSword, Dragonica, Maple Story), and this is a last chance to try and scrape some cash. Honestly wouldn't waste your time folks, with all the problems that have persisted through the game's entire history, the only way you could possibly enjoy this to any extent is if it's your first ever MMO Platformer/RPG, or you've got more money than sense.\n\nOnly positive thing I can say about this game is that it does have some damn nice spritework.

Almost nobody played this game when i started, and for some reason i think i could only connect to one server. I start the game seeing characters i have absolutely no context for, and a confusing prologue that teaches you confusing controls and alot of ''Use the arrow keys and reach for the mouse everytime you need to talk to somebody'' And i mean a lot of it. So ignore it and start the game. A red power ranger i have absolutely NO F**KING CONTEXT FOR. I walk up to him to talk to him, the game crashes. I now understand why the game is only 1 GB big. I am not saying i dont recommend this, since some people might not mind not having the promised classes, not understanding what the hell is going on or playing with a lot of other people. It also might run more stable on other PCs, but i got mine not even a week ago. So if you dont mind an empty, fake promising, confusing and unstable game, then have a blast.","April 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Good gameplay, good servers, good time.\n\nNow, we're still forced with that 5:4 ratio... even on laptops. This means no widescreen support. The graphic engine is broken and doesn't recognize most of the recent graphic card drivers whenever the user try to run the game on fullscreen with the highest resolution.\n\nThe solution officially given was "Play on a lower resolution" which means, for most, being forced to play on 800x600 or 1024x768. This game is run by, now, talentless devellopers who never accepted to evolve their product. It's a ghost of its previous glorious self.\n\nIf you're not playing with a 8 years old computer or on a 5:4 ratio screen, I highly suggest to stay clear from this (technically) piece of crap. Yeah, its style and gameplay footage might be attracting, but that's all there is to it. You have been warned and if you ever lost dozen of hours trying to find the right support and having fixes done... in the next 6 month.

Players stealing your kills is just expected. Description lies about the number of classes (there are only 26 jobs and 6 actual classes). The UI and gameplay is horrible, Other players block you from completing quests, and you have to click constantly in it. Maplestory and Elsword are similar games, but so much better than this one. The music gives you a headache in 5 minutes, the tutorial is horrible, and there is absolutley no immersion into the game. All the characters are pretty much the same, and have no background specific to them. Quests are more of a hassle than an accomplishment, completing any quest is a chore. It has horrible graphics as well. At least in maplestory you can see what your doing, in this game nope, and the textures feel like they were thrown together at random. If you want to play a 2D MMO choose any other game, ZOMG!(not on steam), Maplestory, and Elsword are all so much better than this...","June 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

You don't\n\n2. Tutorial is not separate instance with requirement to finish (can't skip), there is a quest in tutorial where you need to kill a stickman, and its shared by 9001 other tutorial player, so you get the image. Cluster**** is the right word. If you can't kill it you don't pass the tutorial : you cannot advance\n\n3. Assuming you pass those stage the first spawn are after tutorial is NOT a separate instance, therefore the questing npc is being swarmed by a bunch of people like you. Also a lot of annoying effects from "advance" player cluttering the screen if thats not enough sound effect spam also exists.\n\n** By this point if you still want to play the game i condone you as a masochist **\n\n4.  The questing system is a bad joke similar to how your dad make jokes about your mum. So basically questing is a text base questing with little to no hand holding on where to go (which is not a bad thing) but of course with the spawn area cluster**** hand holding is little more necessary since you can't even see whats going on the screen.\n\nAlso questing feels dead. like dead. I mean dead. You click, click go to here buy that, kill that, gather that. Yep.\n\n** By this point if you still want to play the game you might consider checking your head, go to doctor **\n\n5. So there is a lot of 2d mmo around yeah, well known one like maple story or stuff. Compare to them the movement in this game feels like lifting weight while running, you get what i mean ?

Therefore, you don't really have to pay much attention to the actual game to keep going, and can just do other things while mashing your number keys and going from quest giver to quest giver. I've spent over 100 hours in this game in under a week, and I don't feel burnt out about it.

It has fantastic rpg elements with loads of options and stuff that can keep you busy for days (but i aint got no time for that anyway), this game is a must play. the fact that a free to play rpg is not a pay to win just keeps my day shining.\n+great gameplay\n+impressive pixel art\n+unique classes that change gameplay styles\n+alot of unnecessary but cool options (ex: a pet automatically picking items for you, enchanting your pet to give you permanent bonuses)\nhowever the only complaints i have are these two:\n-weird design descisions (for example, when you start the game it tells you to jump over a small area, it says ABOVE that small area how to jump, but i couldn't see that sign when i was still behind the rock.)\n-the game doesn't help you understand alot of things (for example, there is a stat called "luck" at the start of the game that changes based on your class, the game doesn't say the effects of that stat (the effect i didn't know was that luck increases money earned from monsters), another example is that i didn't know the difference between stamina (which i assumed was the SP bar), and magic (which i also assumed was the SP bar???). this is also a weird design descision.\neitherway good or bad i highly recommend this game, as a free to play you should have nothing stopping you from trying this mmorpg out. this is my favorite 2D mmo and i am very impressed by its mechanics. though some things are stopping this game from being the best.\n8.5/10","June 22, 2014","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also if you like grinding (killing monsters for items and exp, not the other way...), there is a lot of it.

Now dat aint right man!\nEverybodys saying "Maplestory this Maplestory that", lemme tell yall something: Loot button that loots with one push of a button. COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT!? Maplestory uses this nectar of godness honey! Why aint this fool using dat!\n\nSecond, DAT LAG. No i dont mean like that lag that happens when your connection is slow or that my pc's not good enough, No i mean the lag or should i say delayed character movement. Yes, when i push right. Okay, you with me here? Good, so yea when i push right. It goes right, right? You still with me man? Nice. But you know what aint right? The Delay on that move! when my skinny long ♥♥♥ finger push da button it takes almost half a second for the fool to move. Yea i know what yall thinking "You're keyboards bad, buy a new one" or "Your pc so slow it halted the earth from spinning" but dis da only game it happens at.\n\nThird, Why does the character stop for a second after i jump? Especially when running(which works wonky too).\n\nThe games looks like it has been on for a little over half a year and is still undergoing major fixes(it needs them!) and still in a alpha/beta stage.\n\nBut i gotta say that the graphics are good, the sounds are allright. The music though, it sounds pretty bland.\nThe fighting is nice but the delaying destroys it.\n\nFrom this experience i would give an 6/10. And thats because in my opinion this is still kind of wonky and stiff, it doesent feel free and enjoyable.\n\nI'd still recommend this to anyone :D It's fun and first game for a while now to make me play.","June 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And thanks to the gamepad surport, I enjoy it even more. Sure it the normal hunt-things MMORPG that most Free-to-Play RPG are but the combat and skills are simple enjoyment and the class and weapons are very nice. Downside to this is the lags I get most of the time due to how many monsters and players are on ths screen and the lack of more better quest just make the game more repetitive. Also the costume cost a lot. Need to dish out ton of cash to look cute, cool or whatever and same goes the pets.\n\nA nice, simple 2D MMORPG. So simple, I only played it to kill some hours.

I played this game since it was originaly published by aeria games. La Tale is a side scrollong MMORPG where you see a tiny bit of backstory of a mysterious woman named Iris. After the optional cutscene you're taken to skippable tutorial with and a refference to the power rangers (The main villians are complete idiots BTW). The classes are the warrior(two handed sword and spears), the knight(one handed swords and clubs), the explorer(cross/bows and daggers), the wizard(staves), engineer(Breif case with large arttilery), and the SOUL BREAKER (monster souls). most classes uses knuckles(warrior,knight, explorer, and wizard)  and two classes uses daggers (explorers adn wizards). however the knight has a class theat specializes in knuckles. B4 the STORM update the requirement to go the next class is level 80 and now its level 50 in the desert. Most classes has 2 classes to play. Like the warrior you can pick the warlord but you'll still use swords and spears but if you choose the blader you can use twin blades. what I like about the game is the variety of classes there including the subclasses. The first 2 towns will be highly populated. my main issuses about La Tale is the deletion limit. once you hit 30 times you can't delete you character anymore. not unlees you're told to submit a ticket in order to rset it. I felt like a dumbass when I was told about it on facebook by the GM's themselves. This game isn't my favorite 2D sidescroller (its wonderking (youtube it). some maplestory may call it a "clone" but why the hell would I care.

Still, it seems like it would be easier to download the game from OG instead of on Steam until they find a way to merge it together better.\n\nSo anyways, changing this review to a do recommend.\n\n\n\nI like this game. It's a MMORPG that reminds me of Maple Story. The characters are cute, the story is interesting, and you get to destroy all sorts of adorable enemies.There are loads of events, and the community is big enough that it's not too difficult to find someone to play with. If you'd rather play alone, playing by youself isn't impossible either.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend this game on Steam. I joined this game not knowing that everything I do here is not compatible with their website.\n\nFOr example, the OG team sent me an email with some free gifts. Free gifts that I cannot have. Why? My account name is only for Steam, and doesn't link up to their website. I can create a new OG account, but that cannot be linked to my exisiting character, who is already has 10+ hours of work put into her.\n\nMy only option would be to start over. I am not going to do that. It's a waste of time. So, all the email promotions I get will be useless. Oh, and I can't stop them either, because the account is linked to Steam, and not to OGs website. I can't login to OG at all.\n\nI recommend downloading this game from OG. It's free. Don't make the same mistake I did.","August 6, 2014","true","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonkingdomify/recommended/264360/","moonkingdomify","Moonkingdomify","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonkingdomify/","130 products in account","Now I've played a few MMOs in my life and this isn't the worst. But it isn't the best. it's just sort of decent. I see the inspiration it took from Maplestory but even then that MMO only really appeals to a very niche audience, as does this game. Well let's get into the aspects of this game.\n\nThe plot, and don't tell me "Oh, it's an MMO plot doesn't matter" because it does, Tera has a good plot and that's an MMO.  The plot is pretty basic, go here, help this npc to stop some big evil force and she's with you as a sort of Navi character. It's decent story but they actually give you the choice to skip the plot, which is a bad idea. I understand it's independently developed but I would rather a slightly mediocre voice over, over just text. And they put some of these text dumps right in the middle of enemy territory, which gets to be annoying.\n\nNow with the gameplay. It's repetitive. So it Tera's, but they at least constantly throw new abilities at you and get you to learn them. And each class plays drastically different from the next. You can pretty much put these classes into three categories. Melee Martial, Ranged Martial, and Magical. And each class within those categories plays the exact same. They advertise over 40 unique classes but they fail to produce much diversity in their gameplay. Not to mention that they just hand you weapons that are decently powerful, it isn't until the first boss that you get a more powerful weapon. The game pretty much holds your hand throughout the experience. I also had a lot of lag and even had the game crash on me during a transition. The only good thing I can say about the gameplay is the respawn function this game has, where you can either decide to respawn in town or in the field.\n\nThe soundtrack is average. It's soothing, I guess that's a good thing.\n\nAnd now, onto the aesthetics. This game has the same chibi anime appeal that Maplestory has. While at the same time you have to play the game windowed in a decently small window, this makes the game itself harder on the eyes, at least for me, and once you get to Elias there are just too many people around and it was really a strain on my eyes to look at the surroundings. The enemies aren't threatening either, even Hyperdemension Neptunia had that problem but at the same time they did have some threatening boss enemies. Even the first boss in this game looks adorable.\n\nAge Rating: E for Cartoon Violence\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10\n\nSo in the end I wouldn't suggest it for most of the gaming community, so it will not get a recommendation from me. Instead I'm going to recommend it to you if you enjoyed Maplestory or Gaia Online. I couldn't suggest this game to most of my friends so I won't recommend it here.","November 17, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this game since it was originaly published by aeria games. La Tale is a side scrollong MMORPG where you see a tiny bit of backstory of a mysterious woman named Iris. After the optional cutscene you're taken to skippable tutorial with and a refference to the power rangers (The main villians are complete idiots BTW). The classes are the warrior(two handed sword and spears), the knight(one handed swords and clubs), the explorer(cross/bows and daggers), the wizard(staves), engineer(Breif case with large arttilery), and the SOUL BREAKER (monster souls). most classes uses knuckles(warrior,knight, explorer, and wizard)  and two classes uses daggers (explorers adn wizards). however the knight has a class theat specializes in knuckles. B4 the STORM update the requirement to go the next class is level 80 and now its level 50 in the desert. Most classes has 2 classes to play. Like the warrior you can pick the warlord but you'll still use swords and spears but if you choose the blader you can use twin blades. what I like about the game is the variety of classes there including the subclasses. The first 2 towns will be highly populated. my main issuses about La Tale is the deletion limit. once you hit 30 times you can't delete you character anymore. not unlees you're told to submit a ticket in order to rset it. I felt like a dumbass when I was told about it on facebook by the GM's themselves. This game isn't my favorite 2D sidescroller (its wonderking (youtube it). some maplestory may call it a "clone" but why the hell would I care. There is two communities who argue about the simmilarities i still don't care about it","July 15, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its 6 on every basic class. 5 Classes are now implemtented makes 30 classes.

You start out by picking one of the classic RPG classes, which then can be advanced into an even better class at level 80. The quests are simple; kill 'x' amount of monsters or get this item from so-and-so or go to this NPC. It isn't that difficult to level up in, and the storyline is easy to understand despite the grammar lost in translation. Despite the massive amount of grinding done, it isn't that painful and the game makes it relaxing. The quirky yet colorful graphics are anime/manga-like, and the colors for equipment and such aren't gender restricted. I highly reccomend that everyone reading this review should try the game for at least five to ten minutes; even if it's not your cup of tea.","June 29, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No one is able to play this game properly due to it. Control lag makes it very difficult to fight and navigate so during battle you just spam keys hoping that an attack will go through, and when jumping or climbing ladders and such, you have little control. Climb a rope or ladder, get to the top and you're floating above it and can't move, you have to go down and back up a few times and hope that it'll let you off. Aside from broken mechanics, this game has WAY too much detail. All you have to do is walk into the first city and you are assualted with such a cluster♥♥♥♥ of bright colors and other players cramming your screen, that it's hard to see anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adam1150/recommended/264360/","Adam1150","@dam L£vine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adam1150/","107 products in account","La Tale is an MMO in the same vein as Maplestory - it's sidescrolling and platforming based, with cute pixel art graphics and moderate grinding. The difference here being that La Tale exemplifies the free to play experience.\n\nI've put hundreds of hours into this game before it was put on Steam, and I've loved every minute of it. There's a lot of "no" recommendations for this game from people who were expecting to be able to link our original OGP accounts to the Steam distribution, and while I wonder exactly why they didn't go for that route (seeing as how Maplestory lets you use your nexon account), I don't think the people giving out these "no"s exactly know who they're supposed to be recommending the game to.\n\nIf you're new to the world of 2D sidescrolling MMOs, La Tale is a great place to start. I'm not sure whose idea it was to put into the description of the game "choose from over 40 classes", because that's not really true. Unlike in Maplestory where the "infinite shelf" has long since started to sink in, La Tale gives players six classes to choose from that, while growing stronger, rarely change their gameplay very much. From the six available classes, four have growth trees that go in two directions, most notably the Explorer's ability to either stay an explorer or switch around to guns; everyone else stays remotely the same. The only super different gameplay experience happens when you hit level 140, and you're able to choose a sub job which mixes up the gameplay of your class to the point of being almost unrecognizable. With that being said, once you've picked from the starting six, you've basically chosen from the only classes you'll need to choose between.\n\nThe screenshots are hilariously misleading, too, as they are all from high level areas that, if you're super dedicated and willing to spend real money on exp gain items, will take you probably a month to reach. 61000 damage is really atypical for most classes, as well, and if you ever want to put out that kind of damage, you're going to have to go down a pretty grueling road to get there, as playing Warrior ain't easy.\n\nOn the bright side, unlike most free to play games, you never feel pressured to spend any actual money on it. Almost everything that can be obtained from La Tale's cash shop is tradable in game and will often end up on the auction house or in player owned shops. Granted, they'll cost quite the sum of in game cash, but the game basically throws money into your lap if you're willing to do quests and sell the junk items you get.\n\nNaturally, this isn't Runescape, so the quests are pretty basic fetch/kill quests. Fetch quests start out deceptively easy, with the quest items dropping almost 100% of the time, but later on, the quest items drop maybe 40% of the time at best, so they end up being the most tedious things in the world. Luckily, most of the time, you can take a kill quest along with a fetch quest to at least feel like you're doing something while wondering why something with two eyes only drops one at a time.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about La Tale is to play with friends. If you don't have friends, make some in game. Playing by yourself is next to impossible for almost every class aside from the Knight, whose high defense/low damage output basically guarantees you won't die constantly, but leveling up will be slow and arduous. Make friends, form a party, grind together, quest together. Have a skype call or something, it's good fun and makes the grindy downtime pass so much faster.\n\nOh also the game's music is absolutely incredible.","June 27, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Might as well be a rhythm game, tap Z every time your character refreshes it's ability to attack) There is no in depth mechanic and there is no set goal, and the intro is just lazy. It seems like your typical "Save the world and have a female character at the end congratulate you" game, which is lazy. Also, the options menu is almost non-existant, which gives me a hunch that this originated years ago in a web browser. (If it's ported to steam, there should be qualities that would add a compulsion to play it again, but instead it now sits in my games library as a reminder of agonizing repitition) I cannot recommend this because of it's repititive nature, non-existant story/goal, and it's towel boy feeling.\nFinal rating is 3/10, I would rather do math than play this (In my scale 5/10 is average)","July 2, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has fantastic rpg elements with loads of options and stuff that can keep you busy for days (but i aint got no time for that anyway), this game is a must play. the fact that a free to play rpg is not a pay to win just keeps my day shining.\n+great gameplay\n+impressive pixel art\n+unique classes that change gameplay styles\n+alot of unnecessary but cool options (ex: a pet automatically picking items for you, enchanting your pet to give you permanent bonuses)\nhowever the only complaints i have are these two:\n-weird design descisions (for example, when you start the game it tells you to jump over a small area, it says ABOVE that small area how to jump, but i couldn't see that sign when i was still behind the rock.)\n-the game doesn't help you understand alot of things (for example, there is a stat called "luck" at the start of the game that changes based on your class, the game doesn't say the effects of that stat (the effect i didn't know was that luck increases money earned from monsters), another example is that i didn't know the difference between stamina (which i assumed was the SP bar), and magic (which i also assumed was the SP bar???). this is also a weird design descision.\neitherway good or bad i highly recommend this game, as a free to play you should have nothing stopping you from trying this mmorpg out. this is my favorite 2D mmo and i am very impressed by its mechanics. though some things are stopping this game from being the best.\n8.5/10","June 22, 2014","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The people there are actually willing to help you if you ask for it (might give you some free armor you dont have to buy). This looks like a small anime. Attacks look so cool, story line is like so cute!, weapons start getting cool looking around 30lvl but its easy to lvl up, oh you can sell and resell useless items from monsters you fought get lots of money, you can trade with people, pvp (player vs player) its cool! And simple but if you get high lvls the pvp looks even cooler, lots of quest to doo, omg there like 70+ skills you have to master, the bosses look cool/cute, mostly what i can think of i played it all day yesterday  and today!","July 10, 2014","true","93.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after i started playing and getting used to the sometimes weird mechanics, my passion and motivation to play this game went down the drain.\n\nFirst of all, Looting. Why da heaall do you need to press anything else than the daymn loot button, it's an annoying little thing that if theres 2 or more drops i need to SHIFT + SPACEBAR to loot 'em! Now dat aint right man!\nEverybodys saying "Maplestory this Maplestory that", lemme tell yall something: Loot button that loots with one push of a button. COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT!? Maplestory uses this nectar of godness honey! Why aint this fool using dat!\n\nSecond, DAT LAG. No i dont mean like that lag that happens when your connection is slow or that my pc's not good enough, No i mean the lag or should i say delayed character movement. Yes, when i push right. Okay, you with me here? Good, so yea when i push right. It goes right, right? You still with me man? Nice. But you know what aint right? The Delay on that move! when my skinny long ♥♥♥ finger push da button it takes almost half a second for the fool to move. Yea i know what yall thinking "You're keyboards bad, buy a new one" or "Your pc so slow it halted the earth from spinning" but dis da only game it happens at.\n\nThird, Why does the character stop for a second after i jump? Especially when running(which works wonky too).\n\nThe games looks like it has been on for a little over half a year and is still undergoing major fixes(it needs them!) and still in a alpha/beta stage.\n\nBut i gotta say that the graphics are good, the sounds are allright. The music though, it sounds pretty bland.\nThe fighting is nice but the delaying destroys it.\n\nFrom this experience i would give an 6/10. And thats because in my opinion this is still kind of wonky and stiff, it doesent feel free and enjoyable.\n\nI'd still recommend this to anyone :D It's fun and first game for a while now to make me play.","June 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I met really nice people, and it was a big stress reliever for me. I had little to no problems with this game. When I first tried starting up the game, it didn't work. What I did was quit the game, log out of steam, log back in and then relaunched the game. Gameplay was a little slow at first, I had a bit of trouble learning the controls until I realized that it tells you the controls in the top bar. (I felt so stupid...) Also if you like grinding (killing monsters for items and exp, not the other way...), there is a lot of it. A lot of the quests I did was to kill monsters, collect a certain amount of whatever they drop, and go back to collect your reward.

I loved the structure of the game, but the implementation of the way it all worked had always felt wrong or slightly off. Getting back into the game, things feel smoother and as they should be. Maps flow excellently now, quests are considerably easier to understand, leveling up is not a total chore right from the get-go, making money isn't an exhausting issue, many things seem to be in nice places with more proper labels. Compared to what the game is now, LaTale felt much, much more unorganized when I last played. The classes are still flashy and fun to play, and I see some skill animation changes have come around too which is really nice. (Warrior's heavy attack is not some clunky slow swing now)\n\nAll in all, LaTale is getting to a point where it honestly should have been at a long time. But hey, better late than never. Give this game a shot if you enjoy(ed) Maplestory.\n\nEdit: Okay, I do see what other people mean about the translations being poor. They definitely need to be revised for proper English. It looks like some Asian kids with a terrible understanding of English wrote more than half of the scripts for the NPC's. One character even says something in a different language but spelled with English letters. That's just...massively stupid... I believe that's called Singlish? idk, needs to be fixed.","February 14","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start the review with simple pros and cons.\n\n+Pros of this game:\n+Classes = Many good classes with various skills and abilities\n+World = World in LaTale is really nice with ton of variety from forest through ancient temples to train with rats ? K. LaTale also have a lot of dungeons and event locations.\n+Items = LaTale have some coolest looking weapons and armors i've ever seen in online games.\n+Music = Love it\nBig+ Comunity = Comunity is really amazing in this game when you need help someone will help you (sometimes for free sometimes not)\n+Real money shop (Fashion store) = In this shop you can find some special fashion stuff (Mostly permanent) and some evet boxes nothing overpowered that would make this game pay2win.\n\nCons:\n-Translations = Some text in the game is still not translated to English\n-Resolutions = only 3 options\n-Grind = You need money or XP or equipment ? Prepare for a looooooong grind. Or buy a lot of ring chargers from Fashion shop.\n- Customization = Some more customization while creating the character would be nice.\n\nIn the end i think LaTale is a great game and i had a lot of fun with it. I played on OGP (not the stem verson obviously) and i still have a Der Freischutz lv 187 with some decent equipment.","July 4, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonkingdomify/recommended/264360/","moonkingdomify","Moonkingdomify","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonkingdomify/","130 products in account","Now I've played a few MMOs in my life and this isn't the worst. But it isn't the best. it's just sort of decent. I see the inspiration it took from Maplestory but even then that MMO only really appeals to a very niche audience, as does this game. Well let's get into the aspects of this game.\n\nThe plot, and don't tell me "Oh, it's an MMO plot doesn't matter" because it does, Tera has a good plot and that's an MMO.  The plot is pretty basic, go here, help this npc to stop some big evil force and she's with you as a sort of Navi character. It's decent story but they actually give you the choice to skip the plot, which is a bad idea. I understand it's independently developed but I would rather a slightly mediocre voice over, over just text. And they put some of these text dumps right in the middle of enemy territory, which gets to be annoying.\n\nNow with the gameplay. It's repetitive. So it Tera's, but they at least constantly throw new abilities at you and get you to learn them. And each class plays drastically different from the next. You can pretty much put these classes into three categories. Melee Martial, Ranged Martial, and Magical. And each class within those categories plays the exact same. They advertise over 40 unique classes but they fail to produce much diversity in their gameplay. Not to mention that they just hand you weapons that are decently powerful, it isn't until the first boss that you get a more powerful weapon. The game pretty much holds your hand throughout the experience. I also had a lot of lag and even had the game crash on me during a transition. The only good thing I can say about the gameplay is the respawn function this game has, where you can either decide to respawn in town or in the field.\n\nThe soundtrack is average. It's soothing, I guess that's a good thing.\n\nAnd now, onto the aesthetics. This game has the same chibi anime appeal that Maplestory has. While at the same time you have to play the game windowed in a decently small window, this makes the game itself harder on the eyes, at least for me, and once you get to Elias there are just too many people around and it was really a strain on my eyes to look at the surroundings. The enemies aren't threatening either, even Hyperdemension Neptunia had that problem but at the same time they did have some threatening boss enemies. Even the first boss in this game looks adorable.\n\nAge Rating: E for Cartoon Violence\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10\n\nSo in the end I wouldn't suggest it for most of the gaming community, so it will not get a recommendation from me. Instead I'm going to recommend it to you if you enjoyed Maplestory or Gaia Online. I couldn't suggest this game to most of my friends so I won't recommend it here.","November 17, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition the ways that your character walks, fight, etc. is quite powerless, it doesn't have the gratfying gut 'Ugh' when you hit an enemy. However the wide options deliver a most unique and varied gameplay for every different person.\n\n\nI recommend this game to those who don't mind some 'slow-paced' gaming and like having avariety of options.","June 25, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game, in the earlier days, was a nightmare of a game filled with some of the very best people on the internet. It was hard, painstakingly so, but everyone helped eachother. It was the only way you could make headway. Fast forward five years. Add several more classes, job changes, a ton of end game content and make everything easy enough to not feel dead and hard enough to be rewarding.\n\nBoy this game has changed a lot and so has the community. There's some nice people out there and it's getting better each month. Everyone  is much quieter but fast friends are easy to come by. Now that we've got that out of the way lets talk about it as a game.\n\nFirstly get prepared to do a lot of grinding. There are questlines EVERYWHERE. Seriously. There's more quests than you know what to do with but after years of playing most people just grind to end game levels 194+. That being said I highly recommened questing with some friends. There are a ton of new players out and about and the quests are both fun and the areas varry greatly from one another.\n\nCash Shop: Something on everyones mind now days with more and more F2P titles rolling out. OGP's cash shop is well... La Tale isn't pay to win. Virtually everything from the cash shop can be traded or bought from other players with ingame cash. The only thing you'll have to pay for are specific fashion sets but hey. You can get a ton of fashion sets ingame too.\n(which look better)\n\nEvents: Lately there have been events everywhere. Tripple exp. Tripple drop rate. Log in events. Level events. You name it there's always something going on. It really makes everything feel alive and fun.\n\nClasses: There are a ton of them. You start out with six and then every class has 2 more jobs to go for a total of 3 job changes. To make it even more awesome you can switch back and forth to what's known as a subclass for 5 of them. Subclasses play much differently than the main class but are incredibly strong. Nothing like switching back and forth on the fly to make your life easier.\n\nEconomy: Alright lets be real. What MMO these days doesn't have a seriously messed up economy? La tales is on the mend and right now it's very easy for new players to show up, get some exp boosters and enjoy the game. The devs are putting effort into fixing the economy and everything's going well so far.\n\nEnd game content: Right now there are several end game dungeons. Each one can have up to 8 players fighting epic bosses or being killed constantly. They drop rare armor, excellent acessories or just gems to boost your character even higher. We're getting even more of these end game dungeons in the coming months so strap in and get ready to die.\n\nCrafting: Crafting is interesting in the game. If it's your first character crafting can be very important. Making potions to heal you faster or crafting food to provide simple but helpful buffs. Unfortunately in the higher levels it begins to fall off. Don't get me wrong there are some incredible things to craft like the master set which takes 10 hours to craft between each piece and takes even longer to harvest the materials for it, but it's just not there. There have been several system changes in the past few months and more are coming so hopeflly they'll add even more things to craft. (I love crafting)\n\nPvp: Pvp right now is somewhat broken due to recent release of 4th jobs and balance changes but boy can the pvp be fun. 8v8 anyone?\n\nIn short there's a lot to do here. You could be like me and spend several tens of thousands of hours playing this gigantic game. There's always something else to do. Something to by or someone to bargen with for just the bit cheaper item you need. Out of every mmo I've played over the years this draws me back every time. This isn't for everyone but if you're interested make a character, play until 40 and see if it fits. It's a little hard to get into but it's well worth it.\n\nI hope to see you on the flip side.\n\n- TormentedSpirit - 195 Wind Stalker","July 4, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one is no exception. As soon as I was able to play, I noticed immediately the sluggish movement of my character. If there was an option to get a good connection to the server, I would've found it more fun to play.\n\nIn terms of the actual gameplay, the concept shares elements from Maple Story, which I spent a fair few hours playing and cannot fault the concept. I just wish that games such as this were offering solutions to Oceanic gamers more.","July 6, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core of the problem is awful controls, and no obvious way to go and change the controls. The Keyboard works... after you get used to the really bizarre setup, but the USB controller is down right perplexing. Start button is jump? Why? And why is this system using a 1 through 10 power setup? This game is a side scroller, implying fast action with little thought about your three dimensional placement. Turn those into button combo moves, tighten up the control scheme, and you'll have a good game. Right now, because of these major faults, all it manages to do is look neat until you try playing it...","May 25, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I don't think so. Putting aside every changes in both games, I could spend whole weeks playing Maple Story and it wouldn't made me bored at all. I can't sadly say same about La Tale. It feels like everything I do, uncluding just moving around, feels sometimes like playing while having heavy lags. Combat also feels slower. Maybe because of that I couldn't enjoy La Tale for longer time. But hey, it's free to play game, so install it and try it yourself - that's the best you can do.","June 5","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
