They looked around the room at each other and said, "Let's just make a King's Quest game but call it something else." They all nodded in agreement and set out to make a nostalgic video game that older gamers would appreciate.\n\nOne Hour Gameplay Video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqTE_aLj78I\n\nFull Review\nOverview\nOrder of the Thorne: The King’s Challenge is the first episode in a series. It follows a Bard named Finn who wants to create the ultimate adventurer ballad. He sees the opportunity to create this song by taking part in The King’s Challenge to find the missing Queen of the realm.\n\nDialogue\nThe dialogue in Order of the Thorne is very much in the classic style of games like King’s Quest. Everyone is polite, honorable, and happy go lucky in the way that only fantasy characters can be. Needless to say, the game takes its world very seriously during dialogue but is not without its comedy as well. It does get a bit long-winded in places but it remains nostalgic of the genre.\n\nThat being said it doesn’t have a deep conversation system and most characters are fairly one dimensional. There will be a few places where you’ll just want to skip through the dialogue to get back to the adventure.\n\nThe voiceover in-game is for lack of better words is “standard” for the genre. No one particularly stands out as believable denizens of this fantasy world. It definitely gets the job done with the eclectic cast of characters. There are far too many pleasant townies, but it does help showcase the more interesting characters like Esmerelda the Spider-Lady and Skelton the Dwarf.\n\nStory\nI make more comparisons to King’s Quest as this game immediately begins with a contest to find the King’s wife. It’s as straight-forward as it sounds and it propels the player to stumble through Crann Naoimh and get into all sorts of shenanigans. Mainly, it’s everything you’d expect from a King’s Quest title and that seems to be the point.\n\nGameplay\nYour standard point and click gameplay for an adventure title. Nothing really stands out as an advancement, beyond the Simon says style guitar playing. Finn will discover a person or object that requires an item he has discovered while wandering the land. He can combine items and use them to solve problems or complete quests only to collect more items and repeat. Fortunately, this game has a clear goal when it comes to puzzles and doesn’t allow us to wander around confused about all these items in our pants.\n\nMusic\nNothing really stands out in the music department other than the fact that it can get a bit loud despite being on the lowest setting.\n\nGraphics\nI feel like I’m making a lot of mentions of King’s Quest, but that’s exactly the nostalgic look that this title is trying to hit. Sierra would be proud to see that their visual style have been properly replicated. While it’s not exactly the most detailed of titles, it does paint a unique world filled with  slick character portraits, beautiful backgrounds, and old-school pixel animation..\n\nConclusion\nCombining all the things I’ve played in this game, It’s very obvious that this title is targeting the earliest fans of the genre.. It really makes no advances to the adventure formula, and generally doesn’t take much from modern adventure titles. This is a great game for those people that saw the newest King’s Quest and harrumph’d at the lack of 2D pixels. Order of the Thorne: The King’s Challenge is definitely worth a look for adventure seekers. I’d personally catch it on sale myself, but if you’re looking for a true old-school adventure title… dive right in.","January 26","true","3.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

Being raised on old King's Quest games, this is right up my alley. It's a fairy tale where you don't solve problems by fighting people, but by being kind and asking questions. And you get a lute and have to learn songs to play which reminds me of another favourite game Loom! The only drawback is that the game is very short. On my initial playthrough I only missed one achievement.\n\nOn the other hand I look forward to the sequel...","January 26","true","3.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

As per my reviews of games I have backed, I was in on the Kickstarter for the game so if that is too biased for you, you might be happier elsewhere!\n\nThe King's Challenge is a good old fashioned adventure game where you wander over a nice large map, meeting folks, collecting a rather odd assortment of goods, and then helping others help you in your goal. You play as Finn the Bard, the son of a well known bard. You aspire to be like your father and you enter the King's Challenge to help inspire you to create a great ballad. Unlike many games, you don't have a sword, dagger or even bad breath to take on your challengers; you have a lute. You learn to play songs on the lute that help you progress through the game. A nice nod to Loom but many of the Sierra adventures get nice little nods as well. Finn is a fun character, young, ambitious and willing to learn, he survives by his wits, not his brawn.\n\nLike their title, Quest for Infamy, The King's Challenge offers a variety of places to visit, multiple characters to interact with, lovely backgrounds and sprite work, and fine music and dialogue. Unlike QFI, the King's Challenge is a G rated game and is a game that the younger set can enjoy too.\n\nI would describe the puzzles as "medium" in difficulty; there are plenty of clues and the more you chat with others in the game, the easier the puzzles become. The objectives are clear and quite logical and help often comes from where you would expect it to come.\n\nThe game also sets up the universe for future titles. You meet several characters who knew your father and thus you learn about the Order of the Thorne and yourself as the game goes on. The game comes to a nice conclusion but clearly sets the stage for further chapters. I, for one, am looking forward to the further adventures.","January 26","true","0.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Unlike Quest for Infamy (Infamous Quests' previous game), this game takes the traditional fairytale path that reminds you of games like King's Quest (the original) and yes as mentioned above, one really cool feature is the lute. You can play it manually or automatically, but manually is definitely the go-to choice for all the s**** and giggles.\n\nAs I progress through the game (or when I finish the game), I'll try to update this review accordingly.\n\nIn the meanwhile, if you're still thinking whether to buy this game or not, check out my Let's Play of it down below. :P\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEf1c1SWgs","January 26","true","6.9"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/425600/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","This is the first installment of the in-development Order of the Thorne anthology series by Quest for Infamy developer Infamous Quests. The game takes place in the Faerie Realm where the King has proposed a challenge: If anyone can find his Queen, who has hidden somewhere in their kingdom, he will grant them one wish. And so Finn the Bard takes up the challenge out of a selfless wish to help every musician far and wide.\n\nThe King's Challenge is a traditional adventure game which reminded me quite a bit of the early King's Quest games and Loom. Take my comparison to King's Quest with a pinch of salt though, as I only played a bit of the original first game at a friend's house many years ago, and the AGD Interactive remakes of the first two games are to this day the only games of the franchise I have ever completed. The reason why I also compare this game to Loom is that you get to play songs on a lute, which will sometimes have effects that are required to solve puzzles, like putting people in a certain mood.\n\nChoosing a song on the lute will display a sequence of notes that you will then have to repeat in the correct order for the song to be played. If that sounds tedious or difficult though, you can switch between hard and and easy mode at any point in the game. The easy mode will just play the song at the press of a button, freeing up your hands to do something else in the meantime.\n\nMost puzzles in the game are of the conventional variety though, and even though none of them are particularly hard to figure out, I found them enjoyable and they all fit well in with the theme and setting of the game. This game uses a two-button control scheme, with left-click for interaction and right-click to examine things. There are no dialogue puzzles, but you have to talk to a rich cast of characters to acquire information that you need to get through the game.\n\nOne thing I greatly appreciated about this game is that there are a lot of scenes stretching out from the huge tree housing the Royal Court, which gave me a sense of exploring a vast kingdom. But even though there is a big area to cover in search of the Queen, the scenes are connected in such a way that it never takes you long to get back to the massive tree in the middle. I also never found myself "pixel hunting" in any of the scenes, since objects of interest either stand out in their placement or are signposted through dialogue or cutscenes.\n\nThe story is well written and concise, with several nods to fairy tales and classic adventure games. There wasn't anything in the writing that really stood out to me, but I appreciate a game that delivers its story efficiently and with respect for the player's time, and this game certainly does that. There are few things I find more annoying in a game than clicking on a hot-spot for the second or third time and be forced through the same long-winded speech again, so I value it all the more when a game gives you just enough information on repeat delivery of dialogue to nudge you along in the plot and puzzle solving.\n\nLike Infamous Quest's previous game, this one also uses the now open-source AGS engine[github.com]. This means that the Linux version also has many of the limitations and issues of other games using the engine, and I've been unable to Alt+Tab out of the game or switch virtual desktops. Features like the Steam overlay and screen capture do not work, and achievements only occasionally unlock at the moment. You can launch a graphical settings panel that I don't think I've seen in any previous AGS games on Linux, which saves you the trouble of having to manually edit the acsetup.cfg file if you want to put the game in windowed mode or change graphics filters.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed The King's Challenge, and I wished I could have continued playing when it was over after three hours of play. The ending and post-credits scene allude to things to come in the next installment, Fortress of Fire, which I can now almost not wait to experience.\n\nNOTE: This review was originally posted on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com].","January 29","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The Puzzles made sense and ranged in difficulty, none of them being punishingly hard. There also are not any dead end puzzles or deaths. So, if you enjoy a good adventure game that will take you back in time a couple decades to the "Golden Years" of the genre give The Order of the Thorne - The Kings Challenge a try. There is also a demo you can take for a test spin before purchasing the game.

My limited review here wouldn't do it justice, but it really was very well done.\n\nThe play style functions intuitively for the novice and will be very familiar to fans of the genre. (Save save save!).\n\nThe story was fun.  It was certainly characteristic of the genre, perhaps even a little canned, but I  truly didn't mind.  I would have preferred it it to be a bit longer though.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is clear that the design team thoroughly tested the game, which I found to be completely free of any bug that would crash the game.  The team took the testing a step further and made sure that there were no logical dead-ends either.  I'm sure there's an official name for it, but basically where you advance to a point in the plot without obtaining something, and then can't proceed without reverting back to an earlier save/start. (KQ5 and the cat chasing the mouse still makes me grind my teeth.)\n\nI am thrilled that the point-and-click adventure game market seems to be picking back up after what seems like an eternity.  I really thought I'd seen the last of this sort of game until just a few years ago.  If you're a fan, there's a whole community of sites out there devoted to this type of game. Just like any other genre it is not without its fluff or repetition.\n\nThis game isn't fluff, and I enjoyed it beginning to end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/probdenis/recommended/425600/","probdenis","Denis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/probdenis/","108 products in account","The Order of the Thorne: The King's challenge is a fun traditional adventure game. With it's beautiful art, a freely explorable world and a charming fairy tale setting, it evokes the spirit of the King's Quest games. The game is a lot more playable than those classics though. There are no deaths or dead-ends, and the puzzles are all fair and logical. The music puzzles are a nice touch and not too difficult.\nI love exploration in adventure games, and this game really delivers in this regard, with many interesting places to visit and characters to talk to. Almost the whole map is accessible from the beginning, giving you a very non-linear feeling. It quickly gets more linear as the player gets a clearer picture of what he must do and in which order the puzzles have to be solved. Still it never feels forced.\nThe story is also very reminiscent of King's Quest, and that is probably the only real weakness, because it is as simple and straightforward as it possibly gets. The intro explains the quest, then you go out, explore, chat and solve puzzles in order to fulfil your quest. Dialogues and and a few books give you an insight into the backstory, but as far as the main quest goes, there's not much else. The story does get a lot more interesting later, but this is also when the game ends. Though with this exposition, I have high hopes for the sequels.\n\nIn short, this is a beautiful and calm introduction to the series that leaves you wanting for more. It's well worth the price, and if the planned sequels deliver a little more in terms of story and character depth, the whole series could become a masterpiece.\n","March 13","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

No text commands, but there is the lute interface which works well and is the "unique selling point" of the game, as it were. While the puzzles are easier than I've become accustomed to for this genre, they are not trivial by any means.\nThe art and music are beautiful and the characters and environment are really well done. Considering everything is hand-drawn pixel art, the kingdom and forest are pretty extensive. The voice acting was a really nice addition and I also appreciated having the option to skip ahead if you've read faster than them.\n\nThe game has a lot of unique touches and personality to it. While the adventure is fairly short and contained only to one setting, there is plenty of detail within which still gives the player a rich experience.\nThere is humour in it too; I liked the running gag where you kept bumping into the two women trying to befriend the gnome who wasn't having any of it. Really amusing.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is how "bare bones" it still felt with regards to the amount of interaction available other than that which was needed to continue the plot. This could just be that I'm used to having text commands available though, and they did the best they could with the two click system. There are also a couple of bugs (at the time of writing this) such as some conversation trees still being available when you'd already progressed past that part of the game. This was a little jarring although nothing game-breaking.\nOn the other hand the forest and swamp are large enough that you have a lot of area to just walk around, explore and try things out. Did I mention it's really beautiful?\n\nOverall this was a very enjoyable game with lots of personality and a nice story, despite being quite short and small-world.\nIt was extremely good value for the price paid (£6.99) and I will probably get the next episodes when they come out. Would recommend to fans of the genre.","February 4","true","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not sure I would purchase Order of the Thorne again, but it is a nice little game for what it is.\n\nFirst off, what this game is NOT:\n\nPeople have been comparing this to both King's Quest and Quest for Glory.  I will agree with the first and disagree with the second.  The game is definitely similar to some of the later KQ games, but its lack of RPG elements, combat, etc, make it a marked difference from QFG.\n\nThe impression I got from the game's pitch also isn't quite on target.  The game was initially billed as follows -\n\n"Our first game is about an intrepid bard who embarks on the King's Challenge to save his Queen!  Action, adventure and a touch of fairy tale magic take you away on this quest.  The King's Challenge also features fun and interesting puzzle mechanics, including the use of Finn's Lute - and a magical, music based GUI that controls spells to aid you on your quest!"\n\nThe impression I took away from their description was an adventure game possibly similar to the old Loom title crossed with a somewhat dangerous King's Quest like environment.  However, you're not actually 'saving' the Queen - you're just taking part in a contest where the Queen is playing hide and go seek and the first to find her wins.  The lute system, while somewhat interesting, was also very underplayed.  For the most part, you had to use each song exactly once, and there weren't really any puzzles designed around clever use of the lute.  It was pretty obvious when and how you'd have to use it.\n\nNOW, all that being said.\n\nThe game is quite enjoyable, if simple.  It does hearken back to the King's Quest series with more of a simple/kiddy feel to it.  Not the sort of thing I'd normally play nowadays, and not much in the way of replay value, but it was a fun, nostalgic game to play through.\n\nOn top of that, it entranced my 3 year old son.  He loved watching as I played.  If he were a year or three older, I'd have turned him loose on this game to play himself with zero hesitation.\n\nSummary:\n\nDo not get this game if you are looking for:\n\n1) Action or RPG elements such as you'd find in QFG\n2) Challenging puzzles\n3) A sophisticated plot and/or moral ambiguity in the story\n\nDO get this game if you are looking for:\n\n1) A nostalgic trip reminiscent of the KQ series\n2) A simple, charming fairy-tale story\n3) Rather delightful music and respectable art.\n4) Something engaging to play with your children or let them play\n5) A game where you don't have to worry about dying or doing something "wrong" and getting stuck.  There's always a path forward.","January 30","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're familiar with the King's Quest series you'll even notice some direct allusions and homages.\nThe graphics imitate that classic style and the music, voice acting and dialogue are all very good (lots of Scots voice actors).  I did turn off the narrator though, I couldn't handle someone slowly reading the description whenever I clicked on anything.\nIn terms of weak points, the game is on the short side and the puzzles are pretty easy (I finished the game in 3.5 hours). Speaking of puzzles (most of which are inventory based), the designers did a good job of giving clues and letting you know when you were on the right track but hadn't quite gotten it right.\nOne more inventive aspect of the game is that, playing as Finn the bard, you have a lute and can play a number of songs (you learn more as the game progresses--this part is a lot like Loom).  Playing the right song in the right situation is often necessry to progress.  But going back and experimenting, I noticed that trying out songs in different places can spark interesting interactions I missed the first time around and even help you perform one or two additional good deeds.

The art direction is dead-on and the style of puzzles are in a similar style to what Sierra used.  Although I did manage to get stuck on one puzzle and had to take a break for a day or two to think about it, I found the game to be very straightforward.\n\nThis makes for a light-hearted (although there is a foreboding sense of peril around the edges) and breezy experience that can be enjoyed in a short amount of time (about 3-5 hours depending on playstyle).  While I guess some people would argue that this is a short game, it manages its time well and establishes a world I want to spend more time in.

Just want to put that out there so no one cries foul on me posting a review (I even bought a copy of the game, as I do for most games I record for).\n\nThat being said, I think what I like most about IQ's games is that they look one way on the surface, but you start to see the depth behind the characters/story/concepts when you have some time to think about it later on.\n\nFor example, some people complained that QFI treated women poorly, based upon some of the scantily clad female characters featured in the game. But once you actually interacted with them, it became clear that the game was mocking the archetype of the scantily clad female warrior and the games that had used it in the past. Voleris, the head of the Tyr's Arrows clad in a metal bikini, sounded entirely fed up with her lot in life. She rebuffed all of Roehm's advances, not in a "playing hard to get" manner, but in a way that suggested that she knew just how dumb it was that she was in the employ of a man that made her dress this way. She was sick of being an archetype.\n\nFlash forward to OotT and a few things pop to mind about the way I've seen people react, and since you know I liked the game already, I'll instead say a few things about some concerns I've seen raised...\n\nFirst of all, some folks have complained that the game is "too happy". Yes, the game is overall filled with characters who are content with their lot in life, but the first thing you see when you gain control of Finn are two pillars inscribed with the names of everyone who died in the last great war.\n\nIn fact, when you talk to the king, he'll tell you that the primary reason for holding the challenge is because he knows that, even in peace time, it's important to give potential champions something to strive for, to keep them vigilant. This is a peace that was obviously paid for in blood. Later in the game, you'll visit a graveyard that also reflects just how true this is (and how backing one of IQ's kickstarters is a very dangerous undertaking, heh).\n\nSo yes, the general tone of this game is one of peace and happiness, just like how the first Harry Potter had an overall light-hearted tone to it but things only got darker from there. We had to see Uir at peace to know just how much we have to lose (and the end of the game sets up some dark clouds on the horizon...).\n\nSecond, I've seen some complain that Finn (the protagonist) is "too sweet".\n\nRight in the beginning of the game, we learn two important things about Finn: his father was a heroic bard of the Order of the Thorne who died in its service, and Finn seeks to do his father proud by following in his footsteps and becoming an amazing bard himself.\n\nWe immediately know that Finn has taken some lumps from life already, but despite this, he's still a kind, compassionate artist who wants to make life better for others (and his wish reflects this most of all). However, we see a bit of cynicism poke through from time to time, like when he talks to the snobbish jerk of a priest, Abdon, and says something to the effect of "A bard's job is to make life better for people, but I'm sure that's something YOU wouldn't understand", or when Finn was sure that Skelton was going to kill him for trying to take his treasure, even while Snowy and Red (who are by far the MOST naive characters in the game) thought there was still good in Skelton. Finn certainly knew better.\n\nFinn is the person who has "lost his innocence", so to speak: he knows the world isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but he's not letting that drag him down to its level and turn him into an angry cynic (and I also have to add that Matt Curtis absolutely NAILED Finn's voice. Sometimes a voice just clicks with a character and that was definitely the case, here).\n\nSo that's my take on the game and some of the concerns: some things that may seem simple on their face are in actuality a great deal more complex underneath, and I hope Finn's story arc (which clearly isn't finished) involves him accomplishing the goals he set out to achieve in TKC (and no, I don't know where his story goes from here).","January 31","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The voice acting is ok, aside from the narrator, but suffers from the same issues as Quest for Infamy, which is poor audio quality that really clashes with the quality of the graphical art which is outstanding. At least the lip smacking is gone but some of it sounds like it was recorded on a $10 microphone while other sound clips are crystal clear. All of that would be minor if the story were excellent.\n\nI hope the next installment is better, but the ending of the first one didn't leave me terribly excited for it.","April 24","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I couldn't stop playing. Lovely story, characters, artwork, and gameplay. It's a true modern classic and it almost hurts that it is still relatively obscure among adventure game players, much like its predecessor Quest For Infamy. More than worth the money, even when not on sale. Totally fair puzzles throughout, but not in a way that eschews a challenge, as long as you think a little. Go buy it to show your support for such talented game makers, I have no doubt that any sequel, or other game in this vein they try to make, would be easily greenlit.","April 5","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very much like King's Quest. You wander around, pick up items, talk with people, gather info and clues, and figure out how to progress.\n\nSo it's fun. But if you're a deft player, you can be done in 2 or 3 hours. Is that time fun? For the most part. But given the total content, once you're done, you're going to evaluate whether the money you spent was worth it.\n\nEven $10 is too much for 2 hours of fun and limited replay value. I got it for 6, and 6 I can handle.\n\nTo the developers themselves, it's not a bad effort. But I'm hoping a future chapter will have more content. I think in total I dealt with about 10 characters and 20 items. You can do better still and really make it worth the price.","April 6","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was disappointing that your character can't even die (in funny ways).
