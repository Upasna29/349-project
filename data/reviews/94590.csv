They're good and all but they don't match the amount of atmosphere this game has and it only lasts around 4-5 hours to complete.

It's unfortunate that the game has not added more to it than the original offered other than more puzzles.  However, it's fortunate that they didn't break anything that did work from the original game and simply just offered new puzzles.  No risks taken here, if you've played the original, then you know exactly what to expect for this sequel.  Again, the only drawback for this game is the fact that it is so short.  Overall good quality game with some good puzzles to tease the brain.","January 8, 2015","true","8.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anigmha/recommended/94590/","anigmha","anigmha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anigmha/","170 products in account","What looks like a children's book is actually a dark story punctuated by challenging puzzles (and sometimes vice-versa).\n\nPuzzle Agent takes place in the morose corners of the Midwest. Sure it's a clichè setting for mystery thrillers, but how this setting is expressed in a "children's book" art form turns that clichè into an interesting contrast. Graham Annable's art profoundly brings the story to life, and what a strange story it is. I say that in a good way.\n\nThe main gameplay draw in Puzzle Agent are obviously the puzzles, which are interspersed throughout the game as the story unfolds. The formula is basically narrative-puzzle-narrative-puzzle-narrative reminiscent of the Professor Layton games for the Nintendo DS. No, Puzzle Agent is not a Professor Layton rip off. Both titles are really just video game versions of puzzle story books that anyone born before 1990 grew up with. Also, although this is a Telltale game, this is not really a point-and-click adventure since there are no branching paths. Just keep on clicking the next obvious thing to progress the story.\n\nThere are a good variety of puzzles ranging from logic to spatial reasoning. I would say just over half of the puzzles offer a solid challenge for the average Joe. The puzzles that are easy are indeed the weakest aspect of this game, but they're so easy that it can literally take 10 seconds to finish them, getting you straight back into the intriguing narrative or better puzzles. It only gets frustrating when an easy puzzle is a slight variation of a previous one. The game could seriously use less of those rotating tiles, piece fitting and pathfinding puzzles which often can be solved by simple brute force. The piece fitting puzzles in particular are somewhat broken because the pieces automatically latch onto the correct position when in close proximity thereby essentially solving itself for you.\n\nI do like how a few puzzles meld with the narrative. At certain plot points, the game interrupts you midway through solving a puzzle with an animation happening on the puzzle pieces directly, momentarily bringing you back into the story. In one part, someone off-screen steals a puzzle piece while you solve that puzzle. You can't experience narrative like this in puzzle story books. Here Telltale have shown us an example of what they do best: how they can transform traditional forms of media into a better experience through new technologies. I just wish there were more moments like these.\n\nThe one other issue I had with a few of the puzzles is that sometimes the rules are vague. For example, one puzzle asked you to determine the winner of a tournament with nothing more than statements made by the contestants. However, the format of the tournament was never mentioned (spoiler alert: it's single-elimination). Another involves fish and food chains, but it was never clear what eats what and whether there can be a fish within a fish within a fish... ya know, fishception. There are 72 puzzles (37 in Puzzle Agent 1 and 35 in 2) and I counted no more than 5 that suffered from ambiguity or outright misses necessary information to be solvable. It's a small percentage so I don't think it's that big of a deal. It just sucks when a brilliant puzzle was spoiled because the rules weren't crystal clear.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Puzzle Agent's story, art and most of the puzzles. Also, you should know that this review covers Puzzle Agent 1 and 2 since they are each half a game and half a story. Telltale really should've called them Episode 1 and 2.","December 28, 2013","true","5.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mblimbaum/recommended/94590/","mblimbaum","emblim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mblimbaum/","293 products in account","Puzzle Agent 2 is a game marred by plot inconsistencies and an unsatisfying story. While the characters and atmosphere pull the player in, the gameplay and story problems are overwhelming.\n\nAfter competing Puzzle Agent 1, I was excited to play the sequel. Unfortunately, this game doesn't hold up. The story has suffered, as the overloaded plot crashes and burns in a chaotic confusion, leaving plothole debris everywhere. A list of which includes: Agent Tethers keeps his job at the FBI despite returning to a case without authorization; breaking and entering into the local police department; tampering with government evidence; assaulting another government agent; espousing conspiracy theories to his superior; and stealing and destroying government property.\nMrs. Garrett did not want someone to know that Tethers was staying at her inn, but we never find out who or why.\nIt is never revealed what happened to all the missing people in Scoggins, because...\nIt is never established whether the astronauts are murdering the missing people or if this was another wild goose chase. Since there have been a few false leads in both games, intentional to the plot, there is no way to know.\nThis leads to another problem for the story: If the astronauts aren't murdering people,  what's causing the disappearances? If the astronauts are murdering people, why didn't they murder Tethers when they cornered him and injected him with something to make him fall asleep?\nIt is never revealed what happened to the astronauts aside from Isaac.\nWhy did the astronauts remain in the forest for 16 years?\nWhat are the Hidden People? Where was their home? What was their home?\nWhy did Glori and Isaac agree to go the Brotherhood if he was disturbed, when he never appeared to be disturbed?\nDid the government know the space lander was in Scoggins since the first game? If they did, then why did they wait until Tethers sent back tapes in the second game to go there? If they didn't, why didn't they let Tethers finish the case is Scoggins the first time around? Why did they let Tethers stay in Scoggins after they found out he was there investigating a case off-duty?\nThis is a minor point, but Agent Tethers never draws his gun once in this game, even when his life is in danger. In the last game, I believe he uses it only once, and he misses. For some reason, the game's title card on Steam shows him drawing a gun. Again, I know this is a minor point, but why give him a gun if he never uses it? Especially since it's so easy to write in a reason he doesn't use one; He's an office agent in the Puzzle Research Division who almost never goes on field missions. There's even less of a reason for him to have a gun this time since he's not even on offical busniess. It just shows a lack of thought in the writing.\n\nThe list goes on. This is totally unacceptable and unprofessional story-writing. You can beat the game in under 2 hours (I've played the game a couple times to get all the achievements) and the number of plot-holes is unbelieveable. Why else would a game so short have a plot explanation on Wikipedia that's as long as a PhD dissertation?\n\nI've heard great things about Telltale's more recent work, but there's still no excuse because Puzzle Agent 1 was satisfying as far as story goes. Yes, there were loose ends and mysteries at the conclusion, but the main goals were achieved and the mysteries were largely related to things out of Tether's control the whole time: He couldn't understand this odd little town, and he never would. It was over his head, and he caught a glimpse of something greater than he could ever imagine. The player is left intrigued. In Puzzle Agent 2, parts of the mystery are revealed and simply make no sense, leaving the player very frustrated.\n\nThe biggest problem with the first game were that the puzzles were inconsistent in difficulty and clarity. Here, it seems the difficulty has been smoothed out a bit, but they have lost variety and at times still have difficult to interpret rules. The biggest problem I had was that the puzzles had little to do with the story and actually broke the pace.\n\nNot to say I disliked everything. Sheriff Bahg was my favorite antagonist from the first game, and his condescending skepticism of the meek FBI man Tethers is always so well-played. The voice acting for Bahg is excellent. The atmosphere in the game also retains it's X-files allure, and Tethers searching for clues is still exciting. Korka was an interesting new character, and she gave the story some funny payoff and comedy relief. I always liked Tethers as a character; he's an excellent straightman in a world full of insane people. He also always has this idiotic confused look on his face that's actually pretty endearing.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: Since this is a point-and-click adventure game, this is pretty hard to screw up, but Telltale pulled it off. One achievement requires a perfect run of all puzzles in the game. Even if you beat the game with one failed attempt at one puzzle and go back to that puzzle after the conclusion of the story, it doesn't matter. You have to open a new file and play the entire game over and do everything perfectly. Kind of a waste of time.\n\nOverall, the game is atmospheric, exciting and well-acted, but the gameplay and story problems are too great for these high points to overcome. Not recommended unless heavily discounted, you have played the prequel, and are looking for achievements.","March 5","false","6.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

If you are looking for a game with enjoyable puzzles, the first Puzzle Agent is great and a real bargain. But if you enjoyed the puzzles in the first Puzzle Agent, you may be sorely disappointed with this continuation of the game. Unlike the first game, many of the puzzles lacked proper descriptions, forcing the player to make guesses on the rules of certain puzzles. Some even required previous knowledge, which may cause some puzzlers to break from the immersion of the game to go to the internet. While the first Puzzle Agent relied more on logical and 'puzzle' puzzles, this game tended to use more visual puzzles without much logic at all. But if you try not to care about the puzzles, and ignore the visual and gameplay bugs (infinite gum!), you might enjoy what you see.","July 19, 2014","false","3.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

(Hint: Binary number system, and PI's digits. Great if you know them, but frustrating when it doesn't give you any context for number sequence puzzles.\n\nThe original Puzzle Agent I still recommend playing as a good example of a story driven adventure/puzzle game that manages to convey fear and suspense.

They not only can watch the rest of the story, but can enjoy the increased puzzle difficulty.\n\nLong version:A typical sequel usually does nothing but brings you more of the defining elements of the first instalment. Puzzle Agent 2 is no exception.\n\nThe artwork is yet again based on Graham Annable’s Grickle series, but one of the defining elements, the eerie small town mystery is quickly abolished by the new plot, leading into an overcomplicated government conspiracy thriller that in the end just cracks under its own weight.\n\nThe puzzles received a large overhaul. There is no more ambiguity, and the number of 5-second riddles have been reduced considerably to give room for more difficult and more computer game-like types. There is also a new incentive system for replay value: you can only access the final enigma if you successfully complete all puzzles without hints or wrong answers, a feat which is nearly impossible on the first try without a walkthrough.\n\nThanks to these simple design improvements Puzzle Agent 2 is a little more fun to play than the first game, especially for returning players.","December 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

PA2 is essentially the same exact game (same engine, same characters, same setting, same types of puzzles). The main thing this one brings to the table is a continuation of the absurd story that began in part 1. So if you enjoyed the first game and/or just want to see how the story ends, then by all means, go ahead and pick up PA2. However, be warned - the puzzles aren't terribly brillaint or clever, and for the most part (as in PA1), the solutions are ridiculously easy. On only a few occasions will you be truly stumped for more than a few minutes, and that will likely be due to the instructions not being clear enough. Although, oddly, there are a couple of harder optional puzzles that require a more-than-casual familiarity with mathematics (which I felt was a bit strange).

As the first game tells us, you are in a village/town/outskirt called Scoogins, where an accident has occured in a eraser factory. This eraser factory was the only thing Scoogins could make money on, since the lack tourism. This factory also did erasers for The United States of America's president (unknown president in this lore), which means that if they do not get in to the factory and get it working again, they will lose their income and bad ♥♥♥♥ will happen. That is easier said than done. Anyhow, that is Puzzle Agent, not Puzzle Agent 2.\n\nAs you solve the Scoogins mystery, you decide to return back to Scoogins and get more answers (Play Puzzle Agent to understand). The game contains great puzzles, fantastic artwork (my personal taste) and some good fun. The puzzles makes you actually use your brain for once, since most of the games is one click and wasd to score, whilst in Puzzle Agent, the puzzles will reward you for solving them (with mental honour).\n\nMechanics:\nThe mechanics is still there, point and click, and for every puzzle you decide that you have the correct anwer, you will see how much tax money you will use up (The less, better score). If you solve the puzzle you will get a ranking and som gum (used for hints). If you answer incorrect, you will have to retry or leave the puzzle (Not every puzzle is needed to complete the story, but is highly recommended to atleast try.) and also spend more tax money.\n\nPros&Cons:\nI love the story and how it progresses, the first game actually got me jump at times, because the red ugly looking gnomes will freak the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. The only downside is the loading screens, they tend to be either slow or fast. Also the sound of voices is a little bit roughed up, so it makes it sound horrible at times.\n\nRating:\nOther than that the game series is great, and is a total must buy if you get bored of the wasd click games as I call them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/94590/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","When the first Puzzle Agent released, it was an unexpected but welcome change from developer Telltale Games's typical point-and-click adventure game that they are know for. Given it's cliffhanger ending and complete lack of closure it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually emerge, and thus we are presented with Puzzle Agent 2, a direct continuation of Nelson Tether's previous escapades in the odd little town of Scoggins and a fitting end to the story that was begun in the last game.\n\nAlthough it's marketed as a full sequel, PA2 is far more akin to a second episode, which is fairly typical of Telltale. It ties directly into the ending of the original game, tying up loose ends and finally shedding a light on what happened to Issac Davidson, what have Nelson's visions been about, and who the heck are the hidden people. While many of the revelations are absolutely absurd taken in context with the rest the series they don't feel at all out of place, instead just one more bizarre happening in the day to day occurrences of a puzzle agent. I was very pleased to finally get some answers for the many questions that had previously been asked, and in the end everything tied up quite nicely (or as nicely as anything this unusual could).\n\nGameplay is identical to the original game, mixing Professor Layton-like puzzles with the Twin Peaks-esq setting and dialog to great effect. The puzzles are a bit fewer in number this time, but as a whole they are better designed and effectively tied into the story than before. Many characters return, with better writing and voice acting while still retaining the original off-kilter charm that made them what they are. I never did adjust to the stilted animation style, but like everything else has a unique appeal to it that works with the rest of the game.\n\nIf I had any problem with the game it's that it's short, shorter than it's predecessor, and yet costs twice the price. I couldn't say that the quality of either of the two games is far apart (I think both are excellent for what they are), but at double the cost of admission with less content, it's hard for me to recommend purchasing PA2 at least outright, and would definitely advise waiting for a sale.\n\nOther than the length, Puzzle Agent 2 is a treat for fans of the original. You're getting more of the same, and that's a good thing as so far there isn't anything else like the series available on Steam. Playing the first game should definitely be considered a prerequisite, and if you didn't like it then this won't change your mind. For those wanting for more this is a worthy sequel who's biggest flaw is actually being called one.

You should get it if you can get both games for less than five dollars.\n\nPros\n- The videos will give you a feel for the game.  It is an interesting, slow paced game that has a twist here and there.\n- Humor is sprinkled into the game.\n- Getting your pen and paper out is satisfying for some of the puzzles.\n- The fact it costs the taxpayer so much per puzzle is both funny and realistic.\n- There is a resolution to the second game but there could be more (the right way to end the story).\n- The premise for the game is hilarious because it's realisitic.\n\nCons\n- A third or more of the puzzles are completely throw away.\n- The first game is NOT COMPLETE.  37 puzzles and half a story is not a full game.\n- the second game is NOT COMPLETE 34 puzzles aand half a story is not a full game.\n- There should be a better way to make sure you get all the puzzles before leaving a scene.\n- They should cut off dialogue options that you've already heard (you can talk to the same person again and on it will repeat when they're done but that means you'll have to repeat dialogue at least once per person per situation to make sure you hear everything they have to say.)\n\nTips\n- Always look carefully at the images behind numbers or other puzzles, they can provide clues.","January 5","false","5.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It was almost as if I was in a Professor Layton game. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.\n\nThe town greeted me with the warmth of a cold morning. Monosyllables and riddles, shoos and puzzles, lots of ABC gum. But the answers were clear: more missing people. All lost in the woods. Just like Isaac.\n\nI could tell that, while everything looked the same, everything was different. There was a sense of urgency about the people. Folks who made little to no sense before had now lost all but one of their marbles. Something was going to happen soon.\n\nI'm still not sure I believe what I saw in the woods.

An early example is a number sequence puzzle that provides the numbers 11, 12, 1, and 2, and challenges the player to work out the next number. Multiple potential patterns present themselves, but none of them are relevant; the game intends for the player to guess that they must be talking about clocks, and assume that the 12-1 portion of the sequence is a reset of the pattern, none of which is information that can be presented or discovered ingame in any way. Thus, like many of the game's puzzles, it's impossible to appropriately solve without using the built-in help system or by simply guessing.\n\nAnother good example is the coinbox puzzle, which attempts to utilize binary, but does so incorrectly. That puzzle is literally not possible to solve properly because its understanding of binary is incorrect, or perhaps the solution was coded wrong. The 'correct' answer is a mirrored version of what the actual binary values should read, though there's no indication that the answer is mirrored, leaving the player to guess and check. Either way, it's another ready example of puzzles that are ill-planned and expect the player to guess or to have outside help.\n\nThis might be the right puzzle game for people who like to be stuck only to learn that the solution was hidden in information they never had access to. Probably great fun for people who like riddles that can't be solved with the data provided. Not a good one for puzzle solvers who expect cleverly presented clues and solid logic, none of that will be found here.","July 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The truth is, the ending is not conclusive, the mystery isn't really solved, all the clues we found and all the mystery leads to a very inconclusive ending. The puzzles are good in both games, the suspense for a while is good, but when you start uncovering government conspiracies it takes a turn for the worse.

I was hoping Puzzle Agent 2 would follow in that honorable tradition. It did not. While not REALLY that much worse than the original (which I gave a general thumbs-up), it has certainly taken a couple of steps backward. The games' crayon-drawn style and sleepy setting were risky, but the first game succeeded in making them seem fresh and charming. In the sequel, the pacing is allowed to lag even more, and in order to follow up on the incomplete "Hidden People" storyline, it brings us back to the exact same town, with mostly the exact same characters, and even some of the same puzzles. In fact, the whole thing just feels like the second act of the same game; the experiences are mostly redundant.\n\nBut the big problem is that, the puzzles, the crux and namesake of these games, are simply poor. The original had a clear progression in difficulty, with the few exceptions sprinkled so as to have an alleviating effect. In PA2, it's all over the place. Worse is that many of the puzzles AREN'T EVEN PUZZLES. One of them (spoiler alert, I guess) literally just wants you to recognize the digits of pi and supply the eighth and ninth digits after the decimal, you know, because we've all memorized it past the first two. The whole game, in fact, is so inconsistent that it never feels like it was ever going to be cohesive in the first place.\n\nAnd the storyline is no better. So unless you're addicted to Mr. Annable's art style, just give this one a pass.","October 14, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's definitely worth $5, and it may even be worth $10 to you depending on how much you loved the first game and the series' story.\n\nOne note, though: This game has Steam achievements, but far more than the number of those visible. Each puzzle has a secret achievement and some events have their own secret achievements too. In addition, the "Puzzle Agent!" achievement is "bugged".

The second game does not have as many issues - only a few puzzles are ones that I would consider unfair (specifically, a few puzzles that require the player to have a cursory understanding of mathematical concepts that are not universally taught to all students, such as what an integral symbol from calculus looks like). In their place are more simplistic, traditional puzzles (many of which are used in the first game) that repeat several times through the game: sliding tile puzzles, "cut all the lines" puzzles, and programming puzzles to name a few. It feels like the developers got rid of the whole "FBI man solving challenging puzzles" conceit and just made the game using puzzles no more challenging or unique than those found in typical adventure games - except the puzzles don't integrate as tightly into the narrative as they do in the better examples of the genre.\n\nThat being said, I'm actually going to recommend this game for one reason: the storytelling is a step-above the first game. The writing for the character dialogue is more enchanting (though it may be because the Scoggins universe has already had a game to set up its universe... or it may be because there is a much larger dialogue tree this time around). The story also goes into mysterious, unpredictable directions, riffing on government conspiracies with engaging results. And the humor (while still subdued and at times subtle) is more on-point this time (particularly in the hero's exchanges with Korka Tetirdottir, the closest the game gets to creating a love interest for Agent Tethers).\n\nThe story is improved enough that I'd recommend this game for anyone who made it through the first one or anyone who likes adventure games. Those who aren't keen on adventure games should probably just skip this return trip to Minnesota.\n\nNote:\nFor those who didn't play the first game, there is a synopsis of the story in Nelson's journal under the puzzle file menu - I'd recommend skipping the first game and just reading that as it isn't worth playing through the first game just to get a few in-jokes.\n","December 8, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fewer ambiguous puzzles, more substantial hints, and better explanations. All around the puzzles were much better designed, and as a result, I had a much better time with this game. The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game's hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it's more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.\n\nIf you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement.

The second game does not have as many issues - only a few puzzles are ones that I would consider unfair (specifically, a few puzzles that require the player to have a cursory understanding of mathematical concepts that are not universally taught to all students, such as what an integral symbol from calculus looks like). In their place are more simplistic, traditional puzzles (many of which are used in the first game) that repeat several times through the game: sliding tile puzzles, "cut all the lines" puzzles, and programming puzzles to name a few. It feels like the developers got rid of the whole "FBI man solving challenging puzzles" conceit and just made the game using puzzles no more challenging or unique than those found in typical adventure games - except the puzzles don't integrate as tightly into the narrative as they do in the better examples of the genre.\n\nThat being said, I'm actually going to recommend this game for one reason: the storytelling is a step-above the first game. The writing for the character dialogue is more enchanting (though it may be because the Scoggins universe has already had a game to set up its universe... or it may be because there is a much larger dialogue tree this time around). The story also goes into mysterious, unpredictable directions, riffing on government conspiracies with engaging results. And the humor (while still subdued and at times subtle) is more on-point this time (particularly in the hero's exchanges with Korka Tetirdottir, the closest the game gets to creating a love interest for Agent Tethers).\n\nThe story is improved enough that I'd recommend this game for anyone who made it through the first one or anyone who likes adventure games. Those who aren't keen on adventure games should probably just skip this return trip to Minnesota.\n\nNote:\nFor those who didn't play the first game, there is a synopsis of the story in Nelson's journal under the puzzle file menu - I'd recommend skipping the first game and just reading that as it isn't worth playing through the first game just to get a few in-jokes.\n","December 8, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is alright and fit to continue the first part but I cannot help but cringe at Nelson's behaviour as he unrelatably quick slips into paranoia. Director Jennings brings it to a point: "Tethers, you're embarrassing yourself." To be fair, Nelson's paranoia pace is sort of explained later in the game.\n\nWell, Puzzle Agent 2 successfully repeats features already in the previous part, likable characters, coherent sometimes creepy sometimes funny story and of course puzzles, puzzles, puzzles.\nSince you spend most of your time puzzling it's rewarding to see the puzzle evaluation being polished, more envelopes, more stamping, more feeling successful :)\n\n+ Fell-good pencil graphics from a 3D engine\n+ Coherent story\n+ Very good voice acting\n+ Almost no 'broken puzzles'\n+ A puzzle hard to brute-force\n\n!

I wonder if development felt the same and then decided to reward you at the very end with a really nice one.\nThere is a number of puzzles that sort of fall in the same family thus adding to the feeling of repetition. One class I particularly dislike is that of incomplete sequences asking the player to continue a sequence of number of unknown reference and extent. I dislike them because references can be randomly chosen if the sequence is not completed with what the player has to provide.\nThink of "What two letters follow MTWTF?" Actually this is asking what two letters complete the sequence. So there are there is a sequence of seven letters with the given five-letter prefix that is a thing which you are supposed to recognize as such. With incomplete sequences that don't 'form a thing' there is some kind of description allowing for every possible follow-up letter or number or digit.\nThe three puzzles with that problem refer to a part of a no longer everyday object of cultural convention, a mathematical constant that made it into pop culture and a contrivance of an again cultural convention.\n\nBroken PuzzlesIt seems one major flaw of the first episode has been almost completely eradicated. There appear to almost no broken puzzles, i.e. puzzles with insufficient description or multiple solutions not all of which are accepted. Specifically the very first puzzle accepted three different of the 24 possible solutions. As you hear a ding whenever that puzzle is done even before submitting, I'm assuming all of those dings will lead to an "Accepted".\n\nMission: RockInsufficient description.\nThe assignment mentions the bouncing of the stone but fails to mention the rock doesn't enter a forest tile when bouncing as opposed to the way light reflects off of mirrors in the brain puzzle or how the snowmobile bounces off of logs in the first game's puzzles.\n\nGnome AppearanceMe being picky again.\nYeah, the title has "appearance" in it, so I guess this puzzle is 'sufficiently explained'. From the pictures alone there are two possible sequences, only one of which has the gnomes appear, but the accepted solution has the Moon's movement wrong. Just think about how the waxing and waning Moon develops light patterns.\n\nSubtitlesWhen inspecting the stove for first time the text says "Ms. Garrett" with two 't'. Also, there are a number of discrepancies between written and spoken text.\n\nBuggy HotspottingSometimes we see inconsistent iconography for hotspots. Again, hotspots are revealed when clicking in the current scene outside of dialogue and puzzle. There is a green arrow for exits from the scene, a magnifying glass for things that can be looked at/investigated and a puzzle piece for puzzles.\nNow, from the main street the way through the alley is marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but it is actually the way to the hotel.\nThe secretary in Olav Melhaven's cabin with the stars on its backside is sometimes marked as a hotspot with a magnifying glass but no action happens when clicked. Similary you will find 'hotspotted' areas later in the lodge that do not react to clicks.Not really a bug but bugging me: I like to identify hotspots in a scene before deciding which one to click next. Hotspots don't reveal the extent of the corresponding area. Although usually sensibly bound to an object I found myself time and time again interacting with hotspots before knowing the complete scene.","July 7, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second game does not have as many issues - only a few puzzles are ones that I would consider unfair (specifically, a few puzzles that require the player to have a cursory understanding of mathematical concepts that are not universally taught to all students, such as what an integral symbol from calculus looks like). In their place are more simplistic, traditional puzzles (many of which are used in the first game) that repeat several times through the game: sliding tile puzzles, "cut all the lines" puzzles, and programming puzzles to name a few. It feels like the developers got rid of the whole "FBI man solving challenging puzzles" conceit and just made the game using puzzles no more challenging or unique than those found in typical adventure games - except the puzzles don't integrate as tightly into the narrative as they do in the better examples of the genre.\n\nThat being said, I'm actually going to recommend this game for one reason: the storytelling is a step-above the first game. The writing for the character dialogue is more enchanting (though it may be because the Scoggins universe has already had a game to set up its universe... or it may be because there is a much larger dialogue tree this time around). The story also goes into mysterious, unpredictable directions, riffing on government conspiracies with engaging results. And the humor (while still subdued and at times subtle) is more on-point this time (particularly in the hero's exchanges with Korka Tetirdottir, the closest the game gets to creating a love interest for Agent Tethers).\n\nThe story is improved enough that I'd recommend this game for anyone who made it through the first one or anyone who likes adventure games. Those who aren't keen on adventure games should probably just skip this return trip to Minnesota.\n\nNote:\nFor those who didn't play the first game, there is a synopsis of the story in Nelson's journal under the puzzle file menu - I'd recommend skipping the first game and just reading that as it isn't worth playing through the first game just to get a few in-jokes.\n","December 8, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fewer ambiguous puzzles, more substantial hints, and better explanations. All around the puzzles were much better designed, and as a result, I had a much better time with this game. The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game's hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it's more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.\n\nIf you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement.

But no cards to collect ;(\n\nThat's the good stuff and if you liked the first game already, you definitely should play the sequel if you haven't started yet.\nAnd I recommend to play the first game first since "Puzzle Agent 2" continues the open end-story (in the worst case you might just get confused by the plot).\n\nSpeaking of plot: Unfortunately I have one or two issues with it.\nWithout spoiling it I can tell that the story doesn't seem to be clear in the end. When I finished the game (thus the whole story) I just wondered about details that seemed to be forgotten halfway through and thus some questions remained unanswered. What a pity since the actual crime story is quite funny and crazy.\n\nAnd the puzzles? Yes, some are very easy and some need real hard thinking and cleverness to be solved. And then there are one or two you might just look up on the guides or do trial or error (to me math idiot, that was a mathmatical puzzle). But at least you can't complain that the puzzles all were boring and crazy-easy. And it's a good mix.\n\nSo if you love to relax to a short, funny crime adventure based on puzzle solving, grab some chewing gums and try this!

Good times! A must-play to at least finish the story and loose ends of the first game.\n\nThe story is a lot more interesting than the first game, with far more going on, new characters, and less revisiting the same people over again. (Which makes for a less believable detective story, but in this crazy game that's a plus.) Unfortunately, the puzzles fall down hard on this one, with everything basically being an annoying "unblock" puzzle, rehashes of the first game's puzzles with no new mechanics, or a number sequence. Every single puzzle was either solveable at a glance or unsolvable without a hint for me (I don't have a head for number sequences), so it wasn't nearly as exciting as figuring out the mechanics of various puzzle types in the first game.\n\nStill, the good voice acting, the weird story made much weirder but wrapped up nicely, and new places and people.

For the full price I might've.\nThe plot is weird and creepy and random enough to be charming and it somewhat resolves the previous game, thankfully.\nThe puzzle mechanics are better than the first one, unsurprisigly. It's a natural progression of developers realizing you don't want to require a pen and paper to solve things if you are making a video game. Unfortunately, it made the variety of puzzles a bit worse.\nIf it was a longer series of games, they would have probably hit their balance eventually, but alas. And maybe realized that more than one sliding puzzle per game is too many sliding puzzles.\n\nStrange thing that I haven't seen mentioned is a secondary character design homage to the Broken Sword game series (the Korka girl).

I can't say enough how pleasing the animation is: 70's cartoon style with plenty of sly winks and a great sense of humor. The story is fun and has twists to it and I never got tired of the animation's pacing.\n\nThey did improve on the problem of vague puzzle directions derailing the actual puzzles themselves, but it's still not perfect. Or perhaps the instructions weren't improved at all except that I had been exposed to all of these puzzles in the first game and now didn't need better instructions. There were no new puzzles, just variations in the decorations on the puzzles from the first game. I didn't have a problem with that.\n\nAlso, I would love it if they sped up the "submission" process. The animations never vary and are frustratingly slow and completely superflous to the puzzles and the story. They just get in the way.\n\nThis is a great game. If you like puzzle challenges, play this. You don't have to be great at puzzles, there are plenty of hints available to solve them, you just need to like puzzles.","September 7, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a solid game built on an unsteady foundation. It was a novel premise back by an endearing backdrop, but you couldn't help think it was incomplete or cut short in places.\n\nPuzzle Agent 2 is, in many ways; the second half of the first game. But despite reusing alot of the assets of the first game. it still feels fresh and current by virtue of it be so cleverly crafted as well as being as short as the first Puzzle Agent. The story does take on a quicker pace with the assumption that the player had finished the first game. The unforunaale thing is it fails once again to conclude all the plot points in a good fashion. Leaving you flummexed in the end about why certain significent plot points are left out.\nThe puzzles this time seem to lack the variety and consistency of the first Puzzle Agent's. Too often types of puzzles are reused too frequently, And although its been a while since I played the last one, it feels like there were fewer puzzles to solve in total this time around.\n\nSo what is Puzzle Agent 2? Well I would not call it a haphazad afterthought sequel meant to sum up the first game's glaring cliff hanger. But on the other hand its doesn't do much to improve or build on the series. Perhaps than Puzzle Agent 2 is a well crafted, somewhat rushed stopgap, made to bind this part of this series' narrative with the inevidentable third and possibly fourth entry (which is hamfistingly implied at the very end).\n\nI liked it, but I'm not satisified with the end product.","December 20, 2011","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are difficult but they're not so impossibly difficult that you have no idea how to solve them.  For the most part, they're also all different from eachother.\n\nThe story is really creative even though it's kind of farfetched.  But it's a cartoon so it doesn't really need to be realistic.  It's really well laid out for a point-and-click game.  I've played lots of point-and-click games where you could get completely lost and never know what to do next, but you pretty much always have a decent grasp on where to go in this one.  The characters also all have distinct personalities.\n\nThe art is simple but it's a cool style, like most Telltale games are.  It seems to be all rendered in 3D but meant to look 2D, which is pretty neat.  The only time you can really tell it's 3D is in the cafe when you walk in, you can see the booths move a bit.\n\nIt took me 2 playthroughs and about 5 hours to get every achievement, but I really enjoyed playing it each time.\n\nCons:\n\nThere's chewed gum stuck to the walls everywhere.  You rechew the gum as a hint in a puzzle.  This makes me gag.\n\nAlso, the voice acting is kind of transparent but not really to the point where it takes away from the game very much.","January 15","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a mixture of easy, medium and hard puzzles, depending on how smart you are. I'm not that clever, let's just say I'm okay at doing puzzles, but I managed to get through all of them with patience, dedication and of course the wonderful hints that are available and that you can find all over the map. If you aren't patient, and if you don't like thinking a lot, then I'd recommend not even considering on buying this game as this game is for people with patience as you need to think about how to complete the puzzle.\n\nThe game has a good story to it, which I will not reveal or else it will ruin the game for everyone. There are approximately 25+ puzzles that you need to go through in order to proceed further into the game. Graphics aren't fantastic, they are alright in my opinion.\n\nAnd last of all, how long the game is. For its price, this game is well worth it. Right now the game is on a wonderful sale so for $2.00 right now, it is certainly worth buying. For the original price, not so sure about that.\nThis game will take you approximately 2-5 hours.

Do you know binary numbers? Because one of the puzzles require you to know binary numbers, and there's nothing about the puzzle itself that implies it's about binary at all.\n2.) It's 2016 (a leap year) as I write this review. The last "story" puzzle in the game will seem impossible to solve if you play it on a leap year -- assuming you even make the tenuous connection in the first place.

A couple of them require outside knowledge to solve, like of US currency and calculus. They heavily re-use puzzle concepts. You will replay the same types of puzzles 4-6 times each. Many of the puzzles can be confirmed that they are solved before you sumbit them, so you won't have to submit an answer while not being 100% sure it's correct. That means you can often solve them through trial and error. Not to mention quite a few are super simple.\n\nThe story is a continuation of the story in the first game. When it ends you'll know the origins of the gnomes and what happened to Isaac Davner but the explenation is pretty nonsensical and a bit too silly, and several plot points are left unresolved. The creepy athmosphere from the first game is still there, but much less pronounced. To be honest I prefer how the first game ended, that it left the creepy gnomes as a mystery.\n\nOkay, it's still a decent game.

The gameplay is still the same, some two dozen puzzles or so for you to solve, which might be good enough for some, but the game is still too short. 10 euro for 2 hour long game is not a good price, so wait for it to go on sale and it will be worth the money.","April 30","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite having reopened the eraser factory in Scoggins back in Puzzle Agent 1, Tethers is still unconvinced that all is solved in the town. He returns to finally put the case to rest and end the mystery of the little town in the middle of nowhere.\n\nPuzzle Agent 2 plays exactly like it's predecessor, with you playing as Agent Tethers and traveling all over Scoggins to interrogate townsfolk and solve various puzzles you'll come across. The puzzles are again quite varied and will give you a decent challenge, however some are more out there than others. There was one puzzle where I had no choice but to consult Google due to how much mathematical knowledge the games assumes you'll have playing (you'll know it when you see it.) There are also plenty of puzzles that are trickier than in the original so with the exception of those few really obtuse ones, you'll feel a bit more challenged than before.\n\nWithout spoiling it, the plot is rather weak... several of the familiar townsfolk do make returns, but they aren't quite as utilized as well as before. They're all pretty much moved aside from the plot come the second half, which is a real shame considering how lovable and off the wall they were in the first game. Also, a lot of the ambiguity in the previous game is stripped away in this game, which may not be such a good thing, in my opinion. Part of what made the original so great for me was the abrupt ending, and the resolution in this game leaves much to be desired.\n\nThey recycle a lot of the music in the original, but do manage to add some other tunes, which sadly didn't really stick to me as well the previous game. The animation is still Grickle, which is just as slow and choppy as before, but if you enjoyed the style before, you'll be getting a lot more of it. The voice acting is still top notch.\n\nAll in all, this game feels like an expansion to the first one and should really be bundled with the first one when you buy it. I'd wait for a steam sale or humble bundle, but if you have a fix for puzzles that the first one didn't leave completely satisfied, then this game is a must buy.","May 1","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blocky, ugly 3D assets and graphical glitches are omnipresent and 2D sprite characters are in a disturbing contrast with them.\n\nPlot it quite interesting, but full of holes. Dialogue works most of the time, but the characters sometimes waste several lines to blabber about something boring and irrelevant.\n\nPuzzles are good and sometimes challenging, but there are some (they are rare, thought) that require external knowledge, like knowing what the coins used in US look like.\n\nI like the game, despite of everything. It has its good moments, it's short and cheap.","May 9","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly, the story had a lot of holes and wasnt the best\n\nAgain, like the first, this game doesnt hold up as a puzzle game. The story was interesting enough but left some holes and there were parts that didnt make sense.

Cutscenes (and gamplay in general) are slow, graphics are annoying (you need to choose the right resolution -even if you have a bigger screen-, or else the mouse is not synchronized with the location where you click). Funny storyline though, really bizarre conspiracy theories. Puzzles are sometimes somewhat unclear, but most of the time quite amusing.

Good varience in puzzles with varying difficulty (a few poorly worded and broken), conveying plot.\nThis was a culmination of "guess-and-check" puzzles, with "outside knoweldge" puzzles. "Here is a series of numbers. What comes next?" was used at least 4 separate times, even more if you include the times when it was reskinned with coins or something similar. Do you know how many  days of are in each month of the year, when added all together one by one  ? How about  reconizing binary when the counting units are coins  ? This knowledge had nothing to do with the game, so here I was multiplying and dividing and square rooting these numbers trying to find what they had in common, but no, they were just  how to count on a clock, 11, 12, 1, 2\n\nFinish the pattern puzzles, spin the thing to make it line up puzzles, bounce the laser around puzzles, move the blocks around puzzles. There wasn't a single unique puzzle in this entire game, even unique to itself. All of the puzzles in this game have been done to death, were used at least once in the previous game, and repeated at least once in this game.\n\nI was disappointed with the first Puzzle Agent game, due to the poorly written and downright difficult to understand puzzle decriptions at times, but at least it tried to be unique. It felt like a challenge. This on the other hand, well, I hope you can spin squares around to match them up.\n\nAnd as a separate issue, on the last puzzle I had a glitch where the main items of focus didn't even render. They were black squares. Through the final puzzles, through the very end of the credits, I had no idea what the items of interest were. Even the after-credits scene didn't load properly. I hadn't had that problem with either of the games up until that point.\nSo I got to shlep through 5 puzzles with different skins for four hours without even a final feeling of completion.\n\nRad.","May 22","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
