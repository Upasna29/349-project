"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/recommended/63610/","TRCheese","Τhe Rolling Cheese Wheel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/","4053 products in account","Riven is a sequel to Myst, an old school click adventure game that revolves solving intricate puzzles and exploring surreal worlds created from linking books.\n\nFirst off let me tell you that Riven is not revised for modern hardware, as such, some feature set is very archaic. The save menu operates like a word document save menu. The resolution is stuck at a piddly 640x480 resolution, this makes playing the game on modern monitors an absolutely awful visual experience. To makes matter worst, the game cannot be set to windowed mode without some major .exe hex coding voodoo. That set aside, the game is still worth playing. After all with the limitation of Riven’s game engine, which is essentially one huge powerpoint slide, it’s not too strange that the game is limited in resolution. The game is a little over 3 gigabytes and it’s 33% of 1080p. Keep in mind that this game was created in 1997, which equates to a 5 CD game. Had this game release at 1080p, it would’ve been around 15 CD’s. Have fun switching and keeping track of that many disk while playing!\n\nLow resolution doesn’t necessarily mean the graphics in Riven are at all bad. In fact, Riven’s pre-rendered graphic looks awesome! It doesn’t look plastic like you would expect from a game from this era, but fairly photorealistic. The graphic looks crisp, and the surreal architecture of the buildings and environment in game brings a sense of wonder and mystery. Very few games in 1997 can blow you away graphically, Riven is one of those games that will leave you in awe at the beauty of 1997 technology.\n\nThe music and ambient track in Riven is absolutely amazing on a beefy surround sound system. Visually I was put off by the gigantic black bounding box on screen but the sound immersed me enough for me to overlook the huge dark void surrounding the game. The sounds from a water creek would fade in and out as I get closer or farther away from the source. The sound of machinery is so crisp I could believe I have such machinery in my house.\n\nRiven isn’t for casuals or the easily frustrated. The puzzles in this game are one of the most mind bending and complicated in any game I have ever played. This is probably the first game ever that I got lost even with the assistance of a walkthrough. It’s not that the puzzles are too obscure to figure out, it’s because the logic behind them and the reference to them is sometimes hard to pick up. The map and locale of Riven is also massive so backtracking for clues can become a headache. With the limited screenshot capabilities of the game, it’s even harder to remember specific details about clues without jotting down rough notes to what you see. For casuals and unclean masses who have never played an adventure game before, this game is a deathwish. Veterans of the point and click genre will definitely be challenged.\n\nRiven regardless of it’s age is still well worth playing for veterans of point and clicks. It aged relatively well even with it’s hideous resolution. If you’re itching for a masochistic slideshow adventure game, you won’t find a better one anywhere on steam.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=212209116\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=191597405\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=185754315","February 4, 2014","true","105.9"," 113 of 125 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","113","125","0","7"

Riven was the sequel to the massively popular game Myst which launched in 1993. It was famously one of the first games to be released on a CD and helped to popularize the CD-ROM drive. I can't even believe Myst is more than 20 years old now. I can still remember playing Myst on Windows 3.1 and how frustratingly often it used to crash. Then Riven was released in 1997 and came on 5 CDs. You had to annoyingly keep swapping the CDs out as you explored different parts of the island. There's a lot of stuff like this about Riven that requires the player to have a lot of patience. Patience that I had as a kid, but has long since left me as an adult. It's kind of a shame because I'm pretty sure that if I played a game like Riven today, I'd push it aside after 15 minutes or so and move on to something else. While there are some technical limitations and some game mechanics in Riven that have not aged well over the years, there's also a lot this game does really smartly. It's a "slow burn" type of game. If you give Riven your time and patience, it will reward you with some amazingly clever puzzles and an unusual and immersive fantasy story.\n\nFor those not familiar with the Myst games, they are point & click style adventure games. But not quite in the same way as the old King's Quest or Monkey Island games. They're no puzzles that involve combining items together through some absurd logic that allows you to progress further or whatever. In Riven, you're gated only by how much you've explored and how deep your understanding is about the island and its inhabitants. It's a game that does a beautiful job of communicating a complex story with few words and minimal cutscenes. The only cutscene you're given for quite a while is the game's initial opening cutscene, which really gives you more questions than answers. During this cryptic scene, a man teleports you to an island called Riven after giving you nothing but two books. You arrive in a jail cell on Riven where one of the books you were given is promptly stolen by a man who does not speak your language. The thief is then quickly killed by another mysterious person who sets you free, but not before taking the stolen book for himself. You're then free to explore the island and unravel the mystery of Riven. An intriguing open, no? What's in that book that's worth killing for? And who are these people who are so desperate to get it?\n\nRiven's story is told through exploring the island, discovering its secrets and understanding the meaning and purpose behind them. Riven doesn't tell its story through dialogue or cutscenes as in most games. When you do watch a cutscene in the game, it usually only serves to confirm what you've figured out about the island already. It's never directly or clearly communicated to you what any of the character's motivations are or even why you were sent to the island in the first place. It's really up to the player to discover and understand the deep story in Riven for themselves, and this may have been the most satisfying part of the game for me. I think the best way to go about doing this is to always ask the question "Why?" when something doesn't make sense. A lot of the fun in this game is trying to form the answers to all of the questions the game gives based on what you know about the island so far. The developers did a fantastic job of being very deliberate with their world design. Nothing is there by accident or coincidence, nearly every object or structure in the game is meant to communicate something important to you. As you explore Riven, you'll encounter many mysterious machines and contraptions. Ask "What do they do?". "Who would have put them here?". If you think on these questions, eventually the details of the story will come in to focus.\n\nThe puzzles in Riven are given to you in a similar fashion as the story. The objective or elements of the puzzle aren't given to you explicitly, but rather communicated to you subtly through the environment and world design. It's definitely a game where you have to keep a sheet or two of handwritten notes while you're playing, which is something not many games do anymore. Some of the puzzles in Riven are downright brilliant. There's one amazing puzzle in particular where I can remember feeling so impressed with myself after I had figured it out. The solutions to these puzzles are really so satisfying when you finally figure them out. I'd challenge you to play through this game without looking any of them up.\n\nRiven is not without its faults though and some of them are unfortunately due to this game's age. The game is first person, but it's not full 3D. It's essentially a bunch of still images that have been linked together. This, to me, really makes the game feel aged. A full 3D engine would do this game a lot of good. The game's pace is also incredibly slow and it can be very frustrating to be stuck in one place for a while and feel like you're not progressing. This will likely happen a lot in Riven which can be discouraging to players if they don't have a deep well of patience. There are certain puzzles in the game where Riven may have been to clever for its own good. The puzzle solutions are fair, but they're hidden so deeply in the game's world that they're not easily discovered without a very keen eye and extremely sharp mind.\n\nIf you've got the time and patience and love puzzle games, mysteries or unusual stories, Riven would probably be a good fit for you. Just keep in mind that this game will probably show its age and you may also get stuck frequently while playing it. If you've never played a game in the Myst series and are curious, Riven is a great place to start. It's a refinement and improvement on everything that the first game was. While subsequent games in the series improved their audiovisual fidelity, they never quite recaptured the sublime story or brilliant puzzles that made Riven a great game. Also steer clear of Myst 5. That game is terrible. Rand Miller, one of the lead creative minds behind Myst and Riven recently launched a successful kickstarter for his new game, Obduction. It sounds like Obduction will play similarly to Riven and I'd love to try another game like this to see if I still have the patience for it. I'll be interested to monitor the development of Obduction and hopefully play it soon.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","September 26, 2014","true","9.3"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","0"

That's not the kind of game this is. The controls are there; they do what they need to do and nothing else. It won't detract from your enjoyment, simply because you'll never feel the need to shoot at something or jump over a pit of lava.\n\nSecond of all, you need to play Myst first, and Myst isn't the best game ever made. Myst will do two things for you: it will start you off with the story and the concept of linking books, and it will warm up the parts of your brain that you'll need to solve Riven. Unlike Myst, there is so much lore and eyecandy in Riven that you won't know what notes to take and what you need to remember, and you won't know a puzzle even when it's staring you in the face. Yes, sometimes you'll find a combination lock or something traditional like that, but you'll also encounter obstacles that you won't even know are solvable. It is one of the hardest puzzle games ever made, but it does it the right way: No pixel hunting and no subversive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThird of all, the Steam version and the GoG version are both broken. Get yourself a copy of the DVD version.\n\nWith that all in mind, go fiddle your way through your favorite Myst remake, and then sit down with a pencil and paper and have your mind blown. Right here is where the universe blossoms, right here is where the blunt story of a peculiar family suddenly shows it's true depth, right here is where you disover that there is thousands of years of history behind you, right here is where you discover that the Miller brothers are two brilliant and crazy motherfrakkers.\n\nAnd if you look up the solution to a puzzle online, you'll ruin the whole thing. Reach out and poke someone on Steam for a hint. Don't spoil the greatest ocean of atmosphere and intrigue ever made.","December 21, 2014","true","2.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","4"

Riven is and forever will be my favorite of the Myst games, and while I would dearly like to see it lovingly restored as Myst has been, it is still a pleasure to play in its original form.\n\nHaving completed the game, I will say once again that it is not without its bugs, but the workarounds are acceptable if done properly and in advance (I did them once before I started gameplay and did not have to do them again).  I completed this game using Windows 7 64bit and was able to avoid freeze-ups, major glitches (there was some minor screen clipping during videos and sound clipping during minor interactions which did not affect gameplay), or deleted saves.  I used the following fixes…\nMake sure the game is up to date.\nSet the game to play in compatibility mode (in this instance I chose Windows 98/ME with all the boxes checked including ‘run as administrator’)\nSet you launch option to ‘/affinity 1’\nMake certain you use multiple saveThis should give you smooth gameplay with a minimum of bugs save for one:\nAfter entering the cell in the Rivenese village, you will walk down a dark tunnel.  If you go to the very end of the tunnel and turn around, the game will glitch and land you back at the swinging chair.  To avoid this, light the first lamp, glitch, run the tunnel again, but this time stop the first time you see light, turn around and light the lamp, work your way back from there. This was the only frustrating glitch I encountered.\n\nEnjoy!\n","July 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","2"

Riven takes place immediately after the events following Myst in which you play the role of yourself, sent to Riven to free Atrus's wife and capture Ghen, a power hungry lunatic who was banished to Riven.\n\nRiven, like the original and the others in the series is a puzzle based adventure game in which you will need to traverse across islands, explore them carefully and elaborately and solve puzzles. Riven like Myst is extremely hard, these are probably the hardest puzzle games on the market yet at the same time are logical and fair. I first experienced these as a child but had no idea what I was doing and gave up pretty shortly then went back to playing Duke Nukem 3D, now that I am older and wiser was finally able to appreciate these games, to call Myst and Riven masterpieces would be an understatement, these are works of art in every regard. I have yet to try Myst III and upwards and can’t wait.\n\nRiven features tough puzzles, has an amazing soundtrack, brilliant plot and some of the best art work in gaming that will leave you in awe, while this may be picture-based there are some scenes which feature real actors and are done very well. Riven has an atmosphere so thick you’d need a steak knife to slice through it, an insane amount of attention to detail was put into consideration when designing every square millimetre of this game, everything is done so well.\n\nI hope they remake this along the line with a new engine so more people and future generations will be obliged to give it a shot as this is a piece of artwork that everyone should experience.","February 1, 2015","true","38.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","2"

What I enjoy most about the Myst series, is the prospect of walking around through beautiful, exotic, semi-abandoned worlds. Riven is the Myst game that least fits that description. And since it has been many years since I read the Myst novels, I found the exact plot of Riven rather confusing. And some of the puzzles are just annoying. Like, throughout the game there are doors that you can open with a click, and you can also close them with a click. Normally, this is a completely useless feature, and you assume it's just there for completeness. But exactly twice in the game, there are hidden passages that you don't see unless you close a door after passing through it.\n\nWith all that said, being my least favorite entry in the Myst series still means it's a pretty great game. Gehn's character is great, and the sun-drenched isles of Riven are beautiful to walk around, and to figure out the economy of how they all fit together.\n\nAnd of course, if you're going to play the Myst series, you've got to play Riven anyway.","October 25, 2015","true","12.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

I say this first because i've already played the game originally in 1997 and certain things had changed for this review (alltough the game essentially is the same from 1997 just compiled to dowload online).\n\nI loved the game when i first played it (almost 20 years ago by now). It was a very interesting sequel to Myst and added many things to the story (in fact, it had a story!) You meet ghen, catherine and again Atrus.  There is something going on at least! that is the main thing i guess.\nThe game came out in 5 cd rom discs wich was pretty notable for that time, lots of data and videos. More than 3gb of data for 1997 was a heavy thing.\nThe puzzles are very hard, it is still hard now,but, even if you use a walkthrough it still is rewarding to find out how the world works, how the story of atrus and his family and the linking books unfolds.\n\nThe music is the best. Pretty much half of the experience in this game (the first one and this one in fact) is the music. Totally amazing, complements the graphics so well and what happens on screen at times. The graphics by the way, were so amazing in 97 that, still, to this day in some places,  they still seem to be made last week. Of course, in general they've became old, but still, this is a 20 years old game!!! Is like watching a movie from 1996 and thinking that the special effects are not so bad...\n\nNow, that was my review from the original game. Now to some things from actual steam/gog version i am reviewing and why i post a negative review.\n\nWhile i was happy to be able to have a newer build of this classic game, wich i can download from steam and install in modern OS everytime i want. i did encountered certain problems, wich are not acceptable even if it is an old game.\nFirst, the game crashes in certain contexts, certain situations. Like for example clicking too fast when moving around (wich of course didn't happen in the original version) While i know that if i don't click too fast i will probably avoid these crashes, still is something that should be taken care of. Specially knowing that the creators and the company of this game (cyan) still exists and should be made aware of this and take care of the problem. Second, in certain situation when saving, your game can crash, during the saving screen... (if you don't use the save buttons).\nAlso, third, and most catastrophic, there is a scene in game, where you have to turn on a light in a passage. When you do that, and you turn around, either the game crashes or takes you to a previous screen.... this is unavoidable. There is anyway, a way to continue through the passage after turning on the light (without crashing) so i finished the game luckily, but i already knew what to do there, i don't know what i could have done if it were my first time playing it, and didn't knew what to do there. This is something that happens at least in a win 7 64 environment and should be fixed, if not they are essentialy selling you a broken game. This is why i will not recommend this game, at least this version on steam and gog (the same). It is a shame, there was an interesting game...somewhere, there, but now it is too old, and its broken in someplaces so... (you could say that, ironically,  the game, the same as the fifth age in riven, have become full of fissures everywhere....how sad...)","March 14","false","9.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

However it's all in service of a visual and storytelling richness that takes me right back to the days when I was playing this on quintuple CD-ROM.\n\nWord of warning that the game is pretty much stuck in its original 640x480 resolution, I'd recommend playing it windowed, or adjust program resolution in compatibility options. Supposedly there are compatibility issues with W7 but I haven't experienced any problems in that department.","July 6, 2014","true","3.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The original game is amazing.

I reached a point where I got caught in a bug where if I turned around I would get relocated to a different part of the level. This bug blocked me from making further progress in the game because I needed to press a button that I could not get to. I am stuck and it is impossible to make further progress and I have only played through about 1/3rd of the game. I even tried starting over but I keep running into the same bug.\nAlso, the game crashes once about every 45 minutes.

If you played the games back as a kid, you know this, and you're not here to hear about the plot - you're checking out those compatibility issues everyone is complaining about.\n\nAs it says above, Riven is not compatible on XP whatsoever. I played it on 7 and it was absolutely riddled with crash bugs, to the point where it was completely unplayable. I later upgraded to Windows 8, and have gotten halfway through the game with absolutely no errors - it runs flawlessly. Transitions between screens are quick, video files play without a hitch, and I haven't been booted back to the desktop once, no matter how much I try and simulate a crash as they'd happen on my Windows 7 laptop.\n\n(along those lines, I was able to play Steam's version of Myst on both 7 and 8 and have thus far had no issues)\n\nSo, in short, buy this if you have a Windows 8 machine. I've heard that with a lot of fiddling, you can force the game to run on 7, but if you're like me, you'd rather just have it run from the getgo.

Atrus has just returned from Myst island and he asks the stranger (you) to travel to Riven; a world gradually falling apart, where his wife Catherine is imprisoned. While Atrus makes hasty edits to Riven's master book to hold the world together you must find out what happened to Catherine and imprison Atrus' corrupt father Gehn.\n\nRiven was the pinnacle point and click adventure game, one of the best games of the genre. It's puzzle design, world building, and storytelling complement each other seamlessly. As you explore you will encounter Gehn's various ploys to govern and awe the Rivenese, you will penetrate the systems he devised to keep himself safe from intruders, evade his henchman who want to capture you, and discover the underground resistance that will aid you.\n\nRiven has aged extremely well in both it's visuals and mechanics. its an unforgettable world that tells a minimal, tight story through it's images and puzzles. The year after Riven was released Half Life burst on the scene and made action game the hot new thing. If Half Life represented the birth of a new type of game Riven was the last act of the old guard, a final masterpiece polished to a mirror shine. This game took advantage of new technology to perfect its genre and as the last great adventure game before their decline it's too good to miss.","June 4","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you help atrus he tells you he may help in getting you back to where you came from (it's funny when you read the myst books) so you journey on to riven with no linking books,many puzzles ahead and a very detailed and interesting world awaits.\n\nI would recommend playing REALMYST before playing riven,i would also recommend you avoid the newer rerelease of myst as it's a mess and if i were to choose a version of myst to play,it would always be realmyst over the original,when it comes to riven,like myst and realmyst there are problems on newer computers and windows 7,most of these problems are fixed by changing the .exe of both games compatibility to windows xp and also choosing administrator when launching both games,however on riven you will face two problems,first your game sometimes will lock up so you MUST save often,second\nproblem is that your gamesave can sometimes corrupt,so save often and save to two slots each time you save the game\nand you WILL get through the game from start to finish.\n\nLike the game before,riven is a fantastic game filled with atmosphere,it's a very taxing but relaxing game and also highly rewarding,this game is no walk in the park and you should expect to get stuck many times,there is no shame in googling a helping hand at riven from time to time,just don't spoil it ! even with it's age it has lost none of it's charm and will always be a game dear to me.\n\nOn a final note,i recommend you play myst then look out for the myst books in an online book store,the three myst books are available in paper and digital form,after reading those books you will be itching to jump into riven and i am sure your eyes will be open to the amazing worlds of myst,the ages and the lore.\n\nThe ending has not yet been writen\n","June 24, 2014","true","121.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you can get through the game without needing to refer to a guide I have to admit you are far better at solving puzzles and mysteries than me. Riven is brutal about NOT telling you where to go at times and a number of critical clues can easily be overlooked. I would recommend having a pen and paper handy on your desk to take notes of things you see, read and hear. Furthermore I'll give you one really big suggestion for one section of the game; a pair of doors you open cover over passages you need to find. Close them again once you have passed through to see the passages. It is games like this which make you realize how easy modern game developers go on players these days when it comes to puzzles. If you like a good story, enjoy logic puzzles and have patience I'd highly recommend this game despite its antique graphics.","July 17, 2014","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No question.\nI purchased it on steam since my CD's are, well, destroyed from improperly being stored.\nThis game has bugs. Large ones. It destroys your gaming experience.\nIt's important to note that the original version of the game did not contain these issues, it appears to be steam related.\nFor example, you cannot effectively read the journals as a single mouse click enters 2 page turns. Since the journals are a part of the game play, having you click back and forth while trying to keep your eyes in the same position to read a few more words is - well, it's frustrating and makes you hate. Hate leads to fear, fear leads to the dark side, next thing you know, you have JJ Abrams giving you a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ playing a Darth Vader wannabe who doesn't look ANYTHING like his parents, and JJ telling you "no I didn't copy the other movie, Rey isn't a skywalker and Luke will not say to 'I am your father', and Cumberbatch is DEFINITELY not Khan. Nope. I don't do remakes, and I thought of the name 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' long before it was an internet fan film in 2006, so no, I didn't copy that either" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\nOk, so I'm still mad at TFA being a remake..... and I'm taking it out on this remake.\nRemakes are stupid. So am I for buying this before reading any reviews.\nDon't be like me, read the reviews and go by "THE TALOS PRINCIPLE" instead.

You do that by pressing CTRL-S, and load your save by pressing CTRL-O. Laughably arcane now, but there you are. It's funny to accidentally press ALT and bring up a menu bar in an IMMERSIVE!!!!! game like this.\n\nThe graphics still look pretty good, though primitively implemented. It's cool to look at and listen to. It's too bad the game is so stupid-hard. Glancing at a strategy guide periodically is necessary not to know what to do but just to make sure you're going in generally the right direction. It's important to keep in mind that each of the islands is not its own isolated puzzle, like Myst's four Ages; you go back and forth a TON. If you don't like backtracking, do not play this game. I guarantee you will hate it.\n\nActually, there's lots of reasons to hate this game. Nigh-invisible buttons and pathways you have to click-hunt for? Check. Missing obvious things because the interface won't let you look at them? Check. Unlike Myst, you have to really know the tropes and techniques of adventure games to play it without guidance. When you get stuck, boredom sets in quickly. And the hell of it is, sometimes you don't know you're stuck, and you wander around trying minute variations on the same things over and over again to no visible effect. The feeling of progression is totally absent. And in the end everything you do is just in search of codes to a few combination locks.\n\nWhen this was originally released it came on 5 CDs. FIVE. That was way cool to me back then but I never managed to get very far and now I'm starting to remember why.

Period.  Riven and the Myst series has so much lore and and huge world to explore.  Riven hasn't aged well to today's standards but don't let that dissuade  you from purchasing this classic gem.  Riven has extremely hard puzzles to master unless you use a walkthrough of course. If you haven't played Myst yet then I reccomend playing that first as you won't know what's going on in Riven.\n\nSummary:\nStarting some time after the conclusion of Myst, you, the traveller return to Myst Island to meet Atrus at his request.  Once there, Atrus informs you about his father Gehn and how Gehn kidnapped his wife Catherine in a world called Riven.  He asks you to go to Riven and rescue her.  A truly epic adventure to undertake.  Once on Riven you discover its inhabitant's are only slaves to Gehn who has escaped to another world due to the destabilization of Riven.  The inhabitants of Riven despise Gehn and will try to help the traveller to capture him.\n\nConclusion:\nRiven was the greatest adventure game of its time when it released a few years after Myst.  It was twice the size of Myst and came on multiple CD's which the player how to swap out every time they traveled to another island on Riven.  The puzzles are hard and require you to make diagrams to solve most of them.  This game is definatly NOT for the impatient player that can't stand drawing things and writing down names.  One of the puzzles requires you to know the D'ni alphabet and number system.  For this, you have to write it down.  This never detered me however, because the lore is so much better in Riven then in Myst.  You truly feel like you are the lone survivor on in a world with so much lore and history.","February 12, 2014","true","14.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Riven has not depreciated with age (expecting in graphics resolution).  Its concepts are keen, art is great (even in 'primitive' resolution), acting is over adequate, and the puzzles are fantastic.  If you like playing games with your brain, play Riven.\nIf you haven't played Myst ever or just recently, you should do that first.  I recommend 'realMyst: Masterpiece'.  Is nice.\nThe steam release is a bit buggy but it can be finagled to run with almost no problems.  In Win7, just run in compatibility mode for 98/Me, check all the 'disable' option under Settings and also 'run as administrator'.  You may also find it necessary to name your new save files with completely different characters.  With just that done I had only minor trouble opening saves during play and exiting.  Also at one place in the game I encountered a teleportation glitch that I have found no solution for but can be worked around very easily.  Once you encounter it, go back to where it happened and "do the stuff at the place" then "after it happens again", go back again but "go slow this time and not all the way". See, problem solved.\nAlso to fix this stuff some people have suggested using some sort of folder shenanigans.  These can be traced through the forums.  I did not need them.  Also there are many who say the GOG release is hardly to not at all buggy.  I don't know those people.\n","May 31, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, if you enjoy making sketches and solving complicated puzzles like learning the D'Ni language and numbering system; Riven is a wonderful game to fill that particular void.\nThe Steam version is possibly buggy and save games get corrupted easily but it's not too difficult to start over and get back to where you had left off due to how the game mechanics work. It can be annoying but not enough to stop me from playing.\nFinally, the Myst universe is quite beautiful and if find yourself playing try to appreciate everything it has to offer.","December 13, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was addicting, puzzling, and all around beautiful. We've beaten the game several times, and to our dismay, it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. So when I heard that there were FOUR MORE Myst games. I had to take serious action. I brought Riven for 4 bucks and its been worth every cent.\n\nNot only does it resurrect many of the old timeless features of Myst, (Click on the hidden objects etc.) but adds new ones as well. The graphics, (while a bit outdated) are stunning. Considering they were made with the modern technology of their time. The puzzles never cease to confuse me. Which I suppose is what you look for in a good puzzler. Overall, the game play mechanics, the beautiful images, and the brilliantly designed puzzles, makes Riven live up to the good name Myst erected.\n\nHowever, the game doesn't work perfectly on Windows 7 unfortunately. Frequent crashes and game freezes aren't unheard of. But I suppose it wasn't really designed for an operating system as complex as Windows 7. ;-;  To avoid loosing your precious game progress, I recommend saving whenever you get the chance. Trust me, I've had my share of rage quits from a game-progress-deleting-crash. (GPDC)\n\nGPDC aside, I recommend a pen and paper, an event-less lazy weekend, a bag of chips, and occasional breaks. To fully enjoy this masterpiece of a game.\n\nSince this game wasn't designed for Windows 7, i'll put aside my crashing con. Aside from that, there's not that much else wrong with this game. I'll give it a  9.8/10","January 1, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","3"

Worked really well on my Windows 8.1 which was a big concern. I think it only crashed on me once in 12 hours of play and I ran into one bug that wasn't a huge deal so those concerned with stability you should be fine. Riven as a game is great and has an amazing story (play MYST first or the story will be lost on you.) Some of the puzzels in this game were insane. I REALLY don't like to use guides for a puzzle game (because that kills the fun right?) In some cases I felt as though a guide was needed. Even after having looked through a guide once I was stuck near one of the final puzzels part of the solution was "you need to guess this part" which I found silly seeing as how every other puzzle in both Myst and Riven you could work out logically.

However, I do not reccomend downloading this game from Steam if you are running anything modern. Save your six dollars and buy something that will actually work. I thought this would be fun to play without switching discs as you did when playing the five disc version of 1997; but again, it doesn't work. The 1.4 hours I have logged as play time has all been the first cut scene over and over again as it crashes directly after. Although one time I did get to actually walk before it eventually crashed. I have tried using a VirtualBox but that was too complicated to figure out for a game that is planning on a re-release (with no set release date) and if you would like to look into that it can be found by searching for the Starry Expance Project on your browser. Please only read on if you have the five disc version of the game, have a system that runs Mac OSx, and cannot wait any longer for "realRiven" which has already been in the making for over six years.\n\nWhen looking for ways to play my Riven discs again without getting a VirtualBox for Windows 95, I stumbled apon a thing called "Riven X." Now either I'm the stupidest person on earth, or the page which origonally hosted Riven X no longer supports downloads. Either way, just by searching for a download, I found it. After finishing the download all I had to do was put the discs into my computer and it automatically copied all the files into the program. I never have to switch discs again and it looks very good and functions so very smoothly. I highly reccomend this way of playing. At least until the remake, realRiven, is released (which will be on Steam)! Good luck!","April 15, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Worked really well on my Windows 8.1 which was a big concern. I think it only crashed on me once in 12 hours of play and I ran into one bug that wasn't a huge deal so those concerned with stability you should be fine. Riven as a game is great and has an amazing story (play MYST first or the story will be lost on you.) Some of the puzzels in this game were insane. I REALLY don't like to use guides for a puzzle game (because that kills the fun right?) In some cases I felt as though a guide was needed. Even after having looked through a guide once I was stuck near one of the final puzzels part of the solution was "you need to guess this part" which I found silly seeing as how every other puzzle in both Myst and Riven you could work out logically.

It was addicting, puzzling, and all around beautiful. We've beaten the game several times, and to our dismay, it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. So when I heard that there were FOUR MORE Myst games. I had to take serious action. I brought Riven for 4 bucks and its been worth every cent.\n\nNot only does it resurrect many of the old timeless features of Myst, (Click on the hidden objects etc.) but adds new ones as well. The graphics, (while a bit outdated) are stunning. Considering they were made with the modern technology of their time. The puzzles never cease to confuse me. Which I suppose is what you look for in a good puzzler. Overall, the game play mechanics, the beautiful images, and the brilliantly designed puzzles, makes Riven live up to the good name Myst erected.\n\nHowever, the game doesn't work perfectly on Windows 7 unfortunately. Frequent crashes and game freezes aren't unheard of. But I suppose it wasn't really designed for an operating system as complex as Windows 7. ;-;  To avoid loosing your precious game progress, I recommend saving whenever you get the chance. Trust me, I've had my share of rage quits from a game-progress-deleting-crash. (GPDC)\n\nGPDC aside, I recommend a pen and paper, an event-less lazy weekend, a bag of chips, and occasional breaks. To fully enjoy this masterpiece of a game.\n\nSince this game wasn't designed for Windows 7, i'll put aside my crashing con. Aside from that, there's not that much else wrong with this game.

No way around it. It's an old game and just doesn't play nice with modern OS's. Plus - and this sounds kind of nuts, most modern computers are too fast for the experience to be the same as it used to be. What I mean by that is that even the slowest modern gpu/cpu combos will cause the transitions to happen about 600% faster than they did on Win95/98. Even if you have the transitions on the slowest/fade. The result is that you are simply not going to get the original experience.\n\nSo - what we have here is a buggy mess that can barely play and when it works - still doesn't deliver the slow/atmospheric experience that it gave us over a decade ago. I would recommend following the progress of the Starry Expanse Project, which is aiming to re-build the game in a 3d engine ala Real Myst. It won't be done any time soon, but playing that when it's done will likely get a lot closer to the original feel than wasting money or time on this.\n\nIt makes me immensely sad to down-vote my favorite game of all time... but such is the reality of this product in 2015.","May 14, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

My friend gave it to me because one of the disks was broken. Even though I couldn't go to one of the islands, I still had a blast exploring the ones I could get to, and piecing together what I could of the story. That's how good this game is! I had fun, even though I never got to the ending, and never experienced 1/5th of the entire game! Unfortunately, I can't reccomend buying it on steam. It's a good price for a great game, but unless you still have the same computer from 1998, or for some reason never updated past windows 2000 it probably won't run properly. It suffers from frequent CTD's, huge lag spikes, and many other issues. IF you are dead set on getting it, remember to save liberally, like every few minutes.","December 20, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Myst must be played beforehand.  My only complaint is that saving is a pain (research keyboard shortcuts before starting) and I've hit some tough graphical gliches.","December 27, 2011","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this with my dad when I was 7 (or more realistically, he let me watch him play), and I remember the graphics being excellent. turns out they do not hold up to the test of time, but the puzzles definitely do. This game has the most interesting and exciting puzzle experience I've ever had. And I only had to use the Universal Hint System page a few times! If you like puzzles and aren't put off by old graphics and don't mind tweaking settings a bit to get it working without crashing, then this is an amazing game. Make no mistake, it's old, but it's one of my new favorites!\n\nMake sure to have a notebook handy, sketching out diagrams and taking notes is absolutely nescessary.","May 4","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
