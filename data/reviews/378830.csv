The basic story is about a princess who has tobreak a curse she set on herself because she made an agreement with a demon to make the prince love her. (What a Stalker!)\n\nPositives:\n+ It’s $4.99\n+ Graphics are nice, if you like the SNES style\n+ A few randomly funny moments, there's a few side quests, no random enemy encounters,  the combat is quick.\n\nNegatives:\n- Graphical issues: The screen flashes and skips often when walking. This is especially annoying if you set movement speed from walk to run.\n- The story line: It is different and that helps it a little, but there needs to be more to the story and the characters within it.(The story starts with the princess going on a drunken bender and ordering the death of innocent guards for no reason. This does not make for a very likable princess character.)\n- Some basic missing aspects: No armor or weapon upgrades, except for one accessory slot. New spells don’t unlock as you gain levels and each character only has 6-9 skills. Money is mostly irrelevant, since you don't need to buy gear. No world map.\n- Some boring design choices and grinding: So far I have been going from dungeon to dungeon, moving two levers to unlock a boss room, and then killing a boss. Go to the next dungeon and repeat. There are also some difficulty spikes, where you are fine one level and then get crushed the next level. Exploring new areas is not advisable, as you really need to go in the order the game wants or you're going to die.\n\nOther:\n• Not recommended for kids. The majority of the game would be fine for kids but there are occasional, mostly random moments, where the text is pretty all over the place. I am an adult so I can handle it, but it a little unexpected in a cute looking game when a bandit states he going to kill the princess and ♥♥♥♥ her corpse if she comes back.\n\nOverall this game has a few positive aspects but I haven't found enough enjoyable content in this game to make me recommend it. If more content was added and the above mentioned negatives were corrected, it would greatly improve the game and add some charm to it's world. Rating: 5/10\n\n--------------\nGame Tips:\n-To get spells you have to buy them from within the game menu. This is simple but easy to overlook, so go to the skills screen and select learn skills to buy them with journey points.\n-You need to talk to Maota, at the Snowline Port Inn, to be able to fight bandits at the tower and obtain the ship to sail the sea’s.\n\n*This review covers the first 8 hours of gameplay.*","September 6, 2015","false","10.3"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","29","39","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kotih/recommended/378830/","Kotih","Kotih (no w key)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kotih/","327 products in account","I had alot of fun beta testing this game for steam release, would be speedrunners have me to thank for adding 4 hours to their runs, no sequence breaks for you hehe XD\n\nTo start off my review, my opionion of the game was pretty low starting out. The intro gave me the impression that the plot was going to be quite dark. Having a few innocent guards executed near the begining reinforced my suspicions. The gamplay which ill cover later, also bothered me at first and i was almost ready to send the game back and not play anymore. That said, I am glad i pushed past that, as overall i realy enjoyed the game. It just took some warming up to. The plot was not nearly as dark as the intro made it feel for me.\n\nGameplay Mechanics(7/10): There were a few mechanics that irked me while playing, Such as entirely disabling dash in any combat area, making navigating already comquered areas much slower. or that Shop items never change, the price just goes up with your level, making it harder and harder to purchase everything. I ended up just not bothering to use consumable items and found it easier to grind till the area couldnt hurt me.\n\nThere were also some mechanics i loved in the game, such as the ability to swap out your entire party once per combat, even boss battles, this has saved me many times. As you progress and unlock more skills the initially dull encounters start becoming very fun and engaging, there are so many ways to play your party strategically. The skills make the battles, as other than an accessory that allows double turns, most equipment in the game is rather dull and pointless. there are only accessories, armor and weapon do not change. also strange how many characters fight with some variation of fisticuffs.\n\nGraphics: The engine used to create a game is not an excuse for the quality of the game. As with most RPGM games I feel i cant really even grade this catagory, other than the "retro feel" it does not stand up to current industry standards, though its what you will see in most RPGM games.\n\nCharacters(9/10): I very much enjoyed the banter between characters and the personality of each one, and no character felt worthless in my party so the battle balance was well done. the only flaw i find is there isnt enough screen time to showcae these characters, and few of them grow past what they start as.\n\nStory(8/10): I feel this could have been much more than it was. while i did end up enjoying it quite a bit, there are alot of gaps between story moments, and the story moments were short and sweet. I do feel the needless deaths of countless guards was a bit much compared to the light heartedness of the story that follows. I started off with a negetive bias but enjoyed the game enough to get back into the story, and i feel that while too short, it was a good story.\n\nOverall: not without its flaws and frustration, but far better than a great many other games out there, and overall quite enjoyable even with the issues. Dont expect the next bioshock 2 out of it, but dont pass it up either.\n\nEDIT:\nIn light of the recently released deluxe version, im afraid my overall opinion of this game has dropped conciderably. making 3 in game skills only available by spending extra money is kinda messed up. x.x","July 30, 2015","true","46.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","2"

Things didn't turn out well as planned and Aerin has to travel through the world with her companions and defeat 5 different demons, each representing a different dark part of the princess to be able to break out of her curse and clear her husband's possession.\n\nFor an open-world RPG, the game is relatively easy to finish, with an estimated playtime of around 15 hours and doesn't require much grinding for experience levels or loot drops. The combat is simple and very consistent, with every character using the same weapon from start to end of game and only one optional jewellery slot to protect against a special negative effect or to enhance a certain combat ability. There are very few instances of failed or missed combat abilities or magic not working on allies or enemies that have no special resistance to that form of attack. The only con is the scaling up of prices for potions and elixirs with character level, which reduces the motivation to grind for loot and hoard 99 units of potions or elixirs. Among the side-quests available in the game, they are short and all can be completed without too much travelling or grinding for specific high-quality mob loot.\n\nThe graphics and soundtracks are great, it would have been nice if the game allows the take screenshot button on Steam to work. The deluxe edition is recommended when at discount as it includes the OST and the strategy guide which is needed to finish certain side-quests that require travelling to a specific area.","March 30","true","17.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/378830/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","Very good, but rather short JRPG. The music in this little gem is really great. One of the best soundtracks I've listened to in a while. The graphics are rather standard for an RPG Maker game, but some effects and a distinct set of tiles for each location creates a pleasant to look at game. The story isn't very deep, but it's well written and gives enough background.\n\nThe gameplay isn't without flaws though. There's the odd auto leveling of prices for inns and items. I guess it's meant to balance out the higher rewards you get from stronger enemies, but it just feels wrong. The other thing that is worth mentioning is the 'streamlined' equipment. There's only one accessory slot to equip something and the selection of equipable items only covers protection against the various status effects, more HP or MP and a small boost to attack. There's only one special accessory that you can get for completing a side quest. At least two slots and a bit more variation could have helped here.\n\nThe enemy variety and the boss fights are again very good. You won't find any 'recolored' enemies in this game. Each area/dungeon has its unique set of enemies and you will need a bit of strategy to get past them. The overall difficulty isn't very high, but it's not a casual game either. Make sure you save up enough potions before you enter any boss fights.\n\nThe game is only 15 hours long (including all side quests) and there's not that much to discover outside of the main path. A good amount of that time is grinding for levels as the lack of equipment forces you to make up for it by leveling your characters. It doesn't get too boring though even if the dungeons don't hold any surprises. You hunt for a switch or two and figure out which paths are dead ends. That's pretty much it. Still the game doesn't feel boring because the dungeons don't drag on too much and as mentioned above each location feels unique.\n\nOverall it's a very solid JRPG with a bit wonky gameplay mechanics, but a beautiful soundtrack, a good variety of locations and enemies and an entertaining story. Well worth the 5 bucks.","November 25, 2015","true","19.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Those were the first words to greet me into this game after some rather awkward form of configuration. Just like how you don't hang out at alcoholics anonymous meetings for a laugh, don't come to this game expecting a documentary style affair. Don't come into this game expecting a lot, it saves a lot of disappointment in the long run.\n\nWell, as if that little statement didn't give away my opinion on this. I should elaborate. The Princess' Heart is a story written from the perspective of an adolscent girl and like everyone's early work, this is just awful.\n\nThe princess herself is a brat. Totally irredeemable. The captain has no backbone. These two are introduced to us and are just flat out unlikable, how does one get invested in the story when the characters themselves actively fight your interest if you decide to give it a chance? You are punished for starting a new game.\n\nIt doesn't get any better from there. Bland plot points, one dimensional characters and just poor mapping. The game uses RTP which is included in RPG Maker and the built in character generator for the character sprites and faces. I maintain there is nothing wrong with that, however when you have a place called a Ridge, why is it suddenly floating in the sky?\n\nThe world itself feels empty. Characters sprouting the some few lines as nauseum. In a dungeon, there may only be a few things to interact with, some treasure chests and a switch or two if you're lucky. No flavour text, just events important to the plot and that's it. Here's another map you have to walk through until you get to the next non-interactive moment. A > B > C. Perhaps it opens up afterwards, I don't know. I doubt I'm going to find out.\n\nIf you recall the beginning of this "review", I mentioned some configuration. You are asked how you would like to play and you are then warned to not press the F12 key as that will reset the game. It does not, it does however crash the game. You can also change the window colour in the options menu however the audio system? Doesn't work. I changed all values to 0% and still had everything at the same volume it was earlier.\n\nIn short, it's a cliche ridden mess, full of unlikable characters with menus that achieve nothing. The music isn't too bad and the auto-save feature is non-intrusive.","August 30, 2015","false","2.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It was their third commercial game, after successes like Whisper of a Rose and Sweet Lily Dreams (both available through Steam). It does not share the same universe as those games and looks and feels more like a traditional JRPG.\n\nThe Princess’ Heart has a nice plot, if a bit short, however its characters make up for it quite well. I found them very unexpected and they often surprised me. There’s 9 party members in total, one of which is optional. I would have liked to see some more party interaction.\n\nGraphics are pretty standard, but used wisely and correctly in my opinion. It also feels more traditional, because of the standard graphics.\n\nAs for gameplay, there’s no difficulty modes, but as the battles are well balanced and the monsters don’t respawn until you’ve left the dungeon completely, it doesn’t feel necessarily. I liked that I could change the party formation easily, which is quite necessary as most battles require you to do so.  Some of the dungeons are mazes and loop, which I quite enjoyed as a challenge.\n\nAll in all I recommend this game to every strategic RPG lover.\n","July 30, 2015","true","18.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/378830/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","The Princess' Heart is the latest game by RosePortal Games to come on Steam and just like its predecessors, Sweet Lily Dreams and Whisper of a Rose, it's definitely worth buying and playing.  I had a chance to beta test this game, too, so I can convey a pretty good idea of what it's like.\n\nUnlike RosePortal's other games, The Princess' Heart doesn't take place in the same universe as those games.  That's why the feeling from this game is quite different from those.  For me, I found the gameplay to be somewhat more challenging but then that could be because it did take some adjusting on my part.  There is only one difficulty level to play so you have to take that into account when battling monsters, bosses, and whatnot.  There are aspects of this game that I did like.  Unlike SLD and WoaR, TPH (The Princess' Heart-I'll use abbreviations to make references much easier to type) has more party members available to you as you progress through the game.  In SLD and WoaR, you were pretty much stuck to four party members.  However, in TPH, you can have a total of 8 party members.  Of course, you can only have 4 members battle at a time so it's up to you to choose which ones will do the battling for you.  I tend to have a preference for certain types of party members so I tend to stick to the same 4 (for the most part).  However, like in other RosePortal Games, this one does have quests and once you complete quests, you earn experience points which benefits everyone, regardless of whether they're in your active party or not.  Also, upon leveling up, instead of automatically learning a new spell, you earn journey points (JP).  Using them, you can choose what spells for your members to learn so it's important to choose wisely.\n\nOverall, I found the game to be quite fun and challenging at the same time.  The storyline is pretty good and there is character growth for the main character, which I find to be a positive aspect when it comes to narrating a story.  I'd definitely recommend giving The Princess' Heart a try and adding it to your Steam library.  ^^","July 31, 2015","true","30.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

A cursed princess on a journey to save herself and find true love.\nCould be interesting, only that there is much interaction between the characters...and the NPC's.\n\nSound: OK.\n\nGameplay:  Well, of course there is grinding. Much grinding. Thats because your characters can only equip one item.\nONE.  And in the game there is only ONE item worth to be equipped...you get it after a sidequest.\nSidequests...only a very few. Most of them are bring me x-items...and the rewards are not worth the trouble.\nOf course your characters can learn skills. After you level up and solving one of the quests you get points you can spend\nfor new skills. But again there are only a very few skills. Halve way through the story you have learned all skills.\nOf those skills you'll only use one or two for each character.\nFor winning fights you get exp. and some items you can sell. No money gained. Not a big problem, because the only\ntime you need it is for resting in an inn...oh, you could spend it for potions, but you'll find enough in chests.\nThe price for resting and potions goes up with every level your party gained.\nOf course you gain access to an ship and balloon. Now don't get excited. There are no hidden locations to explore.\nAlso there are no hidden passages in dungeons.\nThe only problem you may encounter is finding one or two switches.\nAND there is no map. Not a big problem. The dungeons are small. And the world only has a few locations.\nIf you rush you can finish the game in 6 - 8 hours.\n\nIs it worth playing?

It was a pleasant surprise to hear the intro music and the music for each locale. Each of tracks to the locations represented each location's "feel" and theme very well. The music is very well made that it somehow stuck itself in head like bumping 90's track.\nMinor gripe: A certain enemy type that has a high pitched battle intro sound, that's all.\n\nCharacters\nAs it is a game with a party system, you can expect variation in each character's strength and weakness.\nAs for me I can't seem to work out the importance/strength of this one character that you will encounter in one of the first few locales. So I will usually alternate between every other character to play to their strengths when encountering different enemies except for this one character.\nBanter/Interactions between characters is what makes them memorable. However I felt that it toned down a tad bit as the game progresses.\n\n\nGameplay\nBattles have a turn-based combat system reminiscent of other RPG-Maker games (which isn't a bad thing necessarily)\nWhere you have the general "attack", "special/magic", "guard" moves etc and also to which you can try to escape from combat when things turn sour.\nAfter each combat it will yield you with experience points and items that the enemy drops. These items then can be sold to acquire potions, rings etc.\nA minor gripe: The item system, you will find yourself selling a lot of those item drops from battles because it doesn't have any use to them. If you play too much RPG games you might find yourself feeling that more could be done with those items, such as a crafting system where you can make special potions, enchant a ring or something along those lines. But if you can overlook that aspect then there won't be an issue at all.\n\nSince the game does not have any difficulty settings, I was surprised to see certain locations that has really challenging enemies if you happen to enter those locations a little to early. So do expect a small portion of the game to level up your characters before you progress into a new area or you would find your party decimated over and over.\n\nGetting into this game to beta test it, I was expecting (not hoping) to encounter certain bugs or maybe even a typo here and there in the dialogue. However much to my surprise, there wasn't any bugs encountered which was breath of fresh air, wish the same thing can be said about my house.\n\nGraphics\nAs with other RPG-Maker games you get what you see in terms of the graphics of the game.\nThe art style is up at the standard of other good RPG-Maker & Visual Novels you can think of.\n\nStory\nDon't let the initial cliché start of the story stop you from playing as it gains momentum as the minutes tick by. The initial cliché start will be a distant memory as story pans out.\nA good note to take is that I expected the game to on the range of 6-8 hours but that doesn't seem to be the case as it is rather longer than I had expected but that could also vary from each player's play style.\n\nOverall\nFor a person who is easily put off from an RPG-Maker game like how some people are put off with pixel graphics games, I would say to give this game a shot if you're open to trying and giving a game of this nature a chance and who knows you might be finding yourself having some fun relaxing time in this game.\nThe minor gripes stated above is based on personal preference that can be overlooked and vary from person to person.\nBut with a game that is fundamentally & mechanically well made as this, its hard to not recommend it.","July 31, 2015","true","17.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","2"

The battle system was interesting, but I didn't like how the price of everything went up as you got higher levels. Also the drop rate for the HQ items should have been higher. I would give this game a 6/10.","September 28, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're expecting a goody two shoes, kind, loving, sings to animals type of Princess this is not the game for you!  This is not your fairy tale Princess!  The more I played this game the more I disliked the main character not only because she was rude, selfish, vain, arrogant, manipulative, murderous and an alcoholic but she lacked depth or any likeability to begin with.  This game had promise and I was very excited to play it but it let me down quite painfully after the first five minutes into the game I was literally groaning and going, no don't do it!\n\nAlso the boring fighting and the characters that when you spoke to them would go ..... as they had literally nothing to say to your character but just to look pretty was also a huge disappointment.  The prizes you got from the battles were just as boring as there is only so many feathers you can pick up as your party members would constantly repeat themselves with quotes, I am not to old when lvled up or can I keep that, when you found a feather or eyeball of a monster you just killed.\n\nThis game could be so much more if the characters were actually likeable and you cared for them and their outcomes, and the main protagonist wasn't so cruel and selfish that you start out not liking her immediatly.  Also there were no markers showing me where to go and I ended up just wondering around for an hour wondering where I was going.  Personally if I was the developer I would not put this game up for sale but have it for free or at least make this game something that is memorable to sell.  Not the worse rpger game I have ever played and I have played many but definately not something I would recommend in its current state.","January 27","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I use RPG Maker myself so I did recognize quite a bit of the RTP art, however, it is used very well. The music in the game is also great.\n\nBut I, like many other reviewers, immediately hated the princess character. I'm about an hour and a half in and I have yet to have a reason to care for this character.\n\nI am also taking a break tonight from it because I have been going back and forth throughout the same dungeon to flip switches on opposite sides (you can't get switch A until you hit switch B and switch A lets you go onward into the dungeon (the stairs for which are back on the other side) so after clearing the enemies this makes for a rather dismal walk back and forth. Not looking forward to doing this multiple times, I hope some of the later dungeons are better laid out.\n\nThe game gives me a couple good ideas for "do's" and "don't's" for videogame design. I'll probably shelve this one for now, might play it during some down time.","February 13","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
