"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/262980/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Yotsuba aka Clover-TAC is the man behind doujin danmaku darling Crimzon Clover. This game is not just the result of five years of hard work. Yotsuba is phenomenal at shmups, has world records in Cave's ESP RA.DE, and worked as a tester on Arika's Playstation 2 port of Dodonpachi Daioujou. In short, he knows his stuff.\n\nSo, aspiring shmup developers, is all this really necessary? Do you have to be a 2D shooter God in order to make a good game in the genre? Not everyone has that level of dedication, I understand that. But if Artnumeris put forth even 1% the effort Yotsuba did, maybe C-RUSH wouldn't have turned out to be such a horrible pile of bull-♥♥♥♥. I've read a number of reviews for this game. Most of them say they couldn't even get the game to run. I guess they lucked out. Playing C-RUSH will ruin a perfectly good day.\n\nThe first thing that set off my "uhoh this game is booty" alarm is the way the ship moves. When moving forward, the ship looks like its v-sync is screwed up and it glitches out as a result. This doesn't affect the game, but it looks really poor. What does affect the game is the hitches and pauses. The first achievement you'll get is for attaining an 8x multiplier. When I got the achievement the screen juddered for a half-second. I brushed it aside at first, because sometimes achievements can cause ever-so-slight hang-ups during the game. As it turns out, this happens everytime I hit that multiplier. Stuttering is a constant in this game.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT ALL!\nThe weapon-system makes no sense. The player-ship has two fire modes, single-fire or twin-cannons. All players are going to choose the mode that offers more fire-power. This game tries to force the single-fire on you, by lining certain enemies up in a particular way, or making exceptionally tight corridors. This really doesn't work. You know what also doesn't work? Giving the weapons some weird ammo system. You have to touch this strange gas to recharge your weapons, or else the fire-rate goes down. All this nonsense does is handicap the player.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT ALL!\nYour ship has a shield of sorts. It recharges very quickly, but you won't survive more than two hits or a collision. From what little of this game I could stand, it isn't exactly clear how much damage a bullet does. Your shield has five blips, but a bullet can take 2 or 3 or 4? It doesn't make any sense. When your shield is drained, a high-pitched warning siren that is much louder than anything else in the game assaults you. I'm being completely serious here, don't play this game while wearing head-phones.\n\nBUT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT ALL!\nThe difficulty balance in this game is a complete mess. The beginning of stage 1 is snore-inducing, but then a mecha-scorpion shows up and throws more bullets on-screen than you'll see for the entirety of stage 2. Off-screen enemies will also continually fire at you, and there's nothing you can do about that. Even though the game gives you 9 lives and a shield of questionable effectiveness, you're probably going to lose it all to the mecha-scorpion. This guy is a mountain of bull-♥♥♥♥. First off his attack pattern consists of a steady stream of lasers. He never lets up, and the waves of fire are more intense than anything prior to this fight. You're going to be completely unprepared for this fight, simply because you never got the mental training.\n\nOH NO! THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ♥♥♥♥ING ALL!\n\nDuring this fight, you're moving backwards, and there are objects to run into such as walls. Hanging as far away from the boss as possible, isn't really a viable tactic. Furthermore, after you destroy the scorpion's claws and tail armor, he doubles up on the lasers. What was originally a really tight fit is now practically impossible. Luckily there's a safe spot if you hang out just under his tail...BUT...without any warning at all the scorpion will rush forward and smash you. There is absolutely no possible way for you to know the scorpion would do that, unless you designed the game. I'm going to guess that C-RUSH didn't have any testers, because anyone would know that such a sudden attack without any warning is awful game-design. The worst part is that just before the fight, a couple of hornets attack the player-ship by flying into it. They actually point out where they're going to go, so the player knows to get out of the way. Before I give too much credit, C-RUSH also doesn't warn the player about enemies approaching from behind.\n\nDon't bother with this game, you'll regret it.\n\nSorry, but when I'm given the choice between writing a mean-spirited review or putting a keyboard through my monitor, I'll choose the review every time.","November 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","37","40","3","2"

I admit I was disappointed at first  to see no mouse compatibility in-game, it's played entirely with keyboard. Just a preference of mine I always hope to see, but I shouldn't be surprised there isn't one here.\nI only encountered one small bug with the in-game pause menu but this may only be an issue for me.\n\nThere is a huge lack of options under the settings with just fullscreen on/off, difficulty, key bindings and one other which I don't know what it is. This doesn't bother me at all, but is something others might want to take into account.\nThere is no customization for your ship whatsoever that I can see. Powerups are temporary and primarily obtained by destroying enemies, otherwise there is no weapon or ship upgrades. You can flip your ship around for slower, more accurate attacks and dodging. The dodging seems forced in some areas however to get you to actually use your ship on it's side, because it's very easy to just leave your ship flat and spam the two, faster guns.\nAlso I didn't seem to notice a scoreboard, though I did notice something about my score being uploaded. I'm not sure if there's a place online to view leaderboards; it would be nice as that is the game's point.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up, why? Because for it's price this game is an amazing grab. The controls are responsive, the game is pleasing to look at; the hit-boxes are forgiving, maybe too forgiving for your enemies, but that can just add to the challenge. So there's only one level? So this is only $2.00 and I think a lot of work went into this for that price despite what it lacks. I'm enjoying this game for what it is, who isn't going to give a game a thumbs up if they're enjoying it?","February 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","1"

There is a blaster fuel bar, which you will have to maintain to keep it on the highest damage level by constantly recharging it with passing the special stations on the go. The controls are your old buddy WSAD or arrows and any button to shoot, but you will have to setup it first, since it’s not comfortable for the user by default. You are tasked to do a normal type of fly and shoot missions with constant obstacles on the way and the epic boss at the end of it all. Might feel a bit hard at the beginning but practice do the wonders. The graphic is surprisingly high. A game will be a new addition for gamers who r into 2d shooters to test their skills, though any gamer might find in it something special for himself to enjoy.","January 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The "feel" is all wrong, nothing moves with any aggression.  The player's shot type is very strange and oddly small, making precision aiming a requirement.  The combo system sucks because there are huge stretches of time where no enemies appear on screen; you're limited to chaining the very simple groups the trot out onto the screen mindlessly.  Maybe it gets better, I couldn't tell, I can only play the game for a minute at a time before it freezes and I have to kill the runaway process from the Task Manager.\n\nI have no idea what the sound design is like, because all I hear is static.  The developer quickly blames this on codec packs and capture software, and the solution is "uninstall them".  Apparently just to presence of these things is enough to cause issues.  Maybe software conflicts made sense in the Win9x days, but there's absolutely no excuse for it today.  The real issue is the audio subsystem he depends on.\n\nSome users report the game boots to a blank screen.  I didn't bother to read the thread on that.\n\nThe game hasn't been updated since it was published.  Considering how the developer is handling feedback on the forums, I wouldn't expect any either.  Syder Arcade is often on sale and is much more interesting than this, I'd recommend taking your money over there.","June 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

Plays great on a control, but with so much grand 2d shooters in the market, this one definetly feels like it was rushed. Hence the name i guess? The first screen looks awesome, and then it stops, moving beehive cells are your background, throughout everywhere, I'm not sure if they really tried to be unique or simply got lazy half ways but same ol enemies bland backgrounds, with really bad powerups make this game very forgetable. Try it if its on sale, it is hard, somewhat. You do get shields and have lives to waste, but if you played bullet hell games, it actually isn't that hard, it just feels so empty when you play it. Maybe if you were high on something might you find this game entertaining, the background sort of pulses and you can shoot some of the level away. Bosses are alright but at just a coupld of them and no checkpoint save system, it feels like a chore to come back to it and pass it, I would rather fish in World of Warcraft than play this anytime soon.","February 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not a great game, for sure, but it's not bad either.  It's nice and solid 'okay.'\n\nThe first time I played this was on a keyboard - other than the menus the game has no mouse support - and admittedly, even with rebinding the keys, I found the controls to be a bit on the clunky side and not as responsive as I would have liked.  I recently added an x-box controller and came back to this game and using the controller instead of keyboard is a world of difference.\n\nA tutorial, or at least a tutorial-esque splash screen, would have been nice.  There are these tanks that shoot out different colored gas and it took a few games until I realized that you're not supposed to avoid the gas but actually go into it to recharge your weapons.\n\nBut as I said, the game is okay.  There is nothing stellar about it but so far nothing horrible either.  I guess the biggest crutch I've seen is I don't see that sense of addictive fun where you're mindlessly popping quarters into the figurative arcade machine to see if you can make it just a little bit further this time.  It's something you play for a little bit and then forget about, and then down the road when you're looking for a shoot-em-up, you can play this one again for a little bit too.\n","January 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
