Or more exactly like a mission pack, with some small additions. Or sequel. Think of Spear of Destiny but less lazy. It's also often mentioned that game remained forgotten due to being Wolf3D-era FPS released after Doom 2.\n\nNo complaints about how this old game runs on Steam. Just one fine DOSBox.\n\nSo yes, what awaits you here is 20 more levels of same Blake Stone goodness. And repetitiveness. This time the level have darker feel to them, less interesting somewhat. They aren't divided into episodes. This time in order to get access to the next level you have to find Detonator and then use it on Security Cube device, that you also have to find in the level. Doesn't feel too different.\n\nPlot is simple at that: They finally found Goldfire and now it's your job to defeat him once and for all, before he built yet another mutant army. Huge plot twist: You actually kill him. Otherwise we would have had ten more sequels where he keeps escaping. He also got whole bunch of new mutants, which are reskin from the first game, and uses bosses of Aliens of Gold as regular weak enemies. Human guards were replaced with aliens, which means that head was edited in their sprites. Or maybe they aren't aliens, Blake Stone story never clarifies whether there are non-human sentient beings in game's universe. Perhaps they just got mutated by Goldfire's order, that would explain why they speak in reverse. Yes, old voice sounds were reversed to make new ones, sounding funny.\nStill more effort than Spear of Destiny.\n\nWeapons were improved as well. At least they aren't so embarrassingly low-resolution as they were, they look pretty now. All detailed, all shaded, all correctly placed in the center of view. Developers went ahead and added yet another weapon, which is like a dual rocket/plasma launcher, shooting explosive plasma balls fast, because, clearly, bosses dying in a single-digit amount of seconds in original game wasn't enough. It's not really useful otherwise, waste of ammo, where normal plasma launcher would do just fine.\n\nIt got all new Soundblaster music as well, which is still fancy. Still fits. Still not rock. Shouldn't be anyway.\n\nBiggest addition to gameplay got to be new map system. This time it's placed in below interface, letting you see it all time without having to pause to stats screen. You can magnify map to 2x or 4x, each with new features, all of which starting to waste "map resource" that you can pick around in levels.\nAt 2x zoom you can now see enemies that you can already see anyway. Doesn't sound too much useful, but Planet Strike now has enemies that are either cloaked (the kind of effect that you can see from mile away as long as you focus on finding them) or transformed as map objects, ready to ambush you, shame that these aren't used often.\nAnd 4x zoom allows you to see secret pushwalls! As you know in Wolf3D era secret pushwall could be anywhere and there was no system that would make you think how to get into secret, only tedious wallpressing. And I think that Planet Strike 4x zoom map system is best solution to making it more fun, making you zoom in in placed where you believe secret could be at the cost of map's energy.\n\nI also encountered bug while playing game. A monster was supposed to drop a Detonator, yet he didn't or it got dropped inside object that couldn't be destroyed. Anyway, watch out for these. If you are lost in a level for more than a half-hour, then perhaps load previous save or die.\n\nPlanet Strike overall plays similarly to Aliens of Gold, it will not change your opinion on Blake Stone. Try it if you liked original, at least this one doesn't drag for 60+ levels.\nThough, it could do more as a sequel. But hey! Some people think that Spear of Destiny is classic sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. I am pretty sure their heads will explode when they learn about Planet Strike.\nWell, ignoring that it came out after Doom 2, that is.","May 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I never got to play the Blake Stone games back then, so I was rather excited to give it a go. The simplest way to decide if you will like it is this: Do you love Wolfenstein 3D? Then, this is for you.\n\nPretty much everything you could expect from Wolfy with some flourish and more story. It is still fun and that's all that matters.","May 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"
