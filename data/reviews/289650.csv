Parkour is easier and more fluid. Combat is the best it's been since AC2, at least. Customization is finally here, and you can completely customize your outfit based on your playstyle. Different weapons with different stats are back for the first time since the Ezio trilogy. Paris is beautiful, massive, and feels alive with all the enterable interiors and all the people in the streets, and the graphics are the best I've ever seen in a video game (including Crysis 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Far Cry 3, GTA V, etc).\n\nThese things all sound great, right? They are. Which is why it's so sad that the game got ruined.\n\nHorrible optimization means almost unplayably awful performance. On both low and max settings I usually get the same FPS, and I've never gotten a constant 60 (for reference, I have an i7-3770k, a GTX 680 SC, and 16GB of RAM).\nBeyond performance in gameplay, performance in cutscenes is usually around 15 FPS.\nA lot of the chests you find in the world require you to log in to a separate companion app on your phone to unlock them, which is completely immersion breaking and really sucks.\nFor some reason, everyone in Paris speaks with a British accent (which is more annoying than it sounds).\nYou're required to go through Uplay, a separate client, to play the game.\nThe co-op often doesn't work because the game can't connect to Uplay.\nThe second thing that shows up when you pause the game, right below "resume," is an option to go pay real money for in game stuff. This ♥♥♥♥ing sucks for a $60 game when micotransactions up to $100 are shoved in your face.\nThe best armor and weapons in the game are locked behind either a real-money paywall or a requirement to use some stupid external companion app.\nThe mini-map is stuffed with so many options that it's almost impossible to find anything useful.\n\nOverall, this game is incredibly disappointing, not only because it follows the amazing Black Flag, but also because it could have been the best AC game ever if it wasn't completely ruined by awful business decisions.\n\nDon't buy this game.","December 30, 2014","false","8.1"," 3,503 of 3,806 people (92%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","92","503","3","85","67"

And I'm not talking about performance issues (which are horrific), I'm not talking about DRM, microtransactions and all other stuff. I'm not even infuriated about the lack of english language in my regional version. Well, I am, sort of, but only because the pre-order clearly stated that all languages are included.\nAnd suddenly after the purchase it isn't, and few hours later store page is updated to reflect this issue.\n\nTHIS.\nIS.\n♥♥♥♥ING.\nFRAUD.\n\nUpdate\n======\nSo I've been trying to resolve this with technical support of Ubi since release, aaaaand… you guessed right! Basically, their answer is: “You can go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, we took your money, we owe you nothing”. Additionally I must mention that support took their time responding. After first response: “We can't help you, go talk to Valve” and me catching them on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (publisher admins store page, not Valve) they waited WHOLE MONTH (even more, 34 days to be exact) to just copy-pase another “We can't help you, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself”.\nIt really amuses me. The price of changing one digital copy for another for a company is a ♥♥♥♥ing ZERO. Yet their support wastes time writing meaningless ♥♥♥♥. And worst of all: there is no other channel of communication. No phone number, no address (though they have regional office, but it's super-duper secret, so I can't even make a complaint about their horrible support).\nYou know what, Ubi? I've had enough of your ♥♥♥♥. I will never ever pay even a single cent for you game, no matter how good it will be. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself — that's my answer. I was a loyal customer for years, I've tolerated your lazy development, bugs and stuff. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me and saying it's raining? You must be really delusional to think you're doing good job. More importanly I will tell every person I know, every friend, every fellow online, when it comes to any of Ubi games, and the person wants to know whether it's good, should he buy it; my answer will be short: Hell no.","December 26, 2014","false","48.1"," 6,083 of 6,675 people (91%) found this review helpful 631 people found this review funny","91","083","6","631","176"

As a history nerd and a huge stealth genre fanboy, these games are always right up my alley.\n\nNow I'll tell you why Assassin's Creed Unity is, flat out, one of the worst games I've played in years, and why it's absolutely unrecommendable to everybody who owns a gaming PC.\n\nI want to start off by saying that I was absolutely hyped for this game. More hyped than any Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2. I had watched a few gameplay videos that sold me due to the fact that the devs seemed to be going for the classic Assassin's Creed experience: An emphasis on stealthy gameplay, an intriguing historical period, and a stripped down approach to weapons and gadgets. It hearkened back to Assassin's Creed II, which is an amazing game and probably the best in the series, closely followed by Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Black Flag.\n\nThe first drawback is the one everybody already knows about: The game is nearly totally broken at this point. Bugs are everywhere, the game hard crashes quite often, and it runs like a dog even on the most beastly of rigs. For me in particular, the most damning graphical drawback was some kind of weird frame stutter that I would experience literally every 4 seconds without fail, even in menus. I'm not sure what's causing this, but the game is nearly unplayable with it unless you're incredibly determined. As you can see, I have managed to bludgeon through several hours of the game, mostly due to its amazing recreation of Revolutionary Paris, which is by far the best aspect of the game. Most of that is wandering about the landscape and gathering collectables, which has been the peak of my enjoyment of the game, because any missions are so difficult to get through thanks to the fact that it's maybe the single most broken game I've played since Obsidian was forced to release Knights of the Old Republic II in it's half-finished state way back in 2004. And that's saying something, because that game was a broken mess.\n\nThere's been enough said about the games broken, poorly optimized state. I'd like to talk about why it would be a bad game even if it were to run beautifully. I'm going to talk about the past couple of AC games here, so bear with me.\n\nI hated Assassin's Creed 3. Absolutely despised it. I thought it was terribly designed. It had muddy control and poor line-of-sight mechanics that often resulted in instant game over detections, it had awfully designed stealth sequences that forced you to follow people at ridiculously close lengths, and it had bad checkpoints that compounded both of those issues. A number of the missions (the midnight ride, the Charles Lee chase sequence) were just horribly designed to the point where they were frustrating. To top it off, the writing was utter trash, all of the characters were cardboard cutouts, and nothing was even worth following.\n\nThen came Black Flag, which was a complete redemption for the series. The game was so much fun, it was beautiful to look at, and, most importantly for me, IT FIXED THE SERIES STEALTH AND GAMEPLAY DESIGN PROBLEMS! Control was smooth. Stealth sequences were designed well. Free running and climbing was nearly bug-free, quick, and intuitive. Trying to achieve 100% stealth in the plantation sequences were probably my favorite missions in the game. Playing Black Flag felt like the Assassin's Creed series had truly taken a step forward, like it was ready to get back to being the stellar franchise that Assassin's Creed II had promised it would be.\n\nEnter Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nThe reason I contrasted AC3 and Black Flag is because playing through Unity gave me the distinct feeling that I was playing a game designed by the AC3 team. It has the same exact pitfalls that I just described in AC3. Controls are muddy and you never truly feel totally in control of Arno. He lumbers to and fro in the vague direction you send him. A cover mechanic has been introduced that's way too sticky, way too close to guesswork, and generally hampers stealth so poorly that I completely stopped  using it except in sequences when the game forces you to. And, to top it off, they've redesigned free running and climbing with a system that seems like it should work beautifully, but fails miserably in every aspect of its execution. The days of your jumping off into odd directions, taking the wrong path up a building, and even inexplicably stopping in place and having to recenter the stick, then hit up again to continue moving HAVE ALL RETURNED FROM ASSASSIN'S CREED II. Seriously, bugs from a game that was made back in 2009 and were just solved last year have miraculously reappeared. How do you ♥♥♥♥ up that badly?\n\nAdd in that the music, something that was unbelievably atmospheric and really made the experience of Florence in Assassin's Creed II, and lent you sea shanties that stuck in your head for hours in Black Flag (and was utterly forgettable at best and terrible at worst in AC3) is absolutely unnoticeable. In fact, I didn't think about it once until, midway through this review, I remembered how much I loved Jesper Kyd's work in AC2. That's how forgettable it is.\n\nThere are also several instances of immersion-breaking content, including chests that are only open via the Unity Companion App, and microtransactions that are so hamfistedly jammed in they pull you right out of the experience. It's a basic example of an immersion murdering mechanic, and it boggles my mind that developers have not learned why you don't do these things in games. Hell, even the publisher and the money people should know why immersion is important for a single player gaming experience. There's no excuse for garbage like this.\n\nYou can also consider Ubi's utter failure to maintain some semblance of business ethics by setting their review embargo to 12:00 PM of release day, rather than the day of or the day before as is common practice. Why would they do this, you say? The only obvious reason that comes to mind is that they knew their game was an unfinished, broken piece of garbage, and they decided that their best course of action was to lie to their customers for as long as possible in order to prevent them from canceling their preorders. Despicable.\n\nIt really disappoints me to tear this game apart so viciously because I've been such a huge fan of the series. I'd like to believe that this was rushed out the door by Ubi, and that the team would eventually have produced a good game if they were given adequate time to have worked on the things that fail here. But at the end of the day, blame lies with the developer as well as the publisher.\n\n"A delayed game is eventually good, a rushed one is forever bad"\n- Shigeru Miyamoto\n\nIn conclusion, there is very little redeeming quality in this game. Unless you're an absolute history nerd or a super hardcore Assassin's Creed fan, this game is completely unrecommendable in its current state. Furthermore, even if the game were totally fixed, even if the graphical issues and the bugs were completely ironed out and the game ran beautifully, this still isn't worth a purchase because it's easily the worst Assassin's Creed and just not a great game period. The dev team here has an eternity of failure to look forward to, as people will forever think of this game as an exemplary pillar of Ubisoft's descent into the basement of video game development and business ethics. Hell, at least Watch Dogs had some interesting mechanics and some competent stealth sequences. This game brings absolutely nothing to the table. Just replay Black Flag instead. Or burn $60 in your backyard while punching yourself in the face, because that's a more valuable, entertaining experience than playing this game will ever be.\n\nSome gameplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlgf4p0AOVY&ab_channel=BrutalJones","November 12, 2014","false","28.3"," 2,304 of 2,548 people (90%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","90","304","2","78","97"

The game is constantly crashing about every 1/2 an hour on average for me. The game might be playable in 4 - 6 months time but for now, it is definitely not worth playing.\n\nGame mechanics are more or less classic AC. That's great if you enjoyed any of the previous instalments. However, because Ubisoft has decided to force Multiplayer on us. Here's what you are missing out on if you just want to play the game totally solo single-player and not participate in any co-op or any of the guild (called clubs ingame) content (which I must add, the club competitions are NOT EVEN RELEASED YET) You are completely locked out of the 5 star gear upgrades if you are a solo player meaning you will hit a glass ceiling in terms of gear.\n\nThe Armor set in Unity that can be unlocked is basically a reskinned Altair's costume (Either a Pro or Con depending on your preference), however it is basically a skin and has no statistical advantages so it is pointless to pursue if you are not a fan of the looks. I should also mention that you need to collect about 12 seals to unlock the gear which means it will take a while to do as well.\n\nThe Parkour is great in this game and probably the best in the entire series so far however as usual, it has a lot of stickiness issues. I've basically bounced about on all 4 sides of a window for 30 seconds or so because the game just doesn't want to let me climb to the exact spot to climb into a building.\n\nLevel design is much better than the last few games. Now they give you a more open area and let you figure out which route you want to take to get your target which is pretty fun when you perfectly execute an assassination. However there are a few levels (or some spots used in assassin missions) where the layout and guard density can get pretty ridiculous. Overall though the level design is pretty good in Unity.\n\nThe Stealth detection mechanics are pretty spotty in this game. I have encountered issues where guards were alerted of my presence after I stealth killed another guard on another floor or issues where guards all across the restricted zone are alerted to me when I killed a guard and there were no other guards looking my way.\n\nCombat is a lot more difficult compared to previous games (which again could be a pro or con depending on your preferences). No longer can you fight off 20 or so guards and win easily. All guards carry guns which can take out 1/2 to 3/4 of your HP if you stick around too long so you have to try not to stay in combat for too long. The Double Assassination mechanics seem to be pretty spotty too in my experience. Even with 2 enemies clearly highlighted for a double air assassination, I have found myself frequently seeing Arno only hit one target which causes me to aggro the 2nd guard and consequently every guard in the zone is alerted to me.\n\nThe Story is pretty meh and doesn't really take advantage of the interesting setting of the French Revolution which is pretty unfortunate. You only seem to read about the events of the French Revolution behind the scenes through the ingame journals or dialogue but are not really involved in many of the big events. I can't think of a single character outside of Elise who is memorable or even has any kind of personality. Arno is okay but is a poor man's version of Ezio.\n\nUbisoft has also included chests that rely on you playing a Mobile App to be able to unlock. I decided to give it a try but uninstalled it 2 days after playing it after it reset my progress twice. Another broken component of ACU... There is also an AC Initiates web game which I'm not too sure what the point of it is as it is still half built at this point on the website and it has also reset my level earlier. To unlock the legacy skins like Altair's Armor, Ezio's armor, etc  you need a certain Initiate level before you can open the chest. (Seeing a pattern with Club Competitions, Companion App and Initiates? I'm not sure why Ubisoft is adding in all these extra things to the main game when they are all pretty much incomplete, unfinished and bug-ridden)\n\nFrankly if Ubisoft couldn't get all this working, they should either have left them out of the game completely and made sure their main game is fully featured and actually works properly or delayed the game release.","December 3, 2014","false","61.2"," 1,580 of 1,775 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","580","1","8","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexpre888/recommended/289650/","alexpre888","Derps von Herpington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexpre888/","146 products in account","[AFTER THE 5TH PATCH AND DEAD KINGS DLC]\nAs you may have noticed among the Steam reviews, Assassin's Creed Unity currently has a very bad reputation among the PC Community and I am here to explain everything I can about my experience with the game in the most respectable and honest way possible. I have experienced good things and bad things in the game that I am willing to share.\n\n[VISUAL]\nThis is something that many people will more likely agree. This game is truly beautiful. I appreciate the fact that Ubisoft truly made this game look like Next-Gen. You can go to many other places and see the beauty on the poor and rich side of Paris. Of course, to experience this well, you might have to have a very good PC to explore it pretty well. Otherwise, it is just a tease to you.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\nThe game seems to play out like a refined version of AC1. The parkouring is somewhat smooth, but sometimes a bit buggy when climbing in certain areas. The Combat is actually more difficult than one might think, if fighting a bunch of guards, you might end up using alot of smoke bombs and even with all the medicine you take, it might not be enough and you will more likely die (in other words, smoke bombs are your best friend). The new combat also removed the free flow kill streaks and counter kills, instead you parry, attack, or dodge. Fans wanted a more difficult challenge, and so they have it. Now the Fanbase is divided about it. For me, it wasn't bad but it could have been better refined. I think Ubisoft was trying to add more realism into the AC series, after all, I don't think its normal for someone to kill 10 guards under 1 minute unless you had explosives. Stealth in this game is possible. It's not really the best stealth feature, but it is possible.\n\n[MISSIONS & OTHER ACTIVITIES]\nThe Main Missions are pretty well done If I may say. You can enter a building, lure them out, riot, go yolo, sneak under the building, etc. This made the game less repetitive. I cannot say the same for the Side Mission however, they do tend to repeat itself, however it does have some interesting stories behind these missions. Investigation Missions is pretty awesome, you play detective and try to figure out who murdered the person, and you have a variety of people to blame. So choose wisely. The Notredamus Puzzle is the most time consuming unworthy chore I ever done. You pretty much attempt to solve these painful riddles just to get a reskin altair costume that is merely cosmetic, I personally think it is not worth it. Helix Rifts are actually part of the storyline and you are basically just trying to escape that era. It was pretty enjoyable to watch and explore this small linear era, but it wasn't that spectacular. And finally the co-op missions that might prove enjoyable, unfortunately due to bad connection with Ubisoft's servers, attempting to connect takes quite long and sometimes end up with just two player team, even having to join friends proves difficult and this mostly forces me to play alone or with just one player. The game has chest...BUT WAY too many chests....and some Nomad Chests and Initiate Chest that once were used for third-party app (Patch 5).\n\n[CUSTOMIZATION & WEAPONS]\nThis game has ALOT of customization for your character from hood, chest, legs, bracer, and belt to weapon varieties. Its really REALLY well done and many people enjoyed having their own attire. Weapons can be selected from Swords, Heavy weapons, long weapons, pistols, and rifles. Some of these attires and weapons must be unlocked through missions, chests or through club competitions. You also have the ability to buy skills to improve your health, stealth and fighting abilities.\n\n[STORY]\nI won't lie to you guys, I say this as a true fan of the AC storyline, the story....is the weakest of all the series. I will explain with no spoiler as possible. The story focuses soo much on Arno and Elise that everyone else, including historical figures, was forgettable. And even when it focuses on Arno and Elise, it feels pretty meh. I admit though, their love story is pretty well made but short lived. This is pretty much how the story usually ends up going: Arno kills the target, drain his target's memories to find the next target (there is no confessions for the victim like previous games), kills the next guy, repeat. I know there is story behind all of it, but there is hardly any backstory for that target, even the main antagonist hardly had some spotlight other than the fact he is a sage (but we knew that from the beginning of the game). The ending was....I have to say...it was pretty cliche....and the Modern Day storyline was little to nonexistant unfortunately. I am NOT saying the story was horrible, but the story is weak for an AC game. What bothers me the most is the order of missions of single-player and co-op missions are not linear, this usually results an early spoiler for single player story, WHICH IS REALLY BAD!\n\n[BUGS & GLITCHES]\nThis is where the game's experience was killed since its launch. It performed badly. Now we are at Patch 5. Online is so-so fixed along with Issues of Dead Kings DLC. the Crashes however, I still get that. It really does kill the experience for me along with constant stuttering issues. I was able to run this game at around 45 fps with custom high/ultra high setting so it wasn't entirely bad for me. But I really cannot say the same for others. If you check the forums, you will see that many people can't run this game as well as others (even Powerful PC users have issues) I also read reports that as if Patch 5, SLI/Crossfire Users perform worse for them. And of course, the game is not optimized well on PC, in fact its worse than any AC title.\n\n[MICROTRANSACTIONS]\nLet's make it clear that this has no affect to us in gameplay, since this is optional. However, this cannot be ignored either. Putting microtransactions on a Single-player/Co-op game, simply to get items early instead of encouraging players to get them through effort is just a big no. What disturbs me is the price, it ranges from $20 - $100 and the helix credits aren't that much either. This is possibly the worst thing I ever saw in an AC game and this sort of business practice has made Ubisoft look like the new EA.\n\n[DEAD KINGS DLC]\nI would type out the review for this, but the I am reaching my character limit for this review. so I'll get to the point. Story wasn't dark as they said. Surprisingly boring. Weapons are meh. at least it was free. yeah, sorry peeps.\n\n[DO I RECOMMEND?]\nThis game had such potential and was executed poorly. The reason I give this game "Thumbs Down" is because this game may not run for everyone and to top it all, this game still has major issues that needs to be dealt with and the chances of having that is 50/50. Another reason is because the story was weak for an AC game. You might be one of the lucky ones to run the game with little to no problems, or be one of those unfortunate enough to have a bad experience, So if you feel you can run this game and can deal with the issues the game has, by all means get it since it can still prove to be enjoyable, but please get this game during discount, because I personally think this isn't worth the full price. You see all the thumbs down reviews and I agree with many of them, its that bad. If a lot of people are complaining less about Uplay and more on Unity, then something went seriously bad for Ubisoft. I really worry for the series now. Personally, this game may have been given a recommendation or just a mere complaint about Uplay launcher if there were little bugs and glitches, or at least a good optimization and better support. The damage has been done and there is no doubt that this game became one of the biggest disappointments of 2014.\n\nNOTE: I Completed the game with 97% Sync\nI Played this game on Barebones Gaming Laptop\n\nIntel Core i7 4700MQ\n8 GB RAM\nWindows 7 64-bit\nNVIDIA Geforce GTX 780M","January 7, 2015","false","84.7"," 730 of 817 people (89%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","89","730","817","29","19"

I guess most people need to brush up on their French history and world history for that matter. First off, I find it silly that I have to explain that the world wasn't in 1080p until 1962, but that must be before your time. Though Unity often dips below 20 fps, this is generous for the time period, as France was one of the last countries to hit 240hz and operated at an unsteady 15-20fps throughout the 18th century. Unity surprised me by accurately showing Arno dropping through the ground and into the white abyss that exists under the real Paris, even to this day. Finally, there is the non-issue of pop-in... Anyone that has been to Paris is quite aware that parisians are all British accented phantoms that often come and go between planes of many dimensions.\n\nOpen a history book! Do more traveling!

Loyal Consumers, we have your salvation! It comes with a twist. Intead of changing gameplay mechanics to aid with your requests, we have strived to challenge you in a new way. What makes Unity more challenging than other Assassin's creed games is how in the heat of battle against low level enemies, they still provide challenge due to the fact that you are constantly treading through a thick swamp of glitches and framerate drops to below 10 fps. The camera angle will almost never show your Assassin and you will always be in the dark when fighting those evil templars. How does that sound for a challenge? We hope that you will enjoy Unity with as much enthusiasm and dedication as we put fourth into optimizing it.\nLove,\nUbisoft Montreal\n\nEDIT: The recent updates HAVE IMPROVED the quality of the game bit it is still far from where it needs to be. Just ran into a glitch that required me to reatart the game and i felt that this edit was necessary.","November 15, 2014","false","18.7"," 1,373 of 1,595 people (86%) found this review helpful 101 people found this review funny","86","373","1","101","45"

Which is like 10% of the time. First of all, unless your computer is optimus prime in disguise, this game will drop frames like a mother. I have a GTX 750ti with 2GB RAM and it runs around 25-30fps on low settings, SMH.\n\nHoneslty most of the issues with this game I feel can be fixed with updates, but until then, i wouldn't reccomend this game. I've played all of the Assassin's Creed games, and this game by far is the least optimized and has the most bugs.\nI love this game, and want it to work so bad!\n\nAs for co-op, it's fun, but same problems, bugs, sometimes game breaking bugs.\n\nThe game's difficulty spike is tremendous, which i like, encouraging people not to simply run in rambo style, but sometimes seems harder than it needs to be. I typically die in one hit from a great axe, or two shots in the back from running away by an AI with perfect accuracy.\n\nThe story isn't bad, but it's nothing groundbreaking, I was honestly not really paying attention, I was too distracted by the weird ♥♥♥ hair physics and inconsistent textures.\n\nOverall the game honestly feels rushed. I would've rather played Rogue this year and waited for AC Unity next year working optimally. It would have been well worth it. But the way it is now, if a patch isn't good enough to fix it, this is a waste of a title. I love Assassin's Creed. And I really want to love this game. I'm trying my hardest. But I can't lie when i say this game is broken, almost to the point of unplayable, and unless your a hardcore AC fan, you WILL NOT tolerate this game. You should be fine if you have a supercomputer, but that won't eliminate the bugs...\n\nYeah, in my utmost honesty, being the dedicated AC fan that  I am, as much as I hate to say it: F*ck this game, buy Shadow of Mordor instead. It's basically the same game, except it works.","November 12, 2014","false","49.7"," 946 of 1,099 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","946","1","14","55"

Which is very simplified and boring.\nAnd to add with the climbing, since there is douzands of ways to get up a building now, its actually hard to get the guy where you want him to go.\nThe HUD for guards detecting you looks very ugly, a square 3D box that is "filling" up now, it is unfitting for the gamestyle and sometimes hard to see how much filled it is.\n\nAnd another big bad part is the microtransactions. Its now possible to buy yourself into the highest gears within minutes now, for real money of corse.\nAnother simplification is that you can now access and buy new gear/clothes anywhere, its in the ESC menu now, not in shops.\n\nAnother gameplay related thing I think is stupid is the fact that the Eagle Vision has some kind of short timer and a reload now, you cannot choose when to use it entierly.\nAnd same goes for tossing coins, very bad implemented now.\nIt uses the coins as "ammo" so you dont take it from the currency you have, its simply ammo like arrows or smoke now, so you can use it limited times then you have to refill it at a consumable shop.\nIt also has a 20 second long reload timer after every time you toss the coins, which I hate VERY much.\n\nAnd also, the non existent "weapon wheel" is totally useless. ONLY way to get through weapons/gadgets now is 123456789 keys, no scroll, no button to hold to get the wheel up, which dissapointed me alot.\n\nWhistle? Gone.\nYou cannot attract guards while in a hiding spot in any way now. You can only hope they will magically go to the haystack and "happens" to look into it for no reason.\n\nCombat system drastically changed now, and I dont find it particuarly positive.\nWhile going full on attack on a guard, another one can attack you from behind instead of the "what-now-waiting"\nThat is good.\nBut I still find the fights alot slower and boring to engage in now really.\n\nGuards can no longer climb at all, so its VERY easy to get away from guards, way too easy really.\n\nNow I have only written down bad things, because... I am that type of guy that complains alot, but its still all fact.\nI know this is not really the kind of review people may want, but I really focus more on the little stuff that is bad with this game.\nI also wrote all this meanwhile playing, so hence the un-formated sections.","November 13, 2014","false","49.1"," 969 of 1,131 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","969","1","2","18"

I'm running an i7 3770 @3.40 GHz, i've got 16 gigs of ram, windows 8.1, and an Nvidia GTX770 with 4 gigs of vram.  It doesn't seem like a better system than some of the ones reviewing and yet I get a constant high frame rate with absolutely no video problems even in huge crowds.  I also never had problems with Watch Dogs and everyone was complaining about that game too.  All that being said this game is SUPER buggy.  I haven't had any crashes, but the NPCs and the parkour are both very buggy.  An even bigger issue though is the one that's not a bug it's a feature, and that's the absolute SH** stealth system.  The cover mechanic is just awful.  He can't get behind everything only somethings, he takes forever to get in and out of cover, the cover toggle button is space and so it's also about a million other things, there is no button to go around corners in cover, and the cover switching mechanic may as well be broken it's pretty much impossible to use.  Also if AC wants to be a stealth game they need one simple mechanic: quick save and load.  Without that it is just simply infuriating to try and play this stealthily, but the combat is tougher now and enemies can one-shot you so you are still forced to play stealth even though it is just absolutly horrible to do.  This is a first attempt in this series at stealth but with a publisher catalouge that includes splinter cell this should have been way better.  My hope is that Ubi will release a patch to fix all of this but I know that that is very unlikely.\n\nAlso, this is a pay-to-play, pay-to-win game.  That's right, Ubisoft just charged you 60 dollars for a game that they also want you to buy items in with real money.  Here's the pricing of the weapons in game:\n-$250 (I know they aren't dollars but dont tell me to look up that symbol)\n-$1000\n-$2500\nYou might be thinking well these all sound managable and they are but here's where the price jumps to a minimum of:\n-$125,000\n\nIf you ever wanted to think about owning that last weapon (which is super powerful of course) Ubi offers microtransactions of up to $100 USD.  This is unnaceptable and just an awful business practice.\n\nThe only reason I would tell you to buy this game now is if you have a very good PC and enjoy the free roaming the most in AC games.  The city is huge and beaitiful and varied, and the parkour system, while buggy and more unrealistic, is fun and fluid for this new city.  If that's all you care about buy this game now, but if you want to play the story and don't really care about exploring than I think maybe your best bet is to wait either for a patch or for Rogue.\n\nOverall I wish they had delayed this game a whole hell of a lot more than 2 weeks.  Another year's polish would have done this game very well but this is Ubisoft we're talking about and that didn't happen and this game probably won't even get patched.\n\n\nUPDATE: The patch corrupted my save game, deleting about 20 hours of gameplay.  Not sure I can motivate to try again.  Highly recommend backing up your saves.  Screw this game.","November 12, 2014","false","51.1"," 688 of 795 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","688","795","2","12"

I would still not reccomend the game, simply because this is still late alpha or early Beta level preformance at best. Another note here is a portion of the issue could be attributed to NPCs. Ubisoft really put a boat load of NPCs in this game, tons more than an Assassin's creed game has ever had. While it does add to the atmosphere it seems to cause framerate drop when running through a crowd of 1000 people screaming and burning stuff (go figure...)\nEDIT: (11/18/14) Two patches in now and I am still seeing very minimal changes to the major issues that are in this game, framerate drops are still extremely common and present. Lighting remains an issue on certain settings (including one glitch where all lighting became bright white pixelated blocks that when looked at would make everything disappear from buildings to your character). Some people have attributed it to Ubisoft Online and reccomended that turning off the overlay and playing in offline mode will help with the framerate drop, I personally have not tested this, but in the past Online modes for Ubisoft games have given me trouble, but not on this scale. Other major issues are still prevalent, such as characters falling through the map (granted one of the "patches" stated it resolved this issue)\n\nEdit: In the comments some troll (steam level 1, with an account that has no games listed...) told me that the game was just glitchy, not unplayable and that I shouldn't be pitching a fit about this. He also stated that his PC with a 660 was better than mine and I should work on my PC. I won't disagree that I should upgrade my PC some, maybe buy 3 980s and SLI them....But anyways here is my build, since it is relevant to the quality of gameplay\nGeforce GTX 770, Geforce GTX 770, Intel Core i5-670k CPU @ 3.40GHz, 8GB ram (7.93 usable)\n\n\nHaving played 8 hours of this game I think I have come to a solid conclusion. Don't waste 60 fraking bucks on it. Ubisoft has apparently determined that their customers are completely unimportant and released an utterly hideous game.\nWhile yes, the gameplay remains loyal to the Assassin's creed style, which I appreciate, and the player customization does offer some interesting styles in which to play. The issues with the game simply outweigh the good...\nGraphics: Normally I wouldn't be so judgemental on graphics, but even on Ultra High graphics, I felt like I was playing a 6+ year old game, the game does an utterly terrible job rendering anything more than a few (ingame) city blocks away...To a point a cathedral such as the notre dame looks like it was built in Minecraft, it has no detail at distance at all. Simply flat blurry walls. It's terrifying. There are numerous glitches, I've seen guards fall out of the sky, fall through the map, fly around. The framerate jobs are random and extremely game breaking, try playing a freerunning game at 60 fps then drop it down to 5 for a few seconds, you wind up facing the wrong direction, falling of stuff, and just generally dying. The graphics here, even on the highest setting, look like Call of Duty 4. And that may be insulting Call of Duty 4. I took some screenshots, If you want to see em they are on my profile.\nGameplay: It's still Assassin's creed, solid combat (not as fun as past ones combat wise), interesting customization options, ways to make your own gear unique to you and your style.\nStory: I can't decide yet, aspects of it have clear plotholes, and really strange ones at that. Ones that I can assure you will never be addressed.\n\nHonestly If i could ask for a refund, I would. Without hesitation. Maybe in a few weeks once (if) ubisoft starts rolling out patches for the games numerous issues it will be fun to play. But i doubt they will. Especially for us PC gamers. Even the console gamers have had issues...Which says how seriously FUBARed this game is.\nSave your money, Go elsewhere.","November 11, 2014","false","16.1"," 596 of 686 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","596","686","0","6"

So let me just say that I HATE THIS GAME! Let me tell you what you are getting when you purchase Assassins Creed Unity. You will get a reskinned Assassins Creed 1 game, down to just having one hidden blade and no horses in the whole of Paris. Let me repeat myself NOT A ♥♥♥♥ING HORSE IN SUCKING SIGHT. The parkour feels like it has devovled from the pass AC games. Why the hell cant I jump from one wall to another? Is that yet anoter skill I have to buy with one of four in game currencies. Haha, Customization is cool in a game but Ubisoft went way over board with this one. But thats not the most annoying thing in  the game aside from the most abisomal controls you will ever have the delight of dealing with. Sometimes I think the game is playing itself. But back to the most annoying part of ths abomonation of a videogame is that every bad guy has a gun and they leave you with no way what-so-ever to dodge or block bullets. So each shot is a guarantee hit unless you run behind a wall or in a crowd of Parisians in which the guards will shoot most citizens point blank. Really Ubisoft? Really? You couldnt have tightened the AI a bit so the soldiers dont shoot the citizens.\n\nI can imagine how this game was made. Someone at Ubisoft was given a ridiculous deadline in which to finish the new AC game. Naturally they have run out of story ideas, so the genious decides hey why not semi reboot the series with the game mechanics of AC 1 and the story of AC 2 and shoe horn in some Muliplayer? Well since the higher ups think their fan base are dumb sheep who will eat anything with theAC branding on it up with a spoon and decide its the best idea in the whle wide world. Unfortunately they negleted to over look the fact that one of the main reasons their customer base plays these games is for the historical experience and in fact we(the fan base) are quite intelligent. SO naturally the fan base beigin revolting like the French citizens in their game and suddenly everything comes to light..... Ubisoft is Abstergo and in fact trying to sabotage the Assassins by putting out incompitent videogames like ones that take place in Paris but regardless the people have perfect victorian age accents, they even go as far as having different accents from the UK such as Scottish and North Irish. I mean if thats not a slap to the face. I mean come on UBISOFT I know Canada Still pays tribute to the queen but this was just tasteless. I sincerely hope the team that made this garbage.

All this seems unacceptable when the game seems to be so much smaller in scope than previous entries in the series.  That and the step away from many of the underlying story ideas that have tied all the Assassin's Creed games together so far.  Why the new "helix" system?  What was wrong with just calling it the Animus still?\n\nIt looks gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and the motion capture work is pretty much second to none so far, but the experience itself is held back by the negatives.  In hindsight, I should have waited to purchase until later, after some patches came around to fix it up, and maybe when cheaper on sale.  Too late now, though.","November 12, 2014","false","16.1"," 437 of 503 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","437","503","0","0"

After extreme satisfaction from Black Flag, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this game, especially since it's set during the French Revolution.  However, I am extremely disappointed in this game.  I don't even think this was optimized, as I am well above the recommended specs but I cannot play on normal graphics settings without my fps dipping well below 30 FPS.\nMelee combat has been nerfed on an extrodinary scale.  This can be a good thing or bad thing depending how you liked the melee in the past games.  I for one am not a fan of dying to 4 enemies.  Oh, they also got rid of using people as a body shield when enemies are about to fire, lovely isn't it?\nI'm not a fan of how co-op was forced upon us.  You are forced to play co-op missions in order to get 5 star armor.  Most people playing co-op have absolutely no care for stealth and will just run into the mission guns ablazing.  I could expect this, but co-op should not be forced on us.\nThe parkour in this series has always frustrated me, no matter what.  I thought they were getting better with it in Black Flag, but this game has taken 2 steps backwards.  It seems like they've tried to get too cute with the parkour and now it's no longer flowing.  There's countless times where Arno will just stay hanging from a ledge because I do not press the "free run up" button.  Entering through windows is extremely buggy.  Most of the time Arno will climb around the open window instead of actually climbing in it.\nOn top of all this, Ubisoft has decided to add microtransactions in game.  This utterly disgusts me, and the fact that there are 3 different currencies in this game is just plain ridiculous.\nOverall, this game feels like an Alpha release, and I cannot recommend this game whatsoever.","December 19, 2014","false","25.4"," 553 of 657 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","553","657","9","8"

Assasin's Creed: Unity is not finished.  The performace issues are epic and although some folks seem to be able to play the game, many, many others including myself can not.\nMy system is in somewhere inbetween the Minimum and Recommended specs, so if I had to turn the graphics down to medium or even low, I wouldn't complain much.  Sure, the system requirements seem high for the visual fidelity  that the game delivers, but that's forgivable.\nBut Assasin's Creed: Unity is a mess.  The game performs poorly on all graphical settings, suggesting that the problem isn't simply graphical horsepower.  Many gameplay sessions end with the character stuck halfway into the floor.  Crashes are frequent.  Frame rates regularly range between 10 and 20 FPS, especially if there's a lot of hair or cloth on the screen.  Most maddeningly, every few seconds the gameplay will hesitate for a fraction of a second.  When if catches up, it assumes that your mouse must have been moving at the same rate it was when it hiccuped which usually results in a sharp spin of the camera.  In AC:U, that means that your character suddenly changes direction, often running off a roof, into a cart, or turning your back to an enemy.  This bug in particular has rendered the game completely unplayable for me.\nAs a long time fan of the series, I find this extremely disappointing.  Many folks wonder how this could have happened and wonder if Ubisoft even has a QA Tesing department at all.  To this, I would speculate that they do in fact have competent tester and that those developer's opinions and warnings were ignored by Ubisoft management who just had to have the game released this quarter so that their earnings statement would be positive.  Screw long term company reputation and screw the customers.  It's worked for EA, so why can't it work for Ubisoft?\n\nWhile that last bit is all speculation, the summary of the game and its performance issues is not.  Don't buy this game.","November 12, 2014","false","31.4"," 320 of 365 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","320","365","0","4"

I also work in QA, and love AC, and Ubisoft which I have a couple friends at.\nThat being said, I would like to explain in detail and reason, as to why I would not recommend this game.\n\nYes the game is filled with performance issues, that I would like to believe Ubisoft would be able to fix with time, at current the game is barely playable, it does not run at the framerate it should and staggers a lot on any graphical setting, plus has rendering issues.\n\nBut the main arguments is how different this game feels from the rest of the series.\n\n\nEagle Eye.\n\nOn Black Flag and previous titles, Eagle Eye worked as a Stealth Tool, you could not RUN while it was activated and it highlighted things for you for a short period of time.\n\nThis time, Eagle Eye can be activated while running, and even mid combat, how ever it has a Cooldown. Which is a bit off putting. Specially when the highlight colors for Eagle Eye on Unity is also the brightest shade of RED and YELLOW I have ever seen. It actually bothers having highlighted targets during Combat, which occasionaly it may occur.\n\n\nCombat.\n\nThe Combat in AC Series used to kinda fit the series. Everyone in Assassin's Creed regardless of how nuts, powerful, skillful or influential is a human. Which means they can be killed by Blades and Daggers. So it was awesome and pretty iconic to stop a Super Villain's monologue mid sentence with Hidden Blades from Above. How ever now, there is even a QTE Fight against a guy, and the use of an Eden Artifact as an excuse to "Do it again three times" typical video game ness. Even Jobbers in Unity have way more health, and cannot be killed with a single Counter, which again made sense since it's a bunch of guards fighting an ASSASSIN, and you could up the challenge a bit by adding tons of guards that you had to time each counter to.\nAssassin's Creed is a cinematic experience, I do not want to fight some random guards for precious minutes cause they somehow are able to Tank an Assassin.\n\nEquipment.\n\nAnother thing about this game, you could always get different gear and stuff, some with stats too. But you never REQUIRED to upgrade your stuff. I beat most of Black Flag with default gear cause they looked neat, and felt part of the character. This time how ever it is a huge challenge to beat the game with default gear "Which I did, cause the rest looked ugly" since there's an RPG element to the game, where you have a "Level" for your character and each Jobber and missions too. And how ever you are able to play the missions they simply have more health, or you perhaps are not "As Stealthy" cause your "Stealth Stats" were not high enough.\n\n\nStealth.\n\nAnd stealth also has it's issues, they made a lot of things look and feel different, even the Blending on groups of civs has a different type of visual to it, and is not as effective if you do not have enough "Stealth Stats" from your gear. Still works till the end of the game, but it's clearly dependent of these upgrades.\n\n\nCity.\n\nThe City is amazing, is the one part of this game that needs proper credit. The amount of NPCs on the screen is ridiculous. And gives the city an incredible detail and Life. The Revolution is displayed very well too.\n\n\nCo Op.\n\nI have not yet been able to try Co Op much since friends were not able to play or playing on PS4.\nBut as far as I see you have some neat options for creating your own Club, and having challenges, objectives. Form your own Creed. And meet other Assassins. There are a few options for different types of activities for your Co Op friends. And exploring the city with friends sounds amazing.\n\nStory.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, I don't see major flaws with it aside from not explaining the Eden Artifact used on this game AT ALL. Characters are pretty interesting, but they are barely used as to their extent.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of glitches, lack of the Hidden Blade rendering during ingame cutscenes that shows the character stabbing a dude, even tents that have 100% visibility through it getting guards to detect you through it. Lot's of QA issues, and for what ever reason they decided to mess with a bunch of mechanics that already worked in the first place. Eagle Eye, Stealth, Combat. I feel like people ♥♥♥♥♥ed at how easy it was to fight in previous AC games and they tried to please those dudes, but Combat always made SENSE and it was cinematic.\n\nI also believe this game might be pretty "Skipable", in terms of what it adds to the overall plot and the characters on it.","November 15, 2014","false","22.0"," 489 of 578 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","489","578","0","9"

Not to mention the online is so laggy and unreliable  that when combined with the frame rate and pop up bugs, its pretty much unplayable (when you can join a game at all).\n\nUbisoft should be ashamed for releasing a game in this state, but I know they aren't, because they already have our money.\n\nThere is also a portion of the game locked behind a "Companion app" that forces you to to DL an app on your ipod/phone/android in order to experience the content, but its also bugged as hell with frequent progress loss and such, not to mention people without an ipod/phone are SOL and miss out on that part of the game completely.\n\nIf all that weren't enough even more content is locked behind an "intiate" system that requires you to go to their website and sign up and half of that is still in closed alpha and inaccessible/buggy.\n\nAnd if all THAT weren't enough the game also has a bloody real cash shop with Day One DLC.\n\nGood God its like Ubisoft was so sure this game would be successful they looked up all the "Do nots of game creation" and said, I bet we can be the ones to make this work and we'll get even richer.\n\nBut I digress...\n\nIMO there is a solid game -some where- behind all that mess, so I say wait before you get this game, cause it needs a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of patching.","November 12, 2014","false","11.9"," 330 of 379 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","330","379","0","0"

If you do not have the recommended requirements, your frame rate will be tanking the entire time you're playing (around 15 to 40 fps MAX).\n\nOn another note, the campaign missions seem rather dull and no longer has me interested in finishing the rest of the game (the beginning missions before Arno became an Assassin were fine). The concepts behind the missions just aren't very appealing. The co-op mode, which was LONG overdue since the introduction of multiplayer in Assassin's Creed was finally delivered in Unity--but was not executed outstandingly. Although it is rather intriguing to see fellow Assassin's air-assassinate into the battle to assist you, the repetitiveness of the co-op missions gets overwhelming with the same formula of kill, investigate, steal, and other mindless objectives. Moving onto combat, I have no idea what happened but the combat in Unity just seems ridiculously difficult. You can slash all day but that enemy will NOT die unless you attack him at least 6-12 times. (Edit: I have finally figured out how to kill enemies faster, but that was only after upgrading the sword so you can actually do damage. Good luck getting enough money since the game is really stingy when providing means of income. The only way I got enough money was to grind the "It Belongs in a Museum" Heist which rewards you with $25,000-$70,000. You won't make enough money otherwise...) Meanwhile you have other enemies surrounding you to deal with, some which will shoot at you and most likely take 1/2 to 2/3 of your health away if the bullet hits you (maybe I missed a tutorial about meat shielding like the other games?? I don't know. As far as I know there's basically no effective way to not get shot and killed since you get stuck in kill animations). Furthermore, I personally do not approve of the new eagle vision that has a 10 or so second cooldown and only reveals targets for a FEW SECONDS (the minimap also doesn't tell you any information about enemies anymore unless they are revealed through eagle vision--this makes stealth much harder since you have to toggle eagle vision on and off constantly otherwise you have no clue where the enemies are on the minimap). On the plus side, the new eagle vision reveals EVERYONE within a certain radius from you, whether or not you directly look at them or they are hidden behind solid walls.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed Unity seems to have lots of potential to keep the player entertained through the amazing graphics and partially enjoyable co-op mode (only when you play 4 man with some IRL friends), I would not recommend this game unless you have a really high-end computer. Anything below the recommended specifications and you will find a hard time "enjoying" the game. However, if the day comes that the game is substantially better in optimization (as in 50-60 fps for decent computer builds) Unity may restore its honor.\n\nTL;DR Assassin's Creed Unity has great graphic detail, very poor optimization (consistently 15-40 fps), unforgiving combat system, a decent co-op mode that gets repetitive over time. Do not play on PC unless you have a top-tier graphics card and CPU.","November 11, 2014","false","28.0"," 324 of 377 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","324","377","0","0"

The Uplay cloud save system deleted my game after 30 hours.\n\nUnity is absolutely deserving of all the criticism it is receiving for the dishonest tactic of placing the review embargo twelve hours after the release date. As the subsequent mixed reviews revealed, more than half of the content is inaccesible due to bugs. Co-op is broken and does not work. The matchmaking system does not work. Any attempt to join a multiplayer session locks up the game and I cannot even continue without quitting and restarting. The top tier of armor and weapons is inaccessible due to bugs with joining clubs and completing co-op missions. The ranking system is broken and tells me I am the highest "Legend" rank, and has told me so since 15% completion. The companion app is broken and does not work despite paying extra for the premium version. A significant number of the chests, money, collectibles, and equipment that are present in the single-player campaign require the use of the mobile app which does not work, leaving a large amount of clutter on the world map that cannot be hidden. They even managed to mess up the Initiates ranking and syncing, even though I painstakingly completed every Assassin's Creed game to 100% synchronization in preparation for this game. Also, all Initiates content in regards to Unity still says "Coming Soon" a week after release, be it daily challenges, map puzzles, Initiate missions, even sync percentage.\n\nNone of the gameplay changes are for the better. Combat was changed to make it "harder" but all that means is that you will be shot dead through walls and crowds in an instant without warning. Animations are less fluid and realistic than in previous games. Arno can leap across 20 foot alleys and climb up blank walls in ways that make no sense to anyone who has played the previous games. The modern day storyline has been abandoned and the French revolutionary characters are less than weak and speak in London and Cockney accents. The "crowd events" consist of two varities: "kill the criminal" or "tackle the thief" and they are repeated every two to three minutes of gameplay. Another strange design choice are the frequent pop-ups to let you know you have unspent skill points (missions award two skill points but most skills cost five or eight skill points, so you will always have a leftover amount of skill points and wil be viewing this pop-up constantly) or a seperate pop-up to let you know that you have used your hidden blade. Speaking of the hidden blade, the ability to use your hidden blade has been limited and become purely contextual. You can only use it under certain QTE circumstances and you must be in complete stealth, otherwise you must use your sword if there is any combat involved.\n\nParis looks amazing and I feel bad for the artists whose work has been rendered worthless by other departments' poor choices. My favorite moment of the game was experiencing an intentional glitch in the Animus that resulted in Arno being transported to 1944 occupied Paris, dodging tanks, machine gun fire, shooting down airplanes, and scaling an Eiffel tower adorned in Nazi flags. This was a main storyline segment and only temporary escape from the sad reality of the "real" game. Other than graphics (which must be expected of the most recent entry in a video game series) literally every single facet of the game is inferior to previous games. A first in the series are microtransactions in the single-player campaign. Uplay points are now awarded for purchasing and using "boosts" which make your character do more damage, make guards dumber, or make you earn more money. There are four types of currency now, three of which can be paid for with real money. You can unlock the fast-travel points around Paris for the single-player campaign by purchasing them in the in-game store. The game offers currency packs of up to $99. Fully upgrading your top-tier gear requires purchasing tens of thousands of "Helix" credits from this store, or can be earned 100 "creed points" at a time by completing the same two events over and over (requiring completing the same event 100 times to upgrade one item).\n\nWhen completing a main story mission, the game will crash to desktop just before hitting a save point. This happened to me three times within a two hour period. Are you a fan of the Assassin's Creed lore and universe? Well, forget about that business because this game doesn't bother with it. Who is Arno and why are we observing him? Who is the descendant whose DNA we are looking at through the Animus? What is Juno up to these days? Where are Shaun and Rebecca? (Shaun has a bit of dialogue but he's using a codename and we don't know why) If Elise is really a Templar then why is she just a generic helpless female love interest who doesn't actually have any importance on the story? Why are the Miles family and the Kenway family completely irrevelvant now? Why is Abstergo trying to "access precursor DNA"? What is precursor DNA and how did we find a sample of it? What about the Apple of Eden and other precursor relics? What do the writers have against Les Miserables? Who are we playing as and why do we never even leave the Animus? Are we being held in an Abstergo facility and the Assassins are hacking into our brains? Who is the woman speaking to us, why is she important, and why have we never seen her before? Could they have used an actor we know from the previous games or was their fee too big? Was anyone involved with directing the story for this game aware of what the other Assassin's Creed games are about? Why did they decide that this game does not need to have a main menu? Why can we only quit to desktop or edit options once we have completed the first section of gameplay? Why did they remove horses? Why did they remove hunting, crafting, guilds, allied factions, assassin signals, mini-games, and challenges? Why was the most groundbreaking feature of this game the fact that you do not get any rewards for getting all of the collectibles? Why did they remove the unique and interesting multiplayer and put in a barebones co-op mode that is clunky at best and game-breaking at worst? Why did they lock a significant portion of items and skills behind this co-op mode which does not currently work? Why does this game have a smaller scale and less content than each game in the series that came before it, even ones that came out five years ago?\n\nTo top it all off, after 30 hours of doing my best to trudge through it and ignore the flaws in story, gameplay, and large chunk of inaccessible content, the single Uplay cloud save file that we are allowed to have has become corrupted by some invisible force, all progress has been lost, and Unity as a whole has become reduced to one smug dialogue box that I cannot escape: "Your save file has become corrupted. Would like you start a new game and overwrite it? Yes or Quit to Windows?"","November 16, 2014","false","55.1"," 322 of 377 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","322","377","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/289650/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Assassin’s Creed: Unity was supposed to be a new milestone in video game technology, the first game to take advantage of the power of next generation consoles. For PC gamers, it was meant to be the mainstream title that freed them from the shackles of limiting ports, and allowed them to really put their painstakingly assembled gaming setups through their paces. Instead, performance-wise Unity is a janky, ragged mess that only occasionally shows glimpses of its full potential. When the game’s not stuttering to a halt it’s an enjoyable enough Assassin’s Creed adventure, though it’s one that lacks the ambition to really breathe new life into the franchise.\n\nLet’s start on a positive note. The game’s recreation of revolutionary Paris is the most beautiful, believable city environment I’ve ever seen in a video game. Clamber to the top of Notre Dame as the sun rises and you can’t help but admire the beauty of the lighting engine as the pale orange light dawns across a painstaking recreation of Parisian architecture, from the back-alley grime of the proles’ quarter to the ludicrous opulence of Versailles and the noble districts. It’s breathtaking.\n\nUntil you look too closely. Then you begin to notice them; a levitating civilian there, a moon-walking royalist here, a man’s trousers sticking out a hedge for no particular reason that I can fathom. A few hours into the game, and Paris is no longer a beautifully realised location, but an endless exhibition of bugs and glitches. Most are annoying or amusing rather than game-breaking, but added together they’re concrete proof that Unity simply wasn’t ready to be released.\n\nIt’s a shame, because there are some great ideas here. The new movement controls add up and down buttons for parkour, which finally does away, for the most part anyway, with the old Assassin’s Creed problem of accidentally hurling yourself off a roof when you’re trying to shimmy down to the street. There’s some neat animation work as Arno skips for beam to window ledge to market stall, and it makes evading enemies far more smooth and satisfying. Issues still arise – I had more trouble entering a house through the window than I did with the majority of Unity’s boss battles – but generally I think the basic movement here is the best the series has ever achieved.\n\nOh, and there’s finally a stealth button. Being able to crouch and therefore not instantly get spotted is so overdue for this franchise that I shed a few tears of pure joy when I first used it. Stealth in Unity is still a bit of a hit and miss affair for an assassination game, with far too little opportunity to predict and react to enemy soldiers’ movements, but that simple button removes a lot of the frustration from instant-fail sneaking missions.\n\nMuch of the complexities that the franchise had piled onto its counter-heavy fighting system by the time Black Flag was released have been removed. You’ve now got two basic moves, a parry and a strike. Counters will no longer set up enemies for an instant kill, and enemies are far more aggressive, which means you can no longer stand stock still in the middle of a horde of soldiers, neatly stabbing each one who attacks you in the throat. Animation hiccups drag the simple fun down again, though. I lost count of the times Arno stabbed an enemy despite pointing in a completely different direction, or a guard somersaulted awkwardly into the air upon his death.\n\nStory-wise Unity seems like an attempt on Ubisoft’s part to draw a line under the increasingly baffling franchise storyline. Though Unity does nod to the ‘colonial era’ of Assassin’s Creed, this is very much a standalone tale. The modern meta-narrative has been peeled away, leaving the barest framework to set up the story and omitting any modern-day parkour shenanigans or Black Flag-style office work slash spying. I’ve personally always found the modern day aspects of the series deeply distracting, and I think sticking to one story helps the narrative flow a great deal.\n\nThis is one of the series’ better tales. Arno is a likeable protagonist, and though his arc from roustabout noble to agile killer is maybe a little quick and easy, he’s got more motivation than Edward Kenway and more charm than AC3’s Connor. He’s Ezio mark two, essentially, and he’s enjoyable company. The story zips along nicely, and although it never reaches beyond Dan Brown-style conspiracy theory nonsense, it entertained me well enough. Though at some point someone needs to point out to the Assassins and Templars that they’re boring, humourless sods. Wouldn’t it be cool to play a Creed game where you work for neither of these self-absorbed institutions?\n\nOutside campaign missions there’s plenty to do, but it’s definitely a case of quantity over quality. Paris is swamped, absolutely plastered in side-missions and collectibles, but for the most part they’re simple collection or assassination jobs. The new ideas, like several murder mystery events dotted around, are a passable distraction, but there’s nothing here that comes anywhere near to the rollicking naval fun of Black Flag.\n\nUnity also loves to fill up the screen with an obnoxious amount of clutter and pointless complexity. There’s four different kinds of currency, and the same number of types of chests, each of which need to have their own specific goals met before you can open them. It’s odd to see Unity be so awkward and ungainly when you look at the fantastic exploration and rewards available in Ubisoft’s other big open world game  Far Cry 4.\n\nCompleting these side-missions earns you cash, weapons, or costume parts for your own personal Arno, who can then hop into a friend’s game In co-op play. So far my experience with the multiplayer has been marred by connection issues, but when it works it’s decent fun. It feels like an afterthought rather than a main feature, though. Assassination missions aren’t particularly interesting or challenging, and stealthy heists are just too frustrating to bother going through with a friend. Ubisoft is right to experiment with co-op multiplayer in the series, but it needs to be a main focus during development.\n\nIf you can put up with the stuttering performance and some comically ridiculous bugs then there’s a decent Assassin’s Creed experience to be found in Unity. The fact that it’s never more than decent makes those glaring technical issues much, much harder to excuse. Despite some good ideas and an entertaining tale, this isn’t a revolution for the franchise. Considering the hype and the promises made compared to the final experience, it actually feels like a step backwards.","December 5, 2015","true","113.6"," 327 of 390 people (84%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","84","327","390","33","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinabey/recommended/289650/","sinabey","sina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinabey/","244 products in account","Update: Unity lowered the bar to such a point that almost all the positive comments recommend the game because IT CAN RUN. The sympathy for the game is bordering Stockholm Syndrome. It is praised for doing what exactly every single game should be able to do: execute. It’s almost brilliant and a great business model, too: 1) Release a game with no content that cannot run. 2) Fix all the bugs. 3) Profit.\n\nFirst of all Unity is actually a decent game but since this is supposed to be a part of the Assassin’s Creed storyline, it miserably fails to fit in, hence the vote down.\n\nSecondly, of course, spoilers.\n\nThe overall feel of Unity is more like a fan fiction project with an enormous budget rather than a proper, canonical installment.\n\nI think the most important thing that I would have liked to know before buying Unity is this: It has NO ADVANCE IN THE MODERN DAY STORY ARC. Apart from the occasional server change ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (which I think is a lazy excuse to include the Eiffel Tower in the game) there is nothing happening today.\n\nHonestly I gave up on expecting any good story material after playing AC3, because the compelling and coherent story of the first civilization and their artifacts that will help prevent the 2012 apocalypse ended with Desmond. The story as it was revealed up to that point didn’t require the juno plot twist to be any better.\n\nIn Black Flag the sages were introduced, which were only conceptually replacing the artifacts. But I still had no problem with it, because the reason I play the games is the beautifully complex story that actually takes place today, which has layers and layers of narration embedded in each other. Like the way the game used to be about the modern day assassin Desmond, living Ezio’s life, who has visions of Altair and the way these characters are interconnected centuries apart (the last speech of Ezio in Masyaf).\n\nBut the good side is that you do not have to be annoyed about not being able to replay modern day missions, since there are none.\n\nMaybe I’m mistaken but I remember an interview, explaining this initiate thing to be a way of supporting the immersion of the game play, that the player would indeed feel like the person who is actually in the animus. Well, it does not. and I do not. When there was this confused, interacting, afraid deep within and overall relatable Desmond, I cared about his story. His layer of narration was the buffer between the animus and the actual game. His presence was a mental bridge; he was there to suggest the mode of interaction and how to feel. Now that the game has no modern day content, no outer layer of narration that I can relate to and is based on a complete rehash of the finding artifacts plot with the one key difference that there is no cataclysmic end game like the DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH, it is reduced to some kind of assassination simulation.\n\nAs it is stated by many other players, now the fighting is much, much better. It is more realistic that you can’t take 30 people at once.\n\nUnless you use the smoke bomb generously.\n\nI was one of the people who thought the fighting should be more challenging and I actually liked this improvement at first, but the fact that it is easily overcome by buying powerful enough gear and smoke bombs, does not make me believe that this is a genuine attempt to make it realistic, but rather a way to make players grind points, or much better, buy helix points to upgrade. The new fighting mechanism doesn’t require skill, it requires points. At some point, I ended up running into lifts like an idiot to collect extra creed points for a sword. There are nice improvements but all of them feel contrived.\n\nPlus, since with enough smoke bombs, skill and gear the fighting is exactly the same, the only difference now is that you don’t see a damn thing through the shroud of the smoke while fighting. Or you can activate the eagle sense, of course, so now you’re fighting luminescent, solid colored bald figures.\n\nUnity adds nothing to the main story arc and everything in the game is a rehash of an old concept, without proper justification (unless you count being cool as a legitimate reason). I could completely skip this installment and I wouldn’t miss anything story-wise:\n\nLike Arno owning the Cafe Theatre is analogous of Ezio owning a town. But, well, Ezio is a ♥♥♥♥ing landlord! Why does the Assassin Brotherhood just give away the entire income of a huge cafe to this one seemingly insignificant new recruit?\n\nWhat is the proper justification of the ancients devising a lightning sword, which is analogous of the apples and the shroud, that teleports to undefined distances? The apples and the shroud that was always there at every turning point of human history, as opposed to the sword which is there as a nice gimmick and an end game reward.\n\nWhy nobody is freaking over the existence of such sword and looking for it, instead of looking for the body of a man, who was explained to be an identical genetic copy of another man with the identical set of memories, who was already captured dead in the previous title?\n\nSeriously, where is that sword? Doesn’t the existence of such an artifact implies an additional title on Arno, where the modern day Assassins try and find the sword before the evil reverse engineers of Abstergo?\n\nWhere did this Desmond-replacement, unnamed initiate come from? Desmond was held captive by Abstergo and later rescued by the Assassins. Why is this person agreeing a possible lobotomy and why should I relate myself to such an immaterial idiot? The stakes were real in the story for Desmond, because he was there in flesh and bone. And really, in AC:R, his consciousness was [able to get] trapped in the animus, since he was introduced as a separate character (and a plot device) than the actual player. Since the initiate is an avatar of the player, We know that there is no risk of brain damage that will change the course of the modern day story, thus anything Shaun says is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to make the game sound cool.\n\nWhat happened to the bleeding effect? Is the initiate being trained now? For what? Or is this an upgraded animus that doesn’t cause the bleeding effect? If so, then, is it actually a downgrade?\n\nWhat is the deal with Arno’s eagle sense? Why are they making up new, ambiguous powers as they go along? When was the “super smelling” power introduced? Why Arno and no one else has the power of sharing consciousness with a dying person? If the eagle sense was a genetic trait coming down from the first civilization as explained in previous games, isn’t it supposed to be more powerful as you go backward in the inheritance tree and not other way around?\n\nWhy is everyone British? Of course they will have some accent after all, but why such a distinctive one? Just because there are palaces and it is Europe? With the nasal sounding butler and other characters, saying pretentious ♥♥♥♥ like “*rse” or “myes sire”?\n\nIf the entire Helix and Abstergo Entertainment subplot is their new immersion trick, how am I supposed to feel immersed while being asked to pay actual money for upgrades?\n\nWhy is Ubisoft doing this to the franchise?\n\nSo all in all, if you are a loyal fan of the series, you’ll disregard all the negative comments, including this one and play the game anyway. That’s what I did, because I was curious about the progress in the main story arc, which turned out to be nonexistent.\n\nIf you are new to the series, please do yourself a favour and go start from Ezio’s story. Assassin’s Creed Unity is the single most beautiful Nvidia showreel I have ever seen and nothing more.\n\nThe game of course had its few moments, which I will not spoil, the graphics were gorgeous and the soundtrack was the best so far (bar the Revelations main theme). But I could be completely fine with watching few scenes online and listening to the soundtrack of “Tous les matins du monde” instead.","June 23, 2015","false","30.6"," 573 of 713 people (80%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","80","573","713","55","45"

It took me from 2008 to 2010 to actually beat the first game just because I played it on and off from time to time, but when I finished it and saw the ending, I was immediately pulled in and bought the rest of the games so far (retail AC1, PS3 Black Flag, waiting for Rogue on PC). And when I saw a trailer for this game I instantly wanted it, without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nAfter about two months of nonstop bashing (from me and others, just by me witnessing all the reports) because of the game's flaws and errors, I decided to finally buy the game and try it myself, seeing as I'm some foolish customer who doesn't want to believe my game has been broken beyond all repair.\n\n- EVGA GTX 660 Superclocked 2GB\n- 16GB DDR3 RAM @1600Mhz\n- Intel Core i7 4770K @3.9GHz\n- ASUS Z87-Pro Motherboard\n\nThere's not a single reason out there that these specs, which I bought just earlier this year, should not run any new game at least on medium-high settings. But Unity disagrees. Greatly.\n\n- Frame dips in random areas for no apparent reason (yet ironically crowds don't drop a single frame for me).\n- Microstutter when VSync is on anything but "Adaptive" setting.\n- One to ten second stutter when resolution is changed/edited or after changing the Ambient Occlusion setting.\n- Co-op play causes microstutter regardless of whether I fixed it beforehand.\n- Controls on both gamepad and keyboard and mouse not responding properly or at all sometimes (Logitech F710 and MIcrosoft Sidewinder X4 w/ Gigabyte Krypton gaming mouse).\n- Visuals are nothing stellar to begin with and changing Texture/Environment Quality settings do nothing for the game (as with Bloom) visually, yet hinder the already bad framerate even more.\nAnd the list can go on, I'm sure. I just haven't encountered anything else worth noting yet.\n\nAs excited as I was for this game before its release, and after buying the game for roughly $40 and experiencing it firsthand, this is an utter disappointment and Ubisoft needs to fix the broken mess they call a "game" or else their reputation will become even more tainted than it already is at this point. I'm absolutely disappointed in Ubisoft Montréal for this garbage that allowed for true Assassin's Creed co-operation with our friends that somehow bypassed playtesting to be rushed and released to the public. As many times as we've all heard the phrase, "The customer is always right," it certainly seems to be true in this case. Do not take my specs, look at them, and assume that it's obvious I can't play the game because my video card doesn't meet the supposed minimum spec. Instead look at those who far surpass the minimum and required specs by far and wonder how they can have the same problems, and potentially more.\n\nShame on you, Ubisoft.\n\n\nEDIT: Apparently enemies can aggro onto me through various walls at various locations, even when they aren't even looking at my general direction. Had I know that stopping my mission for a small moment to pick the lock to a chest would have caused approximately fifteen (yeah, 15, FIFTEEN) enemies to become hostile and clip through walls in a bloody attempt to kill me over the 250 money I looted, I'd have not done it. Ubisoft forgot to mention that the game features wallhacks for enemies.\n\nEDIT 2: After awhile, it's still broken at the API level. Ubisoft, what's going on? Are you still not going to fix this mess? I mean, it performs just as badly on Xbox One and PS4, so maybe that's a hint that something is wrong with the software. Oh, but don't worry. They don't HAVE to fix it, but it would certainly be nice.\n\nEDIT 3: (March 25, 2016) Moved from GTX 660 to R9 390. Game is still broken, unplayable.

That is noticeable. Yet, alas... I can still only run on "Low Quality". Minor issue, more less personal taste. At least it runs better while roaming around for goodies or being able to sneak about.\n\nHowever, If I am attacked by 4+ hostiles the game freezes and lags up still. Making defending (Parry) next to impossible. Using smoke bombs then only amplifies the lag.\n\nIn larger area's where the crowd is more dominate I will have issues with "locking-up". Even more so if being chased and shot at.\n\nSpeaking of which, please do something about enemy targeting with their guns. I mean, I'll sit there and watch a cutscene in story mode. Those guys couldn't hit anything if it were right in front of them. Yet, gameplay wise, these guys have DEAD ON accuracy. Dodging does not help. Sometimes dropping smoke does not help because they can magically see through it. For the love of god, please make them miss here and there. /end rant.\n\nI've also noted missions that have you "Defend" a target are not working properly and had to restart the memory. What happens is that they get "stuck" and no longer follow you. I don't know if this was an issue or not seeing as I only reached those stories as Patch 4 dropped.\n\nPlaying Multiplayer, Every other mission causes my game to crash if I play online, searching for people or playing with a friend. BUT, If I play Locally, being on the same internet network, the game runs smooth and I never crash. Few glitches here and there. Having a target see me through a wall as an example. Other wise, aside from the expected lag (after searching or non local) I haven't stumbled upon any other issues.\n\nThe customize menu (Gear/equipment load out) is still rather laggy and is not enjoyable at all.\n\nThat's all I was able to notice so far. Still, a very sad panda. Since this was supposed to fix a lot of issues. Which, in a sense it did. But, I'm still locking up and crashing (multiplayer, non-local).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lh1983/recommended/289650/","lh1983","Dunyain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lh1983/","281 products in account","This game is what happens when Ubisoft listens to its fans.\n\nWait, wait. Hear me out.\n\nFor years, "fans" of the AC series have asked for certain things: dedicated stealth buttons, more stealth gameplay, better variation in mission types, extra things to do, collectibles, achievements, better combat... and AC: Unity represents an attempt to give fans what they want.\n\nThere's a reason fans aren't game designers, however. Ask a kid what he wants for dinner every night, and you're liable to get ice cream as a response. But you know, as I do, that ice cream is not an acceptable dinner food.\n\nAC: Unity, representing a "crowdsourced" AC game, is ice cream for dinner. It's things you think you want, things that in moderation may be great, but when thrown together, end up just being bad for you.\n\nWhich is not to say that the game is bad, per se. The game is mediocre. Arno is a mediocre protagonist, akin to Connor or Altair. He lacks Ezio's roguish charm or Edward's roguish roguery. He doesn't have the personality of Shay or Aveline. In that regard, he's much more of a "blank slate," easy to step into the shoes of, but ultimately, a little flat.\n\nThe game also features very little bleed-in from the modern day story line, again something "fans" have been clamoring for, and again, something that doesn't feel right for the series. The series' more annoying moments (tail missions, instant fail missions, anything with Desmond, etc.) served to highlight its truly bright points. The series has never been a "stealth" game series. It's historical tourism with a side of stabbing simulator. It's a third person action game with wonky, yet familiar, controls. AC: Unity tries to change that, and in what ends up feeling the most like a video game, also feels like a shift away from what made the series popular, even if it wasn't always the toast of aficionados on gaming forums.\n\nWhat good can be said about the game? It's beautiful. Obviously, Ubisoft put a lot of work into the new engine, but the edges are rough. This is a craftsperson's first try with new tools, and it shows. However, it's plain enough to see that as the engine matures and the technical bugs get ironed out, it will produce some simply stunning graphics and gameplay.\n\nThe game also has some innovative features: the murder mysteries, for example, are great. We've been master assassins and soldiers long enough. Let's have a Great Detective Assassin character, a rollicking mix of Holmes and Batman. The gear customization is also a nice change.\n\nBut what are we missing? Series mainstays like Assassin Tombs, variation in mission types (a problem with ACIII and AC:U, it seems). Rewarding combat (AC:U penalizes you for getting into combat. I suppose this is supposed to make you play more stealthily, but see above: stealth is not a strong suit of a game with janky controls and odd rules about line of sight). A well-written premise. I feel like we were cheated out of our Pere Dumas-inspired storyline for some crap about a murder we don't get to care about because we hardly know any of the characters. Even the star-crossed Templar/Assassin lovers storyline is downplayed for, what, the 30th time we've seen a bildungsroman about a young protagonist who totally doesn't want to follow Mom and Dad's creed, yo, only to realize by the end of the game that the Creed is worthwhile and the evil Templars must be stopped? It was cool when Ezio did it. It wore thin with Connor. Matt Ryan's performance as Edward saved that storyline, and now again we've got flat-voiced Arno learning that the world is a bigger place than he thought when he was young? Yawn. Yawn yawn yawn.\n\nI think Ubisoft's heart was in the right place, but the execution fell flat. If AC:U is nothing more than a game hastily constructed around a tech demo for the next-gen AC engine, then it makes sense. If they meant this to be a full game, it's a sour note in the AC symphony. Still, there's enough good elements here to work with that I think the series still has a bright future.","March 11, 2015","true","25.3"," 741 of 946 people (78%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","78","741","946","69","27"

It's nothing new in relative to the rest of the series. Very similar formula to the games preceding it not counting Black Flag. Graphically, it looks very impressive and the new parkour and animation system system is something I consider to be a vast improvement to all other games in the series. The story is pretty bland which is a shame because playing it you can tell that it want's to be good but can't quite muster it. Ubisoft has filled the world fun little sidequests and collectables for you to nab ranging from tedious to geniunely interesting or fun. The customization is alright but it is hampered by the fact that Ubisoft thought it was a good idea to lock at least half of it until they decide to release a multiplayer game mode. It also suffers from collectables that are locked unless you have access to the companion app, which is just stupid. Not to mention their clearly forced in microtransactions that they must have tossed in there in the last five minutes. I will say that Ubisoft does not force anyone to buy these microtransactions as within 6 to 8 hours of playing you can accumulate a pretty substantial in-game fortune. While I do have these grievances with the game I would like to reiterate that I do actually enjoy it. I want to play it. But Ubisoft's broken release is actually now preventing me launching the game at all. I played for a good few hours with no glitches apparent, but then it started with the frame drops which I can't stand. So I stopped playing for several days only to hop back on today and find that the frame drops had disappeared. Then just an hour ago, I decided that I would play some more, but I was hit the ACUnity.exe has stopped working, and after trying all available fixes I have given up. It would be a crime to recommend the game in it's current state to others. The reason I am writing this review is because Ubisoft can't provide me with the product that I stupidly paid for. So instead, this time that should be spent enjoying my purchase is being used writing this review in hopes that I may deter at least one person from spending money on this product in it's current build so that they may not have to suffer my fate.","November 20, 2014","false","54.7"," 235 of 280 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","235","280","0","0"

If future patches fix the existing bugs and optimize the games performance, it may well be a game worth playing. I certainly hope so, because I have long been a fan of the seriees. However, I would currently go so far as to claim that the product I recieved is not the product that I was told that I was purchasing.\n\nMy PC is no powerhouse. It's not as though I was expecting to play this on ultra. But my computer either exceeds, meets or falls very slightly short of the "recommended" system requirements. For the record CPU: Intel i7-4770 @ 3.4ghz (Better than). RAM: 8G(same as) Video Card: GTX 760 (slightly below). All well above the minimum system requirements. I didn't expect mindblowing, but I did expect smooth and playable.\n\nIn order to achieve an acceptable framerate (and by acceptable I mean not having half second pauses every three or four seconds) I have to set the graphics settings to the lowest possible, across the board. Even then, I experience texture pop ins at remarkably close range, inexplicable framerate drops and stuttering (especially in cutscenes, oddly).\n\nAt lowest settings the game is playable, on a machine which meets the recommended system requirements. To me, meeting the recommended requirements ought to mean that I have a computer which is capable of delivering, more or less, the experience that the developers intended. If my experience is that which was intended then... AC: Unity is not a game you want to play. And if I, running at a system fairly close to the "recommended" system, am experiencing these kinds of problems (at low!), I can only imagine the experience of those who purchased it for play on systems which only meet the "minimum system requirements"\n\nBottom Line: There are people playing on machines far, far superior to mine reporting substantial graphical issues. And I, with a decent PC, can only run this game well on the lowest settings. As a fan of the AC series... Don't buy it. And possibly send an angry letter to Ubisoft.","November 14, 2014","false","9.5"," 168 of 191 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","168","191","0","0"

I like to think it will be a very fair, unbiased review.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, the game itself is awesome. The feeling of immersion I get from playing it is literally unmatched. Just walking around, I get the feeling that the NPC's are all real people with lives and things. You'll be running around and see people protesting at Notre Dame, people running away carrying items they looted, etc. The city looks both absolutely stunning and on the brink of chaos all at the same time. The free-running aspect has been much improved, but there are still instances where the game won't fully understand where I'm trying to point Arno and instead run him up a random lightpost mid chase. Assassination missions are completely open to however you want to go about it. You get heavily rewarded for utilizing the stealth aspect of the game, and not running into a situation guns blazing and sword swinging. I rate the game itself a 9/10.\n\nBut should you buy the game right now? Absolutely not. Unless you have a super high-end PC, you won't get above 30 FPS as it is now. I have a GTX 660, overclocked to 1385 MHz, 8 GBs of ram, and a Core i5 4670k, and even when I turn the game down to 720p and use FXAA anti-aliasing, the game doesn't seem to get much above 20-25 FPS. I watched a screen cap on youtube of a guy who claims to be running the game with 2 GTX 980's in SLI and he didn't get much above 45-50 FPS, and that's over $1,100 in graphics alone. I highly doubt this is something Ubisoft can fix with a simple patch considering I believe this is a problem within the core of the game itself. Not only that, it's incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes I'll load it up and it will play just fine, other times it will crash as soon as it starts having changed no settings whatsoever. Co-op is a nightmare right now. Not only is it horrible to try and connect to a game, but UPlay frequently is down.\n\nTL;DR: The game is awesome. But don't buy it unless you have no friends who are interested in playing with you and a gaming optimized high-end PC.","November 16, 2014","false","20.2"," 237 of 285 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","237","285","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antiup/recommended/289650/","antiup","エンゼル","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antiup/","30 products in account","I have been a huge fan of the series since the first game that premiered in November of 2007. This game was a huge let down to me. Ubisoft totally dropped the ball on this one. You should probably know by now that this game has major performance issues and microtransactions. But my major problem with this game is its gameplay. Considering the fact that it was developed over the span of four years with the collaboration of countless Ubisoft studios, this is just unacceptable.\n\nHere are my problems with the game:\n\n1. The fact that there is basically no longer a weapon wheel. The new weapon wheel no longer give players the option to equip a hidden blade or your fists as a weapon. Why ubisoft? Why limit the amount of weapons the Assassin can equip? Also why limit the duration of eagle vision?\n\n2. The story. The story is basically just *spoiler alert* Arno and Elise taking revenge on a Templar whose name is Germain. That is it. No more no less. You don't know the characters enough to get attached them. There is zero character development, like how *spoiler alert* Arno's dad is murdered in the beginnig of the story but Arno never questions why, and Ubisoft decides instead to just keep making missions about him retrieving his watch.The story feels incomplete and boring and dull in comparison to Ezio's story in Assassin's Creed 2 or any assassin in the series.\n\n3. The story takes place during the french revolution yet I don't feel like I was really in the French Revolution while playing it. There are tons of NPCs with waving French flags yelling "Long live the revolution" but I felt more annoyed with them than anything. They make the streets of Paris nearly impossible to traverse through. There are "crowd events" that you can participate in to make you interact with the NPCs but they are tedious and very repetitive. From my interactions with crowd events within the game, a majority of them are just "kill these criminals" or "tackle the thief". Very dissapointing.\n\n4. Not only was the story very boring, I felt like there wasn't enough of a focus on the story mode. With the introduction of Co-op missions, Paris stories, Murder stories, etc, they shifted the focus of the story to all these other modes. To me, Assassin's Creed has always been about the story. It's what makes the games interesting. In this game however, with all these modes, every game mode just feels incomplete.\n\n5. The new combat system. I guess Ubisoft hasn't heard the phrase: "If it isn't broke, don't fix it". Why change the counter-attack combat system that Assassin's Creed has had since the first game? Fans love it, why change it?\n\n6. Time Anomaly, though it is a very pretty sight to see Paris in its different time periods, this addition to the game felt incomplete as well.\n\n7. There is zero modern day story progression in this game. How does Arno play into the modern day story?  Who is Bishop? Why does she matter? The only thing we've learned in this game is the triple helix.\n\nIn conclusion, Assassin's Creed Unity tried to renew its series and accomplish everything within one game but they instead failed miserably and fall short of a fresh start.","November 15, 2014","false","29.0"," 229 of 279 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","229","279","0","0"

The map, while quite large, is splattered with collectibles, some of which you can't even get without using the mobile app.\n\nIt seems like this game is trying to do too much at once without focusing on story or character development.  Arno is a weak character, and doesn't hold together well.  Even Connor from AC3 was a better character development.\n\nThat being said, the game itself is gorgeous to the eyes.  However, since the framerate stutters constantly, it's hard to appreciate it.  Ubisoft should have pushed this out a while, and now they're trying to scramble to patch it and apologize for screwing up to save face with the community.  Too late on that front for several people.  I regret pre-ordering the game, and honestly can't recommend this to anyone.  While some ideas are great, such as the new movement, both up and down buildings, or going inside of buildings, or the murder mysteries; the overall feel of the game is lackluster.\n\nWait for a year for them to fix it and pick it up on a steam sale.  Can't recommend it until then.","December 1, 2014","false","29.7"," 252 of 311 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","252","311","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoC_TR/recommended/289650/","LoC_TR","LoC_TR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoC_TR/","101 products in account","***UPDATED***\n\nFirst off I'd like to say that I knew what I was getting into when I dropped the 60$ on this game. I knew Ubisoft's previously release of Watch_Dogs was sub par, I had also pre ordered that game as well. I also knew that my specs were borderline minimum when it came to the horsepower required to run the game.\n\nBUGS\n\nI didn't expect to run the games top notch graphics settings, and thats not even where my gripe is. There were obvious bugs right from the start that weren't caused by my hardware. If you have a mid-range computer I would definitely find this game a tough sell.\n\n*Some cut scenes would just skip part of the scene and place me ahead of the story line. It would also do this if I died during a cut scene instance. It just didn't seem like it was very streamlined.\n\n*The shadow flickering was horrendous and almost stopped me from playing altogether. I played around with some graphics settings (which are sparse) and finally got it to stop.\n\n*Constant stuttering. While I understand this could be hardware related, I went ahead and tested it in various parts of the maps. My character continues to stutter even in areas with very low clutter.\n\n*I'm sure you've heard about the hair glitch, floating hair that seems to drift at odd times.\n\n*The "Initiate" program doesn't seem to work for me when I attempt to do anything with it. (more on this later)\n\n*Ai just acting straight up odd. Glitching through roofs, floors, running in odd areas. (kinda like all the previous games including watch_dogs)\n\n*A few CTD's (could be hardware)\n\nSTORY/ GAMEPLAY (**NO SPOILERS**)\n\nOutside of the bugs I enjoyed myself quite a bit, with a few hiccups along the way.\n\n*The main missions are a ton of fun and you have quite a few choices to make when tackling these.\n\n*The parkour is better than the last few installments and is probably the best part about the game as a whole. Trekking the city and just looking at every detail that goes into each inch of the world. Unfortunately the movement is plagued by many of the same issues such as, you're still frequently getting stopped in your tracks from either bad pathing, or odd obstacles. The downward parkour (new) is nice for sure but doesn't act how i expected either. Sometimes Arno jumps impossible heights without taking damage or suffers from the same issues as the upward parkour and goes a path you didn't wish him too. Some paths that seem like they should be, are not.\n\n*The combat is much slower imo and rugged, it's fun but there isn't really anything revolutionary about it. In the beginning the enemies seem to be tougher but there are only a few enemy models so their patterns are easy to learn over time.\n\n*It seems to be that they tried to make this game much tougher without certain upgrades from either your equipment or weapons. While I'm a veteran gamer I enjoy the challenge this brings. I can imagine a more casual gamer getting frustrated over how the parkour, combat, and AI work together. Maybe even frustrated enough to buy some "hack" points? (**We'll talk about this later**"\n\n*The side quests are mostly one dimensional requiring you to fetch something or kill this, some of them have arcs that keep going. The eventual feel of these quests is grinding though.\n\n*They mix in a combination of 5 or so random crowd events (pickpocket, criminal, police vs revolutionaries, templar vs whomever.) these happen often and you get rewards for doing them. They are redundant to say the least.\n\n*None of the characters are really that intriguing. They seems to be cookie cutter Templar vs Assassin attitude.\n\n*The crowds themselves are quite massive but, but for the most part they stick to a particular spots. Theres obviously roaming people from street to street, but there doesn't seem to a concious of the AI. Once again there are only so many models and some many outfits/colors. They don't react to you directly or your deeds you've accomplished. I kinda expected the city to be more "alive," at the time period it was a very turbulent and the city was of the edge. This is not the feeling the game gives off at all.\n\n*Customization is better than the previous installments but once again nothing revolutionary. There are plenty of outfits and you can individually pick head, chest, pants, gloves, and belt. You CAN NOT choose your own colors but from the pallets given which include three colors per pallet.\n\n*Menu's are a step up from the last couple games but seem to be super laggy. Map loads laggy, and there is like a billion icons on it ( you can choose which ones show up but there are still things that pop up that you can even access like Red and Gold chests)\n\n*I managed to do one Co-op mission without friends, either people disconnect, or leave. Some just troll. I did not try again because it was annoying. It sucks that i'm driven away by this type of feature.\n\n\nMONEY STUFF\n\nThis is where we get to the money game, which they seem to have put an awful lot of time. There are several currencies:\n\nFranks are used to buy consumables, outfits, weapons, and property.\n\nAC points(whatever that symbol is) which is a "abstergo" increment of money used to upgrade weapons and buy colors for the outfits.\n\nHack points are the microtransaction increment. You can buy everything in the game with these points if you have the real life dolla bills to throw down. This is where I get a little irritated. What it feels like they're doing is slowing down progression in various ways.. getting to places feels slower (possibly because our character runs slower on a 1:1 ratio of paris? Idk), combat is slower. Leveling seems to take forever, which also means I don't get to use all of the abilities throughout the entirety of the story.\n\nIn combination with the Initiate program... which you have to sign up for.. to unlock certain items.. so that you can eventually buy them. There is also mobile apps i've yet to download that unlock other in game ♥♥♥♥. This also allows you to open up certain Red and Gold chests. So basically theres stuff in the game that you can do because you haven't downloaded all the crap yet on all your devices.\n\nSo what this feels like to me is a they've added a grind to the game so you either\n\n*dump tons of time into if you want to complete everything, and buy everything.\n\n*OR buy upwards of 100$ worth Hack points so can buy better equipment earlier, or buy boosts to level up or w/e.\n\nIf ACU was just a parkour game it would be ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, it's not though. A lot of things seem forced, I really just want to play my video game without have to download a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bs apps and add-on ♥♥♥♥ to get the whole experience. The microtransactions I will never touch, nice try tho. Why would you spend any money at all to cheat a game? It seems really ♥♥♥♥ing backwards, and I just generally hate the thought of it.\nI enjoyed the gameplay a lot, I really did, but there are too many things that are buzzkills for me. At the top of the list is the attempt to control too much. There is such a fierce grasp around this game I feel the developers let slip too many things through the cracks. The graphics are next gen for sure, the gameplay and story telling is not. On top of all of that is the bugs, which I wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about if they actually wanted to improve the core of this game. I expected the flow between the parkour and combat to be much more fluid but it seems to be relatively the same with a few minor changes. When games start to bring these kind of emotions out of people you wonder why they backlash so hard at the developers.\nThis review is based almost entirely on gameplay, the actual launch with the bugs didn't irk me as much as some of the actual in-game features. Though that doesn't mean it's acceptable. 6/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgpzT5V5Mgs","November 11, 2014","false","20.9"," 1,079 of 1,442 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","079","1","0","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonerandomguy/recommended/289650/","thatonerandomguy","That One Random Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonerandomguy/","528 products in account","I'm a hardcore fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but just seeing how they messed this up was just disappointing; and besides marking the obvious bugs and FPS drops with this game's release. I plan on telling about some bugs that most people didn't play enough to see. (unless you have - in that case -  you know what I'm talking about)\n\nThe first bug being related to  Parkour , which has gotten a overhaul; but not complete. I am disappointed to say that the Parkour is even more broken then it was in previous games. I find it frustrating that Arno will assume to climb things within his body's height (like random crates, miscellaneous clutter, and market stands) with the "Run" action. There is the "Free-Run Upwards" and "Free-Run Downwards" actions to fully control the elevation of his Parkour; why not fully contribute to the system and make it so Arno will not randomly start hoping from crate to crate when being chased by enemies?\n\nI find many issues with the shimmying (which in parkour term is to shift left or right while hanging on a ledge), he is unable to shift his body left nor right at certain angles and on certain buildings. One example of crappy shimmying is the Co-op Mission "Woman's March" when you have to assassinate the gate-base captains. If you climb up on the right building (has one of the captains on the roof) and shimmy across the ledges (in which has windows below the ledges); you come up with Arno trying to shift across the window, but ultimately failing and ending up in a hanging animation.\n\nAnother problem that occurs to me, is the  button choice  and  delay for combat . I play with an *NEW* Xbox Controller (the fact that I use a controller still shouldn't affect the button choice), which I find very fluent and great; however, the button choice for "Block"/"Sheath" and "Loot" are very awful. Although the "Block" and "Loot" have been used in previous games, its not those actions I find most annoying; its the "Sheath" action which CAN disrupt combat and end up with Arno putting his sword away and getting DESTROYED! Further more with getting destroyed, I find delays within the actions that Arno does. Examples being "Blocking" which at some points take no effect and Arno is left standing defense less. But lets not forget that when this happens, he is unable to attack nor dodge.\n\nAnd last but no least; the most annoying problem I face (and I believe others do as well) is that  THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION  between other players. All you can do is mark targets and hope that they won't go charging in like a bunch of idiots. It happened on too many cases where we would all fail because of one guy charging in like a ♥♥♥♥♥, then killed like a ******ed person getting hunted down by Navy Seal Team 6. And don't say "use the voice chat on Uplay", It's in freaking Beta and doesn't work for this game. I tried it with my friends and with random people, and nothing seemed to project my voice into the game; even thought I test my mic on Uplay and it works fine. It's just not implemented into this game! (aka  IT DOESN'T WORK ) And I am VERY sure that others can agree with me on this bad communication factor.\n\nI hope others can see these bugs within the game too, and support my arguments about this game's flaws. And don't get me wrong, I love the game and completely think that this game will be amazing with all these problems diminished from the game's first release. I just wish that this game was at least delayed or set on a later date to fully create this game with minimum bugs that could be fixed easier. I just wish this game was able to live up to its full potential...\n\nP.S. Other Fan Boys of this Series; Don't get me wrong, I would love to love this game, but it just really let me down. I've been psyched about this game for over a year, and it coming out like THIS! No, that will not do for me dudes - that is NOT okay to build everyone up then throw them down. And I know that this isn't entirely the developer team's fault, Ubisoft has been doing this for a while now. But by them doing this to Assassin's Creed, that went WAY too far now. I just really wish the developers would have at lease post-pone the release date to fix EVERYTHING before giving us buggy crap. However, maybe they had no control over the time - maybe only Ubisoft held control and they had to obey. And Lastly - to everyone - before you judge me for what I say above, remember: " Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted " - Ezio Auditore (My favorite Assassin)","November 21, 2014","false","43.4"," 227 of 282 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","227","282","0","8"

People seem to think I hate the game, but I am just pointing out the faults.  It is fun, (don't get me wrong) but not nearly as fun as it should be, with very little replayability.  Here are my problems:\n-poorly optimized\n-terrible story+character development\n-very few coop missions\n-terrible coop missions\n-not as much gear variation as implied\n-clubs are still buggy\n-loot system is terrible\n-combat system not that different\n\nHere are the two things that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off most, and sorry if its a rant.\n1: You can only have one character.  This is the first assassins creed with only one save spot.  I loved going through the campaign and starting fresh, but you cannot do this in ACU.  You can go back and do the missions, but its not the same.  I have all legendary gear, so its easy as can be, and just equipping old gear is not something I should have to do to have fun.  At this point in the game I have beaten the campaign and I'm waiting for the week long club competition to get more legendary stuff, but its boring.  I would compare it to an MMO with no end game, but instead of leveling another character, your stuck with who you have.  The most fun I had was with the campaign, but that is over now.\n\n2: The loot system is pathetic.  I thought completing heists or other coop missions would grant random loot, the better you do the better the gear is.  That is not the case.  Most coop missions have 3 pieces of gear, and upon completion you get one of them at random.  However, almost all the gear you get is terrible, so there is no reason to do coop missions for gear.  The way you get legendary gear is through club competition, which is the stupidest thing I have seen in an assassins creed game.  I now have to wait a whole week for a random piece of legendary gear to be the reward, then I have to win the club competition.  I prefer the payday 2 loot system to this, and for those that do not know the payday 2 loot system, every mission you complete you have a 1/3 chance at getting a randomly selected piece of gear. 140 hours of game time and I still havent gotten something I want.  This one is especially ranty, which I am sorry about. It is frustrating because there was so much potential and it was wasted.\n\nSome positives:\n+the time period is well done\n+Its back in a city, which is more fun to me, but that is opinion\n+the city is huge, so exploration is decent.\n+Still assassins creed, so fun enough for me to play.\n\nI am probably going to  still play the game from time to time, but it is not worth $60, there are many better games you can get for less, so at least wait for a deal.","January 9, 2015","false","75.3"," 185 of 226 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","185","226","12","4"

Here they are.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful landscape\nActive NPCs\nCo-op system\nReplayability\n\nMixed:\nStealth system: They made a sneak button which we were looking for. But it's still cleary unfinished. It's hard to change from corner to corner, it's harder than it should be to leave the corner. And you cannot jump over obstacles or kill over enemies when you are sneaked behind them.\n\nCons:\nFreerun: unfinished. You can climb from anywhere but where you want from. Climbing up and down is bugged.\nJumping: Arno is a spiderman and jumps over 20 meters.\nGraphics: Recommended stats on my computer, still play on the lowest quality.\nYou cannot pet dogs.\nForced story.\nForced main charachter.\nForced optimatisation.\nForced new freerun.\nForced game overall.\nTake a break ubisoft.\nShould have copied splinter cells, stealth system.\nYou stole my money ubisoft.\nGive them back.\nBack to the topic.\nPay to win: In that sense that you get the best armor from the start if you pay real money.\nMisleading instructions: Followed a guy for 15 mins who had ''tail'' on his head. Got bored and killed him. Completed the mission. (Chemical whateves the name of the mission)\nUnfriendly for newer players.\nBiggest bug simulator of all time 0/5.\nBig hype, bad result.\nForced kiss scene.\nGravity doesn't work.\nLeap of faiths through walls.\nCan't climb in the F***ING WINDOWS.\nForced ubisoft client.\nNo assassins that you can use.\nCannot assasinate 2 linear guys in one shot. (Which was implemented in ac 3)\nMoney pouch uses ammunition?\nGuards see you from 500m.\nSnipers have aimbots. Cannot dodge, cannot block. You just have to accept your faith and die when you see one taking a shot.\nTerrible hud that doesn't show clearly where the enemy is.\nEagle vision was a dissapointment.\n/Pros/ Made the game more stealth able. /pros/ Stealth is useless because you can just run in, smoke bomb, and kill the guards and complete the mission. Commonly seen in the co op missions. (No penalty for rushing in rampaging through the guards.\nFight system: Took away counter kill/dodge/disarm and taunt. Left only dodge and basic attack ,and heavy attack that is buyable later in the game.\nSometimes you just get insta killed without any chance to do anything about it because of the buggy animation.\nCamera: Too close to the character. Hard to climb and fight enemies.\n\nSo if you are a ac fanboy and don't care how crappy the game is and just want to play some assassins' creed like i do. Then buy it. Otherwise don't touch it even with a big stick. This game is worth of 15 euros, no more.\nDesperately waiting for bug patches.\nSincerely yours: a Traakon!

The textures for the roads, rooftops, walls, interiors, paintings, and even some NPCs are some of the best in any genre. The clothes actually have a softness look to them that make them seem like they are clothes. Although a minor complaint there is that your clothes never get wet, but thank you for allowing the grotesque blood stains when we get injured. There is a weather system, but like the clothes the attention to wet surfaces also seem to be ignored. I am running a EVGA 970 GTX at ultra settings, an upgrade I made specifically for this game due to low performance on my previous Sapphire 7850HD. The lag is not very noticeable at all with my new setup and I probably average 30-40 fps at 1080p. When the game is working, it is a visual experience very few other games can even come close to deliver. But the overall lack of some of the realism elements, such as wet textures, are a deal breaker for me so I cannot give this a 10/10 since many other games have implemented this sense of immersion, including Ubisoft itself with Watch Dogs for example.\n\nGame Play: 3/10\nI can say with some degree of confidence that the game play is one of the most annoying aspects of the game. Ubisoft finally added a long overdue game play element to allow for better vertical traversal of the environment, but it is equally annoying as it is helpful due to awkward camera placement during the animation. In fact, the camera in general is something that I am constantly fighting while indoors or in small corridors as well. As for the fighting aspect, it was a little hard to pick up initially, but ultimately this is the one piece of the game play that holds up well despite the departure of previous games' fighting mechanics. This is the part of this section that makes up the entire score I have assigned. As for the rest of the game play goes something like this: constant crashing, NPCs acting glitchy, falling through the ground, getting stuck between a table and a chandelier, losing game saves due to cloud or saving strategy issues, general lack of online components and sometimes even online support itself, the number of features that say “Coming Soon”, and poor performance for those without a $1,000 PC to play the game... seriously I feel for you if you have anything less than a higher end 700 series GPU and a quad core processor. I can only imagine how horrible this game would run on the consoles, and I have been reading some of the complaints. Overall I would also bring down the score even more due to missing game play elements from previous games that should have been included. Transportation, transportation, transportation. Where are the horses? Where is my flying machine? Where are the zip lines? Underground rail systems? Something... at least Arno will be in great shape having to run everywhere, I guess. Which actually brings me to another complaint, is it just me or does Arno jog in places where he should sprint? And is it also random when he decides to run or sprint? I know getting up to speed can be an issue on the ground dodging all of the crowds I guess, but when I have not run into anyone seriously, sprint please...  I will be running close to a crowd and he drops to a jog, and when you are running everywhere it gets quite annoying. Long story short, Ubisoft update this issue and sprint when in doubt if you have not run into anything.\n\nSound: 5/10\nThe music score pretty well sets the scene in most cases. It does feel natural and dynamic, when it is available, but I did notice that there was an overall lack of music unless something is going on. This is not necessarily a bad thing, to be honest it makes the moments where you are actually doing something feel much more engrossing. The ambient sounds is where we start to take a hit though. I feel like a lot of sounds are just plain missing, like sometimes they are there, and other times they are not. Kind like shooting a gun and expecting to hear the gunshot, but for many different things in the environment like dropping a bottle, getting pushed into a wall, NPCs falling, etc. . It's like the crowds of people are suppose to keep us from noticing the overall lack of ambiance that is not coming from a NPC. The NPC do seem to talk for 30 sec loops in some cases. I camped out near a set of NPCs just to see how much animation was given to them and the dialogue that was associated with those animation. Overall, it seems as if everyone is repeating the same routines. Some people probably just walk in circles all day, never stopping in for a drink at the tavern, or going home to sleep. I often see people pouring out of walls and closed doors without any sound, due to day/night cycle changes I am guessing??? In my opinion it is this lack of immersion elements and ignorance to these types of bugs that hurts ACU the most.\n\nOnline: 3/10\nI was able to get online with a friend to play some of the online play. Of course by the time we were set up and going my PC crashed. That pretty much concluded our online session. Unfortunately this section takes a hit due to constant Uplay issues. After spending nearly 20 hours on the game my save game disappears and I seemingly have to start over. Even when I do, and I restart the game my progress is lost. Even if I set up a local save and ignore the cloud service, my game will continue to lose my progress. Between this issue and the constant crashes, this game is unplayable. No one with a life could hope to sit down and finish this game without being able to save your game. I put this here since it seems to have to do with the cloud save feature, but when you can get an online session started and your game does not crash it can be quite fun. If I could access my previous game save I might be able to play online again. I do feel like the online play could be promising, if the game worked.\n\nStory: 1/10\nWell, here is my two cents on the story. Overall, who am I again? Of course I am one of the disgruntle gamers who cannot even finish the story due to an unplayable game. Maybe sometime after the second memory sequence you actually get to see a reason to get invested an any of the characters, so far I am not very invested at all. By the time you start getting attached to someone they are out of your life by either fast forward years on end, or separating due to Arno's choices. Some character development would be nice, but I am too early to even know.  Guess this takes a hit since I cannot even play the game anymore without losing all progress.\n\nOverall score: 4/10\nThis is probably the most unfinished game I have played to date, maybe from any developer, and in fact it is now currently unplayable for me due to losing progress on restart of the application. The online game play is promising, if Uplay servers could actually handle its gamers.  Overall ACU feels incomplete, with only game play and graphics holding it up, and only when the game actually works, or you have a rig that can run it. Otherwise it is impossible to overlook all of the issues with the games. Ubisoft should definitely step back and take a long look at themselves.\n\nMy advice to you, wait 6 months or a year until they can iron out all of the bugs, then maybe it will be the ACU that we were all looking so forward to. I am betting many folks at Ubisoft are wishing for a do-over right about now. A suggestion you may want to consider is maybe that you should stop selling this broken and incomplete game.\n\nMy overall feeling towards my purchase is that I feel I have been taken for granted as a returning customer. The scrutiny in which I use to judge Ubisoft games from here on out will be far worse due to this installment of AC.\n","November 17, 2014","false","65.5"," 228 of 291 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","228","291","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enigmaprofile/recommended/289650/","enigmaprofile","A Whimsical Statue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enigmaprofile/","174 products in account","Alright, for those of you who will actually read this, let me start off by saying that these opinions are my own and my perspective is coming from playing the PC version (Finished both the Singleplayer and played about 13 hours of Co-Op already). So, that being said, let's get started. I will be writing my review in a sort of a listing format, being mixed with both pros and cons:\n\nSingleplayer/Storyline:\nThe storyline was good, but it seems like they rushed it a bit in some key areas.\nArno becomes an Assassin out of nowhere, it feels.\nArno had a very similar backstory to that of Ezio, even though Arno seems to be a bit higher class maybe? Seems that way but it wasn’t explained too well.\nThe outside forces (the modern day Assassin’s who are helping you) play no role whatsoever other than saying “Hey, do this because we think it’s important”. We have no connection with the person controlling Arno. Even though we had basically no connection with the one in Black Flag either, at least you got to roam around and understand why you were there.\nArno has become one of my favorite main Assassin’s. even though it’s hard to pick whether I loved him or Edward Kenway more. Maybe if there were more developing missions for Arno’s character I would have cared.\nUnity has been the most nostalgic game to me since Brotherhood, so I do give it credit for giving me “the feels.”\nI liked the addition of the Rift missions. Even though they had no real purpose other than attempting to give the outside forces more developing storyline. Being able to play in occupied France during the Second World War was amazing. But it just shows how a more modern Assassin’s Creed would NOT work.\nAbsolutely NO importance is placed on the Sword of Eden, making it just another cool collectable to get for finishing the game. Unlike the pieces of Eden in the other games where everything is based around them.\nThe only motive you have in this game is revenge. You can argue that the motivation comes from Arno trying to keep Elise, but when she is out of  the picture (both when you don’t have any contact with her during the game and when she dies ) you don’t feel anything for either her or Arno.\nI like how no naval missions are in this. I like them and they worked well in the previous games, but it wouldn’t have for this.\nThe ending was unoriginal, easy, and quick.\nMain story line was not very long. I thought for a huge, hyped up game like this it would take me around 10 hours to complete, not 3 or 4.\nPoor quality of side missions, leaving you with not a lot to do when you’re done with the story.\nLet’s be honest, you will have little to no idea who is on who’s side. Little to no understanding of what is happening in the world outside of Arno.\n\nOpen World and Random Others:\nI love the environment of Revolutionary France (well, Paris and some other locations).\nHaving random scenarios happen around you was a cool addition. I like seeing some random person get mugged, people standing around a recent murder, crowds showing off their revolutionary rights, or anything else you see.\nGotta love the crowd chants you hear every now and again; it really immerses you into the environment around you.\nI hate how there are only about 6 cafes you can fix up. In previous games, I enjoyed be able to renovate tons of places and especially the Villa. The renovations are cheap and the missions are quick and easy. The renovations are pointless because they serve no  real purpose to the story line.\nThe Companion App is a cool addition but it’s more than annoying to have to basically play a whole other game just to get some rewards and open chests.\nNo whistling system? REALLY?\nI have to buy the ability to throw my money on the ground? HAHA.\nI understood not being able to double assassinate people in previous games until you got two blades, but not being able to do it until you buy the ability is rather pointless.\nI like how the buildings are now explorable, rather  than just running through them in a sequence. Their design is very well done, too. Some of them are beautiful.\nThe climbing system was very good, for the most part. The controlled descent is what made it the best system so farm.\nThe Eagle Vision is also the best so far. You can easily move around in the world while viewing through it.\nThe soundtrack is very good. Not the best, but not the worst.\nNo weapon wheel, which was a very good part of the AC games.\nYou can’t pick up rifles, so if you want to use one, you will have to buy one and sacrifice the use of your sword.\nWe have to wait for Club Competition just to unlock some Legendary gear?...\nSimilar to the more recent AC’s, there are no blacksmiths, banks, or anything like that. Just one shop that you can get everything at. I find that a bad thing.\nMurder mysteries are easy and quick.\nNostradamus Enigmas missions are fun and a cool way to unlock armor, but they can be difficult.\n- No horses :(\nTons a different regions, which is awesome. You can be in swamps, farmland, villages, rural middle class areas, high class areas, industrial, ports, and shanty towns just to name a few.\nThe combat system is terrible. I understand they geared it towards being more stealthy than the other titles, but it’s still awful. Especially the parry system.\nI like the mini map. It’s larger and more visible than others in other games.\nThere is no pickpocketing unless it’s assigned in a mission, which is stupid.\nI like the propaganda/graffiti that’s in this game. You can tell the people are going through a revolution without having to shove it down your throat.\nThe amount of NPCs in this game is amazing. It pays off mostly with crowds, showing just how chaotic the time period was.  But it becomes annoying in the streets when all you want to do is run a straight line and end up getting caught up on every single one of them.\nCo-Op:\nSinglehandedly the best part about this game. Really fun to get a bunch of your friends together and do missions.\nThe upgrade system is well done, forcing you to play a lot to unlock good gear.\nThe customization is also well done. You can choose what type of play style you most prefer by upgrading and customizing your character in a certain way.\nSome of the missions are too easy, like the heist Ancient History, for example. It’s a 5  star difficulty yet you can solo it easily with weak gear.\nThe heists are easily exploited for easy money. One of your friends can stay behind as one solos it. Do it again but changing the order of who does what, and you can earn the most amount of money in 2 goes.\nHuge amount of issues with connection.\nHuge amount of issues with disappearing players, enemies, and mission markers.\nThe missions will glitch every now and then, unallowing you to advance. For example, in Women’s March, the two women will just not move. You will have to quite, and then re-queue just for the mission to work.\nThere is NO way of communicating to other players in the lobby (if you aren’t in Skype, or whatever, with the).\nA lot of attention was paid to the environment, you can tell. The buildings were accurate replicas and looks marvelous.\n\nMechanical Issues:\nThis is what REALLY brought the game down and has been the worst PC release out of any Assassin’s Creeds.\nI have a computer the well meets the minimum requirements, yet it forces me to play on Low (I can run Revelations, which was the most demanding AC to me, on high).\nIf you change your settings you need to restart your game or else it will skip  every 5 seconds.\nYou will randomly fall throw the map and desync.\nIf the enemy you're killing is killed by someone else, your character stands there for a couple seconds before being able to move again.\nSound cuts out at times.\nA very beautiful game, if you are able to play it on higher graphics.\nThe loading screens are unbearably long.\n\nHad a conclusion but ran out of space in Steam. Worth the buy if you have friends","November 14, 2014","false","23.9"," 114 of 147 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","114","147","0","1"

I luckily did not preorder this time learning from Watch_poop but I didnt take the reviews to seriously. After I bought it I downloaded it for 12 hours in which I was able to play the next day when it downloaded. Upon playing the frame rate dropped and horrible graphics. I bought this game primarily for the Co-op in which I though me and my friend woul be able to play but of course he could never join a game and ubisofts only excuse was that it could not connect to the servers. One mission for about 5 minutes was the only time the game ran at 1080p 60fps for me which was remarkable and looked beautiful. It truly was a shame how I saw the games potential and realize how bad it turned out everywhere else. Ubisoft says that they are working hard to release another patch(The second patch did nothing still could not connect to a co op game and it did not adress any issues) but the damage has been done. The amount of thumbs down reviews that this game has had has shown that we are tried of their crap and their stock shows for it. Hopefully my purchase will help you decision to buy it or not. There might be a patch later on but like I said the damage has been done and this game goes down in the books as one of the worst launches in history...","November 14, 2014","false","9.2"," 121 of 158 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","121","158","0","0"

The parkour system is absurdly more intuitive than it has been before (about 96% of the time, but thats pretty decent considering the mechanics). The story is compelling, Arno has some decent quips that elicit a chuckle. The progression of Absertgo pushing forth to the public is at least realized from Black Flag, and the overarcing story is at least coherent.\n\nThe game's biggest flaws come in the highly unfinished state the publisher released it in. Kudos aside, the publisher released a buggy piece of software that has inherent flaws. I was able to run it, albeit on low settings with a mixture of medium and high settings. Granted, I have an older Radeon HD7850 and an AMD cpu running at 4 gigz (at overclock to boot!). There are FPS drops, and commonly freezing. I fall through the world, resulting in desynchronization and having to restart memories. I get stuck in gargoyles, railings, and even the floor at times. The cloth and hair sim bugs and starts fidgeting, and overall the phsyics like to go wonky.\n\nNow for the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- New and improved Parkour system\n- Customizable outfit\n- Interesting and acceptable voice acting\n- Stunning rendition of late 18th century France\n\nCons:\n- Horrid framerate issues\n- Steep performance/qaulity ratios\n- Buggy phsyics\n- Unfinished feel\n- Lack of crowd variability\n- Lack of enemy types\n- Immersion breaks\n\n\nOverall, not recommendable in this state. Maybe after bugfixes, mods, and patches this game can be recommended. Yet as of this writing, the game is definitely not worth the sixty bucks.\n\nBesides all of this, and bugs aside, its the perfect Assassin's Creed game. It's what the franchise aspired, and has gotten. Yet its probably far too late for the perfect Creed game, considering how many titles the series has pushed out.","November 12, 2014","false","34.0"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","66","76","0","0"

Patch 5 finally fixed the remaining issues I had (SLI issues with water flickering and a few crash bugs). Game is running fine for me at this point, and, overall, it's a fun addition to the franchise.\n\nPros:\n-The new movement system is much smoother than in previous editions, once you get used to it you can scale buildings, up, down, sideways, and diagonal, and make some impressive leaps, very fluidly\n-Graphis are pretty impressive\n-The main story mission is of a decent length, and draws you in\n-Player equipment customization (armor) is back to affecting stats, plus you can wear an outfit over the top\n-Reasonably interesting final boss fight, but you can cheese it\n-Additional game modes are interesting\n-Progress in companion app is finally not required to access chests (some chests would have taken forever to get)\n-The (too few) cities are interesting and well mapped\n-There's only one property you can buy and improve\n\nCons:\n-The ending to the main story sucks and is a letdown on so many levels, the Dead Kings DLC helps with that somewhat, but, avoiding spoilers, the biggest thing that made the ending suck doesn't change (and can't change as it's pretty final what happens)\n-No ships, hunting, crafting ?!?!\n-Most of the armors, and the pants, look pretty cheesy, even if themed according to the period; prowler armor is decent though\n-No recruiting and training up Assassin's in-game, it's all handled through the companion app; which means you can't access them in-game to help with missions\n-Feels like a much smaller world than previous titles\n\nAll in all it's a good addition, if there would have been naval combat, assassins in-game, crafting, and more opportunity to explore (and no bugs at launch), and to own property, it would have been one of the best, as it is, I put it somewhere around Assassin's Creed 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duckfeatherpillows/recommended/289650/","Duckfeatherpillows","Don't feed the ducks™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duckfeatherpillows/","242 products in account","TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nPlayed about 27 hours of it, finished the ♥♥♥♥ poor main storyline and it seems Ubisoft made this to be more of a tech demo than an actual AC game with interesting characters, places, events etc. It's padded to ♥♥♥♥ with repetitive and generic assassination missions which has you killing random Templars who are given no back story or character development whatsoever before you take them out.\n\nDULL DULL DULL DULL DULL and DULL.. Everything about this game is DULL. Characters are DULL. City is DULL and feels forced and lifeless. They just shoved thousands of NPCs in there to make it seem more alive but it fails so badly. Story is ♥♥♥♥ing DULL AS ♥♥♥♥ and one of the shortest and most cliche' in the entire Assassin's Creed Universe. I could make up a more interesting story in my head with the same characters that are used here.\n\nThe huge crowds that were flaunted to ♥♥♥♥ by Ubisoft do ♥♥♥♥ all but stand there 90% of the time. I thought the crowds were going to play a significant role in assassinations but nope. They just stand there like braindead ♥♥♥♥ing sheep and make my rig work like a dog for no reason. A ♥♥♥♥ing DULL and stupid ♥♥♥ tech demo piece.\n\nCertain chests you encounter in game, can't be opened unless you do this initiates thing (Which is now broken and useless so Ubisoft unlocked all the chests for everyone) and use the companion app for the game. So ♥♥♥♥ing lame and pointless. Forcing you to make accounts on their stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ websites and apps to unlock content in a game you already paid money for. Micro-transactions don't really bother me to be honest. Just don't buy them. Although it does seem they made the acquiring of gear and money a lot harder in the earlier stages or made it seem like it to force people to buy them.\n\nThe main character Arno starts off quite well but becomes DULL really quickly. He occasionally spouts off some one liners that are supposed to be clever and witty but are so ♥♥♥♥ing cheesy and out of place considering the situation. I think what they did was try and recreate Ezio as fans were/are still attached to his character. They failed badly in this regard. I couldn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about Arno's father being killed because they simply didn't let me. He's there for mere minutes before he's gone.\n\nKey characters are not developed AT ALL in the first 10 hours. Elise and Arno have their little prologue before the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan but that's it. You see Elise exactly once after that in 10 hours with no glimpse or mention of her in that whole time. Pierre (the guy who trains you for five ♥♥♥♥ing minutes) is not developed either. He is there initially calling Arno names like the cliche' gruff mentor but then he just slouches up against a wall in the Assassin HQ and does nothing whilst Arno goes off on missions.\n\nThe first 10 hours is just you going around and killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The ♥♥♥♥ing dialogue on most of the characters sounds painful and forced. No likeable or relatable characters anywhere. The only character I liked was the Marquee de Sade and I only saw him for twenty minutes tops if that.\n\nCo-op and the actual gameplay shine however. The new stealth button is useful as hell and the game actually forces you to be stealthy in true assassin fashion unlike the previous games where you were a tank. You can no longer face off against twenty enemies and come out the other end unscathed. I actually find it difficult with more than five enemies at a time. It's hella fun especially if you're on the mic with your mates playing co-op missions or heist missions and discussing strategies whilst playing. A lot of eye candy but not enough material there to call it an AC game. The story is just as important as gameplay in the AC series with it's heavily story driven formula and the game falls flat on it's face with regards to story.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the annoying as ♥♥♥♥ pop-in and FPS drops that are STILL HAPPENING AFTER FOUR USELESS PATCHES that have done nothing to alleviate any of the issues.\n\nI just can't believe I'm writing this as a MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE AC fanboy. I think the blame lies with me in part for expecting waaaaay too much with Unity in the first place. Me getting conned into thinking that they would actually work hard here.\n\nI could honestly rant on and on and on about the various failings this game has. They took a crap ton of features out from the previous games and dumbed down a lot of the aspects of the previous titles. The music in Unity is easily the worst of the whole series. I have never had anything but praise for the soundtrack in the AC series until this game was released. It doesn't affect me either way at all whereas I used to actually listen to tracks from AC 2's soundtrack as part of my music playlist.\n\nAnother thing that bugs me, perhaps more than anything, are the English accents. I honestly felt like I was going through Victorian London rather than Paris. I didn't think this would ♥♥♥♥ me off as much as it did but it completely breaks immersion to the point where you wonder what country you're playing in.\n\nTL;DR: It's a tech demo and a shot at next gen for Ubisoft and little else. At the time of writing, it's on sale at 33% off which is still not worth the experience. I'm genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and sad that the one game I was looking forward to this year turns out to be another turd. Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ off.","December 20, 2014","false","48.1"," 76 of 95 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","76","95","5","0"

We follow a new character Arno Victor Dorion in his quest to find the culprit who murdered his adoptive father. He along with his lover, Elise de la Serre (Elise is for revenge, while Arno is simply doing it for redemption).\n\n[Visual]\n\nThis is something that many people will more likely agree. This game is truly beautiful. I appreciate the fact that Ubisoft truly made the game really eye candy. You can go to many other places and see the beauty on the poor and rich side of Paris. Of course, to experience this well, you might have to have a good PC to explore it pretty well. Otherwise, it is just a tease to you.\n\n[Gameplay]\n\nThe game seems to play out like a refined version of AC1. The parkouring is smooth, but sometimes a bit buggy. The Combat is actually more difficult than one might think, if fighting a bunch of guards, you might end up using alot of smoke bombs and even with all the medicine you take, it might not be enough and you will more likely die. The new combat also removed the free flow kill streaks and counter kills, instead you parry, attack, or dodge. Fans wanted a more difficult challenge, and so they have it. Now the Fanbase is divided about it. For me, it wasn't bad but it could have been better refined. I believe Ubi was trying to add more realism into the AC series, after all, I don't think its normal for someone to kill 10 guards under 1 minute unless you had explosives. Stealth in this game is possible. It's not really the best stealth feature, but it is possible.\n\n[Missions & Other Objectives]\n\nThe Main Missions are pretty well done If I may say. You can enter a building, lure them out, riot, go yolo, sneak under the building, etc. This made the game less repetitive. I cannot say the same for the Side Mission however, they do tend to repeat itself, however it does have some interesting stories behind these missions. Investegation Missions is pretty awesome, you play detective and try to figure out who murdered the person, and you have a variety of people to blame. So choose wisely. The Notredamus Puzzle is the most time consuming unworthy chore I ever done. You pretty much do all these painful riddles just to get a reskin altair costume that is merely cosmetic, I personally think it is not worth it. And finally the helix rifts. They are actually part of the storyline and you are basically just trying to escape that era. It was pretty enjoyable to watch and explore this small linear era, but it wasn't that big of a deal as I thought. The game has chest...BUT WAY too many chests....and some Nomad Chests and Initiate chest that are usually not opened to you unless you use a third party program (AC Initiates and the AC Unity app). There are finally co-op missions which aren't bad, but has little to no communication with ur teammates whatsoever and sometimes you will end up with just one fellow player instead of three.\n\n[Customization & Weapons]\n\nThis is the only game in the series that has ALOT of customization for your character. Its really REALLY well done and many people enjoyed having their own attire. The weapons are also pretty cool as well. Some of these attires must be unlocked through missions, chests or through club competitions (which hasn't started yet)\n\n[Story]\nI won't lie to you guys, I say this as a true fan of the AC storyline, the story....is the weakest of all the series. I will explain with no spoiler as possible. The story focuses soo much on Arno and Elise that everyone else, including historical figures, was forgetable. And even when it focuses on Arno and Elise, it feels pretty meh. I do admit though, their love story is pretty well made. This is pretty much how the story usually ends up going: Arno kills the target, drain his target's memories to find the next target (there is no last words for the victim unfortunatly), kills the next guy, repeat. I know there is story behind all of it, but there is hardly any backstory for that target, not even the main target hardly had a backstory other than the fact he is a sage (but we knew that from the beginning). The ending was....I have to say...it was pretty cliche....and the Modern Day storyline was little to nonexistant , unfortunatly. I am NOT saying the story was horrible, but it is a weak storyline for an AC game.\n\n[Bugs & Glitches]\n\nThis is where the game's experience was killed since its launch. It performed badly. Now we are at Patch 4. I can say that Online was fixed but it still isn't perfect. the Crashes however, I still get that. It really does kill the experience for me along with constant stuttering issues. I was able to run this game at around 45 fps with custom high/ultra high setting so it wasn't entirely bad for me. But I really cannot say the same for others. If you check the forums, you will see that many people can't run this game as well as others (this includes people with good PCs and bad PCs.) I also read reports that as if Patch 4, SLI/Crossfire Users perform worse for them.\n\n[Microtransactions]\nThis one has no affect to us in gameplay, since this is optional. However, this cannot be ignored either. Putting microtransactions on a Single-player/Co-op game, simply to get items early instead of encouraging players to get them through effort is just....wrong. What bothers me is the price....it ranges from $20 - $100 and the helix credits aren't that much either. This is possibly the worst thing I ever saw in an AC game and this sort of business practice has made Ubisoft look like the new EA.\n\n[Recommend?]\n\nThis game does have fun in it and I know you see a thumbs down. The reason is because this game may not run for everyone and to top it all, this game still has major issues that needs to be dealt with and the chances of having that is 50/50. You might be one of the lucky ones to run the game with little to no problems, or be one of those unfortunate enough to have a bad experience, Sooo....If you feel you can run this game and can deal with the issues the game has, by all means get it since it can still prove to be enjoyable, BUT please...get this game during discount, because I personally think this isn't worth the full price. This game isn't simply given by Ubisoft haters, but fans alike as well. Trust me...If a lot of people are complaining less about Uplay and more on Unity, then something went seriously bad for Ubisoft. I really worry for the series now. Personally, this game may have been given a recommendation or just a mere complaint about Uplay launcher if there were little bugs and glitches, or at least a good optimization and better support. The damage has been done and there is no doubt that this game became one of the biggest dissapointment of 2014 (sorry my fellow gamers who do like this game, but as much as I enjoyed some of the gameplay given by this game, would have to agree.)","January 14, 2015","false","15.9"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","56","65","3","3"

Movement seems to be very fluid and easy and combat is now actually challenging. There is more emphasis on stealth, so it's finally an actual assassin game! Now let's go to the bad part, which is low frame rate and frame drops. One segment in the game I would have a solid 40-50 fps, and in the next sequence I would only get like 20 even though the scenary is still the same. The other problem with the game is the frame drops. Every few seconds, you would get a quick frame delay that makes you change your movement direction and pretty much messes up your entire gameplay expierence.\n\nNow let's go on to the wonderful city of paris, which must be my new favorite game setting. The developers of AC: Unity made a beautiful and realistic looking city. It feels very realistic due to the little details that they added everywhere. One thing that makes the city look alive is the people. They are always moving and waving their flags, talking to each other, or stealing/insulting others. The problem with that though is I think it's partially the reason why the game lags because it requires intense CPU usage to process all those movements and characters, even though Ubisoft said that the number of people on screen dosen't affect frame rates at all, but that is something must people are calling B.S.\n\nIf the patches are going to fix the stutter and fram issues, I would rate this game a solid 9/10 and it would be my new favorite Assassin's creed game. However, in it's current state, giving it a 6/10 is a little generous of me. I would only reccomend buying the game when the game is actually patched.\n\nI currently do not reccomend the game but when, hopefully, frame rate issues are fixed, i'm going to change to a reccomendation because the game is pretty fun.","November 19, 2014","false","40.1"," 78 of 100 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","78","100","0","0"

Last year's Black Flag was an unexpected change from rooftop crawling, but it was fantastic. With Unity, there are some strong points: the game looks stunning (when it isn't glitching and stuttering), and the co-op is refreshing (when it isn't glitching and stuttering). I even like what bits of the story I've played so far (which is why I play these games in the first place).\n\nThat being said, this review is less for the actual game and more for the company which made it.\n\nI cannot believe in my right mind that Ubisoft didn't know it would release like this. From the "review embargo" to the microtransactions, what they have done with Unity is completely unacceptable. It looks as though they were trying to supress bad reviews of the game in order to make as much money as they could before the obvious performance issues came to light. This was an incomplete game and a game which required much better porting than what we were given. I've never felt like I was playing a simulation while in the Animus before, but now it feels exactly that, and between the stutters and the random framerate dips, it is like playing a laggy MMO when your ping is too high.\n\nGuards glitch in combat. You're at full health and all of a sudden the guard transports across the screen and your dead. Player character falling through holes in the world. Borderless windowed mode does not work. As the other reviews will tell you, the list goes on.\n\nOn a bit of the stranger side, my game crashed early on after stuttering and framerate dips and a whole plethora of other problems, only to reboot and have no stutter whatsoever. The game has been fairly stable since then, but I'll be knocking on wood after posting this review. I have literally no idea how or what caused this to happen.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game?\n\nNot in its current state. I'm glad to see Ubisoft is taking fire for this, but I'm hoping there will be a patch soon which will fix this issue. I meet the hardware requirements good and well. Like many of the reviews are saying, it has nothing to do with not meeting hardware specs.\n\nIt's just a horrendous and lazy port.","November 12, 2014","false","19.3"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","60","72","0","0"

I've foolishly preordered the game a few months ago and I have given the Devs some time now to fix the game so here is my Review on it so far:\n\nGraphics: The game can be amazingly beautiful. The Artist did a superb job of creating a realistic and wonderful Paris, unfortunetly most players won't see it. The required Specs are really high and even if you meet them there are a bunch of graphical bugs and problems ruining the scenery. (Not even mentioning the problems it had at launch, which now have been partially fixed) (3/10 on release) 6/10\n\nSound: Excellent choice of music and voice actors, all quite well. No Problems here, nothing grandios either. 9/10\n\nBalance: Fights have gotten a lot harder in my opinion but are still managable, if you don't happen to face a couple of well placed snipers who seem a bit OP. I'm really glad they fixed the alarm system, getting caught no longer means mission failure in stealth. The Assassinations can be performed differently now with a open approach on how you get to and kill the Target, although the secondary objectives are a bit too obvious in my taste. Then there is the microtransaction. This is a full price release, there shouldn't be microtransaction in it. Period. 7/10\n\nAtmosphere: Paris is alive, there are people everywhere going about their daily business, you feel the uprest in the Citiziens and the tension between Guards, Fanatics and the Assassin. The districts are diverse and all sides of the city. The main story however is (as always) told in the present, which more then ever is more annoying than enjoyable. The jumps in history and "Simulation" seem like a quick way to throw some exciting stuff in but makes it hard for me to immerse myself into the world. 8/10\n\nControls: As always in AC best played with the Controller but Mouse and Keyboards works alright. The menues are obviously designed to work on consoles but are not terrible on the PC. But as always there are the weird problems with the free-running and climbing, getting stuck on weird places for no reason. 7/10\n\nExtent: Paris is a large City, filled with the usual treasure and collectables, but some of the treasure is only accesable through playing the Companion App or Browser Game. There are many secondary missions (some of which are refreshingly new and interesting like the Murder Cases) so you'll be busy even though the main story is not really long. Now here is the real problem though: Save games are not save. When released saving the game was pointless and even though it was fixed for a time, many players still have problems with this including me. I had about 45% of the game when it got patched, now this save game is broken and I can't save anymore. (Was 6/10) 2/10\n\nAI: Decent enough AI, the enemies have different approches and don't all wait their turn to be slaughtered like they used to in the older games, even though the regular guards are still easily overpowered. Allies are helping out ok, civilians are behaving like they should though sometimes a bit too late. Some guards have spotted me where they shouldn't have and not spotted me where they should have, and (especially in Co-Op) NPCs tend to have problems navigating.\n7/10\n\nWeapons and Skills: Costumization has gotten a lot of love in this game. There are many different Outfits, Clothes, Colours, Weapons and Skills to unlock and you can make your Assassin look unique. Sadly most Outfits must be unlocked (again) via the Companion App or Browser game. Also many of the Skills players have gottten used to as standart must be unlocked again. Some of the Skills and gadgets seem useless in the end game. Speaking of Skills, there is no way to get all Skills unlocked in the game. This is terrible as in the first playthrough you don't even know which skills are gonna be useful. 6/10\n\nStory: As always the historical context and playing with the historical events and people is a lot of fun. Some Characters are great but sadly come to short in the story (Napoleon or de Sade) while the story focuses on a dull and obvious love story. The twists and the end are very predictable, and no veteran of the Series should be suprised. Sadly the ending is not only obvious but also seems unfinished and rushed. There is no real resolution as the game again only tells you about the love story not every other part of the story. Arno is an overall ok character but doesn't really have anything motivating him except for the love interest. I expect Ubisoft will provide more story and explanation in the coming DLC's and sequels but Unity's story leave me dissapointed nontheless. 4/10\n\nMultiplayer: Lets put the first few days of Server troubles behind us and look at the Coop. The Idea behind it is great to me and it feels awesome to climb, jump and fight around as a team but the realization is again the problem. The Uplay servers still have problems, the gameplay is laggy, the NPCs are having difficulty and take way to long to follow protocol. Plus communication with your team (which would be very helpful) is impossible which makes it weird as most players don't like to follow each other around. 5/10\n\n61/100\n\nSummary: Do NOT buy this game in this state. Last time I've preordered from Ubisoft. They need to fix their game, which is a shame because at the core the game is really fun but it was released too soon. Maybe pick it up the Defenitve Edition when all DLC's and Patches are out.\n\n","November 18, 2014","false","57.6"," 69 of 87 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","69","87","0","0"

This shows that you can make something big but if you don't polish it well this is what happens.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdJ9dHZR4qw&list=UUXGd7RegfStA25hUftOyVfw\nand\nthis one\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO2Bbw15lVA&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n\nADVICE - TURN OF Anti-Aliasing and PCSS- Shadows\nyou'll get better fps is what I gathered from a friend. Helped my framerates until then. Also go offline from UPLAY\n\n\nGameplay Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV_omUp16VI\n\n\nStoryI have spent about 40 hours in the game and just finally beaten it. I will have to say that this was not a great assassin's creed at all to me but a subpar B rated title.\nThe story of the game as you already know is about Arno who is a Frenchmen and son of an assassin, his father was killed and so he was adopted by a templar who was also killed. He blames himself and goes to join the brotherhood to rise the ranks and defeat the mastermind behind it.\n\nThe story felt very forced amd rushed. and so did the romance, it was a very dull plot from finish to end instead of being great like past assassin's creed that leaves players hungry for more. This game left me with a\nsour taste as if I had accomplished nothing and wasted my time.  It was a complete letdown and\n\n\nGraphicsThe maps and architecture in this game looks amazing and is very large, the buildings are very aesthetically detailed and for those that can experience it without performance hitches its very clear work and detail has been put into the game's design. Maps have tunnels underneath it and buildings that you can go in this time around.\n\nCombatThe combat to the game this time is the same as the others with attack, parry, and roll except the kill streaks are taken out and is much harder, It needs more work because sometimes it can get clunky during battle due to possible bugs or fighting 5 stars enemy is such a pain. Best way of clearing enemies are using bombs smokes etc and just killing them all.\n\nParkour The parkour is improved with the ability to traverse up and down however can be quite buggy when it comes to climbing near windows. I felt like pressing directional in all different ways and solving a puzzle just to get past them.\n\nMultiplayer  The coop itself is very lacking, they took away the previous death match style games and replaced it with forced coops in certain places. There are coop missions you can do to earn unlock in armors and get more money with random mob generation which bugs out.  Most of the time people don't really try to stealth them, everyone rushes in kills accomplishes the mission or sometimes do escorts, rinse repeat and I can seriously see the replay value of this game dropping in a few weeks.\n\nOther gameplay  I love the fact that you can go over and over a mission to redo it again figuring out different routes in the game though it is limited in ways you can do them really but nevertheless the choice is there\nThe armor aspect of the game is a greay way to customize your assassin's but at the same time  quite silly because you can literally buy it all with helix points by paying which is such a silly and greedy system, You don't have to but you can do so.\n\nFinal opinion\nTruly, I cannot recommend this game until things are fixed. The gameplay is by no mean horrible at all and by no mean very exciting but its the performance issues that really gets in the way.\nWhen you turn down settings to tone it all down even to low and get the same fps problems its clearly an issue with the game not my rig. The game itself is having problems on consoles! If you do your research Everyone is having problems in this game even the higher end tier rigs with the fps and only a handful of people can run it. Overall the game itself was very sub par and introduces some nice new mechanics but also failed to really bring anything exciting to the table. At best for this triple A title it felt B rated and dissappointing, as a Fan I will have to thumb this one down and wait for them to pick themselves up.\n\n\nPros so far + The architect and the city of paris is made very nicely along with the aesthetics.\n+Maps is large, theres a sewer/crypt level along with buildings you can even enter.\n+ The New Parkour system, how you can go up and down, its smooth, damn smooth and the direcitons it lets you manuever when you make the free runs. However can be clunky near windows.\n+ The new Stealth system is a nice addition to the game.\n+ The combat this time flows pretty smoothly and is more challenging basically its just the redone system with kill streaks taken out.\n\n\n\nCons so far - Horrible Optimization on release full of bugs and glitches\n- The animation in combat isn't great, looks like weapons are floating at enemies instead of really impacting them.\n- The requirements are absurd, I have a tough pc, the 680 signature overclock runs it fine, though not at the highest settings. I've seen people with higher end cards having mini lags and issues during the cutscenes. Mine runs them at 25-30 and the game microstutters at wierd times.\n- Sometimes the free form running can make you run in a wierd angle if you aren't facing a certain way correctly windows etc and going past it is just a pain.\n- Co-op is uninspiring and the ability to actually buy items and gears defeats the purpose of playing the game to earn it. Why not keep the Deathmatch from previous games or add modes to that concept? the replay value is lacking and I can see this dieing real fast.\n- Forced coop and I barely see any of it.\n\n\n\nYt/twitch Kenuty","November 11, 2014","false","45.2"," 128 of 180 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","128","180","0","14"

I also tend to complete nearly every game I purchase. I'm not a 100% completionist, but I always finish at least the main story campaign (and usually all side missions unless I ultimately don't enjoy the game).\n\nNearly a year later and I still have yet to complete Unity. After each game bringing new and interesting features, Unity feels like a step backward in terms of setting and game mechanics. The improve free running system where you can influence whether Arno moves upwards or downwards during free run is a great addition. But after the addition of the Brotherhood, then hunting and crafting, and finally with the amazing sailing ship combat in 2-4, this feels like a stale return to the original AC2.\n\nThe time sink mobile app interdependency is also an anvil around the neck.\n\nI have also been hoping for a change of scenery. Unity just feels like we've been there and one that before, 4 times now. I hate to say it, but between Unity, and the decision to set the next game in yet another European city setting has absolutely killed my interest in this series.\n\nI truly hope a day comes where Assassin's Creed will provide innovation and imaginative settings once again.

Twice.  I was at 15% (about 17 hours in, if you count all the ♥♥♥♥ing around I did). Just completely gone. Then I figured "Oh well. I'll just replay it, no big deal". I got from the beginning to the part where Arno joins the Assassins last night before bed, and today my game was corrupted. Again. ♥♥♥♥ off Ubisoft, I honestly hope your shares drop tenfold because of this. The game would be perfect if they had just delayed it for like 3 months.\n*End rant, Start review*\n\nIt's been stated in multiple sources, articles, users, etc: AC Unity is bugged beyond belief. For a HUGE developer Ubisoft has become they manage to ♥♥♥♥ a lot of thins up recently. I know people who bash Ubisoft left and right for things and backed the company up as I thought they deserved more credit for their games that I've spent so much time playing:\n\nUntil this peice of ♥♥♥♥ came a long.\n\nI play Assassin's Creed for the historical setting and the amazingly accurate environments they make. This game, thankfully, still held true to that. But it's hard to take it seriously when I'm watching a cutsceen of Arno's father dying and his father's hair is flipping around like a wind turbine on max capacity (This happens in A LOT of cutsceens for me, maybe the game day release patch will fix this). Or when I'm trying to advance in the Bastille mission and your new friend (I dont even remember his name lol, which is kind of sad) gets stuck in the door and you cant advance in the mission. Then, of course, there's the FPS problems, which I thought was my computer going to ♥♥♥♥ even though I have a decent graphics card and processor. Turns out it was just the game making the dramatic fight scene happen in about 3 frames and me wondering how Arno was suddenly on the ground.\n\nThat's among many technical ♥♥♥♥ up Ubisoft released this game with. There is NO REASON a company should release a game before it's 100% complete. I sincerely hope Ubisoft learns a lesson from this and continues making amazing games I've been enjoying for years, and doesnt ♥♥♥♥ up Rainbow Six or The Division.\n\nTL;DR Game is bugged and FPS rates are ♥♥♥♥ for no reason. Dont buy until they fix the technical issues, which if they gave a ♥♥♥♥ anymore, should be released in about 2 weeks. IF or WHEN they fix these issues, I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you're an Assassin's Creed fan, you'll love it, just wait for the technical issues to get taken care of.","November 14, 2014","false","48.7"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","0"

Tons of millions of bugs scared the customers and serious frame rate issues on every platform caused broken hearts.\nA long story of patches, new ridiculous bugs and not working features followed the launch (which caused the shares of Ubisoft to drop about 10% at release date), a story no one had expected from a big company like Ubisoft and such a triple-a game.\nA story which is too long and too churning to be told in this review.\n\nNowadays Ubisoft apologized by making the Dead Kings DLC available for free and giving those, who already ordered the Season Pass an additional free game combined with a hidden oppressive contract. Thanks for that! Plus, they granted us a fourth patch and finally the game is playable with far less problems. So let's focus on the game on its own at the beginning.\n\nThe Game\nAssassin's Creed Unity is set during the French revolution in Paris and does a great job showing the tumults and split society. It's love for detail is incredible (the player can notice tons of different animations, from apple picking over dancing to book pressing) and it's graphics are stunning. The city of Paris is really big (maybe even a bit too big) and, applause, the most important feature of Assassin's Creed is back: beautiful architecture to be climbed.\nThis time the game features quite a lot of interiors that are ranged from generic to beautiful and impressive arranged.\n\nStory\nThe story of Assassin's Creed has a hell of potential, having a really amazing setting - a potential, no game can even fulfil and neither does Unity. The player takes control of Arno, a young Parisian whose father is killed as he was a boy. And there we go with the lamest motivation of all time, which sadly lowers the quality of the story enormously: Revenge. Please Ubisoft, how about Revenge, leading to idealistic deeds?\nWhile Arno does have ideals and tries to save humanity, it never feels like he is aware of what he's doing. In conclusion Arno is a much weaker character than Ezio or Altair, and his story can't fascinate the player by far as much as Altair's or Ezio's story could.\nThere are tons of optional quests, but sadly they don't have anything to do with the main story. It's more like occupational therapy than an addition to the story on which the impressions could grow.\nThe game immersion has to suffer from another thing: A lots of game features.\n\nThe Game Features\nThe game has several features worth mentioning:\nAssassin's Creed Unity Mobile Application (needed for a lot of chests)\nAssassin's Creed: Initiates (needed for some chests)\nHelix credits\ncoop multiplayerIn Unity the player is confronted with a lot of blue marked chests to open but as he tries, a tip will be shown, saying that this chest has to be unlocked through the AC: Unity Mobile App. So this 'optional' app becomes needed as it is implemented straight throughout the whole game. In this mobile app you are tasked to find some hidden signs on each viewpoint (which is quite difficult sometimes) and then hire some assassins to do several tasks (lasting from 1 to 12 hours). Each task is granting you a Chest in Unity. You can tell this takes a lot of time and off course Ubisoft is nice to the gamer and offers a Premium Edition and other mobile ingame transactions to save time. Really, Ubisoft? Didn't I pay you already? Like 60/90$ ?\nAnd actually I bought Unity to play an rpg and not a simulator-like planning game.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Initiates (currently offline, at this time like forever) is an online service that registers all your achievements of the previous instalments of the franchise - well, it should but it didn't wherefore it's offline now (since 2 months) so that Ubisoft can fix this.\nThere are several golden chests in Unity, containing money or the outfits of the previous assassins, that can only be unlocked by achieving a given level in Initiates by having played the older games or by doing the 'soon coming' daily practices. At least one can access those chests for free. And during the time being offline, they can be unlocked without using Initiates.\n\nThe Helix credits are an ingame currency that can be achieved by paying dollars. Nope, you didn't misread, there is an ingame shop in Unity, granting additional time savers and time-limited boosters. Yes, theoretically AC: Unity is a full-price triple-a game. No, we are not talking of a cheap MMO or free-to-play here. Yes, additional ingame transactions.\nThis 'issue' doesn't have to be commented furthermore. Only one statement towards Ubisoft: F*CK YOU!!!\n\nThe coop-multiplayer which was praised by, well, by Ubisoft for it's tactical finesse is fun to play but more like absolutely murderer-chaos than a silent and well planned assassination. Might have to do something with the fact that there's no time to actually plan a mission.Overall there are lot of features in Unity that barely work to enrich the game. Some are fun at least, others are nothing but insolent.\n\n\nContinuing in the comments","November 18, 2014","false","76.7"," 60 of 76 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","60","76","0","11"

I am just going to point out the bitter irony of playing a game about a revolution conducted by the people and aiming at getting rid of the aristocracy as well as sharing out wealth among the people, when only gamers with enough money to buy a cutting-edge PC will be able to play it satisfyingly, whereas the plebs and their mid-range computers get beheaded by the greedy blade of Ubisoft's guillotine.\n\nIt makes me sad that French honour was ruined by this game, and by a French editor on top of that. This act of national treason is an insult to French culture and the very spirit of our beloved Révolution.\n\nI hope the game will be fixed soon, so that I may stop feeling ashamed of living in the most beautiful city in the world and speaking the most sophisticated language of all.\n\nIm am going out now. According to my current DNA sequence, I need to go buy a baguette and a croissant. I hope I don't come across to many people lining up in front of the backery, as it is well known that French people always make the framerate drop.\nI also hope that I will not fall throug the ground, like one of my sorely missed friends did, I hear it happens more and more often in this time of year.\nThen I will go home, wake up my girlfriend and French kiss her. I just hope that her skinface does not disappear this time.\nFinally, when I join her for an intimate co-op session, I hope I will not be disconnected, as it has happenend many times before.\n\nOn this cheerful note, I wish you all, mesdames et messieurs, an excellent day.\n\nVive la République, et Vive la France.","November 17, 2014","false","30.8"," 64 of 83 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","64","83","0","0"

In each installment, I have achieved 98%+ synch with 100% in Black Flag, Liberation, and Brotherhood. I have completed the AC:Unity main storyline and am leaving the game at 62% synch. I just cannot continue navigating around the map doing all of the side quests and gathering the collectibles.\n\nThe beauty of the older AC games is the ability to enter a new zone and clear the map. This is nearly impossible in AC:U. Aside from the Nomad chests littering the map (of which I have been playing the Companion App since release and am about 70% done) completed Rift and Co-op quests still remain on the map. This makes it harder to prioritize what stil needs to be completed, etc. The older version had a map filter, so does AC:U. However, the filter does not allow for customization like the older versions and you cannot filter "Collectibles."\n\nGraphically the game is amazing. The story is ok. There is not real-world connection outside of the Animus like Black Flag had. You're just locked in there the entire game. This creates a lack of depth which made the other games so involving. From an AC fan with over 300 hours invested into the series, I am fairly disappointed with this installment.","December 20, 2014","false","35.6"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","57","73","0","0"

Like many other reviewers, I'm getting terrible lag spikes.  My computer was specifically bought so that I could play games like this easily and so far it's been a regretable experience.  Within the first five minutes of the game I dropped frames, glitched through the ground, and saw terrible graphical glitching and tearing.  One the third mission where you're chasing the man down, any crowded areas dropped me to about 10 fps and usually lead to a desyncronization or dropped me through the map entirely resulting in the same thing.  At some points, it will run perfectly well, but only if there are no or few other NPCs nearby.  The prerendered CGI cutscenes looked good when they worked, but most of the time they didn't.  Until Ubisoft corrects this, I can't recommend this game. 2/10 until they fix this, and that's probably being generous.\n\nSpecs:\nIntel Core I7-4700MQ @ 3.3 GHz with Turbo Boost, 8 GB RAM, NVidia GeForce Gt 740m graphics","November 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 118 of 172 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","118","172","0","19"

But, since I experienced more negative than positive gameplay, I must lean towards a thumbs down. First the positives:\n\n+The time period and history. The French Revolution is one of my favorite historical periods and the fact that Ubisoft is a French company gave me confidence that they would put more information and lore about this critical point in their nation's history.\n+I love the characters in the game, as well as the moral ambiguity between the Templars and the Assassins. Arno is a great protagonist, and Elise is one of the best female characters I've ever seen in a video game. Some of the historical figures, like the Marquis de Sade, have a charm to them that just makes me laugh and listen. In addition the voice acting is well done, although I've been playing in French in order to give the setting a more accurate feel (Hearing British accents in the English version breaks the immersion for me, even if the voice actors are talented).\n\nNow for the negatives:\n\n-Bugs. BUGS everywhere! Plus, poor optimization has ruined both the graphical quality and gameplay in this supposed "next-gen" game. While the bugs may be hilarious on some moments (I had a hysterical fit after my character fell into a simulation abyss after jumping from a building), for the most part the bugs are more irritating than they're worth. Usually, I play newly released games for many hours nonstop, but I'm struggling to play even an hour in one sitting because the bugs are a gamebreaker for me.\n-Frame rate issues. This is a personal preference, but if I'm playing a PC game, I expect 60 fps to be the standard. My PC can handle Titanfall and Metro: Last Light at around 80fps but for AC: Unity, the game plays at 40 fps maximum, and drops to as low as 15 fps on some areas of the game, like the Cafe Theatre, which is the Assassin's HQ. I could have tolerated 30fps if the the frame rate was stable, but the game constantly shifts in frame rate.\n-Microtransactions. If I paid $60 for a single-player game, I expect that to be the final payment for the game. Trying to further fleece your customers as well as purposely failing to tell reviewers about the microtransactions is an unethical business maneuver that should be condemned universally. Shame on you Ubisoft!\n\nAll in all, I wanted to love this game due to its characters and setting, but the poor optimization and microtransactions prove that Ubisoft needs to rethink their strategy in developing future games as well as issuing an emergency patch for this broken game. A disappointing purchase for a longtime fan of the series.","November 12, 2014","false","9.2"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","0"

For example you can't assassinate people with the hidden blade after throwing a smoke bomb... you are forced into slow melee and they removed the ability to switch to your hidden blade as a weapon while in melee... and I think you only get one hidden blade.  If you recieve two i can't tell.\n\nCo-Op never works.\n\nIts saving system is terrible.  For i have purchased, in-game, 300,000+ F  of items... twice and they still show up as needing to be purchased once i quit the game and return.  I don't just purchase them, either.  After spending my florens I play missions and fast travel so as to give the game a reason to save/load.  But it still says i need to purchase items that I have already purchased several times.\n\nThe story is boring.\n\nThe parkour is frustrating to say the least, though they did add some pretty new moves... i hate getting stuck on furniture and circling windows cuz Arno doesn't want to enter them for some reason.\n\nUpgrading skills is masked as new and different, but really you still are restricted to certain skills based on how far in the story you are and you also have to acquire the needed amount of skill points... which you can only get by playing co-op missions or main story missions\n\nOnly buy it if it's 5$ or if you're so rich 60$ is 5$ to you and you don't care about throwing money away.\n\nI completely regret buying this game.

If you have one, you still will be disappointed by the low FPS and multiple bugs.  My PC (16 GB RAM, good CPU, overclocked Nvidia Titan, latest drivers) can play the game at 1080p with everything maxed out (Ultra High, TXAA, HBAO+, PCSS) at 40-45 FPS average but during one of the cut-scenes I noticed 17-18 FPS.  At least you don't need D3DOverrider, which I was using with AC4 Black Flag because it doesn't have VSync triple buffering (this one has).\n\nThere are multiple bugs:  people half in the ground or inside walls, people appearing from thin air, gaps between textures, the game crashed once when I was browsing the clothing menu, rewards unlocked in Uplay remain locked in the game ...\n\nThe game is an example of some of the worst business practices in modern gaming:  micro-transactions, chests that require membership and particular level on "AC Initiates" (http://acinitiates.com ), chests that require wasting your time with their mobile "Companion App" ....  On top of that AC Initiates is not fully functional and partially broken at present time.\n\nThe game-play is almost unchanged except some small improvements in the free running and the half-baked cover / stealth mechanics.  No more chain kills.  I was pleased that many buildings are accessible and you can enter them.  Paris looks really beautiful and some interiors are amazing but this is pretty much the only "innovation" you'll find in this chapter of the series.\n\nUnless you are a really big AC fan, don't buy this game in its current state.  AC 4 Black Flag was a better game and until they patch Unity and reduce the price, it's not worth your money.","November 12, 2014","false","85.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","0"

But I, like many others users, tired of been conned by Ubisoft. First of all, seasson pass & pre-order content not working at all. Game is filled with additional content, unlockable only by using mobile app or by paying additional money (like f2p games)!\n\nThere also a lot of more dire problems with the game itself - like poor optimization for PC (I have i7 920 2.66 @ 3.65 Ghz, Gigabyte Geforce 780 Ti and 12 Gb of overclocked DDR3 RAM and still have lags, freezes and so on) and various bugs such falling throught the floor, stucking in various places, hovering NPCs, sticking-to-everything-freerun-mode, clumsy combat mechanics.\n\nCoop mode is a mess partially because of mentioned problems, partially because of connection issues. Which is a shame, since if you manage to find right partner(s) for your coop experience, you will find that the game will give you several options how to complete such mission. For example, the mission there you need to rescue unlucky spy will eventually lead you to the prison, there you can take several routs to approch your objective, be it frontal assault, infiltration via roofs or just exploring the surrounding area and find out that nearby sewer tunnel leads right into the prison.\n\nBut personally for me the main problem is that in Russia, were I live, the game is only avaliable in Russian localization, which is just terrible, full of "misheard" and spelling errors.Also, I would like to point out, that we, customers,were not given any information that the game will be only in Russian language, then we pre-ordered it. The notice about that appeared in store page only resently.\n\nConsidering this, we all were missinformed and as the result - totaly screwed because of our trust in Ubisoft. Then Take2 made such thing with Borderlands 2, at least they have the balls to change this and give Russian/CIS players English version of the game. I highly doubt that Ubisoft will do the same.\n\nThe funny thing is that a lot of gamers (if not majority) in Russia, who don't pirate games, buy them from Steam because of English language option. So by locking us away from English language versions only result in increased piracy.\n\nI don't understand why Ubisoft can't simply region-lock their games, or at least give us an option to upgrade our games to multi-language EU version by paying the difference in price, like Blizzard done with Starcraft 2 & Diablo 3.\n\nAs for me, ACU and FC4 were two last Ubisoft games that I bought if things will stay as they are right now.\n\nSo, if you live in any part of the world, apart from Russia of CIS contries, I recomend you to wait for sale and then buy the game then it will be fully patched. But if you live in above mentioned contries, I recomend not to buy it, or any other Ubisoft game until we will be treated as normal customers, not like second-ranked.","November 17, 2014","false","33.5"," 53 of 71 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","53","71","0","0"

It was beautiful, with the wonderful image of Paris. That all changed, however, when I couldnt complete missions because of characters I was supposed to follow falling through the ground.

Assassin's Creed seemed to be the franchise, that was built for me. Then came revelations and I was disappointed to the level of not even considering to buy Brotherhood. I scorned all the sequels and went back once I had read about Black Flag, which pulled me back into AC's glorious days. What I had learned was to carefully research reviews and opinions prior to an impulse buy, which costs you being part of it from the beginning and not being able to argue when friends and buddies all talk about it. AC Unity got plenty of bashing through reviews and first buyers alike, though it kept fascinating me just through the still pictures I saw online. I waited until it was bugfixed and patched and I didn't regret having added it to my collection.\n\nTrue, there are some minor glitches still and it is also true, every 3h of gameplay Arno won't exactly do what you where aiming to when pushing the controls (sidenote, I am a mouse / keyb gamer). Sometimes NPCs pop out of nowhere, but the whole experience is so immersive that it all won't matter. Hiding and planning your next move, analyzing patrol movements, carefully trying to achieve all challenges from the mission objectives and levelling up to get better gear, skills and outfit made me long for the next treasure and the next chest. The world of AC Unity is utterly overwhelming at the beginning where never ending missions, secrets and the like fill your map. It is most disorienting and luckily I am not a completionist. The story is compelling enough to keep you going and the fights are a tough nut to crack (why that's probably my first AC where I really specialized on stealth). The game is incredibly rewarding if a mission goes well and no alarm was triggered. It provides a sense of plain satisfaction. The French Revolution as a setting is breathtaking by just walking through the streets and wondering about it's marvellous architecture. Though I cannot claim its historic accuracy, the mix of it with some hollywoodish intermezzo just makes the trick.\n\nThe game will keep you busy with plenty of extras outside of the main story, where you're requested to complete rifts, which is some kind of data collection parcours, investigation quests where clues will lead you to accuse one of many suspects and the solving of puzzles to gain access to special armour, or you can plan a heist in a well protected villa to gain more loot than by just roaming the streets. They're all optional but seemed more than a filler to me and are truly engaging if you're committed to let it sink in. I would buy the game again just to walk through French Revolution Paris once more and would make it mandatory to have the city and it's crowd being visitable via VR to every history class professor. I didn't do any of the multiplayer part since nobody ever seemed to play either at my level or was trying an online game while I was.\n\nWhat I especially liked\n+ fights are very hard, but smooth and nice to look at\n+ special skills like transforming yourself into a target\n+ the utter beauty and vivacity of the environments\n+ the tons of options to configure my own Arno to my playstyle\n+ sidequests like the Paris stories\n\nWhat I didn't like much\n- I felt like I missed a lot by not chasing every potential map entry, but I got tired at some point\n- That's personal flavour, but I missed the real world Abstergo parts Desmond Miles got me used to\n- Another personal flavour, the tombs and treasure hunts felt always like an arcadish challenge and I missed them\n- The story builds up nicely, but ends a bit abruptly and feels flat (and I didn't understand it to be honest...)\n\nOther than that, I would recommend the game anytime.\nCheers, adre\n","May 15","true","73.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","26","28","3","3"

Of course, by downloading the DLC, you are giving up your rights to sue Ubisoft over Assassin's Creed: Unity, so there is that.\n\nAnyway, I just finished Dead Kings on Xbox.  What I found there addressed some of the issues that I saw in the game, though if you are looking for a glitchless experience, you won't find it here.  What you will find is a more satisfying conclusion to Arno's story, which is one thing that truely disappointed me about Unity.  In addition, you'll get some more side quest goodness with some pretty decent rewards.  Its underground mazes add a new element to the game that is fun to explore as well.\n\nIt definitly does not fix things.  Bugs abound in the game, to include freezing you in place halfway through a mission, which I found to be the most common bug. Also, where as I found myself constantly relying on stealth in the main game, certain changes in enemy AI as well as the WMD known as the guillatine gun turned me into a melee fiend, kinda taking away from the whole 'assassin' thing.\n\nBut despite these lingering problems, Dead Kings is a step in the right direction.  If you have the game, the DLC is free, so there is no harm in playing through.  Dead Kings doesn't make up for all the problems that Unity STILL has... but it does at least put a period to the end of a painful paragraph in the Assassin's Creed Franchise.\n-------\n\nGame Completed Review:\nSo I played the game through on Xbox instead of PC.  I left the initial review comments below, for any interested parties, as I still cannot get it to work on my computer.\n\nI am a huge fan of the series.  When AC: Victory comes out next year, I will buy the game before it is released, and I will have the season pass.  So when I say that if you are not a huge fan of the series, you should give this game a miss, that should let you know how I feel about the game.\n\nOh, it isn't that Unity is a bad game overall.  Paris is thus far my favorite AC world, and will give you hours of exploration to do, with dozens of activities.  I have been playing it almost straight for the last two weeks, and am still not complete with everything I can do.\n\nBut that said, it is certainly a far cry from what Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was.  Assassin's Creed Black Flag had a compelling setting, a very compelling protagonist, and the sidequesting was a dream come true - who wouldn't want to be a pirate?  It also ended on a high note, with one of the sweetest endings that I have seen in any game.\n\nBy comparison, AC:U had an interesting setting (the French Revolution), but interesting is not necessarily compelling.  Arno's initial introduction had me excited; it reminded me of Ezio, which is one of the all time fan favorite assassins.  But Arno wasn't nearly as well developed as he could have been.  Sure, you can go into the database and read Elise's letters, or see the database entry on Arno, but that is not the same as what they did with Ezio over the course of three games, or even Conner or Edward in one game each.  Sidequesting takes a lot of time, and provides a varied amount of activities for you to do, but at some point it got monotonous, and I did not have as much fun completing side missions as I could have.  And finally, the ending, while it brought everything to a nice resolution in one of the best boss fights of the series, left a lot to be desired.  I won't leave any spoilers, mostly because there is nothing to spoil.  In the other AC games, there was always a reason that you were still back in the Animus, finishing up whatever you didn't do; no such reason is given here.\n\nIf you are a diehard fan of the series, then check out the game when it goes on sale; aside from some major glitch issues (which UbiSoft is STILL working on), the game was alright, and the glitches don't render the game unplayable, just annoying.  But if you are just a casual fan, go get AC:BF or wait until the next AC release to check THAT out.  This game isn't worth the time (so heartbreaking to write that line...)\n\nAlso, in light of my continuing computer issues, make sure that you have a computer that can run this game well before you get it, if you get it.\n\n**********\nInitial Release Review:\nLike so many other reviews of this game upon its initial release to PC, I must sadly give a downgrade to what I think would have been an awesome game.  I am biased of course; I love Assassin's Creed; I have been addicted to the series for years now, and have bought the last three games on pre-release.  On all three release days, I have been driven myself crazy trying to get the game to work.  Though I have enjoyed every game in the series (yes, even ACIII, I am THAT much of a fanboy), I have to say that Ubisoft is horrible when it comes to delivery, especially on launch day.\n\nI see this game succeeding in spite of itself, as Ubisoft will possibly put out a patch that will make it easier for us all to play on PC, and eventually everyone will forget what a horrible launch day Assassin's Creed Unity had.\n\nUntil that time, I cannot in good consious recommend this game to anyone who is not a die hard fan.  When Ubisoft puts out that patch (or when I get a better computer in a few years), I will re-review the game at that time.","November 11, 2014","false","6.2"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","42","56","0","0"

It fixes a lot of things that the past titles struggled on. The parkour is much better, smoother really. The fighting is more challenging, can't take on armies by yourself anymore. A lot of people say that this game went in a poor direction, I disagree, I think this game is more of an Assassin's Creed game than the last 2. You aren't some crazy guy with daddy issues and a anger problem that wins the revolutionary war with a hachet and you aren't some pirate that spends 80% of his time on boat in a game that is famous for running/climbing on buildings.

The setting is beautiful; Paris is built up wonderfully; the parkour mechanics are relatively smooth and the ability to do a controlled descent is warmly welcome. Combat is a matter of preference. I was fond of the killstreaks in AC2 and the faster-pace action in AC3 and Black Flag. The combat is more tactical, but at the same time feels more drawn out than it needs to be.\n\nThe plot is a missed opportunity. While I appreciate the game's missions being something of homage to the original AC's approach in terms of opening up opportunities and giving player the freedom to choose how to approach an objective, most of the game is a missed opportunity. Arno has the potential to be a charming character, but he is no Ezio and doesn't hold a candle to Edward. Even Connor had more personality. Very dry character and unimpressive plot - no twists, no surprises, and even the modern-day setting was minimalistic. This is surprising given how well Black Flag integrated the modern setting into the experience.\n\nThere's a distinct lack of things to do. You have your side-missions and collectibles, which number in the hundreds, but it feels like many steps back from Black Flag and even AC3, which had far more gameplay features. Arno doesn't seem to do anything. Compared to Ezio, who does everything from ride shotgun in a carriage to dive bombing in a flying machine, Arno's grandest moment is...running after a hot-air balloon. The excitement isn't there. I spent 90% of my time collecting chests. That's a really poor replay mechanic, especially as the money really doesn't matter after you unlock your main source of income.\n\nIn the interface is surprisingly bad. Tooltips and popups overlap each other, making the murder mysteries very frustrating to play through. The glitches...well, they're notorious by now, and while the game has been patched since, the parkour mechanics are way too sticking for tight moves. When you try "The Tournament" mission, you'll tear out your hair as you watch Arno stick to walls and refuse to come off despite your inputs. It's way too unresponsive.\n\nCo-op feels forced onto the player rather than being a benefit. The co-op missions can be done solo, but some are devilishly hard. It's poor game design to require a mission to be played co-op rather than adjusting the mission for solo play. AC has always been a single-player experience and Unity should have respected that. Co-op is bugged with crashes and de-syncs, and it feels like a laggy version of a single-player mission. The game was really marketed on its four-player co-op potential, but it's not well-integrated and is more of a hassle than something to look forward to.\n\nI'm most disappointed in the amount of feature-creep in Unity. Microtransactions for temporary boosts that...aren't needed at all. Requiring the mobile app to open chests is a blatant insult to players. The app itself is pointless. It's typical Facebook-style "Start mission, wait 6 hours" passivity, and with at least one data crash, it's unreliable. Other chests require use of Ubisoft's Initiates site, which is meant to compile the player's AC achievements, but that's also bugged and incomplete a month after release.\n\nIn the end, it's another AC game, and if you like AC, you'll like Unity. But it's a messy release and devoid of the charm that the series has built up. It saddens me to say that the best thing I got out of buying AC Unity was the chance to claim a free game due to its buggy release.","December 22, 2014","false","64.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional. No similar "WTF" moment like at the end of AC:Brotherhood. Just an average predictable ending with nothing special to it.\n\nCombat is a lot harder, not that that's a bad thing. No kill streaks. "Tougher" enemies are tougher. Whistling enemies to their doom is gone and will be missed. The only issue I have with the combat is that there is no counter measure to enemies shooting at you; no "human shield" counter measure. Having two high tier riflemen shooting at you will kill you, and there is nothing you can really do to stop it; except throwing a smoke grenade which isn't my favorable approach to the situation. I really miss the human shield counter measure.\n\nOne thing I really did enjoy about the game were the investigatory quests, Sherlock Holmes style. I hope they carry on these types of quest into their following games.\n\nHopefully in near future Ubisoft will optimize the game on PC, and polish the game some more so that I'm not so reluctant to recommend the game to others.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDay 1 review -  Story is decent, main character is decent.\nPC optimization - absolutely horrendous.\nMouse/ Keyboard setup is bad.

Just... Bugged out of proportion. This is quite normal for game nowadays, they fix that in later patches. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Looking for the positive reviews, but they never really show. I thought welp - I own the game, might as well try it. During the first five minutes of play, I encountered two bugs. NPCs walking on top of one another, and trees floating above ground. Gritting my teeth, I played on, thinking I could look past these things. And to my surprise, I could indeed look past it.\n\nIn spite of this, I had to uninstall. Just... Give up. Combat is horrible - every guard owns a gun, and every guard is a marksman. They have no problem unloading their guns in a crowd, nor do they miss someone running past them at a distance with people in between. Those are shots really good marksman have a hard time with, with a modern gun, and these guys are shooting ancient crap that has the same precision as say... Boomerangs. Only these ancient boomerang guns seem to be magical. I had no idea ubisoft implemented magical weapons. But there you go. If someone aims at me, I could do nothing about it. Oh yeah, the dodge feature, which instantly allows you to become a target for meleers while the marksman (perhaps) misses. Great, dodge the bullet, stabbed with the sword.\n\nFine, fine... I thought. Perhaps I'm just bad at this. And after all, I am an assassin, not a knight or a samurai. I should be competent in melee, but not a superhero. I'll kill them in stealth instead. Only I can't because many enemies are also clairvoyant. It's my fault really, if they have magical guns then chances should be good that they're also wizards, who can instantly tell that their friends die even though their backs are turned and their friends make no sound as they die. Even around corners, if they're a pair walking down the street. So, stabbing is out of the question unless you stab all your enemies in the same moment.\n\nAgain I thought; fine... Fine... Assassins are not mass killers. They don't take out several people. They're pinpoint killers, focusing on the one target they're supposed to hit then running for it. But again - running for it only works if your enemies doesn't have the time to draw their magical guns and firing through masses of people, hitting the one person who's running. Which they often do.\n\nI mean, I am not bad at these sort of games. I've played almost all other assassin creed games. From Altair, to Ezio, to Connor and Kenway. I never had any problems in any sort of combat, and I liked them all in varying degrees. But this game... Can't do it. Combat is out, stealth is out. What am I supposed to do? Petition a ban against magical guns? I know I haven't played the game that much, but that's not really a feature is it?\n\nIn either case. Buy this if you're a huge fan, or if you just like wonky gameplay. Otherwise, don't bother.\nIt's a polished turd.

Crashes, glitches, framerate stutters and major framerate dips and losses even on loweest settings and resoulution. The game is buggy and just plain broken. The issues plague all platform, Xbox One PS4 and PC. This is one of the worst laucnhes from Ubisoft in recent memory, even worse than Watchdogs at launch. Is this is a good game? Sure, once Ubisoft fixes the damned thing. But as of right now, I honestly cannot reccomend anyone should buy this in the current state that it is in. Wait for the patches, *however long that it is* and spend your money elsewhere. There are thousands of reports from all over the internet about this game's terrible performannce issues on even High end PCs.

Maybe on sale.\nLets get to the review before this is longer than the LoTR trilogy:\n\nUp and down parkour works sometimes perfectly, and would be perfect addition to AC series, but it is about luck. Arno will not follow your orders at all sometimes. Even in the new cover system, Arno will choose the cover he prefers over the cover you chose, and is very clunky. The counter button does not everytime work, Arno's decision not yours, so you will die every now and then, because it was Arno's wish to die.\n\nCombat took a massive leap backwards, it was better in AC3 and that should be saying something. The counters dont work, as I said, but not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the gunshots. You cannot counter them, you cannot always dodge them, and they can happen even when you are in middle of finishing move. Yeah, and two or three shots is enough to kill you when you have max health.\nA rare plus here tho: I like how when one enemy sees you, they dont have shared vision anymore, so the rest dont. The enemies are individuals, and not controlled by some overmind.\n\nUbi advertised their new customization a ton, but the truth is, it doesent change anything all that much, expect belts (more ammo) wich were in previous ACs too. They are mostly cosmetic changes, and there are only 3 or 4 different armors, and the rest change just one button of the shirt or so. Then there are the good looking ones, but you have to compete in Club Competetive to win those. And even after that you have to save a ton of money to get it, or you could always ''hack it'' with ''hack currency'' that you buy with real money. Yeah, a pay to play pay to win game.\n\nWhat did I like about the game tho? The small, very small, customization and the up and down parkour as ideas, seemless enterable buildings and the new assassination missions. If Assassin's Creed is going into this RPG direction, I feel it is the right one. And playing with friends is almost always more fun than alone. Just ditch this ''seemless multiplayer'' crap, it ruins singleplayer for the singleplayers and multiplayer for the multiplayers.\n\nI hope that Assassin's Creed will go the original Tomb Raider path, that another studio would buy the series, and make the series what Assassin's Creed used to be.","November 15, 2014","false","26.5"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

I was not fully convinced however simply because I can run both Tomb Raider and Titanfall on ultra settings (minus TressFX on Tomb Raider) and get 50-60 FPS. As I was extremely dissapointed with my poor judgement on purchasing a game my rig simply could not run I decided to Google " Assassin's Creed Unity compatibility" and slowly began to understand the massive issue this game is having. After watching many videos and reading a few articles I've adjusted my settings as such: all textures are low and lighting filters are off, my resolution is at 1280x720 in windowed mode and I get 30-50 FPS. Besides the obvious optimization issues this game has the storyline has no relevance to the last game, it sounds like Sean is still in this game but he has some sort of code-name, I'm not exactly sure. From what I've gathered Abstergo has created an Animus type console that allows you to play memories that they have pre-loaded, the Assasssin's hack your server and upload the memories of Arno to play. I feel as though it's just bull-♥♥♥♥ and is clearly a cash cow. I've thuroughly enjoyed every Assassn's Creed game up until this point and I think this will be my last purchase of the series. Regardless of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the storyline and optimization are, the gameplay and climbing system is incredibly more fluid and I do have fun jumping roof to roof in a quick and easy way, there's not as many hang-ups climbing that I've experienced in the previous which is a plus. Basically if you're a huge fan of the series and have not purchased this game, I don't think it's worth it, if you want to give it a shot cause you think it looks fun, wait until they have fixed this game from the peice of ♥♥♥♥ that it currently is then proceed to have fun at your discretion.

Everytime there is a cutscene playing, it gets very glitchy and laggy. Not to mention there are so many bugs in the game, I remember I was trying to climb down, and it resulted of the game to crash. Hopefully this game gets good amount of patches to fix all these bugs, then this game will be great overall.

Many games in the past have had the "First Day Bugs/Problems" that get resolved in a certain period of time. The game is enjoyable, but not as much as Assassins Creed: IV Black Flag. Black Flag had a stealth system that felt too easy, but it worked. In Unity, it was taken over board and we got almost impossible AI, I don't know if this is just me needing to get used to the new AI or there are problems with the AI. So, some of the things in the game are kind of laughable. Again, this does not mean that this game instanly gets a low 0/10. The game just came out and until we get fixes, we can rate it properly.

It has already crashed 7 times and I have above recommended specs to run this game. DONT BUY THIS **** TIL THEY FIX IT.\n\n\n\nEDIT:: I have neglected to edit this review since I was able to play, and finish AC Unity. Still rage-filled so here we go.\n\n\n\nThis game is terrible. I'm saying this as an AC fanboy, but this game is terrible. Ubisoft should be held to a very high standard, especially with AC games; however, AC Unity does nothing but disappoint and confuse me. My dislike of AC3 and Black Flag were because of the weak protagonists, but Unity takes it to another level.\n\nArno (who's name I couldn't even remember 3/4 of the way through the campaign) is an utterly flat, boring and blatantly trasparent attempt to recreate the magic of Ezio Auditore. Arno is brash, unlikeable, and maintains an immense level of stupidty to further the 'plot' of this game. The sad thing is, most of the characters in this game are about the same, or worse.\n\nElise, your on and off companion throughout the campaign, is an equally flat, idiotic character. She is a plot pusher that comes along whenever the storyline stalls out to the point of it being laughable. Aside from that, she offers precisely nothing to the game whatsoever apart from decent voice-acting.\n\nOverall the story is boring, drawn out, and confusing. I never knew who I was killing and why I was killing them, also, whenever you complete a contract your victim does not speak to you (like in previous AC games 'requiescat in pace') but Arno somehow absorbs information from their brain into his. This leads to weird out-of-body experiences that are never explained. Or maybe they were, I was half-asleep from boredom while playing through the story mode.\n\nI would say that this game's redeeming quality would be the world, and don't get me wrong, Paris is beautiful, but even with a GTX 970 I can barely manage 24 fps on this poorly optimized insult to AC fans everywhere. Ubisoft should be ashamed of this title, and I truly hope that the next AC game actually works.

One doesn't necessarily play AC for the story anyway, but it carries along nicely from the more recent games.\n\nParkour ControlsIt's pretty easy to get around. My one complaint involves getting down from a roof. Arno simply doesn't like it, no matter how many times you push the buttons, causing me to constantly look for alternative, non-lethal jumps.\n\nOf course, there's still that "My assassin is an idiot" feel when you are running down the street and suddenly jump onto an urn someone left behind, sitting there perched like an imbecile.  You jump off, but instead of landing on the ground, you make a magnificent leap onto a bench across the street.  Jumping from the bench, you now grab onto the beams over a doorway.  Arno, you idiot. I just want to be on the fricking ground!\n\nCombatCombat is fairly nice and responsive, but somewhat repetitive.  You mostly just swing, parry, etc.\n\nStealthStealth is difficult, as the AI can see you in the most unlikely way.  Still, successfully going stealthy will usually make your life easier, although in most instances you can get caught and just slaughter everyone, regardless.\n\nCo-opCo-op is a blast.  You can do free roam together and there are quite a lot of co-op quests. Some of these list as being for 4 players, but we've handled all of them with just 2.  You continue to get rewards for completing co-op quests even after you've done them a time or two.\n\nOptimization and BugsIt's highly unlikely that you will get 60fps on Ultra. I have a 980m with 16 gb of RAM and a 3.,5 ghz processor and get about 45. Medium graphics still look nice. Low graphics look...awful.\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs.","June 2, 2015","true","62.8"," 64 of 99 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","64","99","11","10"

The optimzation sucks and not on just PC, but across the charts on PS4 and Xbox one, which is suffering the most. Like many people, when Ubisoft posted the system requirments I thought my rig was outdated and weak. Rest assured it's safe to say it isn't your rig. In fact any decent gaming rig should be able to play this, but the reasoning to why Ubisoft set the system requirments so high is so that they can make up for their utterly terrible and lazy job at optimizing this game. I love the franchise, but this is just complete and utter garbage. The programmers and everyone who contributed to ACU is comparable to that of a brain dead person confined to a hospital bed. Ubisoft should not be proud of the release of Assassin's Creed Unity. There are numerous bugs to be fixed (I've come across at least 4 - 5). Even in the other reviews down below a person with 16gb of ram, i74770k and a 980 can barley get this game to run 40fps. ACU is not worthy of the asking price from Ubisoft.

When the mists of lagg clear and you're eager to continue, you notice Arno floats mid-air in his gliding position, not able to move or anything. Starting Coöp or fast traveling may fix this, yet if you're in the begin missions, this may turn you into a rage devil.( consult a doctor before raging, tables will be flipped.)\n\nA pro about the PC version is that the online experience is free of cost, in comparison to PS4 and XboxOne.\nLagg doesn't occur for me most of the times(mind you that the only thing not being 'optimal' is my vid card.)\nmaking the online experience one of the best gameplay features of Unity.\n\nJust for those who would still consider buying it. I strongly suggest you don't when your pc can't handle the weight this game will bring with it. If your video card is from Nvidia, is a ' generation too less' and it's the only thing not optimal for Unity, you might want to take the risk to try it, if you're willing to go through 30 minutes of hell first in the begin missions.\n\nConclusion: For the average old gen pc user, i don't recommend buying it. For those with a 'weaker' vid card, i'm suggesting you consider well before taking the risk to try it. But a life without risk, is a life not lived.","November 13, 2014","false","41.3"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","0"

This review is sorted in different departments, just look for the title you want to know more about).\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPros:	     Graphic's are awesome.\nCombat and sneaking is really nice.\nCatching Story (In its parts).\nParkour/Free running, it is one of the things that makes this game so special.\n\nCons:	     Bugs/Glitches, can get veeery annoying sometimes.\nShort and repeating story\nExcept fast travel there is not transportation likes horses or boats as in the older games.\n------------------------------------\n\nStory: 6/10\nThe story in Unity is short and repeating. Most missions are just like eachother just with different locations, difficulties and environment. The story is 12 sequences long, without spoiling anything and what keeps the rating up in my opinion is the ending. It is catching and both fun & sad at the same time.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nGraphics in this game are amazing tho u might experience some glitches throughout the game, like a man who's feet have been minimized to the max. Not much to say about it, they are very nice imo.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nCombat: 7/10\nIt's fun to fight and kill people in this game, the variety of weapons makes it even better and while fighting you doesn't only spam left mouse button and right mouse button, it's also about dodging, shooting/quick shooting, stunning your enemies and parrying their attacks. Tho the game doesn't always do as you wish, and it doesn't always dodge when you want it to.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nRunning/Free running: 7/10\nIf you played other assassin's creed you already know what it is like. Tho this game likes to get you stuck for example when you're gonna drop down from something or want to jump to a different location but instead it jumps in another direction, ye it is annoying sometimes when you are chasing someone on the rooftops. Otherwise it is lots of fun, and that is one of the things that makes this game so special.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nBugs/Glitches: 4/10\nAnd ofcourse there is the bugs in this game, all games have their bugs and glitches, but this game, this game beats them all other games in that... Ofc it is not as bad as it was on release but sometimes it is really annoying, like when you get spotted through the walls by guards and you gotta restart because you ♥♥♥♥ed up or when you knock out a guard and again you get spotted by that guard. Or when you randomly fall through the ground and you have to reload it again.. Ofc there are more bugs that I didn't mention but if you are one of those persons who loves assassin's creed and think that you can deal with bugs. Go ahead, it is a great game.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPersonal opinions:\nCompared to other Assassin's Creed games this one is definately not the best. It has no crafting system at all like in Black flag and so on, which I liked in my opinion. Tho in unity different armor pieces gives you different hp, range, ammo, dmg and so on in all eternity. Tho I think that if you enjoyed other Assassin's Creed I think that you can enjoy this if you only give it a chance to prove itself. I didn't like it in the beginning neither but a bit further in the game I enjoyed it more and more so it is definately worth giving this game a go.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nFound this review good or helpful? Consider giving it a thumbs up! :)","April 1","true","20.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","18","19","4","3"

I loved it, and was really looking forward to Unity. Everyone is well aware now how the launch of Unity turned out, so I am not going to re-hash all that (in short, game ran well for a small minority, there were massive problems for everyone else). I'm was in the latter group, and putting aside the myriad of bugs (such as Arno getting stuck on level geometry with no way for you to move), my biggest issue was very poor performance, even with every graphical setting dialled down to the absolute lowest.\n\nNow that Patch 4 has been released (the patch that was meant to focus on performance), I am still in exactly the same position. There appears to have been no performance improvements on my system whatsoever with the new patch. So, maybe one day when I buy a supercomputer, I may actually be able to properly try out the game (though it will still likely be an unoptimised POS, so unlikely).

Paris has been lovingly recreated with a 1:1 scale, meaning when you walk up to or climb buildings they look massive and the same proportions as in real life, that makes a big difference from past Creed games.\n\nGraphically it looks superb with everything maxed out and you can tell Ubisoft put most of their effort into making the actual city in painstaking detail. The amount of NPC'S in this is insane as well, usually open world games have far fewer people walking around the streets than you would expect. This goes the complete opposite direction, there is one mission where there are literally thousands of people you have to navigate through to find the target you need to assassinate.\n\nThis is however also what f*cked up the game and breaks the immersion for you as a player. Ubisoft hasn't managed to eliminate the bugs of NPC'S appearing and disappearing in front of you, and some characters still swap their clothes at will. I can't stress how bad this is in the game, because there are always large crowds of people on the streets it happens CONSTANTLY and was really distracting to me. I eventually was able to ignore it after about 10 hours, but by that time i was just trying to finish the story missions.\n\nThe game also still doesn't run that well because of (i assume) the large crowds of people. I would get between 40 to 60 fps with the settings all maxed out, and my pc is pretty good.\n\nThere actually is a f*ckton of side content to do, but the few side missions i tried were rubbish. There are these new detective murder mystery missions you can solve where you have to talk to people and accuse the right person who you think did it. At the start of this it warned me not to accuse just anyone and to be sure of who i thought it was, so i thought that all the evidence pointing to the guy who obviously did it was a misdirection by one of the characters planting the evidence on the guy.......but no it actually is the guy you think it is, so it's rubbish lol i didn't bother with the other murder mysteries.\n\nI tried co op but the one time it worked for me the guy immediately left, so good luck finding people to play with.\n\nStory wise it's okay i guess, although there weren't really any stand out missions that took me by surprise like in Rogue, also all the characters speak with an english accent.........in FRANCE lol, i was thinking about this and it's either have the voice actors speak with a sh*tty french accent like Joseph Gordon Levitt in The Walk and give the game some charm, or do what they did and not even try.\n\nIf you like Assassins Creed games and have a fairly powerful PC i would cautiously recommend this, the only bugs i witnessed were cosmetic, the game never crashed on me or had bugged missions like some past Creed games i've played. It's a shame Ubisoft fell at the last hurdle because the game does a lot of things well, it's just that the things it does wrong are so consistent that it ruins a big part of the experience.","January 23","true","22.9"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","7"

The stealth mechanics in this game are amazing, as this game has lacked a dedicated crouch button for ages.\n- Mission design. Assassination missions are MASSIVE with dozens of ways to get to your target, completely non-linearly.\n\nCons\n- Buggier than Black Flag. I haven't had any major bugs, but others have. The worst I've seen are co-op bugs due to                     connection, however I'm used to that in my country. I have confidence that Ubisoft will work hard to fix bugs quickly and effectively.\n- "Stickyness" to walls and objects is often infuriating during chase missions but this has been around since the first game.\n- I can't remember how long the sequences were in the past games, but the ones in unity are generally 3 missions long.\n- I very much enjoyed the out-of-the-animus first-person missions in Black Flag, but they are not present in Unity (I think they're in Rogue, though) I do not like the replacement for these missions, being the "Server Bridge" where you are transported to a different time period of Paris (14th century, WW2, etc.) because although I liked seeing Paris in different ages the gameplay was a bit "arcadey"\n\n\nSo there you go, my review for Assassin's Creed Unity. I enjoyed it a lot more than Brotherhood, Revelations and AC3\n\nNow, I assume my review is going to be downvoted to hell by haters, but at least I wrote it.\n\n9 out of 10","December 9, 2014","true","109.2"," 173 of 295 people (59%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","59","173","295","16","9"

I am on a quite powerful system, sporting 3-way Sli GTX780ti units, and Haswell flagship (2011 v3)-Intel X99 platform. To put it in the kindest way possible, this title seldom takes proper advantage of such hardware, and issues that are present should have never made it into the final retail build. It is like all testing was exempt, and Ubisoft wanted to release the game before the holiday season. Disgraceful performance. Attempting to run at 1440p is disgusting, the engine was obviously never considered to run at 60hz above 1080p.\n\nThey may patch it, but I will remember this release as the worst in history from Ubisoft. I have terminated my order for FarCry 4, and advisted as many as I can to do the same.\n\nThe once great company that gave us FarCry, is no more...\n\nIf I had to evaluate the new in-house engine it would be as follows:\n\nTextures are washed out. Aassets look like they were taken from a game over 5 years ago. AI is comical. Landscape and texture "pop-in" is the worst I have seen in a AAA title. Draw distance was obviously built around console limitations as is the rest is the entire game presentation for the PC platform.\n\nUnity, in a nutshell, is a waste of money, time, and space.

Assassins Creed games.\nOverall for me, Unity is the new low point in the long line of Assassins Creed games. Here is why.\n\nTime to vent about dirty money. You're offered packages of in-game currency up to worth of nearly 100 euros to buy items which make the game easier for you. The game is already relatively easy and you don't need any of the bling provided by the cha-ching. Besides, you're rewarded with in-game items as you progress in the game and I found those items to be just enough help. Now I do realize that mtx-business is the current trend and its understandable for them to try and make money out of their product but it just feels wrong, like dirty money. Not like Valve's business model which doesn't make the game any easier. Cheats used to be there to make the game easy for scrubs but I guess that time is long gone.\n\nThe story of the game is not entirely "flat" but it lacks that something which made the original Assassins Creed game have such an impact on me. Perhaps its the fact that the AC games used to have a "real life"-side to their storyline as opposed to Unity where all the action happens in-game. The main story in the series that (without going too much into detail) had to do with a certain ancient civilization and their relics, the happy fun times that is the impending demise of the world etc.  seems to have lost much of its importance and role in the game. Now Templars are just some chumps looking to make money at others expense and the really sinister world-domination is not that prominent a theme anymore.\nLuckily the storyline conscists of traditional AC themes such as betrayal, romance and "fight the power"-mentality which is all good there and definitely a big plus but overall still lacking.\n\n\nNow, some good things to say about the game.\nGraphics are fantastic. The level of detail and architecture (thats a plus for architects of Paris of the time though) in the various castles, churches, palaces and whatnot is of very high quality and really just a sight for sore eyes.\nThe gameplay of AC conscists of freerunning and combat as usual and it feels fairly smooth (albeit for some incredibly silly controlling flaws and bugs, much of which were fixed on the first patches), except for the combat mechanics: the "skills" are bought with yet another currency and to me it feels ridicilous that you just can't do anything to an enemy on the ground before you "buy" ground execution (which btw. can't be used in multiplayer, no idea why).\nShooting mechanics are allright but the phantom blade addition just feels silly (much less than blowgun used in the black flag).\n\nPerhaps the biggest and the best addition Unity has tried to give us are the multiplayer missions. A nice idea truly, but the lack of communication makes coordinating a 4-man assassin team a ludicrous job. Multiplayer bit has a lot of improving to do and I hope future patches do just that.\n\nThe Unity companion app is allright but the rewards it gives are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 250 credits from a single blue "nomad chest" makes me just think "yes mad". Not worth my time doing the ridicilous puzzle ♥♥♥♥, mission bit and then having to fetch it myself or wait for 24 hours. Right.\nUnity app feels like its just something they took out of the actual game for the sake of taking it out. Playing it on your mobile or tablet is okay I guess but what if someone doesn't have said devices at their disposal? Surely, they're living after their time but I'm just saying they should've added an option to do that ♥♥♥♥ in-game.\n\nThe game, with all its flaws, works as a fantastic time-sink even after completing the main story.\nRunning around the city, collecting the collectibles and doing mini-quests, multiplayer missions and stuff can give many hours of enjoyment if you wish to call it that.\n\nTL;DR: mämmi with sprinkles\n6/10 would not play through a second time","December 19, 2014","false","47.7"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

He grows up into a roguish man with a fondness for getting himself into trouble. His bad boy ways catch up with him as he tossed into prison after he is framed for murder. Coincidentally, he is placed in prison with a man who served with his father as an Assassin. With this new knowledge he takes on the role his Father once held and starts on his path to revenge.\n\nWhat we liked\n\nSplendid Visuals - France is beyond gorgeous, and this is easily one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The detail of each of the buildings is superb. The increased number of civilians are what truly steal the show, with over 100+ NPC’s crowding the streets and causing havoc. Each of the main characters are painstakingly detailed and have accurate and convincing facial expressions to match. This is easily the best looking and detailed Assassin’s Creed title to date.\n\nStealthy – I always thought that for a game all about Stealth, Assassin’s Creed had one of the absolute worst systems for doing so. Someone using the Animus has played a little bit of Splinter Cell, because Arno has finally learned what other Assassin’s haven’t… how to sneak around and use cover. It isn’t perfect by any means, but at least the options have expanded significantly.\n\nWealth of Content – Unity makes sure that you don’t ever have to worry about running out of things to do. There is so much content that exists in the game that it can be a bit overwhelming at first. Once that map opens up and each of those quests and collectibles appear on the screen, you’ll wonder if you will ever complete it all.\n\nCooperative Play – I’ve been dying for an Assassin’s Creed to allow for some true cooperative play. Unity does a great job at setting up missions for up to four players, or allowing them to free-roam and take on the world with their pals. If only the game wasn’t a mess in pretty much every other way.\n\nWhat we didn't like\n\nBuggy – What would an Assassin’s Creed game be without bugs? From people sinking into the floor and regularly popping into view, to the odd appearance of textures forming in the background. This title is full of all sorts of nonsense that will surely create many a YouTube Blooper Reel.\n\nNot Optimized – I have a GTX 980 and this game has all sorts of issues playing the game past the high setting. The frame-rate sporadically dips from 60 to 45 during cut scenes or anywhere there are tons of people standing around the city. This game was clearly was designed for a graphics card that will only appear when we get warp drive technology. It makes it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to configure for both looks and performance, and the random leap between frame-rate can get in the way of the experience.\n\nThe PS4 version on the other hand is filled with muddy textures, and basically becomes a slide show in most areas. This actually impacts combat and movement responsiveness which made it harder for me to parry attacks. The game had the nerve to freeze up randomly in some areas as well, while still sporting all of the buggy issues mentioned on the PC version. The console version is an absolute mess.\n\nTerrible Story – The plot relies on the tried and true revenge trope and a lot of convenient moments so that Arno can kill people. Unlike the previous games in the series, assassinating a Templar figurehead will emit a wave of memories for Arno to pick up with his ESP or whatever godlike ability he possesses. The problem is that for some reason the story is led by his sudden visions and nthe meanderings of the Assassin’s running the animus from the outside.\n\nThe story outside of the animus highlights the Assassins finding a random hacker, and asking him to help them beat Templars. He has no choice but to help them of course, and that’s the whole back story. You play a random guy who has to stop the Templars from stealing history… go you! I feel like I’m playing a random episode of Carmen San Diego or something, nah… that would be cool.\n\nStiff Combat – There are a few changes that have made the life of an Assassin much harder. Enemies strike with a bit more precision and can kill an under-geared assassin in one or two shots. Other than that the combat remains strikingly similar to previous games in the series, and in some ways it takes many a step back. Arno can get hit while trying to finish animations, or fail to properly lock-on a target to attack someone at his back. He will often flail about attempting to fight, and the overall feel of combat feels slower and less refined. It looks bland in comparison to games like Shadow of Mordor, which proves that sword combat can be fast, fluid, and visceral.\n\nParkour fail – Assassin’s Creed games are notorious for ignoring the problems with its automated navigation system. In fact, Ubisoft promised that Unity’s climbing system was “overhauled” for the Next Generation. If by overhauled they meant they add some pretty animations and kept the awkward loss of momentum issues… I’d agree. Anyone expecting quick and fluid animation as shown in E3 video will be sorely disappointed.\n\nOutside content – Assassin’s Creed Unity has a collection of content within the game that cannot be accessed without other apps. You have to download the companion app and sign up for the initiates’ website to access certain chests in-game. So unless you feel the need to get all these excess programs, you won’t be able to enjoy all the content.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs it stands as of the very first week of release, Assassin’s Creed Unity is a technical mess full of bugs and performance issues on every platform. When you can get around the frame drops and the glitches, the gameplay doesn’t make great strides improve on the tried and true formula. Assassin’s Creed Unity earns a Fans Only from Geek Citadel. This franchise has taken a spiral due to the lack of attention paid to creating a working game.\n\nThe most volatile part of the problem is when well-known video game journalists like IGN, Kotaku, and many more don’t let us know these problems exist. They wait until we’ve all started boohooing after we purchased the game, but they have clearly had their hands on it a week ahead of schedule. Right after that they want to make an article saying “You should stop buying games early,” so they can fit into the mold. No guys, you should have created an article stating that this game is awful before release.\n\nI know a lot of these “video game journalists” are afraid to lose the free games they receive from companies. Yet people on YouTube go out of our way to buy a game, play it, and create a review without a handout from publishers. If we can take our time and do that without fear of being blacklisted by these companies… why can’t Gamespot, IGN, and Kotaku? They get paid to do this stuff, so where is the journalistic integrity when we need it most? Don’t be afraid to say before we spend $60 on a game that it is garbage.\n\nPublishers also seem to think they can just push a game out the door because it “should be released by now.” That’s an easy way to push garbage onto us people who are paying for these games. It’s an unforgivable practice to ship a game as retail in such a broken state. Assassin’s Creed Unity is a game I want to like, but the more I try to play it the more the flaws hold back my experience. For a game branded as a full release, it absolutely feels like a game that belongs in Early Access.","November 14, 2014","false","30.5"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","9"

Not really any other complaints though. I will update this review as needed.\n\n11/14/2014 10:55 am: Patching as we speak, nice surprise. Here's hoping.\n\nUPDATE SINCE PATCH 1.2.0: I'm abandonding this game until it's fixed. It runs worse, in a short amount of time experienced a full lock up, corrected itself. The pop in is still there. It ran fine with vsync on and triple buffering enabled but developed a stutter as gameplay dragged on. I'm just really dissapointed with this game and the company in general. The stealth system is enraging and unwieldy to manage, and while combat is unforgiving, I don't necessarily see it as a step in a good direction. That, the embargo issue, the micro transsactions, the content blocked behind the initate and app program, this game just does a very competant job at making you not want to play it. I could NEVER even get my initiate profile to ever sync to my actual in game progress. Co-op missions when they worked weren't that incredible, and tbh detract from the single player game. I may come back to it way down the line, but I can safely say I'll just play black flag again if I ever feel the need to play an Assassin's Creed game, and this hasn't been fixed yet.","November 12, 2014","false","26.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

You can create your own unique assassin\n✔Coop mode\n\nCons:\n✘Story is dull. Dont get me wrong. Cutscenes are well directed. Voice acting is good. But Arno's story is kinda boring. Arno himself is not so interesting as protagonist. And Ubisoft failed to use all potential of Revolutionary France setting\n✘XP system is useless\n✘Creed points actually has no point.  Devs rewarding players more for kills, not for stealth. They just force you to go loud\n✘New stealth system is good but Ubisoft not even tried to make missions fit this new stealth system. There are just room full of guards and you cant do anything in a stealth way\n✘Controls are not comfortable. Arno is not responding to my commands correctly. He sticks to  the walls not climbing into windows etc\n✘Skills system is so bad. You need to unlock skills just to throw money on the ground or sit on the bench. Really?\n✘Economy system just forcing you to use microtransactions. In the 60$ game\n✘Language restrictions in CIS version. Just forced to play in russian. Good thing there is still french voice over\n\nDespite all cons of this game I recommend it for all fans of the series. Of course this game has some controversial changes.

After that, the story, conspiracies, and well anything at all interesting or unique that made this game stand out was thrown out the window.  I didn't buy Black Flag once I had heard it was going to be about pirates and have nothing to do with the actual AC backstory or universe practically for that matter; I am unsure what compelled me to try Unity. I guess I thought the return to an urban setting would mean AC would be back on track. AC Unity just goes further and further of track. There is absolutely nothing about this game that is relevant to Assassins Creed when it comes to the detailed immersion in the brotherhood you have had before in past games, and their struggle/plight. ACU is just way, way, way to watered down to be appealing to long time fans.\n\nThe only accomplishment this game can attempt to claim is the super detailed and stunningly visual game world that IS better than any other AC ever. But it is totally glitched to hell, constantly repetitive in terms of side quests, random events you come across while roaming, and even the npc types and the interactions they have with each other.  And there aren't even shops anymore in the game. Only one hub to get ammo and gear from, which is either the assassins vendor in your HQ or the start button. YES, you can just click start and get what ever consumables you need. There is truelly no point to actually exploring and getting immersed in the game world, like in AC II for example.\n\nI kept playing the game till I got about a quarter of the way through the story. I kept believing that I would end up playing a mission where my hopes would be revived and I would find a well designed level that was challenging and made me fell like a badass assassin again. Things only got worse, and worse, and worse as time went on. Eventually I found myself on a level where you had to listen in on and follow a target as they made their way through a mansion where there were just hordes of enemies crammed into each floor, just standing around. They didn't even have meanigful or well thought out patrol patterns. One cluster of three enemies walked infinitely around in a ten foot circle next to a flight of stairs. Unbelievable.\n\nI  eliminated all of the outside guards before going in side, which was a breeze as enemies literally can not see what is happening directly in front of them if they are more than fifteen feet away, rooftop guards are especially like this. Once inside I was spotted quickly due to the cover system not allowing you to snap around corners, and then eliminated ten guards on the first floor, making loads and loads of noise in the process, there were even gunshots, and still I did not fail the mission or get penalized. I mean, the guards on the floor above which I could see with eagle vision were not even alerted. AT ALL.\n\nOnce I finished the mission, I exited the game and have not played it since. There was no point to. The only fun and somehwat enjoyable part of the game for me, going around the city clubbing random enemies over the head with my sharpshooter's musket, got boring fairly quickly. And that mansion mission was the last straw. There needs to be a "Lemon Law" for games, because ACU is just blatantly broken and unfinished. It is to the point that it is unplayable.","November 20, 2014","false","8.6"," 48 of 76 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","48","76","0","3"

I actually have around 80 hours in game.*\n\nThe Good:\n+ Story up until the end\n+ Lots of stuff to do\n+ Customization\n+ The level system. You are better suited for certain missions based on armor level and weapon level.\n+ Dedicated sneak mode.\n+ Cutscenes looked good.\n+ Performance (from my experience and my friends who played) is a lot better than it was earlier in the game's launch cycle. Was a terrible experience when the game first came out, but now it is better. (My specs: 4690k, 8GB ram, 970).\n\nThe Bad:\n+ Terribly frustrating combat mechanics. I know that it makes sense...but putting guns in AC is just ♥♥♥♥ing annoying (at least for this title, Black Flag did it perfectly). The AI don't miss. Ubi also likes to make every enemy in the game easy to kill and then put in one type of enemy that can dodge everything, counter everything and kill you in two hits. The ♥♥♥♥ers in this game with the top hats are pieces of ♥♥♥♥.\n+ Optimization\n+ Microtransactions\n+ The ending. I went from really enjoying the story to really hating the story in about 5 seconds.\n+ Clunky everything. From movement to combat to entering buildings to doing anything important.\n+ Horrendous pop-in.\n+ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t modern day stuff that's just filler. Doesn't add anything to the story.\n+ Terrible perk system. Why the ♥♥♥♥ can't an assassin do a double assassination right away? I have to use perk points for that? Incredibly stupid. The Ezio games did it perfectly with having someone train you on how to do all the types of assassinations versus now having to put perks points into gaining the ability.\n+ I feel like when you loot enemies, you should have at least a 50% chance of getting your phantom blades back if you fired them.\n\n*Extra*\n+ I don't understand why throwing knives aren't in every AC game.\n+ Why can't we use our fists, or hidden blades as primary weapons? I miss that.\n+ Combat just seems a lot less satisfying while parkour is a tad more satisfying.\n+ Arno and Elise were both pretty decent characters. They weren't bad enough to take away from the game but they weren't good enough to make the game better.\n\nThis game is incredibly frustrating.\nThey really need to refine the parkour from Unity, take the customization and leveling from Unity and mash it together with the combat variety from the Ezio games. Then give us a protagonist that's not a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ all the time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/franchisefraulein/recommended/289650/","franchisefraulein","FranFrau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/franchisefraulein/","561 products in account","When I was younger, we judged games based off of their state upon release because we didn't have the capability of downloading bug fixes and patches at the time. If this were released then, Ubisoft would be called out just as they should be now. Their heads deserve to be placed on the chopping block (pun intended).\n\nGlitches: I beat the game on the first day, and I honestly have no idea how. I'm running on a Nvidia GTX Titan Z with 4.3 GHz processing power, and it still had FPS issues for me. Multiplayer is not existant, I fell through the ground numerous times, crucial NPCs in froze and I had to restart entire missions because I could not interact with them, I was shot through roofs and once up to through THREE buildings, thrown off buildings across half the map for trying to jump from building to building, died randomly despite me not being in combat or wanted, seen through walls or through buildings, and more.\n\nThe Story: From the beginning, I knew what was going to happen and who was a friend/foe. It was very predictable in many ways, and presents nothing more than a cliche revenge tale. Elise was frustrating for her ignorance in her relationship with Arno, and seemed very forced when the "climax" to their love story unfolded. There wasn't really any need for us to grow connected to the charachters presented in Unity's main story missions. I did enjoy Arno because, despite his lack of intrigue, he was definitely one of the more charming of the assassin's presented to us in the series. It's a shame that he wasn't more fleshed out. For instance, his learning of the Assassin's and his becoming one himself was almost as silly as AC4 - you meet a man, and boom! Welcome! It's just silly. It's definitely one of the weakest in the franchise for its glossed over storyline, and has a lot of plotholes that were never really adressed. Every sequence consists of two or three missions - usually consisting of you running to certain locations for a quick and meaningless assassination. It's a very short story.\n\nThe Time Travel Missions: I felt that these were really out of place, and unneeded. I know that many wanted an appearance from Lady Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, but these three sequences were just unusual and seemed more fit for DLC content. The segment where Arno is transported to WWII Paris and must climb the Eiffel Tower is probably the most out of place and rushed section of all of these. In every time travel mission, you interact with numerous NPCs who appear as sillhouetts (similar to those one finds in AC2 and beyond). They are there to show a glimpse of what was, but you do not have any ability to interact with them because you'd be changing events in history. I get that! What's a major problem as far as continuity goes is what happens on the Eiffel Tower - you shoot planes in a turret section that are firing right back at you. So, are the piolots and planes time travellers as well, or do they see Arno climbing? But what about the other NPCs who don't appear to acknowledge Arno at all? Are the pilots just shooting at the tower as target practice, and our protagonist is merely in the wrong place at the wrong time? Another segment finds you running through fields avoiding falling rocks from explosions. Each mission can be completed in about a minute.\n\nOther Cons: I feel like, as a way to stay "innovative," Ubisoft forced changes in areas that previously shined. While I can agree that the "counter to win" strategy of years' past was a bit too easy, the new Parry System is quite unfair. You hit parry as a meter above an enemy flashes to yellow. The problems arise when fighting any more than one enemy at a time because when a characte is off-screen, no indicator is given to alert players to an impending strike. With how agressive and over powered new enemies are, not being able to protect yourself is really frustrating and will probably kill you within two or three hits (even with upgraded armor). Every guard also carries a rifle or pistol as well, so escape is virtually impossible to achieve with full health. Every single time I was about to make a turn, they would strike then. It felt really cheap to run down the legth of an entire street only to dart right or left through a window and get instantly killed by a lone gunshot. I managed to upgrade my health to the point where it took two shots to take me down, but it's still very frustrating. When you get killed after an assassination, you must re-watch the entie cutscene again - VERY annoying not being able to skip them like any other cutscene in the game. The jumps that Arno makes are beyond humanly possible, as well. I understand that Ubisoft wishes to release a game with fluid movements that get a character around fairly quickly, but Arno shouldn't be able to jump across entire streets from a mere standing position. When shot while climbing a building, you cannot grab back on. More often than not, it wasn't the shot that killed me - it was the fall.\n\nPros: The new downward parkour mechanics are fun, though a little odd at points. It takes some real work to understand how to work it and not get stuck on some random area of a building. It's fast, fluid, and entertaining at points watching him climb down Paris' largest churches and cathedrals. The entire city is absolutely stunning, cutscenes fairly fluid (exluding the future portions where FPS tanked), and animaions are all pretty smooth for the most part. Ubisoft truly shines in terms of graphics with Asassin's Creed: Unity. And as I said before - Arno is pretty charming. He's not overbearing, and not too sexual in nature. It's entertaining watching his story unfold.\n\nOverall, the game at launch was what I played through. I can not recommend the game by any means in its current stage. It's a true shame, Ubisoft, that you have yet to learn of mistakes from past games (most recently Watch_Dogs). It feels like I had a big middle finger shoved in my face, and am told to suck it up and wait to give them more money upon next year's release. What have we come to when we have to expect broken games upon purchase? Ubisoft deserves every semblance of flack for what they put forward in this state.","November 12, 2014","false","13.6"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefartingfish/recommended/289650/","thefartingfish","Zebz_Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefartingfish/","84 products in account","Do you want the honest opinion about Assassin's creed Unity from a diehard fan of the AC franchise? Well, sit back, cause this is gonna be one hell of a ride.\n\nLets talk about the hype... When Unity was annonced back in summer of 2014 i was excited. "an AC game whitout any stupid ship gameplay? ill love it :D" and then it begun. Me and the rest of the community started hyping up the game and thats a bad thing since the game developers has trouble delivering and we shouldent expect this much from ubisoft anyway. So the hype basically destroyed unity... but more on that later, lets talk about the game.\n\nStory\n\nAssassin's creed Unity takes place druing the french revulution. In the present, the modern assassins are racing against the Templars to find, shortend down, a soon-to-be animus test subject with a extra amount of memories about his ancestors. If the templars find him first, they will be able to locate a large amount of information about " the first civilization" and find more pieces of eden. The assassin's ofcourse wont let this happen and decides to send multiple assassins into the animuses in order to find information about the soon-to-be test subject before the templars can. We take control of a nameless/faceless Assassins that inturn takes controll of the soon-to-be Assassins Arno Dorian. We follow Arno from a child, to a young adult and finally a full grown Adult, where the assassin part kicks of. whitout spoiling anything, Arno eventully runs into the test subjects ancestor and proceds to find him in the present time.\n\nBut thats just the icing of the cake, theres a lot more going on in paris with tones of side quests witch mixes in a bunch of famous and historical characters that Arno helps out in various ways.\n\nGraphics\n\nAs a next gen title the game looks pretty..that means if you actully manage to play on anything over medium quality.. Thats the real problem with Unity, its choppy framerate. Even though i might suffer from the occasionally freeze of fps drop when i enter a new area or a new quest loads up, it docent even come close to what ive seen some people, with far better computers than i have, run into. Some people cant even play the game on low quality, and cutscenes cant even be watched for some of them. Lets go over what we know.\n\nIm fully capable of playing the game on high quality, but i stick to medium since i dont really care about the graphics. Like i mentioned before, the cutscenes run smoothly and nice for me and rare frame drops and freezes happen occasionally but my computer is kinda slow, so its expected. overall, it runs smoothly for me and i dont have any major problems.\n\nJESUS CHRIST! Some people cant even play the game because of the constant drops in frame rate, freezes and overall  choppyness. Turning around barely renders and actions takes point to registrer.\n\nYeah, its that bad!! I used to consider my self lucky that i my game only freezed about 3 times per session, but now i think that my game is some kind of god sent gift considering some people crash, freeze or drop 50 frames per minute!!\nThe pc realese has recived multiple optimizations but i cant tell the diffrence, i hope ubisoft decides to fix the graphics at some point.\n\nGameplay\n\nActully, this is the games strong point. There are many sidequests and constant events in the streets around paris, multiple chests that can be approached diffrently and collectibles spread throughout the city, ready to be collected!!  So you definitely wont be bored while your roaming the city. Unity also decides to step back to the days of AC Revulations by having alot of weapons, armors and skills! You can earn money but investing in buldings, loot it or steal it. The parkour system has also been simplified, as you can control your way through the city much easier. By holding down the UP button while free-running, Arno will jump higher of climb buildings faster, and by holding the DOWN button, Arno will decend buildings more quickly, jump downwards while freeruning on buildings or more quickly move past small obstacels. If neither of these arnt your cup of tea, you can simply hold down the sprint button and Arno will perform either UP or DOWN as he see fits. Although this makes free running look cooler and easier to perform, its kind of unnecessary. You will also recive money from quests and community events. Thankfully there isent a "level" requirement to buy or equip the weapons, you simply have to buy them and equip them. Unity also introduces the phantom blade, witch replaces the knife, hidden gun and crossbow. it has its own small arrows and berserker darts, witch makes a return in this game. Unity also has diffrent classes that you can play in order to findout witch playstyle fits you the most.\n\nCombat- More challenging than in other AC games, in this one you cant just counter and kill everybody in a giant chain, as you actually need skill and you need to be on the lookout for heavy swingers and marksman that can interrupt your combos. This playstyle is simple in the beginning but picks up in difficulty later in the game.\n\nStealth- Yeah, this game actully gives out Assassin a chance to hide. You can crouch behind object and hide behind corners. Sneak around, distreacting targets to sneak past them and lockpicking doors. This playstyle is more difficult to master, since you always have to be alert and your rear and minimap and make effective use of the eagle sense. You can thow smoke bombs and cherry bombs to make distractions to either assassinate a target or sneak past them. Using the phantom blade's effectively takes practise and you always have to have a plan B, in case you get discovered.\n\nMarksman/Sniper- Definitely the easiest class to master, the Marksman/Sniper favours Guns and the phantom blade over pure combat strength. This class is all about staying out of combat and being support for other Assassins, however if you play by yourself, this class can be quite tricky to main, since you need to stay out of sight more often.\n\nSo with some selection in the mix, this game surely mixes it up, however, this classes are simply subclasses, and they all go through the same quests and story. no diffrence. You may have noticed how i mentioned " however if you play by your self" before. Thats because Unity has the heaviest emphasis on Co-op than any other AC unity game. You nee to join a club in order to 100% the game, certian, bigger, harder missions require help from other assassins, witch can become annoying after a while, thankfully, there is still the singel player story HOWEVER, its incredibly short. So if your planning to get this game, make sure you have some freinds to play with, otherwise you might sit there and not be able to finish certain missons.\n\nCONCLUSSION\n\nSo its obvious that i like the game, but can i recommend this to you? or can i recommend this to someone who has never played an AC game before?... well short and simple... No. I wouldent be able to reccomend this game to, well, anyone and still feel good about my self. This game, although it looks good, for some lucky people, and plays good, if you like constanly getting pepered about club compition and boosts, it still falls short compered to other games. Although ive always liked AC and gladly thrown my money at them, they really disappointed me with Unity. The lacking story, the cliche ending, the AI isent very good, the lacking single player story and MICROTRANSACTIONS?! No. dont buy this peice of money grab. and dont make this your first AC game, buy AC2 in that case. But, if i cant convince you, please approch this game with cation.... This is certainly the last game i preorder from Ubisoft. And dont trust Uplay. As of today, im not gonna recommend this to my freinds. As a hardcore fan of AC, this game fell down under the hype and just became a short, money grabbing side project..\n\nAnd remember guys, Udontplay. Ubisoft plays YOU.

The new weapons are okay, not really anything "new" but having a choice about how you equip you character can let you make a tank for one mission and a stealth killer for another pretty easily with the right amount of coin. The co-op missions are great fun too, you can even play them solo if you feel like you can't handle it (if your a collector than you most likely will end up doing this if you don't have a crew) or jump on with random ppl and torch a mission together; Honestly I had so much fun with the co-op I neglected the main story until I beat them all.\n\nGreat game, even with its issues.","June 25, 2015","true","65.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","21","28","3","0"

The story, which is usually pretty creative and interesting, falls short and is very dull. On top of that they removed alot of features i enjoined. For example, combat with your hands, fighting with a variety of weapons sword to heavy/long weapon the pistols, fight with the wrist blades, which now can only be used when undetected. On top of that, your choice of weapons are, Sword & pistol or Heavy sword/Ax & pistol or Spear/Pike & Pistol or, last but not least, rifle ONLY.

I have a decent enough system to run almost any game on High, but this is the most choppy, memory hungry game i have ever seen. Something as simple as running in a crowded area will cause much of the game to slow down and freeze and crash. Even after all of these patches, my game is still absolutely horrible. I dont recommend purchasing this game through Steam or on PC for that matter. I havent heard much about the consoles except that have a patch out now. Before, even the consoles were unplayable.\n\nThe Pros for this game is the free run capability. Finally, they got something right with this game. One of the only good features is that you can now go almost anywhere.\nThe Combat system is nice, I do like the direction they took us in, but the ease of fighting multiple mobs at once has diminished. It's not like Revelations where you can sit back and kill everyone easily.\n\nCons\nI still cannot believe that they released this game with so many problems. Nothing worked on release day.\n\nBuggy\nFramerate issues\nGame Crashes\nIngame App will lose progress\nFPS drops near huge crowds\nDouble Air Assassination doesnt always work.\nOh and you dont have multiple profiles anymore. You have to phsycially delete save files to start over and that doesnt always work.\n\nMy advice: Save your money or buy it on a console. Easier fix with them.\n\nUpdate: I decided to give this game one last try after Patch 5 has come out. Every setting I have is on the LOWEST and I am still finding my fps below 30.

And you can change it at almost any moment in the game.\nThe story wasn't my favorite thing of the game at first, but that changed the second time I played through the game.\nThe map is amazing, it is  very big and you can go and explore every single bit of it, including many interiors (not from special buildings, but interiors from normal houses).\nIf you don't like the main missions, there are plenty of other things you can do (murder mysteries, assassin missions or just exploring the map). Another new thing that is added to the game, is the co-op gameplay. Not many people were fond of it, but with friends and good communication you can have a great time.\n\nThat was the first time I played it. One year later I decided do play it again. This time on pc.\nAt first I had some issues getting the game to finally work and not crash every 15 minutes. But when it worked I was amazed all over again, maybe even more than the first time. I like Unity over Syndicate to be honest, Syndicate doesn't feel as smooth as Unity feels. Unity feels unique when you play it, but Syndicate doesn't have that feeling.\nThe thing Unity has, is the ability to hide your hud by pressing a button. I started this second playthrough and decided to play it without the HUD. And I must say it's even better than playing with the HUD on. I don't rely on my kinimap anymore, but on what I see and because I can't see my healthbar I have to be stealthy at all times and avoid conflict as much as possible. It makes the main missions way more intense and you get a nice satisfied feeling when you completed a mission without dying over and over again. For me it made me like the story better than my first playthrough. The other thing you have without the HUD is the beauty of the game, this game (all AC games have this to be honest) looks amazing, it's so cool to just walk the streets of Paris and enjoy the scenery.\n\nI know this game got some bad comments from people who didn't like the co-op and/or the story, but there's so much more than that to it than those two things. There's the new combat system, the new free running, character customisation, tons of side missions, a gigantic an beautiful city to explore and many more things that make this game amazing.","April 19","true","18.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistnuts/recommended/289650/","mistnuts","MistNuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistnuts/","30 products in account","Story and Characters\nI thought the story was decent, at best. It felt very clichê at various points, very predictable, and you don't spend much time with most of the characters to fully connect with them and know their backstory, except for Arno and his love interest, Élise. Arno and Élise aren't necessarily boring, but I also didn't come to care much for either of them, as I did with most of the protagonists from previous Assassin's Creed games. During most of the game, I felt that the main targets you had to assassinate were introduced too quickly and died too early. Back in AC2, an entire DNA sequence built up to a Templar's death: you spent said sequence learning about them, what they do and what they are, finally formulating a plan to kill them. Now it's just "hear vaguely about him, assassinate him in the next mission, learn about a new target from his memories and kill him in the next 2 or 3 missions". It kinda felt repetitive to me, like AC1 was. One little addition I wasn't particularly fond of was replacing the usual "memory corridor" that appears when you kill a main target and hear a sort of confession from each one. In Unity, you see important flashbacks from the target, and you don't get to talk to them as you did in previous games, which doesn't feel personal and doesn't let you learn more about their motivations. A true shame, some of my favorite moments from the series come from those "confessions". However, the next game of the series, AC Syndicate, brings these "confessions" back.\n\nI also didn't feel very connected with the "Dead Kings" DLC's story or with its world. For those wondering, it's a free DLC that adds a new region: Franciade. It's set in 1794, after the end of Robespierre's Reign of Terror, and it adds a new faction, the Raiders, that are trying to collect an ancient artifact.\n\nFinally, there's the modern day story. I wasn't a big fan of Black Flag and Rogue's approach to the present day story. I get that you're kinda role-playing as yourself, but it's not directly connected to the war between Assassins and Templars, you just wander around, hacking stuff and learning about the struggle between those 2 factions, instead of actually participating in it. But Unity just made it worse. This time, you don't actually play in the present, you're an Initiate, a sort of recruit of the Assassin Brotherhood, and you just watch short cutscenes where an Assassin codenamed Bishop tells you what to do. I felt the modern day story died with Desmond back in AC3 and this one doesn't add anything new to it. Judging from the last scene in AC Rogue, the least we can hope for is a confrontation between Rogue's Abstergo employee and Unity/Syndicate's Initiate, however that plays out.\n\nGameplay\nI was generally pleased by the combat system, however, there were times when the AI felt really dumb. For example, if I hit a guard with a Berserk Phantom blade, the other guards seem very over-powered compared to the "poisoned" guard, which usually left me frustrated. The fights are certainly more difficult than previous entries of the franchise. You can't take on 20 enemies at a time and hope to leave unscathed. You have to quickly parry and dodge attacks, while seizing opportunities to counter-attack with both fast and strong attacks. While the animations are pretty cool, the controls drive me mad sometimes, making Arno go or jump somewhere I don't want or attack the wrong enemy in combat.\n\nStealth itself is not as good as it could be. We finally get a crouch button, which definitely helps avoiding detection, and you can move from cover to cover. The "whistle" feature is not available in this game, which would come in handy in various situations. One thing that kept annoying me was the fact that, sometimes, I would get detected while I was clearly out of the guards' sight, which would completely ruin my stealthy approach to certain missions. While it could use some improvement, I'm glad we finally have a decent stealth system.\n\nThere are several types of weapons and throwable objects you can use in battle or during stealth, like one-handed, long and heavy weapons, rifles, pistols, several bombs, the hidden and phantom blades, and the guillotine guns, which are included in the "Dead Kings" DLC. By using them strategically, whether in combat or during stealth, you can really get the upper hand on your enemies. You also need medicine to restore health, which is more immersive.\n\nWorld and Atmosphere\nI loved the depiction of Revolutionary Paris in the game. The city was created on a 1:1 scale, which makes for an absolutely massive map, filled with thousands of angry citizens, nobles and guards. You can certainly learn a lot about Paris' historical landmarks through the Database, a concept that as been available since AC2, which is great for History nerds like me. I believe it's one of the time periods that best depicts the concept of the Assassins, and I'm only sad the game wasn't as great as it could've been. While we're on the topic of how big the city is, let me talk about collectibles: there are too many. You can get rich very easily, which kinda renders most of the chests useless. The city is so big it will make completionists go mad while searching for everything. It gets boring very quickly.\n\nYou also get a player home, like always, called Café Theatre, where you can watch plays, train moves, observe the mementos, which you get for completing quests and side objectives, and collect your incomes. You can renovate places called "social clubs", where you can accept quests that expand the Brotherhood's reach throughout Paris, and consequently increase your incomes.\n\nThere are various side missions you can complete, whether you are protecting people, assassinating targets, etcera. The most complex of these missions are the murder mysteries, were you have to collect various clues and accuse the right suspect, earning money and a new weapon after completing each one.\n\nCustomization\nI don't have much to say about this topic. You can buy and upgrade several weapons/pieces of equipment, which have different attributes. You can dye your clothes with several sets of colors, except for the special outfits, which only have their default color. In addition, you can buy perks with points you gain from completing main and co-op missions, divided into 4 categories: Melee, Ranged, Stealth and Health.\n\nCo-op\nCo-op was one of the features I was most looking forward too when I got the game. You can play with up to 3 friends, no matter their skill level. There are 2 types of co-op missions: regular missions to help the Assassins, and heists, where you have to get the loot, and, if you don't get detected, you get a monetary bonus. You can also join other players' clubs, or create your own, and complete challenges with your fellow club members. In my honest opinion, it's one of the best features of the entire game, which saddens me to know they removed it from the next main game. The traditional PvP multiplayer that has been around since AC Brotherhood was completely removed from the game, and it doesn't make a return in AC Syndicate, just like Unity's co-op mode.\n\nOptimization\nI can say this is, without a doubt, the buggiest game I have ever played on PC, so beware of that if you're considering buying it. I didn't have any crashes to desktop, but several bugs forced me to reload a checkpoint because I got stuck somewhere. Even with the latest patches, the game continues poorly optimized for PC, even though I didn't find flying civilians or missing head textures.\n\nConclusion\nThe game isn't as revolutionary or as great as we hoped it would be, but, deep down, I had fun with it. I would only recommend it while it's on sale, and not to newcomers of the franchise.","March 31","true","75.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","4"

I REALLY DID, but everywhere I look I find things they screwed up on. The frame rate is awful (which makes picklocking much harder than it needs to be), I've gotten stuck in hay baskets, fallen into buildings or just through the ground altogether, and even lost items that I had already unlocked. In addition, there are chests everywhere you can't open unless you download their stupid app and play it a bunch (and the app is awful). THEN they also have in game currency that you can BUY with real money called Hack (up to $99 worth. Seriously?). And don't even get me started on Co-Op. Connection is terrible, host migration takes forever, and gameplay wise, it's difficult to properly communicate with teammates. You are limited to targeting something (mind, you can't REMOVE a target once you set one, so at some point there are just targets everywhere) and a "Let's go" command. I can't tell my teammates to throw a cherry bomb, or use their phantom blade, or tell person A to go there and person B to go somewhere else, or even tell them what I'M going to be doing. The whole thing just ends up being a big mess as you try to predict what your teammates are going to be doing. I honestly end up treating co-op missions like solo missions, paying little attention to what my teammates are doing and not working with them at all.\n\n\nAs far as things the game does RIGHT, I can say that the story is...ALRIGHT. It's not fantastic but it's not bad either. I like the changes to combat. Instead of couter attacks you have parry, which will render the enemy defensless for a short period of time, rather than just instantly killing them as you string together counter attack after counter attack like pervious games. It goes really well with Co-op, because with 2-4 people you'd consider just charging into an army and taking them on. However, with combat more challenging (and guns nearly one shotting you with basic armor) it makes you think twice about your strategy. They brought back magic medicine which heals all your health at the push of a button which I actually don't like at all. I liked health rejen out of combat much better because then I could get in little fights all around town and if I got hit once or twice it didn't matter much. But now, I'd have to use medicine after every little fight to keep my health up. I also like the skill system. In co-op it lets each player bring somethign different to the table. One guy might have lots of health and melee skills, another might have ranged skills, and the last two have stealthy skills. It spices up the gameplay nicely. (ALSO I REALLY LIKE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A RIFLE AS A WEAPON. JUST FREAKING SMACK PEOPLE WITH A RIFLE. SWORDS? TOO EASY. BULLETS? THOSE ARE FOR SCRUBS. JUST BASH THEIR FACES IN WITH IT)\n\nOverall, I would NOT recommend this game at this point in time. MAYBE when they fix frame rate issues (I know I didn't talk about this a lot but believe me, IT'S A BIG ISSUE), and the various bugs the plague the game get sorted out my opinion might change. I realize the game hasn't been out long but that is NO excuse for all these issues. When you release something, it should be as perfect as possible. I understand they can't catch every little bug but this is just unexcusable.","November 16, 2014","false","35.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtravar/recommended/289650/","xtravar","xtravar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtravar/","180 products in account","Ignoring the bugs, it's disappointing\nYou've probably heard about all of the DLC, tie-ins, and technical nonsense that has been plaguing the launch.  But even looking past those things, it's hard to find the silver lining here.\n\nFor a series that is supposed to be about climbing, stealth, and combat, this latest installment of the series somehow made those things worse.  My strategy toward the end of the game was (1) run into middle of several guys, (2) spam attack, smokebomb, and health.\n\nThey said they improved combat, but they made it worse.  Let me explain: once you've triggered combat, you can't do any low-profile things anymore until your alert is lowered.  So trying to easily perform an assassination when you aren't necessarily in the midst of combat is impossible.\n\nDue to the new death physics and fancy 'finishing' moves (why were these added?) you can't do a dang thing until that body hits the ground and stays there.\n\nClimbing is as awful as ever.  Here's the big, beautiful city of Paris, and here you are stuck to a wall unable to move like a freakin' idiot.  The whole accidental jumping thing doesn't happen anymore.  You just get stuck to the wall.  Let me tell you, when running from guards, I would prefer to take that leap of faith (no pun intended) than get shot at.\n\nThe stealth hasn't advanced at all.  There's really no incentive to do it, because you can always kill everyone in every scene.  Unless it's a mission requirement or bonus achievement, there's no point to it.\n\nThe side missions are boring.  There's nothing new and exciting to do, except for the mystery missions, which don't make a whole lot of sense and require a lot of running around.\n\nThe modern day plot has been put on hold - you're just playin' a virtual reality game, getting tips from modern day assassin's.  There's no point to it.\n\nThe actual (historical) plot's pacing is absolutely awful.  And there's not enough to make any sense of it.  It's a revenge story where you meet some historical characters in the process, but they never play any meaningful part.  The assassin's aren't the cornerstone of the story, or even the age-old Assassin v Templar narrative.  Even the main character doesn't play a meaningful part.  I barely cared until 20 hours in, where it finally took an interesting turn.\n\nThe voice acting doesn't help.  The main dialog is all in British, while some conversations heard are in French.  The main dialog, strangely, still throws in French-isms like "merci".  If you played AC3, this game may trigger your PTSD.\n\nThere is some time-travel fun to be had.  You climb the Eiffel tower during WW2, and go back to midieval times.  Unfortunately, these are short sequences and simply remind me of other, more fun games - The Saboteur and the original Assassin's Creed.\n\nNow, the less crappy stuff.\n\nThe companion mobile app does not have an option to be played in-game like AC4.  I tried pulling out my phone.  It's annoying and not worth the effort.  Unfortunately, these locked blue chests in the game will taunt me forever.\n\nThere are new missions that can only be played multiplayer and there are lockables that only unlock if you multiplayer.\n\nThere are chests that only open if you have the other games.  I have the other games.  The chests did not open.  I presume that will be fixed.\n\nThey let you 'hack' upgrades by paying real money.  Honestly, this doesn't bother me so much, except for the fact that I can't imagine anyone getting into this game enough to want to pay more for it.\n\nIn summary, AC:Unity feels like a really bad indie game with huge budget.  The graphics are great!  There are tons of useless minigame-like things!  But where's the beef?  It feels like nobody is making sure the game is coherent as a whole.  Ubisoft has kind of cornered themselves here: they can't make a game this big as polished on a yearly release schedule as they did earlier games in the series, but if they make the game smaller or the release schedule longer, they face other consequences.\n\nIn the future, Ubisoft needs to: (1) polish the core mechanics of the game, (2) pay for good writing, (3) put someone in charge of pacing.  If they can't fix these things, the series is going to fall apart and stop being a cash cow.\n\nPros:\n* Another AC game!\n* Paris!  Graphics!\n\nCons:\n* Everything.  This game died a death of a thousand needles.","November 16, 2014","false","73.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/recommended/289650/","MUGARO","418","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/","253 products in account","Overall: 7.5/10\nWhat worked:\n\nStory, graphics, fun gameplay, murder mysteries & coop.\n\nWhat didn't work:\n\n-Drastically different combat that I never got used to & never enjoyed.\n-Removal of ships/naval combat\n-A pretty weak story overall.  Arno is an interesting character, but the story is only as good as the supporting characters.  Aside from Bellec & Elise, I never knew or cared about anyone else.   You never befriend the other assassins or do missions for them like in the Ezio games.  The amount of interaction they give to the story was very distant and cold.\n-You only meet the main villain twice.  It's almost as bad as the AC Revelations Villain that you literally never meet & you're surprised he even knew your name.  Ayala, Haytham, Rodrigo, Cesare, these are the characters that are supposed to steal the show, draw sympathy & taunt you through out the game.  You never meet Germain until the end of the game.\n-The game controls pretty weird too, the thousands of NPC's in Paris is amazing to look at, but they didn't get Arno to control as smoothly as I had Edward or Ezio down.  I really think they were changing what wasn't broken just for the sake of changing it to say that they had innovated.\n-For whatever reason, they removed all the real world 2014 interaction and replaced it with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Helix portals.  Sending Arno to occupied 1942 France?  What the hell are you doing?  As much as I often hated the real world/modern day timelines at times, at least they were seeded with the fiction of the story.\n\nOverall, if you like the Assassin's Creed games, this is enjoyable.  However, the main character is better than Connor & Edward, but worse than Ezio, Altair & Shay.  The main villain is very weak, the supporting characters are all nobodies compared to the memorable cast from the Ezio trilogy.  And that's really a recurring theme every time I play AC games, I'm always comparing them to the Ezio trilogy.  I had more fun in Black Flag & Rogue even though they were earlier iterations.","February 28","true","23.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Do you think your newly built computer can handle every game on the market? Are you on anti-psychotic meds that make life seem dull but yearn to have something spice up your life? Well, there is good news! You can have all these things if you buy Assassin's Creed Unity! Be in awe as you mysteriously travel underground into the magnificent underground white dome to which you will fall into oblivion, never to return to the hustle and bustle of Paris. This game will bring you into the story of a young lad who's hair will mysteriously change colors, or will run in one direction then simultaneously into another direction making you fail your missions in haste! Much like the guillotines of the French Revolution, you will lose your mind as you attempt to make your way through the spontaneous NPCs that will block your path with no remorse.\n\nUnlike many Assassin's Creed releases of the past, Unity offers many heart-racing, brain-blending moments in which you will begin to question your view on life itself. Unity will push you into bringing every aspect of your life into philosophical conundrums, hoping that you could perhaps one day witness a multi-million dollar gaming empire release a game with more optimization than a government's forceful placement of mandatory health insurance.\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness, this game could have been a great step forward in the right direction for Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed. However, due to poor optimization amongst other reasons, Unity has failed to impress on multiple levels. Hopefully a patch (or likely a series of patches) will solve the issue(s) that many are experiencing, but for now, Unity is a bust.\n\n\nEDIT 11/27 - Even after the third patch, the game will still not run correctly with overclocked recommended hardware.","November 11, 2014","false","26.8"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrageinator/recommended/289650/","sirrageinator","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrageinator/","134 products in account","As as hardcore Assassin's Creed fan I played and finished the majority of the game. Unfortunatly because of the unacceptable framerate issues, I get headaches whenever I try and play this game for more than a few minutes now. This review is meant for anyone wanting to play this game, old and new, that is smart enough to look at reviews.\n\n***No spoilers in this review. If I posted a spoiler please tell me so I can fix it***\n\nPro Side of the game: Ok in my opinion the story is great. I like the setting, the characters, and the fact that it takes place after AC Rouge and AC 3. Saying this though, I don't think you have to play Rouge or 3 to play this game if you don't want to but it's your choice. I like the weapons but the recent dlc pack does not offer much in that respect. It plays slightly different from other AC games in the franchise. For example the parkour in this game is much better but not flawless. Another nice thing is that there's not a confusing modern story line. Your just playing as you: the assassin initiate, exploring Arno's memories. Arno is an interesting character that is a good addition to the franchise.\n\nGraphic Cons: Here we go.....The game is broken. The framerate issues are unacceptable and there have been a wide variety of reports of this on extremely high end machines( Amd r9 295x2, GTX Titan etc.) This being said: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOUR MACHINE IS HIGHLY AMD BASED. Ubisoft has outdone themselves with the Nvidia marketing in this game so unless you have some nice GTX 980s or something along those lines, don't try. Actually, this brings me to my next issue: Anti aliasing. For those of you who don't know what this is, it basically makes rough square edges smoother. I cannot run anything above FXAA or lower with my machine. The graphics performance expectations of this game is too high for those who can't afford supercomputers. While testing on the lowest setting there were still issues with framerates. In fact when changing from Ultra to Low settings I saw no difference in framerate drop. The frames were exactly the same: horrible.\n\nGameplay Cons: The gameplay itself is more or less of traditional AC style. This is good or bad depending on your opinion of the previous mechanics. I don't think uplay is as much of an issue in this game as it is in other games but that is based on people's opinion. The stealth detection in the game is not that great as it was in previous games. I've had instances where guards could see me around corners and through walls. Not fun when assassinating important templars. The combat system makes a huge difficulty spike compared to previous games. Parrying instead of countering puts a whole different challenge on you. Instead of being the bad*** assassin who can take out 30 guys in a matter of seconds, your left with running from about 5+ enemys. Multiplayer is basically forced upon you as well because some of the rewards are multiplayer earned only. Sometimes the rewards don't even stay and you'll have to play the mission over. Overall the gameplay is solid but could use lots of improvement.\n\nThe mobile app, initiates, and microtransactions: I cannot describe how angry I was with all three of these subjects. Firstly: the mobile app is broken. The chest rewards do not currently work in game with my experience. Secondly: Initiate rewards already earned disappeared after patch 2 and 3. If this issue wasn't present I would've been fine with initiates. Lastly: Don't bother with the microtransactions. Hacking points should not have been added in the game in the first place. I was fine with the booster packs present in AC4 but those were not microtransactions.\n\nFinal Verdict: Although the singleplayer is pretty solid, this does not excuse poor graphical performance issues, reward issues, and overall bad delivery.\n\n5/10\nI recommend this game once it is fully patched but until then please wait and don't throw your money into this barely stable game\n","December 9, 2014","false","72.5"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

It forces you to use stratagy and teamwork, I see allot of bad reviews but i think it's just people playing the game wrong, They are used to being an unstoppable one man army, Because honestly in the earlier games it was insainly easy, you can insta-kill anybody without being touched even bullets barely did damage, The earlier games were still amazing though my favorites being the first assassin's creed, and black flag.  Im not really into microtransactions, to me thats more like for free to play games. But i also don't see anywhere where it forces you to buy anything, Everything ive seen so far can be bought with game money but if you don't want to wait you can basicly cheat and buy it with real money like an impatient rich person, so you can only be mad at yourself if you spend more money. But anyways.. co-op, my internet is horrid it's dsl, kinda feels like dial-up and somehow i was still able to play with 3 other players with no problems, so i think that's amazing. Some people have a problem with the uplay launcher, in my opinion it's not a problem, rockstar does the same thing with their social club, it's just a social thing, there is DRM but i can play it without internet all i want it seems, just says uplay can't connect right now... But anyways the story is amazing cut scenes are put in seamlessly. I love the main character, i loved all the main characters in all the games, Animations are perfectly fluid, my mind is blown by how many npc's there can be on screen with no lag at all, i mean.. wut? Facial animations are like L.A.noir's enough said. Combat is more complex/challenging, seems to have to do allot with timing and not letting yourself get surrounded in other words you can't just take on everyone with ease, ive died allot lot lot in this game and it has never stopped being fun and it does real good with checkpoints. I love the player customizations, and choosing a main weapon, basicly your class. The game rewards you for everything even if it's a small reward, i don't know what else to say, im upset this got so many bad reviews, The only real place i see ubisoft messed up is with performance, the minimum requirements are the highest ive seen so far with a game, not a whole lot of people have a rig with that power, and i guess they had bug issues, but i mean you can only be mad at yourself if you saw the requirments and bought the game without meeting them, this game is a monster but it's worth it.","May 8, 2015","true","77.3"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","23","35","3","2"

I have tried to play it will my Geforce Gtx 650 and i am getting around about 10 frames.

I have a feeling this game is just hasnt been optimized for PC at all. from what i have heard its got a good story and good game play but am only halfway through the first mission so i couldnt say more.\n\nEDIT: OK, so this game has good gameplay and a fairly decent storyline. It is, however, incredibly GPU dependent. Your processor matters very little ( as it does in most RPG, rather than strat games) The game is semi demanding even on my 980. I am getting about 48-60 frames depending on the environment (On ULTRA). I have seen the game pull 3.5 gigs at times out of the 4. The game freezes frequently (~2 times an hour) for about 4 seconds and then works well. The graphics themselves are stunning (as they should be) i feel this game is just very poorly optimized and was released way before it should have been. I feel if it had some good optimization it would be an overall 8 or if im generous 9 out of 10.\n\nStoryline: 7.5/10\nCombat: 10/10\nOptimization 2/10\nCustomization system: 6/10\nDepth: 8/10\nSide missions: 9/10\nGraphics 10/10","December 28, 2014","false","150.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I'm a fan of this series and have bought all the main releases on the PC.   I've been able to play all of them without much problems.  This game though is a completely broken mess. Performance is horrible. On dual 780 Tis in SLI the game stutters like crazy.  The latest patch, patch 3, has managed to make the stuttering even worse.  It was very annoying to play, now it pretty much is unplayable.    Please do not buy this game. Even if you've been a fan of the series. Ubisoft needs to stop releasing broken games.

I can play most triple A titles from medium to high graphics but I can barely run this game on all low settings. Throughout the game (the little i could actually stand to play) I ran into many bugs and glitches with textures randomly becoming invisible and me going through walls. They probably rushed this game. The combat system is ten times harder than the previous ones (some people like it but I dont) and the game mostly relies on stealth. (I like) DO NOT PICK THIS GAME UP UNLESS YOU HAVE A BEEFY UP TO DATE COMPUTER AND YOU ARE AN EXTREME FAN OF THIS SERIES. Otherwise wait for a new AC game.

I even built my current gaming PC just to play this game. I get it booted up, and play for a few hours, and stop. The next day, the game crashes on load. I write to ubisoft support, and they claim it has to do with my system (which I know it doesn't as I play many many games on this PC through Steam...Unity is the only one from Uplay).\n\nNeedless to say, not my machine, yet they are still acting like it was. Then one day, I try again, and there's a Uplay update - and magically the game starts to work again! Then I get into playing it, and this is where the review really comes in.\n\nThe game is basically unplayable. One of my favorite things about the assassins creed franchise was how fluid the movement and parkour was....and in this game I can almost never make Arno go where I was planning. This is SUPER evident in the 2nd main campaign, where you have a time limit to get to a point, and 1 - i can't control Arno well enough to get there becuase of how he climbs so instead of following the path, i just run to the ground and try and climb up to where I'm supposed to be from somewhere else, and 2 - when I finally get to the right spot at the right time, instead of doing the standard game play button combo for diving off a roof, it makes you hit this strange combo...and then it doesn't work! the door stayed open, I lower myself down, and jump in, but the animation goes back to what would have happened if it let me jump from where I was before!?!\n\nThe worst is in speaking with Ubisoft, wondering how a AAA game developer can let this happen and not try and produce some good will with their customers, they responded by saying that the free DLC they gave us more than compensates for a $60 game being unplayable 4 months in...\n\nIt's going to take me a long time before I can trust any Ubisoft game again...and I definitely will not be pre-ordering any of them anymore.","March 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

Now, every cutscene crashes at least ten times before it works, and the frame rate is atrocious even on the complete lowest settings.  Running a FX-6350 and a EVGA GeForce 660 TI (yes it's under the minimal requirements, but it has been a graphics slayer on every game allowing max settings and 60 fps on almost every game to date).  Extremely dissapointed so far, hopefully there will be a patch in the near future so I can give a positive review.  From what I've seen on console footage it looks like an outstanding game with great new gameplay features, but for now I'll just have to wonder as it seems it is nearly unplayable for most PC users.","November 13, 2014","false","24.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

So far I spent 1 1/2 hours of my life into this game, and I've gotta say, the amount of bugs, glitches and untriggered Scripts that make any progress impossible, is so high that its hazardous to your health.\n\nWell lets start with what this game does right, shall we? Assassins Creed always stood out for me, compared to other games based on a yearly cycle, in a way that it created rich, living environments and great stories that enrich the lore of the franchise, and Assassins Creed Unity does that right. Hell, its the best its ever been. Frankly, I had to turn the graphics down so much to get somewhere near playable framerates that not much of this is left, but from what you see in lets plays and walkthroughs, this game has a beautiful open world to offer. And that is where the problem is for me. Unity is a good game. While I played horrendous garbage like SW: Force Unleashed 2 or Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, these games actually worked. They were pure trash, but from the technical aspect, they were perfectly playable. Now you know Unity is a great game, and from what I play I can confirm it, hell, it may even live up to its hype from the gameplay/story aspects, but this gold is buried under a glacier of bugs, glitches, an FPS-rate from hell and other ♥♥♥♥ like that, that makes it completely impossible to enjoy this game in any way.\n\nNow I know, many of you are already tired of the Assassins Creed Formula, and some even have expected this trainwreck. Still, AC releases have always been stable and customer friendly, regardless if they were good games or not, they were always playable on PC and always atleast a pretty ok port. So what the ♥♥♥♥ happened Ubisoft? This was your chance to give the series a new start, a new direction, which it frankly bitter needed. And the worst thing is, they've made it, as far as I know. A functioning stealth system added to new RPG elements and tons of customization options. So how is it possible that they screw up the release so bad? This is the worst AAA release ever, by far. Added to those issues the App/Microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is a major slap in the face for every customer and should be sorted out quickly. I mean, years ago they called getting the best gear for free, cheat codes, now you gotta open your damn wallet. If this installment of the AC series was some cheap ♥♥♥♥ing f2p moba ♥♥♥♥, I would understand if they need to do this kind of bullcrap, but this is a 70$ full price release. Gimme a ♥♥♥♥ing break Ubisoft.\n\nThe Problem I see here is that if Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥♥ these games out on a yearly basis, they don't even ♥♥♥♥ing care about patching the issues with their trainwreck games they've put out this year. I mean they're obviously already working on the 3 successor titles for this piece of ♥♥♥♥, aren't they. Now critical gamers might have seen this coming by a long shot, but for me there's no ♥♥♥♥ing way of foreseeing this kind of ♥♥♥♥. I can tell from gameplay trailers if the gameplay is fine, if I like the graphics and the artstyle of the game, but there's no way I could have seen this kind of release ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I mean as a paying customer, I expect my games to work on release. Patches should fix the issues like crashes that happen maybe once a week or so, and should NOT be there to make the game playable. This is a trend that is endangering our hobby and our love for games in my opinion, and if Ubisoft doesn't pull their ♥♥♥♥ing head out of their ♥♥♥♥, I swear to god I will have to change my hobby back to reading books and playing the guitar all day long.\n\n\nI understand that they have to rush it out for christmas and that they have to look for alternative monetizing options these days, but for the games I payed 70 bucks for, this ♥♥♥♥ is unacceptable. I played this game for not even 2 hours now, already had to endure 3 game breaking crashes. Well atleast laughing at the ridiculous physics of hair and clothing with my mate here it didn't make me ♥♥♥♥ing quit in the first place, but I can't bite my way to the end of the game in its current state. I really want to play this game, want to hear the stories it has to tell, but hell no. Ubisoft got its payments from its loyal customer, and in the end, screw me. Money is all that matters to these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s today, and that ♥♥♥♥ has to stop. Assassins Creed is one of my favorite game franchises of all time (despite its on the ropes since 3) and I refuse to let you cashgrabbers at Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥ with it.","November 17, 2014","false","13.2"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","40","67","0","1"

If playing this game causes you whole computer to immediately shut off, you WILL have to start over from the beginning. Cloud saving/saving fails miserably.\n\nAside from those, there's also the immense amount of bugs and glitches which ruins the game..\n-----------------------------\nUPDATE: Ubisoft has begun fixing most of the performance issues, making the game more smooth.

The most common is the locking up or a random black screen.  Im currently stuck in the game and have no access to my Social Club missions, they just dont show up.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI was being an idiot, there was no marker but I was able to get to it in the progress tracker.  After playing several hours of this, I think if you can look past all the issues the game is great.  I really love the skill tree, equipment upgrades and the co-op aspects of the game but its just so annoying having to redo several missions because of falling through the floor into infinity.\n\nUPDATE AFTER COMPLETION:\n\nI feel the game was rather short and plagued with "Fetch" quests.  There are so many I litteraly spent hours just trying to clear most of them off the map.  Also I am deeply disappointed in the Chemical Revolution DLC.  The mission took me about three minutes and most of that was just running.  The only good cut scenes are in the main story line.  I didnt have to many issues after the recent patch and found the game quiet playable but I still have issues doing something as simple as jumping through a window rather than grab everything around it, drop to the floor and repeat until I manage to get through it.

Micropurchases are used to upgrade gear... so u can have all best gear and whole maps and els revealed whit micropurchases..\nthey are for phone games, and now they are gonna be on PC games -_-.\n2: some contents are unlocked via phone app that what i understand it is unlocked, app is fine cool, but you have to purchase premium for full potential of the app, once again i bought the game for 79e, why not add the app premium too? punch of other stuff i get but no premium.\n3: PERFORMANCE problems, slow motion.. low fps... and CAPED 30fps (whenever i even get that is on rare not so populated place) (hardware: cpu: fx-6350 Gpu: HD Radeon 7950 Ram: 8Gb, Win 7. settings high or higher. Tested: all settings fps improves only by 1-2fps by lowering settings.) feels unfinished and feels like its not beta tested.\n:update: 4: BIGGEST thing i hate is that THERE IS NO SAVE SLOTS! how does the family member play if no save slots? (okey moving files but that is quite hard) reason i hate this the most is that all new games should have saveslots for another gameplay+its not probably a thing which is gonna come any soon.","November 13, 2014","false","12.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Everything.\nUntil now.\nSay what you will about the graphicla issues, I myself only had some minor lagging and some dodgy camera work.\nFor me, it was everything else. The climbing was weird, the story was haphazard and confusing, and it overall had the pervasive feeling that the developers got lazy in setting the scene of France. For Assassin's Creed II, it took some effort to create a strong sense of Renaissance Italy. But Ubisoft, being a French developer, seems to have really slacked off in creating a vibrant and exciting world. For example, I haven't played much, but I'm walking along the Paris streets, just unlocked free world well and truly, and I find a little quest. An unknown man tells me to steal 2 artefacts from the Notre Dame to join his cult. This cult of which I do not remember (kind of a case and point right there) was not explained, had zero context and value or meaning, and I was expected to just grab some valuables and hand them over to this unknown man for no apparent reason. That is not good game making. You don't assign random quests for no reason with no build upon them. What? It felt lazy; the whole game felt lazy.\nI would rate every other Assassin's Creed 9/10 or higher. Unity I would rate 4/10, or 2/10 if you were someone unlucky enough to have buggy issues.","November 13, 2014","false","3.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredthered/recommended/289650/","shredthered","Smiling Shred :(","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredthered/","117 products in account","This is my second review on this game after actually being able to progress into the game. Whether some of you find this relevant or irrelevant ACU is very good in some areas but fails terribly after recent games in the series.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n1. COMBAT\n\nThey had reduced the combat to you frantically mashing the attack button while your assassin seems to be stuck in this "Its okay I have all the time in the world, Im not gonna die!" Mindset. And once you swing, depending on the level of the enemy, your attack is deflected. Oh thats not working let me use my pistol! Nope the enemy somersaults and you miss. At this point another enemy is already attacking you and youre out of medicine to heal, so, you decide to drop a smoke bomb and run away. But you cant because youre getting spammed with attacks from each side. Then you die.\n\n-There are no instant kills after you counter.\n-There are no instant kill streak chains.\n\nBasically I dont feel like the assassin bad ♥♥♥ I once was in other game previously.\nLike in Brotherhood when they introduced the Kill Streaks and the offensive guard breaks.\n\nIm sure Ive missed some negative thins about the combat but you get the point. Im frustrated.\n\n2. PARKOUR\n\nThe brand new descent system! Very innovative actually. But most of the glitches I have encountered were because of this. I "gracefully" descend into the wall. At the speed of light. One minute Im on top the next Im inside the wall or a chimney. Time to reload the last check point or restart the game. Although thats not the only free running glitch Ive encountered. There are the typical AC frustrations that come up with the parkour sytem. Its like this in EVERYGAME. I guess weve just accepted it and moved on. And so will I with this rant of a review.\n\n3. Performance Issues/NPC glitches.\n\nThe most discussed topic among the Steam community is the performance of this game. How terribly optimized it is for pc. So I dont feel the need to go into depth here other than to say that you cant run this game in ultra unless you have amazing stuff in your pc. I can only get about 20-35 fps on high settings. Cant use any AA. So for me its playable but the framedrops and stutters seriously need to go. This is why my game crashes every now and then. And why I just say F**K it and stop playing altogether.\nAs always npcs pop up out of nowhere and climb up on objects or get stuck in the ground.\n\nIve carried on to long with the bad so here is the good.\n\nTHE GOOD.\n1. ARNO\n\nThe story of Arno is intriguing. He is a cliche protagonist but I found him to be very enjoyable. His banter with other characters and his sarcastic approach to a task is exactly how Id react so I guess its more of a personal liking Ive taken. His motives are good, and his drive is inspiring for the story.\n\n2. THE LOCATION\n\nThis Assassins Creed is probably the prettiest and more awe inspiring yet. When the game is "performing" I find myself just exploring the buildings in and out. Thats the fantastic part of this game is you can explore the interiors of most of the buildings and landmarks. And its life sized to Arno. I feel small compared to the great historical structures Im traversing. And as you explore you discover detective missions. Solving murders and mysteries with evidence you find around the scenes. I personally love this.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine if this game was optimized and we didnt have to deal with the frustrations. Ah its sad I have to sit here and "fantasize" about a game performing correctly when I already spent money on an unfinished product. Shouldve got what I wanted since I spent my hard earned cash on it.\nIm not sure what all is going on behind Ubisofts closed doors but I think they need to slow it down a bit. Ive always thought releasing an AC game every year was too much. Overkill.

The ratings are mixed up. And I can see why. Firstly about 25% of people who say dont buy this say it because they have a bad PC becauese the game doesnt run properly, and with that I agree because I have a really good gaming PC but the game still runs on a low 30 - 50 FPS even with the graphics being lower. And the over all graphics being on lower as well. And the game still looks really nice with great graphics, so i could only think the graphics maxed up the game would look amazing, like in the trailer. Another 25% suggest you dont buy it because the game is too buggy. I have played this game for 20 + hours wich is not a lot but i still found only like 1 or 3 minor bugs. I dont know if i will encounter any more later on but I think many people are over reacting it saying that the game has so many bugs when I go around the open world and I see none. And another 25% suggest not to buy it because the story and pretty much the over all game is bad. I dont think the story is bad, it started out well and im into the story now and I thinks its interesting with nice twists and turns throughout the game. And I think the story is very\nvery long as well. And the other 25% say its a good game, like I do.\n\nThe Gameplay\nFor the gameplay I would say it is really really good. You can select some classes throughout the game. You can be building on: Health class, Stealth class, Ranged class and meele class. If i remember correctly. I like playing stealthy. You can really make your game so that it fits your prefered class, by choosing the correct weapons, skills & equipment. If you want to build on a class you can get all these things and the gameplay with any class is fun and great. For the fighting mechanincs I would say its great, you have enough time to parry attacks if you are good enough and you can counter attack after you parry. You can choose between what weapons you want, one handed, long, heavy, pistols,rifles and the\nrifles with the axe blade on them ( I forgot what you call them lol :D) The gameplay with all of those weapons are great, some have advantages and some have disadvantages. If you buy a really expensive weapon then the work really really well.\n\nFor a bit of stealth...\nThe stealth system has been upgraded fully. Now you can get into covers next to a wall or table or pretty much anything, also you can switch covers silently wich both looks cool and is useful. And there are new ways to kill people too, like cover assassinations and stuff. And the enemy's hearing has been added. Then can hear you if you run behind them, or if you jump, or if you kill someone right behind their back or shoot a gun. Theres also a really good "spotting system" added wich is that if you are walking around the enemy a bit closer to them in the line of sight they will start being suspicious and a yellow ! mark will appear above their head, if you hang about or walk closer to them they will stard walking towards you and threatening you and pushing you away to guard a restricted area for example. If you hang about for too long the ! mark will turn orange and then they chase you for a bit and shout at you.  also if you do anything more suspicious than just walking around like running or climbing walls or something they will spot you and the ! mark turns red and they are going to chase you and shoot you and try and fight you. If you kill someone right infront of them the ! mark turn red right away because obviously you just killed their mate and thats a bit suspicious if you ask me, also in restricted areas if you walk right towards them they will attack straight away, if they only see you for one or two seconds then they will start to get suspicious and go to check out whats up. Also the difficulty of the enemy is a good system as well. LVL 1 enemy are really easy to kill and parry and you can kill them easy with a good weapon and as the LVL of the enemy increases the harded it is to parry and kill. Also the difficulty of the enemy depends on the difficulty of the district, for example in a difficulty LVL 1 district you will encounter difficulty level 1 or 2 enemy. Also for a bit more stealth the smoke bombs and other bombs work well and there is a last known position feature added wich is that wherever the enemy saw you last there is a white ghost that appears to mark where you were, this is useful for stealth.\n\nInteraction\nThe world and the game became a way more interactive. For example you can walk into most houses and blend into massive crowds etc... There are also random crowd events like killing criminals that are marked, or tackling a theif to get a purse or something back or protecting a guy from extremists and many more, and if you complete all of the Social events in one district you get a prize. You can also scare of civilians if you draw your weapon wich is pretty funny to see the whole crowd leg it :D also you get to change your character to however you want it, ofcourse into the classes I was talking about you need to buy the correct equipment and weapons so your character will pretty much look a certain way because you will need to buy certain gear for your character to work well with its class. Also you can choose different colours for your assassin wich is pretty cool, for some you need to collect cockades and for one you need uplay points and for the other ones you need creed points wich you get by preforming assassin like actions in the game like assassinations or cover kills etc... And one other stealth weapon has been added. The phantom blade , wich is a mini crossbow on your wrist that you shoot bladed out of, this is really useful when you wanna kill two people that are away from eachother and you want them both dead because you dont wanna get into contact with them, you shoot one with the phantom blade and assassinate the other. You can also upgrade your gear with creed points wich adds extra bonuses.\n\nWhats bad\nI hate that mostly all enemy has a gun and they are op. If you are fighting a group of people one of them stands aside and shoots you with a gun wich almost instantly kills you, you cant even stop them from shooting you because the other people stand in your way so you cant get to them. Also they almost never miss, it is extremeley rare that they will miss you. Theres also lots of the lads with guns all over the place and its just a pain that you will die instantly from one shot that never misses.\none thing I also hate is that the missions or heists give you like no money unless its like a lvl 4 difficulty wich is really hard to do alone, and in Co op its pretty hard to find people to play with, if you do find someone to play with its good because you can work together.\n\nI reckon you should buy the pack with rogue and unity because you get a 2 for one deal untill the 4 th of january. Rogue is said to be really really good but I havent played it yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sneakablez/recommended/289650/","sneakablez","Sneakablez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sneakablez/","1725 products in account","This is my best COOP Assassins Creed game. The Assassins Creed Unity.\n\nI never cared buying any Assassins Creed game before coz I can just play it somewhere else than PC. But the Assassiss Creed Unity caught my attention I have been longing to have the COOP on a Assassins Creed game. My excitement rushed all to my head for this game during announcement 'til near release. "Okay great, promised I'll buy one! Let's sit and wait!"\n\nAll that excitement were gone immediately like wind that blew so cold and fast when I started reading a lot of complaints, issues, rage and all the negatives that everyone can throw on a game prior to that released date on pc. 100% hype = 100% Failed at launch. I was very saddened by all that. Ubisoft Montreal ruined it all, I'm not blaiming the entire Ubisoft here just this developer studio for rushing it too soon. They made the original Assassins Creed that started it all and it's hard to accept the fact how did they end up ruining the released of coop game in the franchise. Who would have thought of that...?! I hope they learned the lesson now and release a quality game next time.\n\nWell, lets get back to the game itself as of now at this point of day for my self review. Don't get me wrong here, despite all I said above I still love and like this game whatever everyone says about this.\n\nPROS:+ Great visual and stunning graphics\n+ Customizable Assassins\n+ Good story or should I say a love story huh?\n+ COOP System is remarkable\n+ You can play singple player while searching for COOP is on going. It's not a two seperate modes. Sort of interlinked together which is great.\n+ Do you know that when you're playing single player and someone is playing multiplayer that needs a buddy to play with then out of the blue a messenger will come running at on you or sometime it looks like an assassin is chasing you single player then tells you "A friend needs your help!" and you decide whether to accept to join him on a coop mission.\n+ Replayability, you can keep on playing it even if you have completed the main story. You can still do the other missions that are not connected to the main story. I've completed mine in about 40hrs on the main campaign mission but I also did some few side missions and coop plays too. If you're gonna sync it 100% on everything might be 70-100hrs I guess assuming you'll enjoy coop and more exploration.\n\nCONS:- Parkour and controls can be often frustrating than the previous ones (Others said it is fluid once you master it but I guess we need more time to learn it.)\n- Demanding hardware requirements (This! Be ready for it and make sure you meet the system requirement.)\n- Some small minor bugs I noticed on NPCs\n- Sometimes it crashes after playing 3-4hrs not sure why. It's rare but it's there.\n\nREMEMBER!This game minimum system requirements is GTX 680 and min 2gb vram, this gpu have 1536 CUDA cores. This doesn't mean if you have a card higher than 680 in numbers you're good! Your GPU target must be in highend line not mid range or entry range. In short your card needs to be\nGTX 760 / 770M and up, GTX 960 / 960M and up if you want to run it at least on med/high settings on FullHD resolution. Of course you can get some mid-range class cards and settle to run it on med/custom settings at lower resolution.\n\nBut I Still recommend this game despile all the negative reviews. If those negatives don't have the patience and virtue to wait for Patches then I feel sorry for them. I say buy it guys but only during SALE maybe on 50% or better on 75% off. It's a good game above all those negative reviews and hate of everyone who despised this game that much.\n\nPS: Don't let the negative reviews fool your own opinion and judgement until you have tried it yourself. If you know you have good decent hardware the passed the system requirements then buy it and play with the video setting that you system can only afford to run. Do not be a dreamer on running on highest possible settings that your system cannot even afford. Don't make such comparison about optimization on other games. This is game is on a whole lot different level that everyone should understand, deal with it and accept the fact thats already how it is.","March 25, 2015","true","46.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

Then they shipped a game that was not complete and loaded with ads for other content. When I purchase something for entertainment purposes I want it to entertain me not try to sell me addition things. Unity is like getting a movie sequel you always wanted but the climatic scenes are pixilated and there are commercials. The requirement to finish targets with the assassin's blade also breaks the flow of game play. I would much rather have a Hitman style experience where it is kill target and get bonus scenes or points for how it is achieved. In previous games targets would at least flee if you where spotted and you had to actively engage them while fending off guards but now there seems to be no consequence to walking in and stabbing the first two guards in the face only to alert the entire group and have your target come to you. With purchasable weapons constantly flashed in front of you this becomes even less of a challenge. At this rate the next game will give you an option to buy a one use tank every 5 minutes that has to be declined then you will just roll in blow everything away only to get out and stab the target with the hidden blade to kill him.  When Assassin's Creed first came out I was overjoyed that they seemed to combined two of my favorite series, Hitman and Prince of Persia; but with each installment we seem to be getting away from having that mix of free running and having to plan approaches to stab a target that I liked.","December 6, 2014","false","39.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

The environment and the time period that you play in is excellent, the added mechanic of being able to get behind cover is much needed, and the new enemy difficulty levels generated from the ship battle difficulties from previous games adds a new level of necessity when trying to be sneaky instead of just slaughtering everyone. Unfortunately this game crashes everytime I play it!!!! Even with my settings adjusted my framerates are too low to enjoy running around, I constantly find myself getting frusterated with the charecters lack of proper response when trying to traverse the side of buildings, and nothing is funner than a nice glitch that sends your charecter jumping to his death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drab3n/recommended/289650/","drab3n","drab3n","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drab3n/","851 products in account","TLDR: Most of the issues are fixable, the game is not totally lost, if Ubisoft continues work on the game and updates it.\n\nThis game had a lot of promise and was described as a game that would breathe new life into the tired franchise, similar to CoD Advanced Warfare, but Unity seems to be just another generic following the same formula all Ubi games follow. I was a huge fan of Assassin's Creed, but seeing what the franchise has been turned into, this will be the last AC I purchase unless Ubi really steps up their game.\n\nMovement: Arno's movement does seem a bit slower than previous games, but it is a trade-off, giving Arno more control so when you're running, you can make a quicker turn. The game has somewhat fixed the parkour system, where you now can hold a button to do your free-running, and if you hold Space, you'll continue to freerun but Arno will move a bit higher along whatever you're scaling as he gets the chance. If you hold E while running along a building, Arno will move lower as he gets opportunities where he will not receive damage, though moving down is a bit buggier and a lot quicker than moving up. On a couple occasions, moving town a building like a tower, Arno need to do a 90 degree turn in one direction, but instead does a 270 degree turn the other way, clipping right through the building and spinning strangely, ending up where he was supposed to. When it's not doing things like that, it isn't too bad, but moving lower is very abrupt, where you will randomly just leap off a ledge or something to some platform way below you, but just high enough you don't take damage. Sometimes Arno's hands will clip through ledges he is holding onto, because the building is designed to have a ledge that sticks out farther visually than it really does.\n\nCombat: The repetitive combat, composed of waiting until an enemy attacks, hit your counter button and get a counter kill, rinse and repeat until all enemies are dead, it's partially fixed. Now Arno will actually do a parry that can't be easily interrupted by other actions you want to do means you can't mash your counter button repeatedly. When an enemy attacks, his health bar flashes yellow, indicating your window to counter and get an attack in. Your movement (and also your enemies') during combat feels slower, actions taking much longer, and it feels like you and your enemies' weapons have weight to them, and it looks alright, but makes combat a lot more difficult, seeing as you can get hit while attacking someone else. There is a dodge mechanic that either you or an enemy can do, rolling on the ground, which takes a bit more skill but is not worth using due to how buggy it is. Depending on when you roll back, if an enemy was trying to attack yoy, sometimes they will jump through the air an impossible distance to still managing to hit you from far away. An enemy can also roll, but it's reversed for them, in that an enemy rolling = can not hit them, and the enemies love to roll in small rooms; an enemy can be corned in a room and continually roll, not moving in the actual room, simply doing a rolling animation while staying in place, forcing you to go back to waiting until they attack, countering, getting a hit in and going from there.\n\nCustomization: The customization no longer requires you to go a shop or blacksmith, etc. to get new equipment, it is done by going to some menu when you pause the game and viewing your character and changing your equipment which changes your stats and you also look different. Your hood, jacket/coat, pants, shoes, gloves and weapons can all be changed which will change how Arno looks, and the perks are a bit more specific, listing things like your suspicion decreasing a certain percentage more or less. The issue with the way the important information is listed is that, rather than doing small icons or diamonds that are filled and will tell you "Oh this sword does 7 out of 8 diamond things of damage", they now use meters which are filled certain amounts, so when you compare lots of weapons to see which is better, you get confused, thinking "Oh this sword's metre thing is pretty full, compared to that other sword that was really full but I think that other sword that was mostly full is better." You need to buy these weapons and equipment using Francs, which is strange, considering there is no store so your money isn't really going to anyone, it just disappears. If you want to bypass this, you can spend Helix Points, this strange currency that you acquire by spending real-world money, which seems very unnecessary. The game is singleplayer/co-op, but there's no PvP where you want to be better or stronger than someone else, you have no need to have a sword better than your friend, it just seems like a random idea that was thrown in later to make more money.\n\nGraphics/Performance/Optimization: Nothing really special that's consistent through the game. Certain areas perform incredibly well, some drop you into single digit framerates, some stuff looks great, some areas look terrible, etc. I am currently running the game with an i7 4770K and a 780 Ti, using the latest Nvidia drivers which includes "providing the best experience" for Unity, if anything performance-wise changes, I will make sure to update this. The graphics options are not particularly expansive, but most settings are Low - Medium - High - Very High - Ultra High, and I can mostly get 60fps on Very High with 2x MSAA. The game mostly uses two models for everything, one being pretty good, the other being pure PS1 quality, at first making me question if my video card was defective. The game seems to be using these lower-detail models when you're farther away from them, but it switches to them much too soon. You can look down the street, see the first two buildings look pretty good, but the third looks awful. The cutscenes will focus on faces most of the time, and the faces look rather good in these, but your framerate plummits when you get very close to their face, and the rest of the stuff in the cutscene looks horrible. NPC pop-in and smaller objects pop in everywhere, and some people will magically appear once you're within a few metres of them, and some groups of people appear in the distance but you still see them pop in, and it's quite jarring. In a small room that had many NPCs, they all looked terrible, and I will include pictures below, and sometimes one would bump into another, and one NPC would suddenly be standing on another's shoulder or head. A lot of these visual issues seem like they can be fixed, hopefully.\n\nStory: So far the story has been a bit uneventful, spending about 20 minutes with Arno as a child (much better than AC3 being a young Connor for hours) and jumping to Arno as a young adult. So far Arno is aware of the Assassins and has poked some fun at them, which is a nice break from the games taking the Assassins vs Templars so seriously, but I'm not overly interested in this story at the moment, so I will play more and update this.\n\nCollectibles/Smaller things: Ubi seems to be trying to take a singleplayer/co-op game a very social experience, and it doesn't seem to be done very well. I walked up to a chest, and upon interacting with it, was told I needed the Assassin's Creed Unity Companion App, and there was no explanation following it. I went to a different chest and was told I needed Assassin's Creed Initiates; again, no explanation. I went to another chest and was told I need more "Nomad" points, and wasn't sure what that was, so I went to a fourth chest and was told my lockpicking skill wasn't high enough to open this chest. It seems an inconvenience, since you have to stop playing the game, so you can do something in the game?\n\nSummary: A currently broken but mostly-fixable game. Hopefully Ubi updates the game, some things are fixable but the microtransactions and apps/web games just seem shoe-horned in.","November 13, 2014","false","3.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The extreme frame dropping makes understanding whats going on near to impossible and actually controling ur character actually impossiible\n\nP.S.\n\nand the low end system requirements are pure bs to pump up sales for nvidea, I'm playing on a GTX 660 (they say it won't run on anything less than a 680 which is a $500 card) and it looks great it just doesn't play great. That usually means u lack for processing power or the game is poorly optimized. I have an AMD FX-6300 6 core so my money is on crap optimization which would be par for the corse considering were talking about Ubisoft.\n\nBuy and enjoy this game if you have a PS4 or an xbox.

But you wouldn't notice this was a finished product from playing it. Jerky parkour and freeclimbing? Yep. Buggy AI? Yep. Citizens who walk into tables only to be teleported on top of them and walk casually across as someone sits by their feet? Yeah! It has that too! Uplay disconnecting every few minutes despite my internet being fine? Awesome! Uplay in general? Let's not get into that... Quest markers getting "stuck" and not following the characters they're bound too? Absolutely!\n\nThis game is a broken piece of garbage. Ubisoft has gone down the drain.

If you are thinking about buying this game then don't. wait a few months till Ubisoft does some sinificant performance updates and till this game goes on sale on steam.

Here is a list of my play times with the last three AC games.\n\nACIII: 90+ hours\nACIV (Black Flag): 110+ hours\nACUnity: 50 hours\n\nSo it's been entertaining for half as long. So I judge it about half as good as the last two.\n\nGood stuff: Oh sure, it's pretty at street level and inside buildings. Sometimes very much so. And the combat (which many hate) for me is interestingly varied and the swordfighting feels appropriately hard, especially when you're surrounded.\n\nMediocre stuff: The plot isn't great. The voice acting is sub par (for a series which has usually been great this is a big miss). And the collection stuff feels -- for the first time, IMO -- very much like a chore.\n\nBad stuff: The parkour -- one of the keys of the franchise -- doesn't feel anywhere near as breathtaking and dangerous as it once did. Maybe this is because we're "used to it". But maybe it's also the awkward way that every roof in Paris seems to "stop" your movement; those long flowing runs are mostly gone. Gaining viewpoints used to be an absolute highlight for me in previous versions. But every swoopy synchronization in *this* iteration is just a sea of blue-grey roofing tiles. Yawntastic.\n\nConclusion: Skip it. You're not missing anything "important" in the overarching plot. Wait for the next one, and hope it's good.","February 20, 2015","false","56.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Let me say that again, a $3,000 1 year old gaming PC can't push this game to 60  FPS on medium settings with no anti alaising. The game looks okay. It's pretty. It is not pretty enough to justify the performance issues, especially not on medium.\n\nUbisoft, I own every AC game you have released. I own Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon.

Now, lets start with the requirements. If you have even gotten this far you have looked at them, and while they are fairly overestimated, you still need an amazing pc to even think of getting a reasonable fps. I for one found myself lucky at times to have 15 fps, and could only reach above 20 on the loading screens (which are almost entirely empty). Now, on to the bugs. By the balls of Baal, the bugs. Little bugs, small bugs, gamebreaking bugs, bugs that make climbing impossible, bugs that appear in single player, bugs in multiplayer, bugs in cutscenes, AI bugs, you name it. Unity has it. Lets start with the first major bug that I noticed. During one mission, you are following a man through a large, famous building during the french revolution. You, at a certain point, are expected to follow him through a door and fight a number of enemies on the other side. When I first encountered this door, it was with confusion, as I did not realize that, while I was catching up, my leader had FALLEN THROUGH THE WALL NEXT TO IT AND UNDER THE MAP. This rendered the mission impossible, as well as the rest of the game, because it was early on and a crucial mission. I repeated this mission maybe 5 times, reloaded from checkpoints at least 15, and eventually it fixed itself. Elated, I ran on to the next part of the mission, assured that this bug would be a singular occurrence. Yes, I was naive. But who could imagine just how many bugs there would be? Continuing on, I climbed a wall, and upon reaching the top, immediately fell through the map and died. This bug would repeat multiple times, albeit in different areas. Finally, fighting past the abhorrent framerates, almost making combat impossible, I managed to get quite far in the game, to about sequence 6. At this point, there is a short quicktime sequence, where you grapple with an opponent and throw him through a wall. Well, at least that is what I think is supposed to happen. Instead, I was stuck on the quicktime sequence, where I would either fail it, and be set back, or it would glitch and revert back to a certain point anyway. This too I endured dozens of times, at which point I gave up to play something else. Finally, and the most damning bug I have encountered, was just about 35 minutes ago. I decided to play the aforementioned mission again, and maybe get past the aforementioned quicktime sequence. Upon reaching the start screen, I was startled to, upon starting, be greeted with the first cutscene that started when I first played. My confusion led to me restarting multiple times, and then eventually messing with my save files and turning off the cloud save feature on Ubisoft's garbage DRM, when I found that my save had been corrupted. While cloudsaved. With multiple accounts of this from other players, I have come to the conclusion that I may well never restore said files. That is why I wrote this review, the tipping point, and I highly suggest that you don't buy this game. In fact, it may be better to just buy a hammer (save some money) and use it to smash the nearest Ubisoft product, while attempting to curse them forever. It would certainly be more enjoyable. Oh, and to the developers of the game: ♥♥♥♥ you. ♥♥♥♥ you so much.","November 16, 2014","false","32.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

DO NOT BUYYY!!!\nSo, i have been  a fan since AC 1  , all the way too AC 3, brotherhood, revelations, and blackflag, although i havent played liberation or rogue, im pretty sure they are wayyyy better then this one.\n\nI open this game after spending hours downloading the  37.7 GBs  needed to play this game (around  50 gb  space for install). A soon as i open it, uplay launcher had problems for me, then when i finally get into the game, i notice instantly, the worst frames i have ever had in any AC game before!!! I tone it down to med (was on high on default) but still bad frames, i keep fiddling with it and finally just resort to all low graphic options and even changing my res from 1920 x 1080 to 1280x720 and still, bad frames.\n\nOn top of that my game crashes as soon as i load my save!!!!! i orginally loaded up the game and it crashed within 15 minutes or so? before i finished the first mission (i get to the part where you have to climb the chapel? or some building and it crashed)\n\nBut this game is a pitiful excuse of an assassins creed game, i love the concept of coop story mode[/i]. i have wanted that since day one (AC 1) But this, id rather have another solo game with more effort and stable then this peice OF ♥♥♥♥.\nUBISOFT needs to get there stuff together, because i am NO LONGER PRE-ORDING they're games.[/u]\n\nI WASTED 60$$ DO NOT BUYYY!!! i feel bad for anyone who bought the 89$ season pass pack, they wasted even more money.\nAll in all,  FIX YOUR GAME Ubisoft.\n\nUpdate---- its been an hour and still nothing, updated nvidia drivers, everything set to low, resolution and graphics, even turned off blood fx!!! still NOTHING WORKS!!!!! ------","November 11, 2014","false","11.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Well then why am I giving this a bad review? Well to put it simple bugs ruined what could have been a really great experience for me, if you want more details keep reading.\n\n-I've fallen through the map\n-I've lost my save file on the cloud\n-After turning off cloud saving my new file became corrupted\n-Sometimes I encounter a bug which causes nothing but my map and pausing to work\n-I can't open initiate chests now that I'm not saved on the cloud\n-various other bugs\n\nNon bug related things I hated about the game\n-Microtransactions?\n-The companion app, yes it's useful and I like the idea but certain chests in game are not obtainable unless you use the app. The app also has a premium version... It's not needed for anything in game from what I understand but seriously?\n-If you die the spot you marked on your map disappears.\n-In my opinion the interface could be better\n-only 1 save file slot\n\nThere are some good things though\n+Granted I'm only on sequence 3 the plot seems really interesting so far\n+Freerun has been improved in my opinion\n+there are now skills you can unlock, I haven't progressed far but it seems pretty solid so far\n+Combat is harder, the counter kill and chain kill skills are gone but I kind of felt it should have been a high level skill instead of leaving entirely\n+The game looks great\n+pretty great animations\n\n\nAgain the game seemed pretty good when it worked, I just can't recommend this game until all the bugs I have run into are fixed. I have asked some people if they have founded a fix and the general responses I get are "Get a better computer" and "Use patch 4" I am using patch 4 and I certainly don't need a new computer to play this. If These issues are fixed I will glady update my review once I finish the game but until then I will wait for patch 5 and hope that it fixes many of these problems.","January 2, 2015","false","45.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rarijackotp/recommended/289650/","rarijackotp","Shutup868's spooky ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rarijackotp/","111 products in account","It frustrates me how bad this game is. The few good things I can say about this pale in comparison to all the bad things I'm constantly reminded of in the story and gameplay.\n\nGood things:\n-They overhauled the combat system. Ever since Revelations the combat in AC has been a total joke as no matter what strength of weapon you had you could just kill streak every enemy (with the exception of brutes or captains) and have no problem in combat. The new combat system is a nice idea, HOWEVER, the way it was executed could have been better. most of the times you have to wait for someone to attack you before you can actually do anything, and the parry system can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times.\n-Back to one hidden blade. This may just be a personal thing for me, but Ezio getting the double hidden blades was really cool. Connor, Edward, and Shay also getting the double hidden blades was not so much. It was even made a point by one Templar in AC4 that two hidden blades was the standard, when it really should only be one. I'm glad Arno only had access to one hidden blade, HOWEVER later you can still unlock double assassinations, and they are so frustrating to execute with you having to be perfectly between two guards or you'll just end up killing one and alerting the other.\n-Up and Down Parkour: Ever get frustrated when you're trying to dismount a building and you end up leaping off and desynchronizing? I sure do. In this game you have the ability to parkour up buildings and then have a controlled descent down them. A nice touch, I don't really have any complaints about this one.\n\nBad things:\n-The story in general. It's ♥♥♥♥. Arno and Elise are just not interesting characters. The plot has next to nothing to actually do with the French Revolution, much unlike Connor and the American Revolution. Meanwhile there's nothing going in present day either. All you are is some random person along with hundreds of other "Initiates".\n-Stealth is a joke. After around sequence 4 I got so bored with the game I just wanted to finish it as quickly as possible. Most of the time I found I could just sneak past everything with a disguise ability that makes no sense and is really stupid, or I could just charge through a restricted area and throw smoke bombs everywhere, assassinate my target, and run. It gives you all these little side opportunities for infiltration or distraction, but none of them are necessary at all. Not to mention there are hardly any optional objectives to stay undetected or out of combat.\n-Nothing new. There are absolutely no new things they added to this game. All they did was take things out. There aren't even Brotherhood/Fleet missions to do on the side. All you can do is Co-Op, which brings me to another point.\n-Co-Op. It's pointless and ♥♥♥♥. None of the missions have anything to do with the Co-Op mechanic. The Heist missions you can easily do by yourself, and the regular Co-Op missions are boring and short. I had a bit of fun with the Co-Op for a while, but you quickly run out of missions and end up with nothing to do.\n-Gadgets. At the end of sequence 3 you unlock the "Phantom Blade", which is essentially just a glorified crossbow with terrible range. That's the only new gadget in the game. All the others are just previous gadgets or things only meant for Co-Op, like group healing or a cache for group resupply. For a game with an entirely new engine it's really sad that this game added less to the series then Rogue added to AC4 as practically a half AC title on the same engine.\n\nI could go on, but I just don't want to talk about this game anymore. This adds nothing to the AC series and can be completely skipped outright.","April 1","false","25.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm doing all the side missions now and then will do Dead Kings DLC as well.  Loving the attention to detail with the buildings in Paris and this game really brings back the true meaning of Assassin's Creed.  Rogue and Black Flag are still great games but they are more open world an more about ship battles which is cool in its own way.\n\nBut playing Unity really does bring back memories of Assasins creed 2 and Revelations.  Climbing all those historic buildings is awesome as is reading about them (to a certain degree.  this game kind of overdoes the descriptions but its no big deal).\n\nAnyway guys TL;DR if you have a good graphics card then you'll enjoy this game, if you don't, it simply won't run well for you and you'll be upset.","August 11, 2015","true","52.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

In previous games you could just hop on a wall, or climb on a window. Here, no such thing... Trying to scale the church (in the tutorial section) is very difficult now. Which takes the fun away from all the climbing. I can see anchor points where the character *could* hang on to, but doesn't want? Even though it's like shoulder height. Just run in the wall and jump to that point... No, doesn't work. Need to climb somewhere else first and then come back to that same point and then he can hang on it?

No one likes playing outside the Animus, instead they just give you some short narrated cutscenes inbetween chapters.\n\nCons:\nVery unlikable main character with predictable motives.\n\nSide characters are boring compared to Black Flag.\n\nControls are extremely twitchy.

Okay, there would be some bugs, but people have should've entered the game in a more immersive way and not focus on simple things that could be ignored if the game was good. Such naivette.\n\nWhen I started playing the game was smooth, the story line was quite good and I noticed that they wanted to create a likeable character such as Ezio. However, as the game progressed, we move from our first palace to a more vast area, thus overcharging the game. It starts, more and more, to lag, lowering your capabilities to play in a fluid way.\n\nAs I have a good computer that alowed me to play any game I wanted without lag, I was really upset, but as I like the game series, I made an effort to play it with the minimum graphics, just for the fun of the plot and the gameplay.  My frustration couldn't be bigger as I noticed that lowering the graphics to the minimum changed almost nothing to the FPS problem. The only way to lower the FPS was when I look to the ground or the sky.\n\nWhat infuriates more is that the game is in this state, unpolished, and they are working on the next game, realising content and videos for the next Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft, has just lost a very dedicated consummer. I doubt I'll ever play another game from them. And heed my warning, neither should you. At least wait some time after the release and see the reviews. I ignored the reviews and now i feel as if I was tricked.","January 5, 2015","false","46.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As a massive fan of the AC franchise I was sorely disappointed by Unity. The story starts off ok with a little background of Arno and his joining of the Assassin's but after that theres nothing.

So, after the various updates it has received from Ubisoft I can safely say that the game is finally optimized. With a GTX770, 4770 CPU and 32GB of RAM the game ran at ~50 fps average the whole time, with the majority at 60 fps too. Graphics are amazing and the settings I used were FXAA, Ultra High in everything except shadows and no AO. It looks amazing, combat is quite different than the previous games, story is interesting but nothing too deep. The Dead Kings campaign is also quite good but nothing special - thank the Godz it was included.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Michael6084/recommended/289650/","Michael6084","Myspace Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Michael6084/","359 products in account","I really want to recommend this game. I really do. I wasn't compelled to write a review for this game until playing Assassin's Creed: Rogue. I'll explain a little later.\n\nThe huge scope is amazing - it takes during the French Revolution, a time period that defined the modern era. It has many great features: co-op multiplayer, player customization, a large amount of weapons and gear which can fit each person's play style, plenty of collectables, better free-running, more emphasis on stealth than past titles. It's clear to me the development team tried to create an honest AC game post-sailing by returning to form. I actually LIKE the gameplay in this one, which is apparently different from many others' opinions. The downside in my opinion to gameplay is the emphasis on still having to pay for credits to purchase expensive gear. You can wait to accumulate the amount of in-game money, but it stresses on how it does take and hopes players end up purchasing another type of currency to milk as much as they can out of you.\n\nMy biggest gripe: This game is optimized flat-out terribly for the PC. Absolutely atrocious. The game was designed to be more difficult and previous functions that people were used to, such as being able to whistle, were taken out. With more challenging gameplay, it only emphasizes how terrible this game runs. Framerate is depressing, so actions you input take a half-second to punch in - you'll end walking around a corner too fast and end being spotted, or if you're in combat and you try to parry, you'll end up getting hit anyway. Sure, this game gives you a fair amount of graphic options, but nearly every single one you'll try will only help with framerate issues just a little bit. You'll end up having to change graphic options via roundabout ways and STILL the performance is near-negligable. This game was designed to be quite pretty, but I'm the kind of person who prefers toned-back graphics to actual gameplay and high framerates.\n\nCompare this with Rogue and it's no competition. Rogue is the ultimate utopia for the PC gamer performance-wise; it runs better than Unity, Black Flag, and (in my experience) AC3. I'd like to think Ubisoft decided to listen to the PC community's reception on Unity and decided to learn from their mistakes, take their time with the release date on Rogue, and iron out any potential performance issues. Hopefully Rogue is the standard on performance Ubisoft will use when measuring up any future AC titles.\n\nTL;DR: skip Unity by all means if you know what's good for you. I can't even recommend it even if it was on sale for $10. Rogue is the one you'll absolutely want, and I'd argue the full price for that one is worth it.","March 22, 2015","false","70.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Although there are a few (not even minor things) I really dislike about this game.\nFirst of all: it doesn't work properly on Windows 10 after installation, you get a crash every 10 to 15 minutes. It is easy to fix though, but it is quite irritating at first. You can stop it by searching for XAudio2_7.dll , you will get probably 3 results. Move or rename the one in Windows/System32, and you will have no problem playing the game anymore. (you won't have sound during the UBISOFT logo video, but there are no other problems with this.)\nNow during the combat they changed a few key things:\nThey removed the human shield ability, I don't know why, but it's bad. You will get in combat with maybe 7 soldiers, maybe 2 will start to shoot at you, and you can't do anything about it. And, when you are in combat and throw a smokebomb, you have to keep using your primary weapon (i.e. sword, axe or spear thingy), so you can't just stab them with your hidden blade, which is just totally ridiculous. Also, a lot of times, you will get spotted. And when you are spotted, you cannot air assasinate enemy's, so far so good. BUT: when you jump on them, they get knocked down, and you can't friggin stab them when they are on the ground, you just have to wait for them to get back up. You can only stab them on the ground after playing a large part of the story, after which you have to use ability points to unlock the ability to stab people who you knocked down on the ground. (just WHY ubisoft? why did you think that was a good idea?)\nNow I do like the Paris they made, it's a pretty big open world with a lot to do in it. It's also really nice you can customise they way you play by changing parts of Arno's costume. Also the lighting is sublime, The castles and palaces are just beatiful with the glossy marble and golden detailing and the beautiful art pieces on the walls. The story is good so far (only played until sequence 6 yet)\n\nShort version of my review:\n\nPros:\n+ really nice and beautifully created Paris, they put so much detail into it.\n+ random events on the streets of Paris\n+ lot's of quests/side missions\n+ you can customise Arno's costume, with each part contributing to different abbilities\n+ lot's of different weapons\n+ when you have to assassinate a major person in the story, you can take a lot of different routes to get to them\n+ nice brutal finishing animations\n\n\nCons:\n- crashes every 10-15 minutes on Windows 10 after install, easy to fix though, but Ubisoft should've already fixed it.\n- can't stab enemy's who are in a smoke cloud\n- they removed the human shield ability\n- can stab knocked down enemy's only after playing a big part of the story","January 2","true","46.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It would be more beautifull if i use MSAA but that's will sacrifice alot of  framerate 10/10\n\nThe reflect from NPCs is realistic.

Arno actually has a personality unlike Conner and I find himself reminding me of young ezio from AC2. I bought this game simply because of my love for the series, well at least the AC2 line, AC4 and AC3 looked nice, but simply didnt live up to the former games in my opinion. If you are indeed looking to purchase this game i highly recommend that you make sure your rig can run it.\n\nPerformance:\n\nI have an nvidia 880m, and it does infact run "okay". With details and textures on ultra at 1080p i find myself hovering around the 30 fps range on average with occasional drops to around 22.(So i'm recieving the "cinematic" experiance i guess /S)  Oddly enough these drops have happened the most for me during cut scenes which i find quite odd. I have two monitors hooked up to this laptop and as i played i had gpu-z up on one. The game managed to fill over 4gb of vram at points which is the most i have ever seen fill. I'm attaching a youtube video of me 'horribly' playing through a mission. This mission had the most fps drops ive had so far so it works well to show what others with an 880m can expect. The youtube video also has the rest of my computers specs for those interested.\n\nYoutube\n\nGraphics:\n\nAfter playing the game for a while there is one thing that definitely popped out. The game, at least so far, appears horrible at choosing when to render buildings/far away objects in more detail. The worst example i have seen so far is the screenshot i took below.\n\nImage 1\n\nImage 2\n\nThe above is just bad, especially for a game with such demanding requirements and i hope they release a patch that either improves the loading of textures at a distance or lets you adjust when they load.\n\nThe only other issue i discovered was the already known town folk warping in and out. When close up i also noticed that their textures loading were a bit wonky as well.","November 11, 2014","false","35.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The map itself is extremely large with so much going on at one time - hundreds of civillians are dotted around the streets, fighting, talking and even stealing which in effect makes the game seem that more realistic.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, so much detail has been put into your surroundings which placed the game that one step up from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\n\nI feel another part of the game that makes me love it more is the element of customization implemented by Ubisoft into the game. Your given a large selection of armour to buy, unlock and find - ranging from Hoods, Chests, Legs, Forearms, colours etc along with a seperate outfit section allowing the player to wear costumes worn by previous assassins from older games.\n\nThe story I feel could be the biggest let down, although I enjoyed the story, I feel it becomes very repetetive very early on - but Its still a change from constantly sailing about like you were in Black Flag.\n\nPhyscially, the game is quite difficult to run for PC's at a low budget - with the mass map to render along with the in depth textures and the many bodies to load whilst moving at speed. Another downfall is the bugs and glitches found in the game - I find them hilarious to watch though XD.\n\nTo get a sample of hardware struggles, I run an I5 3470 3.2Ghz with a GTX 750Ti OC 2GB and get 30-40 FPS on High.\n\nI hope this review helps you, I love the game and felt I ought to write a review :3\n\nbest reguards\n\nGeroNimo","December 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","2"

I have to warn you that I suck at writing reviews like this cause I never can get to the point.\n\nMy expectations for this game was not high at all, in fact the only reason I bought this game was because of Rogue which was for me, one of the best ac games hands down. But we are talking about unity so I'll stop praising that game for now.\n\nThe French revolution is such an interesting part of history and I wished unity would've interracted more with it - for me, the story was good, but not as extrodinary as it could've been. I wished there were more interraction with the residents and a bit more with the historical characters - but tbh the scenes that we got was pretty entertaining. When it comes to gameplay I have to say I miss the old interface that was in ac4 and rogue. I got ofc used to the new one but for some reason I miss the little "sync wheel" at the end of each mission lmao\n\nOther than that the controls was a good change I think, but it felt very clumsy using them - there were several times where Arno got stuck on a wall and would not go up and times where he did'nt want to jump down - and again that can be me at fault, you see, I suck at video games                             ... or it could've been a bug 'cause you know, unity isn't exactly bug-free (at least they've fixed A LOT, I only experienced like three minor bugs which wasn't a big deal for me) But don't get me wrong, the little change in the game's parkour is A+\n\nMore good things - the multiplayer concept was a very cool thing I enjoy it a lot and will probably play this game more later with friends. The upgrading system was cool too, even though I cringed hard at the micro transactions they've added in the game.\n\nIf this game is on sale then I truly recommend it cause it's not that bad.

I was right to believe it, it looked like a broken mess that took flying across the rooftops a bit too literally. Then, more than a year later, it gets gifted to me for my birthday, I download it, and find what this game was meant to be. It no longer runs like a slug with poor motivation, but like an eagle, gracefully gliding 'cross the well-light streets of revolutionary Paris (till that is shattered when you play co-op and get murdered by a fish barrel). But the glitches that still exist in considerable quantities in the multiplayer aren't gamebraking, mostly they just make me laugh. I once had to get all these npc's out of a small tunnel, but some stood right in the dooway and wouldn't budge, halting the mission. I solved this by getting everyone to shoot one uncooperative citizen each so the rest of the crowd could continue. When I just want to play the game however, the singleplayer provides more than enough to keep me busy, and though I may get heavily scolded for this, at points I get more sidetracked than in Fallout 4. THERE I SAID IT.It is a faithful return to the ACII days of the series, and is well worth the 14 extra gigabytes of patches.\n\nTHUMBS UP UBISOFT","March 25","true","33.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

It's how I want to open this review. I've had the opening mission bug out on me near the end prompting a full restart, combat has frozen in certaint areas multiple times, leaving long delays before action resumes, and not only that, but the game seems very poorly optimized at this time. My GTX 780 is showing frequent (if small) frame spikes, and graphics are consistently not rendering properly. Please be advized that these issues exist at launch day.\n\nThat being said, what I have played of the game so far is... interesting. The story doesn't really seem to do anything new, in fact it is strikingly similar to Ezio's story. Stealth missions, while still plenty of fun, also don't seem to deviate from the tried and true format. Unfortunately, what could have been a huge reveal during the plot at the end of the prologue was quite underwhelming. I am also still very much in the dark as to who my present-day character is and how they fit into the story. This is something I would have liked to have been cleared up near the beginning before I was thrust into the past.\nHowever, I have been enjoying playing the game and I do look forward to seeing how the game plays out. I am very fond of the downward parkour controls, and the obstacle maneuvering controls have been well-refined. I personally am happy to see the series return to Europe and to a busier city setting.\n\nMy verdict: If you're a big fan of the series and have played it all, my initial response is that there's enough here to keep you happy and comfortable, even if it doesn't sweep you off your feet. If you haven't played much, don't bother. As far as I can tell, the game down't hold up much on its own.","November 11, 2014","false","28.3"," 50 of 93 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","50","93","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/289650/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","I think the new engine did the game good. It feels fresher. It's not inventing much new (I still need to try co-op) but when coming from Black Flag and Rogue you'll appreciate what it does.\n\nIt has no sailing and ship combat (love it or hate it) but consists mostly of Paris and some other smaller towns/palaces. In pure miles to travel I guess Unity is inferior to BL/Rogue but it makes up with love of detail and by using the space available to bigger extend. Most notably there are plenty indoors area now being used for missions, to contain collectibles or as means of moving across streets/lines of buildings more quickly (hopping into one window and leaving through the opposite one).\n\nEven when recognizing certain reused assets over the time Paris feels diverse and lively. This game having more civilians on the streets than any AC before adds to it. Every nook and cranny feels kind of unique, often featuring landmarks with historical buildings or places and brimming with life, at best illuminated into a gorgeous sunset making use of fancy post-processing effects. I think this is the first AC where I actually enjoyed moving on ground level more than via the rooftops only thanks to the many more details that are naturally to be found "down below". For the first time I also bothered to consequently read the associated database/mini-encyclopedia - and immediately after having unlocked entries about places, people or historic events at the time. It helps with immersion and to grow interest for the city. Even after I will drop the game (which can still take a while) I can already see myself going on a Google/Wikipedia travel vacation with all the screenshots I took and comparing how Paris, characters and events are shown in the game and how they really looked or worked out back then and how they do now.\n\nReading the database entries, newspapers (there are two, and each year that passes in the story timeline spawns a new issue to read from around places with a couple random stories about the events of that year) or paying attention to details generally is advised. The storyline is following along historic events from around 1788 to 1794 or so (I haven't fully finished it yet but I'm close) and sometimes makes sudden leaps of numerous months up to a year you wouldn't notice if it weren't for previously acquired historic knowledge and the occasional time "stamps" in the introductory memories of each sequence.\n\nThis leads to my gripe with the game or series as a whole: I miss the present-time storyline. Here it is hardly advanced at all. I stopped hoping for anything new ever since Black Flag. More so important is the past-time story. That one isn't bad but not necessarily surprising either. I feel more engaged than in Rogue, the characters are more likeable and tangible, I particularly like the relationship between Arno and Élise even if it didn't get as much display as it could've deserved earlier on. You are back to certain roots like having a proper Assassin brotherhood to work for, a council to report to, you get a real initiation and the three tenets I had forgotten some games back are recited. This is neatly incorporated into the co-op multiplayer which allows you to form clans with people ("brotherhoods") and to grow up in ranks (individually) or specify such (clan-related). Should people have felt displaced with AC3 and onward they will feel back home in ways with Unity, it is closer to the original game and the Ezio trilogy in many ways.\n\nBut: Things can be a little predictable. Following real historic events to some degree and having to maintain a certain balance of power for the present-time story to make sense always means a certain predictability. Some details might be considered plain fan service even. For example it was interesting to meet Napoleon but I have only seen him once and he was relatively irrelevant to the story so far. They could've left him out and it would've hardly made a difference, but I suppose when playing that time one would just expect or hope to have his appearance (regardless of whether he was indeed in real-life where the game shows him to be when you meet him or not, which I don't know). In this manner I can easily see others to roll their eyes a little at this game or the series generally. Even so there was/is boldness in recreating historic settings as well as it does and this is is a game with great love of detail and you can tell the developers put lots of effort into making Paris feel and look as great as they could.\n\nI'm wondering how a non-open world game would fare in comparison. I think I observe that certain groups of civilians in front of historic buildings always stay the same over the years that pass story-wise. There might also be some inconsistencies with how buildings actually looked in-between in the real-life and how they do in the game. For example whether the Bastille was already damaged before you play the mission that sees it stormed. Or whether a certain bridge was built with the Bastille's stones while it was still intact (it was completely taken apart by the Revolutionaries if I understand correctly, so both couldn't exist at the same time but they do in the game). Or if the small noon-cannon in the Palais-Royal actually fires at noon as it seems to do in real-life. Even if I'm just mistaken I guess a more "enclosed" kind of game could deal with these details more consistently and faithful to the facts. But this isn't meant as a negative, I'm just wondering, I bet most players never paid nearly enough attention to any of this so in the end it won't matter.\n\nThese are details one could divulge himself with for more and more hours to come, and I'm kind of curious. Not sure if I'll examine them as much but there sure is a lot one can do with this even after having completed the game a longer while back. This should be appreciated too if I'm to be asked, there is a deep value in it by itself beyond being a game simply. It's sad that all this is a bit looked over in the series generally (I myself learned my lesson late, I feel inclined to properly re-read databases and stuff in the previous games now, I surely will pay more attention in the future titles) or in Unity due to the bumpy start it seemed to have had. The performance issues many seemed to have look fixed, at least on my rig the game runs smoothly, although maybe because I'm rather high-end and at the cost of detail. (The level of detail on buildings and such quickly deteriorates at a distance and characters are rendered during cutscenes with better quality than they actually look like when you're controlling stuff - but I'm also getting some harmless yet consistent graphical glitches that could be the engine, a faulty GPU, faulty drivers - having similar phenomena in other games speaks for this - or some such else so I don't know for sure if this is all supposed to look as I see it or not. It's still a great looking game overall.)\n\nIf I had to add some negatives: The A.I. can be very stupid. I uploaded one video showing an example of that. Something else includes you being able to assassinate targets in a row from around cover with your enemies literally running into it like lemmings. The combat can feel hard at first and you can get overwhelmed by too many guards but you can essentially still block/evade it all if you're quick enough and when you have enough smoke bombs (different gear you wear improves your capacities/abilities/stats) you can easily get rid of them all in a fairly easy manner. By unlocking advanced combat moves you can break any of their blocking abilities and cut them down without much of a sweat. In this manner the series continues to be lacking any great challenges although there are plenty of nice-ish riddles around that have you explore landmarks for hidden symbols with eagle vision. And the co-op content looks like beefed up on difficulty either although I haven't tried it enough to say for sure.","December 19, 2015","true","70.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

I watched EVERY trailer that came out for this thing (16+ i think?)\nNow, i have a pretty beefy computer, its not top end, but i can play new high end games without a hitch. My frame rate is horrible, not to mention random frame rate drops which causes you to suddenly SPIN AROUND to face the opposite direction you were runing right into a swarm of guards, fun!\n\nOkay, so the game isnt optimized right yet, okay. Thats fine, i have an Nvidia card, it should be done right. its fine. i can forgive that. it just came out.\n\nI have a friend i want to play with, so i try to connect to them. doesnt happen. seems NOBODY can connect to anyone for whatever reason.\n\nOkay, the servers arent up to par yet with the workload. You cant exactly test that without making the thing open beta. I can forgive that.\n\nWhat I absolutely can NOT forgive is the SLEW of bugs this game has along with the clunky controls. I've found myself running down an ally, making a turn and suddenly im climbing a random barrel 5 feet away FOR NO REASON. Or the horrible climbing system that worked BETTER on the previous AC games. how the HELL do you break something that you've made work for YEARS?!\n\nOh but bugs? i've got PLENTY of those. I've been running across a roof and my guy hops up onto some invisable platform, jitters for a bit, then freezes. cant move. cant do anything. the game is still going, but im stuck on some invisable floating platform. Oh, what about the random clipping issues in game or in cutscenes where you can see fire through your body from a torch on the far wall or people's HAIR through their face making them look like wolfmen. How about the random horrid pixilation? Or where there are suddenly NO WORDS on my submenus.\n\nThe list of bugs go on....and i've played this game for FOUR hours. 4. not 40. FOUR. Game testing takes days, weeks, months! Did they not even TEST their game?! If this was found in just 4 hours of me playing i can only imagine what deeper, game breaking, hell computer breaking, bugs there are in this game.

I paid 60$ for this and from the first minutes of the game it freezes every now and then for a couple of seconds (I have a pretty good gaming computer , so I set up settings accordingly), I even tried Lowering the settings to the bare minimum and freezes and some "jumping" occurs. Then I jump onto the bar to hang from and the character just appears to be standing in mid air and not moving, its not frozen , i can still move the camera around, but not the character... Please FIX this . Oh and in the future please do a better job testing it and polishing the product before release .

This game is poorly optimized with horrible graphic setting options.  It took me a few hours just to arrange the settings for a half-way decent gaming experience (constantly adjusting resolution, ratio, etc).  The game is also full of many...many bugs even after being out on the market for so long.

I mean how can you not detect someone that walk inches behind you only because they ''Stealth walk''... Unless they are all deaf and semi blind or something this is something ubi need to work on before the next release because it is simply waaaay to easy for a game where you spend most of your time sneaking around\n\n-Optimisation. As I said before the game does look well and run smooth but after a few tests I noticed that my gpu usage is about the same at medium high and ultra settings O.o never seen it on another game of the same ''level'' and I can imagine that it most be hell for peoples who dosent own a recent rig so I hope they keep releasing patches to help this problem\n\n-The amount of DLC that is shoved in your faces.. This  isnt a ftp game ubi... stop being so EA for god sake your customers dont have to pay over 100$ for a complet experience this ISNT right... Every dlc they have made should be free considering the state of the game when it was released + the bad optimisation that is still semi present\n\nThat about it... If you want it buy it while it on sale or wait for a price reduction... It is a good game and maybe one of the best AC yet but could have been a master piece if Ubi wasent rushing everything to  make more and more money...

(6th time). EVERY time your game has more than one update and you're NOT updating your game.. and it PASSES the LAST update without you doing it....\n\nFULL F(_)CKING DOWNLOAD AGAIN!\n\nI  ... HATE ... THIS ... GAME ... !!!!!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game has some serious issues with graphics as you have most likely already heard. It needs FAR too much power (and mainly video memory) for what you get as an end result. The release of this game is much like the first Crysis: only those with the highest end computers can play it as it's been advertised. Everyone else gets a "normal" quality game. Problem is, not one person is getting "normal quality" from anything in this game. Even people with TOP END machines are getting HORRIBLE framrates.\n\nWhile I understand setting the bar as high as possible, it's wrong to advertise a game as "playable" at minimal graphics settings when you have to lower your resolution just to get 30fps on a card that was designed just a year ago. Someone that got a computer for Christmas LAST year should be able to run this game at nearly full settings... NOT nearly all LOW settings. That's absolutly horrible.\n\n-----------------------\n\nFor the game itself, AWESOME! This "game" (not the hardware/software part) is the coolest AC game I've played.. why? Because you can play with friends!\n\nNow, at this point I want to bring up a dead horse to beat and say that I WOULD have had ONE MORE of my close friends to play with, but $60 later we find out he can't even play the game... AT ALL.. because he has 1GB of video ram.\n\n\n\nTHIS GAME NEED TOO MUCH VIDEO RAM!\n\n\n\nI will admit that my friend's 1GB of video ram is pretty dated, but MY video card wich is slightly newer only has 2 and our other friend spent over $600 on his card summer before last and it's only got 3GB..\n\nSo, where does this company get off requring EIGHT FLIPPING GIGS to run on max settings? WTF? Did they use ZERO compresseion?\n\n!Check!\n\nThat's the EXACT problem. This game was made in a "factory" where they ALL had the best computer hardware money can buy... they use this to sell the game and make it look good, then dump SH i T on us!\n\nXboxONE -> Aprox 28 FPS average.\nPlaystation4 -> Aprox 22 FPS average.\n\nPeople are reporting that they think their consoles are locked at 30fps in some zones.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023223614/recommended/289650/","76561198023223614","Hiram Abiff","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023223614/","50 products in account","I thought it important to warn those who have, and those who have not yet purchased this game, to be completely aware NOT to trust the Uplay Sync Services in keeping your game saves supposedly safe...\n\nUplay sync services is known for being unsafe in some Ubisoft/uplay titles. Take for example this game; As soon as Unity creates a save, Uplay attempts to upload it to the cloud to create a current back up. Since Unity creates a new save every 5 seconds (or almost every time you complete an action in game), Unity is constantly creating and Uplay is constantly uploading new 'overwritten' saves to the cloud; this creates large opportunities for your saves to become corrupted in the cloud or on your computer during the upload or rewrite phase.... This is essentially a huge fault in development, which was overlooked and unchangeable after the games release. Ubisoft has gone on to fix this problem in later games, such as syndicate, by only having the game upload the save 'after' the user has quit the game; this of course, gives time for the game to completely finish editing the saves before they are ready for upload.\n\nI myself, got half way through Unity when I got a warning from Uplay that read something like "Uplay sync services has failed; please quit the game and restart"... After restarting, my game opened with the beginning intro, and I had realized that my save was gone. After searching my computer in the normal locations, I found that the save was deleted entirely and that the cloud was no longer downloading my previous save and instead, it just wanted to keep starting a new save... I of course, then came to the conclusion at this point that my save was just entirely gone. After turning off sync services and then continuing to play, I have had no issues and have been rather enjoying co-op gameplay with my friend.\n\nIt should be equally understood, that when you turn off sync services, some games (such as syndicate) do not even load local saves unless it can acquire a copy/clone from the cloud. After playing Syndicate half way through, and then turning sync services off to play unity, I then went back to syndicate but could no longer load my saves; they were of course, being loaded from the cloud (which was turned off at this point). Once I closed the game, turned the services back on, Uplay then asked me which save I wanted to use after loading syndicate back up; I chose my previous save from the cloud, and the game opened as normal...\n\nAll in all, though Ubisoft has been working on Uplay extensively lately, it is completely apparent that Uplay sync services still suck... I highly advise using another third party software to backup your saves, and don't use the Uplay cloud at all; or, use the cloud until it crashes; just be sure to have local backups of your saves or you’re screwed if something goes wrong.\n\nFinally, even with syndicate; if a new save is created without sync services enabled, the save will be created and stored in its normal location where it usually can be found; such as in the Documents folder, as well as the Ubisoft/uplay folder. Unity seems to store two copies of the save; 1 online, and 1 locally. Syndicate on the other hand, seems to only load from a save if the save was first created offline/without sync services enabled, otherwise it wants to load from the cloud; if it can't find one, it loads a new save.\n\n- The rest of my review for this game can be found below -\n\nUnity is what I see as a reasonable addition to the Assassin's Creed collection. Not only does it stay on point with Templar history, but it also brings to light specific conspiracies and traditions about the Templars and their affiliate orders.\n\nIn comparison to previous titles, a lot of people were disappointed with the story and were confused why certain aspects were chosen; I personally, being an avid individual who studies Templar history, found this game to be rather enjoyable and quite accurate for what Ubisoft was trying to portray. Yes, the game does not go exactly with the first three or four Assassin's Creed titles, but it does stay pretty accurate to Templar facts, myths and legends for the time period. To not spoil anything, I'll refrain from explaining this point too much; just bare in mind that this game is exploring further points of Templar history. The below part may or may not be considered as a spoiler, so I've blacked it out; read if you want, but you've been warned.\n\nSuch as the importance of the first scene of the game where Jacques De Molay is being burned at the stake for heresy; after 1308 Templars were regularly being persecuted for heresy, and most fled France to other countries and territories at which Templars evolved and changed their ideas to better fit a repressive world fit on judgmental religious idealism of Christianity. Even after the Templars were absolved of their charges by the later pope, the time of exile made new men out of the old Templars, who fashioned new traditions that could be hidden and practiced obscured to those unable or unwilling to understand their purpose; this is why the beginning of this game is so important, and why throughout the rest of the game (unlike the other titles) you are no longer killing Templars most of the time; instead, you are killing extremist factions who are supposedly people who are have been made extremists by small groups of Templars, to disrupt the city.\n\nAnd a Syndicate spoiler, I guess...Though I have yet to play all of Syndicate, it too seems to be fashioned from the idea that instead of Templars, you are fighting a Gang which is Controlled/inspired/radicalized by Templars...\n\nSo, with my final note on the story of Unity, the game seems to be accurate enough to Templar history to enjoy it...Just don't expect anything fancy what so ever compared to previous games.\n- As far as gameplay goes, there is a leveling system and multiple weapons to choose from. Some skills, and clothing boosters. Many missions, and what feels like 3x the amount of side missions. Co-op is fun and seems to work flawless except for where there is someone with bad ping (which seems to affect everyone in the game).\n\n- The mobile companion app, which you can download for your phone or tablet, is essentially a 2nd screen that allows you to see your map at all times (like a GPS). You can see your character as you walk around the city, boxes you have not yet opened or collectables you have yet to unlock, it displays available missions and waypoints, you can set a waypoint by holding down on a specific spot of the map, and you'll then see the location in game. With this method, you can set two active waypoints by using the app, as well as the map in game. By completing small glyph puzzles in the app, you can unlock additional chests and content in game including some outfits and weapons. Due to updates to the game, you are no longer required to use this app.\n\n- Performance - Though there appears to be a textural issue that causes textures to become blurry at a given (small) distance, I have been playing the game just fine with a healthy 40-45 FPS; all settings are set to high, except for a few such as antialiasing and texture quality. I attempted to set textures to ultra, but it supposedly said it was maxing my 4Gb 970, so I turned it down to "high" where I'm able to sustain at least 40 fps. More testing is needed before I can say whether other settings can be turned down or off, so that I can turn textures up, which would be preferable. Yes, I have enough hours in game that I should be able to answer these questions, but once I first tinkered to get 40 fps, I didn't mess with it again after that.\n\nI probably would have added more to this review, but I ran out of space. I could summarize, but it’s not really necessary.. Thanks for reading. Other than Uplay sync services losing my save, I enjoyed Unity, and would play it again.\n\n~ Hiram Abiff","December 8, 2015","true","73.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While Assassin's Creed Unity's main story is far from being one of the best in the series, the game was still enjoyable for me at the very least. Having played through all of the Assassin's Creed games in their respective order, the enormous city of Paris with its high roof tops felt extremely nostalgic. I have spent hours free roaming because of how gorgeous the city is. The parkour is a bit different this time around. The controls do take a while to get used to and it can be a little frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it, the majority of time it works well.\n\nUnity, in my opinion, has some of the most interesting side missions ever introduced in the franchise.  The Paris stories, Cafe and Co-op missions are very intriguing as they provide a lot of context for tackling your objectives.  Muder Mystries and Enigmas on the other hand can be quite entertaining if you're in the mood for some problem solving.  But what truly makes Unity different from all other Assassin's Creed games however, is the sheer amount of customization.  It is extremely satisfying and rewarding when you're finally able to unlock the gears and skills you've wanted after playing the game for a period of time.\n\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of the series. If not, you should try it when it's on sale.

I'll never forgive this game for tainting the franchise and giving me the second most frustrating gaming experiences because of bugs and glitches next to Sonic 06. Now after replaying the game after it's been patched a year later, honestly it's one of the better games in the series. There are still occasional glitches here and there but nothing you can't handle. The game itstelf is packed with content and so much to do post story. I love the setting and concept but the plot to me was weak. It's okay but it felt lacking with a very disappointing ending. Arno feels like a poor excuse for Ezio but I still like him more than a lot of other characters in the series. The air assassinations are still frustrating for me but little things like that are found in different variations of the Creed series. I spent hours getting every collectable and finishing all of the co-op missions having fun through the whole thing except on my first run which felt awful. Now that this game has been patched and the deadkings dlc is free, This game overall is alright, I recommend it. It's no longer the piece of crap I played a year ago.

I've had a rare crash during the splash screen ubisoft logo (which I suspect is actually codec related) but otherwise it runs grandly. 74 hours in and it's a gorgeous experience of 19th century France.\n\nA few pet peeves to be sure but they're minor and easily worked around. Sometimes Arno won't catch the exact spot I want him to catch during a parkour ascent or descent and will get me (sometimes) in trouble. Also, in a couple really cramped instances Arno was putting away his weapon instead of parrying or attacking. All of this is easily remedied by efficient bomb use and perhaps changing the setting of the fight if you are fighting at all.\n\nAll in all I love the new fight system. It now feels fair as the NPCs have just as much an ability to kill you as you do them. You must be quick, attentive, and resourcful to win fights. Gear only helps mitigate your mistakes...and you will make mistakes. I love how the civilians will jump in from time to time and take some of the fire and steel off me. In fact in one particular mission I recall you can actually use several civs to start a riot, there-by allowing you a clandestine entrance to a certain location. This version of the series actually makes you have to plan your assaults, and I for one like the change from the almost super-hero like fighting abilities from Conner to Shay.

Wish more would use the voice feature to coordinate but for the most part, as long as you stick together and you come prepared (read as: inventory stocked) you can still pull it off even if you suck.\n\nRemember, there is no shame in running to fight another time.

The patches that have been released have fixed the VAST majority of those issues and they only occur on a case by case basis now. Dont let people parroting what they read on reddit - but have yet to experience - tell you otherwise.\n\nBeautiful scenery, challenging combat and a deep and emmersive story are reason enough for this game to recieve my recommendation.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you have avoided this game because of bad reviews, give it a chance to speak for itself. I believe very strongly that you will be pleasantly surprised.","October 29, 2015","true","49.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I played on ultra textures and witnessed the most painful hair in video game history, plus everytime the camera focuses for instance something that arno is holding in his hand, it's hilariously blurry.\n\n-Especially in the beginning of this game, the overall graphical standard is not very good...you'll see a group of npcs 10 meters away from you, and they'll look deformed like minecraft characters, and that was on ultra textures too. (Note that I do play on a powerful machine).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341183500\n\n\n-The game has horrible controlls. There is now a new free running mode, that lets you decide if you want to go up/climb something or descend somewhere/drop. You'd think that this is a nice idea, but really all it does is making the free running less fluid and too complicated. In overall, the controlls are not good. Often Arno reacts way too late, especially when in a fight using the keyboard and mouse.\n\n-Climbing itself is also a pain in the rectal area. Arno will often not understand how he should proceed and will just stop on a ledge instead of jumping over to the next building. Besides from that, he's also slow as hell. Jumping between walls quickly is impossible most of the time. Same goes for climbing around corners. Arno will just get stuck. And not just on walls, that goes for crowds, interiours and fences too.\n\n-Performance is often pretty terrible, I've heard of people with stronger machines than mine that have problems with the game. After these complains, I'm convinced that my "good" performance was at random. A company this big releases a full price tripple a title, and it does not work for ♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Game has not enough new features to justify the 60 euro price tag.\n\n-Black Flag was a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game. This is not. If you haven't owned an assassin's creed for a long time, just get black flag...this game is not worth it.","November 15, 2014","false","15.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It still is. Great, high-resolution graphics, amazing aesthetics, and a breathtaking world perfectly uphold, even surpass, the already high expectations for the franchise. Co-op play is a genius addition, and the interactive AI seem cutting edge.\n\nHowever, this potential was immediately destroyed by severe performance issues and game-breaking glitches in almost every stage of the game. Instantly, the title screen peaked my frames per second at 2, which is, in retrospect, the best I got throughout the experience, despite my up-to-date system. NPCs teleported around me in the tutorial fights, and my character would randomly turn 180 degrees when running. I had looked through the reviews before purchase, but dismissed the glitches as the price of playing a new, unpolished game. However, this was not the case; the game is absolutely unplayable and unenjoyable. I realize that the team behind this game is working to solve these problems, and I do not blame them for the issues- but game is CLEARLY not ready to be released to the public. From the reviews, I know I am not the only one to be let down by this, and likely won't be the last. Until these MAJOR issues are solved, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nI am a huge fan of the AC franchise, and I have loved every game in it. However, this is not acceptable. Whether deadlines or poor testing is the fault of this, it is not what was promised to the buyer, and this is not what I paid for.\n","November 18, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So~ they decide to "patch" the game so nobody, including myself, can play the game without at the very least, run into a hurdle or just not be able to play at all.  BUT...more complaints came in, they had to think fast; make the game slighty the same it was before so "some", not as many, can play the game... honestly I don't truly believe this kind of mindset, but just the thought of it   -pause-   ALL OF MY RAGE!-    you can have it.\n\n\nPatch 4  =  broken dream my friends\n\nSo they upgraded this situation I've been having with their game.  before, it was just random crash to desktop; now its the new and improve crash on menu "stall".

The FPS is just awful for me, but I run it on a i5-3317U core, Windows 8.1, I really want to hope that that is the problem but I just can't do that either. I mean come on, isn't it rule #1 not to ship a broken game? Once Ubisoft gets some type of patch to address the bugs and FPS, then I can write a review that gives ACU a chance at Game of the Year even, but for now just save your time and money, who knows maybe they'll cut the price during the holidays.\nSincerly, a disapointed gamer...\n\nUpdated:\nWell after months of sitting in my library, I finally was able to play this installment to the series. I've got to say, it actually wasn't that bad. Take in mind that yes, you do need next gen. graphics, BUT I was able to play it on a EVGA GTX 750 Ti, paired with a pretty crummy A6 5400k. Now this game only gave 12-25 FPS, but hey it was actually fun when you finally get to play it. One thing I will complain about is the lack of a weapon wheel, I mean seriously? The hidden blade was the SIGNATURE of Assassin's Creed, but I never really got to use it. Further, some of the infiltrate, and assassinate missions do get redundent. Also why did the gear COST so much, and yet story quest gave so LITTLE? However, this story does an alright job, but didn't have much to do with the French Revolution. So while it may be poorely optimized for some, it turned out to be a decent and atleast intertaining Assassin's game. (Don't worry if you want puzzle solving, the Dead Kings DLC, which was made free for all, gives you that, and is a GREAT place to earn some much needed franks.) BUT in total, I wouldnt interely recomend this, its kinda just meh, once you can actually play.","November 15, 2014","false","31.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

SPOILERS FROM PREVIOUS ASSASSIN'S CREED GAMES AND UNITY\nAfter awaiting a full year before attempting a playthrough of this game and the imminent release of the new yearly iteration, I had "the obligation" (it felt like that really) to tamper with the game and try to enjoy most of it!

This iteration doesn't feel like a canonical follow-up in the main setting storyline.\n\nInstead, you barely have anything to do on the modern setting. Bland and boring setting. Now that Desmond Miles is out of the portrait, the new unknown guy from BLACK FLAG you played as in the Abstergo Entertainment Montreal studios had little to offer in the main Templar vs Assassin everlasting confict. That setting felt forced and I had hoped AC: Unity, that the modern setting will be much more developed, just like AC3 and before. But nope! Here in Unity, you don't get "out" of that Animus chair and you only get some quick briefing inside the Animus from the Hacker girl and the awkward Shawn, who keeps whining as much as before. Heck, you aren't even told "who you are", if you are still the same guy as AC IV!\n\nI'm still really annoyed that that portion of the story was ignored.

The gameplay is solid and truly improved upon previous games but aside from that, I can't find anything else to recommend this game for. Unity is a huge step backwards!\n\nUbisoft, if you are really reading this, you really should slow down with the yearly release and focus on making a better game instead. What will happen once you run out of "cool historical cities"?!? Exactly! And also, make a better modern story as well!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:-IF YOU ARE AN HARDCORE FAN OF EVERYTHING AC: Get the game someday and have fun!\n-IF YOU ARE AN AVERAGE FAN OF AC: SKIP UNITY! You won't miss anything on the MODERN SETTING!\n-IF YOU ARE NEW to the AC franchise: Unity is not be the ideal choice to begin the franchise.\n\nRATING:5.0 / 10\n\n\nDEAD KING'S DLCFrom Unity's catastrophic launch, this DLC was offered free to owners of the game. So there already, this is a good pro! The meat of Dead King's is set in a new region of France, the provincial town of Franciade and there, you go in an artifact hunt... mainly, a First Civilization Apple of Eden! From the start, you get the same kind of missions and side missions of Unity. The new additions are: new weapons like the guillotine guns (fun to use!), new outfits, costumes and a lantern that is used to solve the many puzzles DK DLC has. Gameplay-wise, you have outposts to clear à la Far Cry 3-4. Overall, this is a decent DLC and a worthy addition of the main game!\n\nRATING:7.0 / 10\n\n...\n\nNow, gotta take a break from the AC franchise as I'm feeling very fatigued of it!","October 28, 2015","false","41.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What will happen once you run out of "cool historical cities"?!? Exactly! And also, make a better modern story as well!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:-IF YOU ARE AN HARDCORE FAN OF EVERYTHING AC: Get the game someday and have fun!\n-IF YOU ARE AN AVERAGE FAN OF AC: SKIP UNITY! You won't miss anything on the MODERN SETTING!\n-IF YOU ARE NEW to the AC franchise: Unity is not be the ideal choice to begin the franchise.\n\nRATING:5.0 / 10\n\n\nDEAD KING'S DLCFrom Unity's catastrophic launch, this DLC was offered free to owners of the game. So there already, this is a good pro! The meat of Dead King's is set in a new region of France, the provincial town of Franciade and there, you go in an artifact hunt... mainly, a First Civilization Apple of Eden! From the start, you get the same kind of missions and side missions of Unity. The new additions are: new weapons like the guillotine guns (fun to use!), new outfits, costumes and a lantern that is used to solve the many puzzles DK DLC has. Gameplay-wise, you have outposts to clear à la Far Cry 3-4. Overall, this is a decent DLC and a worthy addition of the main game!\n\nRATING:7.0 / 10\n\n...\n\nNow, gotta take a break from the AC franchise as I'm feeling very fatigued of it!","October 28, 2015","false","41.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Because the reviews were - and still are - mixed. But i wanted to take a shot anyway. And i must say i am quite satisfied. I didn't see the release date version of AC: Unity but 1.5 version is playable. There is no 3-9 fps range anymore. I encountered some fps drops ( min. 25 one time, usually 45 with network + - after closing network, it increased. Don't know why. ), funny bugs ( flying goat, chicken, walking folded military outfits, dancing / waving bodies after death etc. ). They were too few to count with fingers though.\n\nAs for the graphics, impressive. After you enter the game you will realize why it took so long to fix it and make it playable. Everything in AC: Unity world is well designed, no more needs to say.\n\nGameplay is new like the graphics. You can't fight against 20 soldier at the same time like the old games. And this is a good thing. After getting used to it, sword fight was boring. Now after i saw the 7+ pack i run or kill a few with ranged weapons before going onto them. Free run, climbing and descending is more fun and estethic. I can't say the same thing about controls. Ubi has a bad habit to make a bad controlling since Prince of Persia. Do you want to descend softly? No, here's a leap of death for you. Do you want to get inside through the window? Nope, climb to the roof or descend more. On free walk it's harmless. But if you want to do these on a mission and you want to do the that with stealth, you will have some hard times.\n\nArno & Élise can't take the Ezio's place but they are memorable compared to other AC characters. Main missions weren't bad at all. But the presentation of the missions are too short. For example i would like to see more about his mentor, lover, creed to get all the details. But what's done is done and we need to make do with them. The more you playing story, it pulls you more to itself to the end. But when you want more, it doesn't give that you want. Things are happening good but they are happening so fast. As for the side missions, they are too many. I lost myself time to time on the map when it comes to Paris stories, rifts, murder mysteries, crowd events etc. Due to lack of players i did some co-op missions solo though. They are pretty hard when i was try to do them alone.\n\nThe last one that i like is equipment, outfit, skill system. These are making your assassin more custom. You are free to create your own assassin. You can change their weapon styles, skills, outfits ( cosmeticly ) and armors. There's a lot of options.\n\nCompanion app is giving you a valuable chests, but i couldn't see more effect on the game so i don't think you need to play with nomad brotherhood on the phone.\n\n- After the Italy series, Unity is the most enjoyable game. Ubisoft wanted to do something new with old series. And for their efforts, they have my respect. They could've give us more AC with same play style, same graphics, same boring puzzles and some mysterious women speeches that never can resolve. But maybe even Ubi bored to give the same Ac over and over lol.  They maybe failed on the release date but complete version of this game is don't deserve a "mixed" reviews. If you still have suspicions, give it a shot on the next sales and try for 2 hours. You will see the difference.\n\n8,5 / 10","December 13, 2015","true","52.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However I picked it up cheap on a steam sale because I am a big fan of the series. I have not gotten a single graphics glitch on it, and it runs mostly smoothly late into the game. The controls are a bit sticky, but nothing new to the series as there has always been a problem with the controls figuring out what you want your character to do lol.\n\nI have read a lot of reviews complaining that it's the same gathering game and climbing tall buildings... Yes it is an Assassin's Creed game they are about collecting tropheys, stealth, fighting, Assassinating people, and completing the little in game events. This is what the series is about. Call of Duty you are going to have a gun and go shoot people. That is what we enjoy about the games. Odds are if you enjoyed the other games in the series you will enjoy this one.\n\nI really like the game's protaginist Arno, he is a likeable character. It has a decent storyline and once again I have fun the the period of time and the setting. I really like the visuals in this game. In short if you like Assassin's Creed you will like this game.","December 20, 2015","true","154.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClaireMeowzi/recommended/289650/","ClaireMeowzi","Yuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClaireMeowzi/","76 products in account","ACU for myself is very much hit and miss. There where points in the game which I really enjoyed, such as the story, and the assassination missions, but there are moments when I just look at it and cant help but feel the game was pushed out the door. You will not get more than 20 hours of enjoyment out of this game!\n\nGraphics!\nI played this game roughly 2 months after the release date, in this time I assume that ubisoft have patch most of the FPS issues due to the fact that throughout my 14 hour play session I didnt crash once, and came across around 8 major FPS drops, none of which I really cared about. You do however notice the render issues when synchronizing (I didnt really care though). One thing that truly annoyed me was the models, I really wish more effort was put into this as it gets extremely boring fighting the same 3 people over and over again (yes the police are slighly different, but there is very little conflict with them). Oh I will be fighting the elite swiss guard, to bad they look the exact same as ♥♥♥♥ing patriots........ Other than that the models for elise and Arno look great, along with any other main character.\n\nStory.\nPersonally I enjoyed the story (I play AC games for the story), the end was very predictable as with all AC games. I didnt enjoy it enough to play through the main story a second time, in saying that AC2 was the only AC game I played twice. I will however go around and collect all the collectables just to expand on the story. I hate all the abstergo stuff, it takes away any immersion you might have had while playing, it was bearable with AC1 to AC3 when there was a sub story to it, but now its just ♥♥♥♥ing special with no point to it. Wish arno would talk less to himself makes him look like a nut job :3\nOn a side note if your going to set your story in France make the characters have French accents not English ones. There where a bunch of historical things that annoyed me to, but thats just because im a history nerd :P\n\nGameplay.\nCombat is extremely similar to every other AC game, just counter..... I mean parry your way to victory. You dont need to upgrade your weapon once throughout the entire story, or armour for that matter. Parhour is basically the same, very little to improve, except now you can fall from great heights and not die, im sorry but it looks ♥♥♥♥ing stupid when you jump off a 3 story building and dont take any damage. To get the best stuff you have to grind like crazy which is boring in this game, I have a feeling this was done so people would buy the premium currency (terrible buisness practice). The assassination missions are quite enjoyable, you have to think, and create a plan (IKR thinking in a AC game), but it still holds your hand like crazy, and doesnt really allow anything to creative.To put it simply the gameplay is very average, with little to no improvement on previous titles.\n\nConclusion.\nPersonally ACU is very average, it just another AC game, nothing ground breaking nothing special just another AC game. I felt ripped off by the $50 price tag I payed for this game, and with the business practices Ubi has been making with the premium currency and the state this game was at launch I really doubt I will be buying another AC game after this one. If your new to the series you will most likely enjoy the game, if your a fan like myself who has played all the games you will just see the same old thing.\nIf ive made any english mistakes Im sorry <3","January 21, 2015","false","19.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","5","7","5","0"

It's not inherently a bad game (there are flashes of brilliance throughout the campaign) and co-op is a welcome addition. Paris looks stunning. There's only a handful of characters that stand out, which is unfortunate. Especially Black Flag had much more engaging characters than this year's release. If the game was technically sound, I would still recommend it. However, the game runs really poorly, and there's macrotransactions in the game as well which are quite in-your-face: in the menu the store is the second item! Are you kidding me? There's even chests that cannot be opened without a companion app (which doesn't work half of the time) and costumes locked behind their ridiculous AC Initiates system, which isn't even fully functional.\n\nThis game:\n\n1) was released too early; should have had more testing done\n2) is gameplay-wise & unlock-wise flawed; e.g. macrotransactions, weird unlocks\n3) has annoying reminders that there's other things to do but play the game (initiates, companion app, uplay, etc)\n4) has a rather disappointing story; e.g. Napoleon doesn't even appear more than THREE times, even though he was cites as a major character; some parts are good, some parts are just... boring\n5) runs poorly; patches have been promised but you will most likely still need beefy hardware (avoid for now -- still poor performance as of patch 4)\n\nIt's not all bad. If you enjoy AC games, you might want to consider it down the line (if its issues are patched!). But for now, it was a major disappointment, and I wasn't even hyped that much. It's a beautiful game with a lot of flaws and annoyances. So, unfortunately, for now, I cannot recommend this game.","November 20, 2014","false","28.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Even on a powerful computer the game still struggles to find stability.\n-Freezing and frame drops are annoying as hell, and most of the times it makes you put your controller down and quit.\n-Graphics glitches, which to me were minimal to nonexistent.\n\nThis game is broken!\nIt could've been a great game, because the gameplay, atmosphere, story, mission variety, combat system, graphics and mechanics of it are almost flawless! Yet my PC (runs GTAV, Far Cry 4, etc.. at 30-50FPS) still struggles to find out how a game with such technical flaws works, which ,for that matter, it doesn't.\nThe frame drops, freezing, and low frame rates are disgustingly annoying, still after a year of the game being released and patched a bunch of times!\n\nMoral of the story, you'd be better off playing this game on a console, since Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥ed up big time on this one.\nHere's to the next title, and here's to hoping they get it together, technically, since they have a solid gameplay base.\nGood luck!","August 13, 2015","true","38.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There may be a few bugs and glitches that occured but nothing too game breaking and even if there is bugs and glitches, it's very subtle. Unity for me so far has been way more enjoyable than Black Flag. Optimization wise it's not too shabby. With my 15 4460 and R9 380 4GB, I am able to set everything too it's highest settings apart from HBAO+, PCSS and MSAA, all of which really hits the fps HARD. If I were to use the ultra high preset in game, my fps will be around 30ish. With the ultra high preset and turing the above mentioned settings off, my fps rose to 45-60ish depending on the location and for me that's pretty good and fyi its on a 900p panel. Overall, unity really stood out to me with its beautiful graphics and enjoyable free running. Really good deal since it's 50% off as well.","November 29, 2015","true","13.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

I like the story and the gameplay.  The new combat is more difficult and forces you to play it a little safer when approaching situations.  Problem is that the GOD AWFUL optimization makes the game completely unplayable.  Forget stealth because lag, rubberbanding, random 180 degree camera turns, framerate drops, and falls through the map make sneaky approaches damn near impossible.  Same thing on the combat side.  If an enemy pulls a gun, game over.  Framerate drops will cause you to not even see it, much less dodge it.  The situation gets even worse in co-op.  The epic cutscenes are ruined by the framerate drops and texture pop in, which is a shame, because they felt very well crafted.  I'm upset that this turned out so poorly.  I love the series, and I love the game, but the optimization is so bad that it makes it a chore to play, if you can play it at all.  The recently released patch did next to nothing as well.

I did like Connor, but thats because his actions felt genuine, here you essentially play an unlikable prettyboy with alot of money. Essentially Colonial Justin Bieber.\n\nStory wise, I loved the locations, the freedom, the flow of events and watching Paris change as the revolution unfolds, it truely let my love of historical events run wild, Napoleon's appearance was the cherry ontop of the cake to all this for me.\n\nNow with graphics, I was fine, whilst it was clear the game was unoptomised, my system was able to run it on the AMD Raedon 290X 4GB card, 8 i7 CPU's and a 16 GB RAM, these spects were able to run it on high/ultra between 45-50 FPS\n\nAnother this I loved, was combat, I hope the changes brought around in ACU will continue in later games of the series will follow it's combat style. Combat in ACU was finally a challenge, no longer were you an invulnerable walker tank, in ACU a couple of guards with some smart shooting are able to take you down in moments, if not they will easily try to outnumber you. Guards are finally more agressive, and never hold back on a chance to attack and instead unleash their full rage upon you, many times have I fallen to the city guards finishing moves and accurate shots.\n\nThe game does offer a system of buying in-game money with real money however this is not necessary if you remember to upgrade your cafe, much like the Auditore mansion of AC2.","October 22, 2015","true","64.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It started up again after about 10 seconds, but that was a bit odd.\n\nThat said.. I can't recommend this game. A few hours in and the story feels horribly disjointed and I'm really not into it. But what's really killing it for me are the controls. I'm playing with the same 360 controller I've used in every PC AC game, but it's just not working for me. Trying to get whatever his name is to go through a window is an absolute nightmare. Trying to get him off a railing, onto a balcony, and into a door is even worse. Especially when there's a guy aiming a rifle at you on said balcony. The game is also horribly slow to respond. Often I'm finding myself screaming at the bloody computer MOVE!!!! for like 5-10 seconds as the character just sits there hanging from something, waiting around forever for somebody to stop squirming so I can loot them, or waiting for an enemy I just knocked over to get back up so I can keep poking them.. because for some reason I can't just bloody kill them while they're on the ground.\n\nThe game has like a dozen different currencies and absolutely everything gives you something different, and often you've got no idea what is used for what. There are even microtransactions.. MICROTRANSACTIONS.. in my full price AAA game. That's a F2P thing. Keep that stuff out of P2P please.\n\nCoop is a nightmare. Everything pretty much instantly kills you, and the enemies get stronger the more players there are. They take forever to kill with even 2 players, and you basically have to stealth kill everything.. which is really hard to do with more than one player. Anyone enters combat, and suddenly they're aware of everyone else too. There is also no way to communicate with other players that I've found. Long story short, I can finish "solo" coop missions (which can only be attempted AFTER completion of the mission the first time, in something like 1/3 the time or less with much less effort.\n\nAll in all, some interesting ideas.. but worst AC game I've played by far.","November 11, 2014","false","57.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","3"

All things that are ahead of their time are viewed in a negative light at the time of their conception, then to be reevaluated and reappreciated over time.\n\nThis game (I recommend playing in French for full immersion ;)) is sensory experience. AC Rogue, which I also (and more readily) had purchased, pales in comparison with this game, and is essentially a rehash of AC Black Flag, if fun in spite of that. This game by comparison seeks to delve into new territory with visuals reminiscent of cinema depicting French history, such as La Reine Margot, and flawless integration of cutscenes with playing. This game doesn't throw you into a world, in which you rummage about to entertain yourself as with almost every other game (frankly, particularly in this series), but invites you visually to explore your surroundings, an enticement that is on every level of finer conception than the regurgitated title of AC Rogue.\n\nIf your system can handle it, THIS is the new generation of video games that Ubisoft has to offer.\n\nupdate on features/ recommendations:\n\nFeatures:\nFirst AC to feature STEAMPUNK elements\nIntegrates multiple time periods\nYou have to THINK: this game encourages/demands you to be creative and precise in carrying out your tasks, you are an assassin after all, not a thug. This combined with the new sneak element makes this game run much more like a Bethesda experience, while retaining all of the AC defining elements\nImprovement and characterization system MUCH more RPG- personalize your fighting style and visual style to an extent unprecedented in AC\n\n\nRecommendations: Turn of the HUD visuals for a more challenging, visually clean and cinematic experience.","June 3, 2015","true","14.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drewbahr/recommended/289650/","Drewbahr","Drewbahr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drewbahr/","95 products in account","The best terrible game I've ever played.\n\nI've been a fan of Assassin's Creed since the first game, and I've purchased every game since.  I even preordered every game after AC2 - I loved the historical sandbox, I loved the gameplay, and the modern-day story was compelling.\n\nAnd then there's Unity.\n\nBetween the almost completely-absent modern-day story, the unrelateable wooden protagonist, and the completely forgettable support characters (seriously, how did the Marquis de Sade become so boring) you'll find yourself wondering what the hell is going on.  The game takes places in a seriously important period of European history (the French Revolution and the beginning of Napoleon's rise to power) - so why is it that it is just so boring?\n\nBut most importantly, there's the bugs.  I have a fairly high-end rig, capable of playing this game at Ultra graphics settings across the board.  So why, then, did it take four patches to make my game play WORSE than it did at release?  Why does it periodically freeze for 5-20 seconds at a time?\n\nThe biggest bug affecting me is that after a certain point in the game (I'm not sure which), I lost the ability to obtain new weapons.  I could buy them, upgrade them, use them for a while - but if I changed weapons for ANY reason, any weapons I purchased after the bug took effect locked themselves again.  This required me to purchase those weapons, again, to use them.  If I obtained a weapon from a quest, that weapon became COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.  I cannot equip quest rewards at all.  Period.\n\nUbisoft has not announced that they are working on a fix, and no further patches have been announced, so it is likely that this bug will persist forever.  And because of this bug, I cannot complete all of the achievements in Dead Kings - meaning this is the first Assassin's Creed game I have ever purchased, that I have not been able to 100% complete, because of a game-breaking bug.\n\nOn to gameplay ...\n\nThere's a lot to do, while at the same time there's very little of anything INTERESTING to do.  Paris is beautiful and enormous.  But its size belies the complete lack of interaction between Arno and the city itself.  Sure, there's random events - kill these criminals, chase down this thief, throw money to the poor - but these are basically one-offs that take about 5 seconds to do, and have essentially no bearing on anything at all.  The Murder Mysteries are a good change of pace, and I enjoyed them quite a bit.  The Nostradamus Enigmas are also fun, if not frustratingly vague at times.  Almost every other side quest is the same - go to this place, kill this guy/fetch this item, run away.\n\nThe much-vaunted multiplayer is fun, if not monotonous.  It can be completed 100% by yourself, which is good because matchmaking is peer-to-peer and laggy, when you can connect at all.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, until you realize you can spam smoke bombs and kill everything easily.  After Brotherhood, you'd think that Ubisoft would figure out a way to make enemies respond to smoke bombs intelligently.  The game's AI is garbage, akin to Storm Troopers from Star Wars or an army of red-shirted ensigns from Star Trek.\n\nTL;DR - it's a beautiful, enormous playground - one that's full of broken toys.  The toys that aren't broken are boring.","January 18, 2015","false","90.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no new catchy jaw dropping sequences or info on the First Civilization, no Abstergo modern world gameplay except from 2 or 3 cutscenes. The entire campaing is really short and its ending dissapointing. You'll stare at the screen wondering... that's it????????????\n\nRegarding performance, unless you have a GeForce 970 dont bother with this game.\n\nGameplay wise... some fight mechanics are absent such as fistfighting your opponents and disarming them if you with to. Fights are much more difficult now since opponents will not wait untill the fight animation of your caracter finishes before the start stabbing. They stab whenever they feel like it, make it much more difficult to face multiple opponents.\n\nClimbing is made simpler, and alot smoother, but there are alot of hickups. Lets say you scale a wall and you wish to jump to another wall behing you... well thats not possible anymore and its annoying.\n\nIf you want an AC game with good visuals and a staggerings campaign, go for AC Black Flag.\n\nIf you are an AC fan, having played all the other AC games... well cant keep you from buying this one, cant say I didnt warn you though....","January 1, 2015","false","74.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much more smooth with the ability to free run up or down and it works much better when trying to climb things diagonally. The graphics are an improvement but not enough to really warrant praise. I like the added customisation to armours however the bonus stats it parades aren't really special, AC has never really been a hard game to play, you could probably finish it in the starting gear.\n\nNegatives. Oh boy.\n\nThe combat is a step backwards. Things have been taken away from previous titles and not really much more added. A new 'feature' is that more than one guard can attack you at once. The kill animations are so long though that sometimes you have to cancel the kill to defend against other guards. It's not satisfying and makes the game harder for the wrong reasons.\nThe main character is boring and blah blah blah. Content is mediocre but hardly the worst thing about the game.\n\nPERFORMANCE. My pc maybe a little old, probably 5 or so years with a GPU upgrade about 2-3 years ago. But I have to run this game at 720p on the lowest settings and still have poor framerate. I realise how open the game is and many pointless npcs are wandering/rioting but it's ridiculous. I can run DA:I on medium settings with a stable framerate even with my old hardware. The latest patch (4) meant to address performance issues has done nothing at all.\n\nPerformance aside there is one last issue. Uplay. I understand it's not Valve's fault that I have to run both Steam and Uplay to play this game but it's honestly unacceptable. I have to open Steam, click to play AC:U, wait for Uplay to launch, probably wait for a pointless update, wait for syncing, then the game will launch. Yes I could have just bought the game through Uplay but frankly it's an inferior program and I have no wish to use 3 of these prgrams (Origin included).\n\nAC:U syncs everything to Uplay, that's your save file. ONE SAVE FILE. I have no idea why I can't have multiple (for other users or multiple play thoughs) and it's a pretty poor 'addition'. If Uplay crashes (which it does) I can't save until I open it again, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.\n\nThe companion app. Cool idea. Say I'm out, wanna do some missions on it to get some ♥♥♥♥ when I get home and play Unity. Nah. You have to be playing Unity and sync up your app. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD I WANT TO USE THE APP WHILE I'M PLAYING THE GAME. Not to mention it constantly loses connection. It wouldn't be much of a problem but you gain extra content, which I assume I paid for, by using it. Whoever thought the idea up to make you connect to both at once should be buried alive.\n\nTL;DR\nSome cool new mechanics with free running and some new customisation.\nTerrible performance, intrusive Uplay, useless ♥♥♥♥ing Companion App.\nJust another steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ that Ubisoft it getting notorious for releasing.\n♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft, ♥♥♥♥ Uplay, ♥♥♥♥ Unity.","December 25, 2014","false","36.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Folken/recommended/289650/","Folken","Folken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Folken/","306 products in account","I've thoroughly played all of the Assassin's Creed games from the beginning and this one is by far the most visually stunning. That I'm afraid is about all the good I've got to say about it so far.  I'm 25 hours in at this point and I'm ready for it to be over. All of the games have had their frustrating moments with mechanics while free running but Unity takes it to a whole new level. From the first game to Brotherhood I spent as much time as possible on buildings running across rooftops because it was damned fun to parkour across the cities. In Unity I spend as much time as humanly possible on the ground because climbing anything will inevitably end up in a fit of keyboard punching while Arno is stuck to a wall/window/overhang making jerking motions in all directions going nowhere. The change to pressing Space to go up and E to go down might have been a good plan if it adhered to that and Arno reliably moved in the directions I press. If you find yourself having to choose between taking on 20 soldiers or going down one ladder to reach a target you'll want to take on the soldiers, believe me. Combat has changed significantly from previous games and while many people seem to enjoy the increased difficulty I'm not a fan. Were characters a little overpowered in the previous games, maybe, but combat was far more satisfying when you got the timing down and the characters are master assassins after all. Even after 25 hours I cannot find any sort of rhythm to combat sequences and it always ends up as a cross your fingers and key smash situation. I especially love when Arno decides to stop responding to attack/block keys and just stand there while being slashed to death, over, and over, and over again.  I've desynced more times in this game than all of the previous combined and it is 99% due to bugs.\n\nBeyond the core mechanics problems lie some core issues that also significantly set Unity apart from the rest of the franchise. I've enjoyed spending many hours at a time in Assassin's Creed games because of the great feeling of immersion in historical settings. Sure they've had plenty of repetitive events, missions, etc but overall I still had a decent feeling of being there. Despite the amazing visuals Unity has little to no immersion, it feels like I'm just playing a game and it reminds me of that constantly. Chests that can only be opened by a companion app, chests that are opened by some kind of online events, co-op popups in the middle of missions, etc. At this point I'm just grinding through the main missions. The diversity of the side missions is definitely appreciated and I'd love to see all the side story content but I have no interest in subjecting myself to more miserable parkour and combat bugs. In truth I would have stopped the game all together by now if it were not for the fleeting hope that there may be some continuation of the background story that has spanned all of the Assassin's Creed games. However, thus far no time at all has been spent outside the Animus and there have been no tidbits at all about the Assassin and Templar struggle, locating artifacts, or what any of the artifacts we've been playing through six games worth of genetic memories to locate are even for.\n\nUpdate: I have now completed the game so I can report that there are no updates to the overall Assassin's Creed story line so there was really no point in playing this game at all.  I now have over 40GB more free disk space at least.","December 29, 2014","false","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally didn't have any full on crashes, just framerates that topped out at about 23 fps, crowds/running dropping that to ~12fps and occaisional drops to 0fps for about 10 seconds, which is great during a chase.  Patch 4 made things a little smoother, but nowhere near what it should be.\n\nWhat gets me more upset is that there is literally no story to this game.  Ubisoft took a caracter vaguely like Ezio, threw him into the Assassin group in a revenge quest...and that's it.  He never actually believes anything the assassins believe in, nobody even really tells him about that in fact.  They just say, Templars=bad, now go kill them.\n\nIn the process of "streamlining" the mechanics, you can no longer whistle to attract enemies. Here is a list of everything that you have to BUY with in game points to be able to do:\nDouble assassinations\nDouble air assassinations\nGround executions\nDropping money to attract crowds\nLockpicking skill (which is really bad AND has 3 levels you need to buy btw)\nEnvironmental Blending\nHealth Upgrades\nMore attacks for EACH weapon type separately\nOther bomb types Now some of these features used to take crafting or searching for things into it which I'm fine with, but using a point system that you only have a limited number to work with unless you play tons of multiplayer is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  It takes abilities that were either built into past characters from the moment they start or taught to them or given for free in the story and makes you choose which you want to spend your "Sync Points" on.  In order to get enough of these points you MUST play the broken multiplayer that I never got to work successfully.  It would load a match then disconnect immediately.\n\nAll in all, a giant step backward in the series, and I have now lost hope for future installments.  We'll see I guess, but Ubisoft better get their act together soon.","January 2, 2015","false","38.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I thought about not recommending this game, but some elements such as co-op makes it worth while.\n\nLets just do the pros vs. cons:\n\nPros:\n- Co-op. The first AC title with co-op and it's really fun. Co-op missions are implemented, and matchmaking is easy enough.\n- Freerunning Up/Down. This feature allows the player to decide whether he wants to scale a building up or down, which works nicely once you get used to it. Less confusion on where you want to jump, which have been a trouble in previous AC titles.\n- Difficulty. This game has an increased difficulty compared to previous titles, and difficulty is bound to districts. Also, the enemies don't attack one at a time, and can also shoot at you while other engage you. Snipers are also a nice addition, as they are very powerful, but more easily killed in close combat (and are most often located on roof-tops).\n- Crowds. Paris is filled with people and the city feels alive and more realistically crowded.\n\nCons:\n- Uplay.\n- Story is rather dull, with uninteresting characters. Missions are rather monotomous.\n- The game revolves around Paris (which is okay), but it's ONLY Paris, nothing else, just a huge city, little variation to enviroment.\n- The game starts to lag at times, uncertain to why, may be only my problem.\n- Uplay, did I say that?\n- While the freerunning is good most of the times, some climbing issues occur, and obvious jumps to the right and left are not always permitted. And though the controls say "wall eject" or "climb jump", they do not always do so.\n- No crafting, sailing, hunting or anything that made previous games fun.\n- I don't really like Arno. He's very plain, and doesn't have anything remarkable with him.\n\nSummarization:\nAllthough I've listed plenty more cons than pros, the game is okay enough, but without co-op not really worth it. So if you have a bad internet connection, buy another game. Otherwise I would recommend it on a sale. Not really worth the full price, or the pre-order price I was stupid enough to get it for.","August 26, 2015","true","22.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has many improvements like a new parkour system, easier stealth, harder combat and pretty graphics. But with these improvements there are quite a few bugs still months after the initial release. The game is playable there are just animation glitches such a skipping an animation while climbing walls/fighting enemies or continuing an animation on a dead enemy. Clipping errors with people in wall and such. The one that frustrates me though is a glitch were mid game my controller will desync with the game and I have to unplug and replug it in. Overall i'd say it's worth 60-70$ for a hardcore fan of the series but for most casual players i'd say buy it on sale","July 5, 2015","true","53.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, the story might be a tad short and the starting bugs were just horrid. Nope, scratch that, they were horrific. But the new Parkour- and Battle-Systems are magnificent. Being able to get of a roof without either taking the time to take the long but safe path down or looking for a bloody Pigoens/Crows (or their droppings) to take a leap of faith. Also, the Battle-System of AC Unity needs you more alert than ever, removing the quite annoying Streak kills you could use in AC Brotherhood up to AC Black Flag, which ended whenever yuo tried to take down a Brute. Also the enemy AI now have the option to kill you with just one precise strikewhenever you fail to balance defence and offense. This makes you reconsider battles even more opposed to going on killing streaks, which I'm sure we all did in all the other AC games. To help strengthen this point even more, we now have an astonishing new feature, Stealth Mode. I'm now able to avoid a bulk of enemies and go on my merry Way through Paris.\nLast but not least, being able to lob Bombs away from you is an impressive new feature. Now I can throw a Smoke Bomb at a group of NPC's and not have to walk into the middle of the group triggering a fight and then have a slim chance (but it's still there) of being killed.","April 23, 2015","true","39.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

I read all the comments below and almost didnt get the game but then decided might as well give a try. I definitely did not regret it. I have a GTX 770 2GB and I was running mostly on Ultra. No lag no issues didnt seem to cause any problems. Graphics are not splendid but they are good nonetheless. Experienced very few bugs in single mode. Coop mode was a bit more buggy but nothing too serious.\n\nNow that aside, let's talk about the game itself. The story is interesting to say the least. A lot of characters, a lot of mixed emotions and struggles. Was never bored of following the main missions. The ending was a bit lackluster I must say. Some characters could be a bit deeper but wasnt really an issue. As for the side missions, in single mode you have missions which take a minute and give you a boost of cash, and others that are longer and more interesting. Coop missions are definitely fun as well but the qeues to find players often put me off.\n\nThe gameplay is in my opinion one of the best in the series. The new free run down option really improves your general mobility and its been a niche I felt needed covering for quite a while. Sometimes Arno refused to do things I asked him to but in general mobility was good.\n\nThey made fighting a bit more difficult since you cant kill a person using a counter anymore at all. If you fight a large mob a few will move back and start shooting at you, and it hurts. It does push you to actually be an assassin and not a crazed savage with guns blazing. Stealth is more difficult but you have a lot of tools to help you. Unfortunately you often end up killing everyone anyway but it feels gratifying to sneak in, take out the target and sneak out properly.\n\nThe city (Paris) is very nice to move around in. Crowd events always give you something to do. You can actually enter a lot of the buildings through doors or windows. Royalist give you trouble wherever you go. The crowd slowly starts to fight with you. I was never bored walking around. While some regions and buildings in Paris are phenomenal (and Im not even talking about Notre Dame), Ubisoft couldve made different regions more unique (Rome in Brotherhood and Constantinople in Revelations come to mind). One of the main things they added to Unity was massive crowds, that you can walk through while being blended in. I particularly enjoyed that part too, and it added to the feel of the revolution and all.\n\nI definitely didnt cover everything in the game but I wanted this review to push people to get this game. Completely different experience from Black Flag as it goes back to the traditional AC feel back in the Ezio games, but its a brilliant game nonetheless.

I think that this game deserves more praise than its recieved, especially for the new 4 player feature. becuase this game has recieved so much hate, they might never re-introduce this feature, and the 4 player co-op is so much more fun than on your own. especially on heavy combat missions. But one final note, check the system requirements. And make sure you have the recommended requirements, not just the minimal ones. The main issue is lag, and if you get this game with and i3 prossecor or even i5, youll encounter alot of it, but i would like if you show this game more praise. They added things that made this game feel unique, and i like the story line. its much more of a realistic one, even if its not as "cool" as black flag, which is possibly the highest ratted game. and yes, i agree i miss boats, but if you want to ride a boat, get a boat simulator. its called assassins creed.

At first I thought about not recommending this game, but some elements such as co-op makes it worth while.\n\nLets just do the pros vs. cons:\n\nPros:\n- Co-op. The first AC title with co-op and it's really fun. Co-op missions are implemented, and matchmaking is easy enough.\n- Freerunning Up/Down. This feature allows the player to decide whether he wants to scale a building up or down, which works nicely once you get used to it. Less confusion on where you want to jump, which have been a trouble in previous AC titles.\n- Difficulty. This game has an increased difficulty compared to previous titles, and difficulty is bound to districts. Also, the enemies don't attack one at a time, and can also shoot at you while other engage you. Snipers are also a nice addition, as they are very powerful, but more easily killed in close combat (and are most often located on roof-tops).\n- Crowds. Paris is filled with people and the city feels alive and more realistically crowded.\n\nCons:\n- Uplay.\n- Story is rather dull, with uninteresting characters. Missions are rather monotomous.\n- The game revolves around Paris (which is okay), but it's ONLY Paris, nothing else, just a huge city, little variation to enviroment.\n- The game starts to lag at times, uncertain to why, may be only my problem.\n- Uplay, did I say that?\n- While the freerunning is good most of the times, some climbing issues occur, and obvious jumps to the right and left are not always permitted. And though the controls say "wall eject" or "climb jump", they do not always do so.\n- No crafting, sailing, hunting or anything that made previous games fun.\n- I don't really like Arno. He's very plain, and doesn't have anything remarkable with him.\n\nSummarization:\nAllthough I've listed plenty more cons than pros, the game is okay enough, but without co-op not really worth it. So if you have a bad internet connection, buy another game. Otherwise I would recommend it on a sale. Not really worth the full price, or the pre-order price I was stupid enough to get it for.","August 26, 2015","true","22.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ubisoft's biggest fail of 2014. They released a buggy, nearly unplayable mess to their audience, slapped some Templars in there, and called it an Assassin's Creed game. After the horrendous ♥♥♥♥♥torm after it, Ubisoft had to give free games out to calm the masses and not make people mad. It was a miracle that they weren't sent to the guillotine in the game. I finally played the game, and I got to experience it first hand. I know you await my judgement. You read the horror stories, you saw the caps with only the eyes and mouths showing up. You know this must be worst than the Holocaust. So how traumatized am I by it?\n\nIt was alright. Nothing too bad.\n\nYeah, I am playing this a year and a half after it was released, and they patched it, but it was honestly fine. Not the best AssCreed, I guess that might go to Black Flag or one of the 2's, and I think I enjoyed Rogue more than this, but I liked this enough. I'm sure you wonder what I talk about, so let's take a look at everything.\n\nSTORY: You're Arno, the second blandest character in ACreed history ever. Your master is murdered and you are framed. However, during the famed Bastielle escape, you get out of jail, join the Assassins, and go after the men who killed your master, who also happen to be pulling the strings of the French Revolutions. Kind of generic "get revenge" story, but it's not terrible or anything. It kept me interested long enough, and while Rogue's is more compelling, this was fine. It was neat running into Napolean and... that guy who invented sadism and... okay, I don't recognize most of these names, but I haven't had this lesson in school yet, so shut up xD. The modern day ♥♥♥♥ they throw in is pointless as always, and I wish they'd just get rid of it, but they need some link to connect the games together, so I guess we have to deal with it. It really ruined the mood here, though. Not the biggest mood killer, but I'll get into that later.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Same ACreed, Different Game. Well, they do refine it a bit more since it's a new gen game. You have a skill tree to unlock what you had back in the last games along with the new stuff. There's a new lockpicking system, which is a neat addition. Stealth has been overhauled a bit, making it a better option depending on what you want to do. Apparently Arno is a lot less agile than the Kenway's or anyone like that, though, as combat is a lot stiffer and you can't just go in guns blazing. Or I guess swords blazing, but you know what I mean. Sadly, there's no ship gameplay, which was my favorite part of Black Flag, but I guess it wouldn't make sense to have that here.\n\nGRAPHICS, LEVEL DESIGN, AND PERFORMANCE: So the graphics. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Paris is ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. Might depend on your preference, but this is probably the best looking ACreed I've seen. Paris feels so alive, and if you can run it on Ultra, do so. It's amazing to see it. While the game had performance issues at launch, they're fixed now. I heard some nonsense about a 30FPS lock, but that's nowhere to be found. Framerate stuck at around 60 for me, with some drops to the 50's or even 40's sometimes, but it was fine nontheless.\n\nCHARACTERS, VOICE ACTING, AND DIALOGUE: Arno is kind of a dull protagonist. I mean, he isn't the complete and utter bore as Connor in AC3, who was known to bore any Templars who bought that game to death along with everyone else, but still, not very good. His companion/love interest Elise is much better, and I honestly think she'd be a more interesting protagonist, but I guess they did the "play as a Templar" thing in Rogue already, so ah well. Voice acting is good... kind of. While the actors are very good, I noticed something odd... EVERYONE HAD A FREAKING BRITISH ACCENT. It's fine if Arno and Elise had one, I wouldn't care. But do you mean to tell me that Napolean and numerous historical figures who lived in France their whole life had British accents? Around 40% of people who live in France today can speak some English, you couldn't get one of them to play some of these characters? It's not that I'm mad or calling racism or some stupid ♥♥♥♥ like that, but it kind of takes you out of the otherwise good atmosphere in the game. Other than that, I had no real problems with the game, voice acting was top notch and the script was alright.\n\nSIDE ACTIVITIES: It's an ACreed game, of course there are a lot of things to do. You have a general idea of what there is? Yes? Well, that's it. No? Ask someone else, I'm too lazy to xD Though I will say that if you want to, you can sink a lot of time into it. I think this is the ACreed game I put the less time into, compared to the 27 hours (says 19 but Steam glitched out, it was 27) of Rogue and the two playthroughs I did on Black Flag on two different systems, so take that as you will.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: ...oh right. ACreed had multiplayer. Um... I only played one co-op game, I think I remembered it being alright, but I don't have enough gameplay on it to make a good judgement.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Eh, it's alright. Graphically it's impressive, but other than that, it's just your usual ACreed game. 7.5/10, it's fine. If you can grab it for $20, that's probably a good deal. Enjoy all the ACreed games? Try this out for size if you haven't.\n\nAll that we do, all that we are, begins and ends with ourselves.","January 27","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me just say, the game was great. I played through it in 30~ hours, I don't have that many due to my router's shennanagins, and I felt like it embraced the role of assassin well. Playing as Arno was fun, climbing around, finding secrets (quite a few to find), learning about revolutionary France, and most importantly teabagging thieves/murders. The fighting sequences weren't your typical button mashers, requiring agood deal of dodging/parrying in the later game, but didn't involve complex button sequences. The mysteries were fun, with some actual sleuthing and much puzzling, and while the rewards weren't amazing, it helps if you aren't farming for money. The initiate chests gave me a few preset outfits, which did look better than the mixmatch outfit I wore previously too. One thing though, look out for a bug that freezes your character if he climbs on something he normally shouldn't be on.\n\nIf you are a first time AC player and are looking for a cheaper version with better graphics, I highly reccomend the game. ♥♥♥♥ the storyline screwups, I enjoyed the game on it's own. A great game to pick up on sale, and get the Dead Kings DLC for a little extra spending money and mortar axes.

Best game ever. I was glued to my screen. The combat was amazing. Then new assassins creed started to release. I was excited. AC 2, AC Brotherhood, AC 3, AC IV. Best assassins creed was very fun.

The CO-OP looked cool to. The day when this released I looked at it, saw gameplays and read reviews and it didn't seem the same. The fact that AC turned the tables. Don't get me wrong I like this game but AC Unity failed to keep me satisified with the story so far but I need to play it just like the other assassins creed.\n\nPros:\n-Nice graphics (Maxed out)\n-Nice map\n-Good stealth\n-The parkour is much more better and syncs in well when jumping into different buildings\n\nCons:\n-CANNOT use hidden blade in combat (Really Ubisoft?

I don't blame people for being angry.\n\nBut my god there is absolutely no reason to not try it now. The game has been updated and patched to near perfection. Throughout my entire 52 hour playthrough (this was literally just completing the story and doing renovating side quests and collecting things) I never got a single crash. Not one. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. The amount of work put into this game is just astounding. The most ambitious game yet.\n\nI typically don't review games, but I had to put this review out there. Please try this game. The story is great. (No spoilers). And the chemistry Arno and Elise share made the game that much more enjoyable. The ending had me on the edge of my seat. It's been a while since any game has had me so actively engaged in the story. Especially an Assassin's Creed game.\n\nThe city of Paris is so alive with literally hundreds of NPC's walking around engaging in revolutionary activity. If you still need convincing of why to buy this game, I'm not even half way through the game! I put 52 hours into the game beating the main story and a good portion of side quests and I am only 40 percent through. 40 PERCENT! The amount of content from murder mysteries, social club renovation missions, collecting the chests, and more just add so much flavor to the game and I can say with confidence that an Assassin's Creed game has never been more polished and beautiful and so full of content as this one.\n\n(I'll be purchasing Syndicate soon. For Now I'll be playing AC Unity if you need me.)  ONE MORE ENCOURAGING NOTE: YOU GET TO PLAY THROUGH FREAKING PARIS IN WW2. LIKE WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR. MACHINE GUNS AND PLANES.

While I have put approximately 6 hours into Assassins Creed 3 and Black Flag I never found myself interested enough in sticking with them to the end.\n\nUnity is actually a very impressive feat for Ubisoft and for the franchise and despite a few very minor bugs that may pop up every few hours (most of the bugs seem to have been addressed and that ones that linger seem to be aesthetic glitches) the game is actually a joy to play!\n\nMy favorite aspect is the setting of the game, Paris is recreated with such mastery it's incredible. Controlling your assassin is SOO MUCH BETTER that it doubles the fun in running around this virtual playground. Story isn't bad, kind of standard but not bad, though I don'r really care for the main character as much as I did Assassins Creed 2's Enzo.\n\nBeing able to traverse through out door to indoor interiors back to out door is seamless and fantastic keeping up the momentum and cool factor.\n\nTry it! You can always get a refund from Steam if it's not to your liking or your PC can't run it.","January 9","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly, there's nothing a patch can do to fix a bland story. Half the time you won't know what you were doing, and when the story reaches its conclusion, there's really nothing more there than a pat in the back. There are some weird things too like the ability to read the target's memory after you assassinate them? When was that introduced? If you like the series, AC:U does pretty much what you would expect. It won't blow your mind, though.","August 15, 2015","true","47.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
