It worths at most 30 dollars at launch for this quality.Koei must be super insane right now.\n说真的，这游戏售价90刀真他妈搞笑。就这游戏素质最多30刀。光荣真是想钱想疯了。\n\npros: several good new concepts intoduced.\n优点：有几个新的不错的游戏概念。\n\ncons: insanely stupid AI, you can pusuade any clan to alliance or armisty without any condition. Clan will keep fighting for his allies even when his own cities get attacked. stupid game mechanisim, you get only one chance of diplomacy suggestion per rank( 9 at most) if you are not the clan lord or lord's military adviser, because as I said, diplomacy in this game is ♥♥♥♥in OP to hell.\n缺点：超级傻逼的AI,可以同盟或者停战任何势力，无论对方实力如何。一个势力可以为了帮助同盟而不管自己的城市。愚蠢的游戏机制，如果你不是君主或者君主军师重臣，那你就只有最多9次机会可以提出外交建议。原因很简单，这游戏的外交OP到火星。\n\nAnd most importantly, the game is TOO fast paced, you CANNOT do much your personal ♥♥♥♥♥. But if the game slows down the pace, you actually will find you DONOT have much ♥♥♥♥♥ to do.\n最重要的是，这游戏的节奏超快，你基本干不了什么自己的事情。但是如果这游戏节奏变慢了，你会发现你其实也没什么事情可以干。。。内容匮乏。\n\nOverall, it is another cheap designed and implented 三国志 game from KOEI.\n总结：暗耻又廉价设计和制作了一个三国志游戏。\n\nPut your ♥♥♥♥ together, Koei, you keep destroying this franchise!\n草泥马的傻逼暗耻。别再毁三国志系列。","February 3","false","63.0"," 306 of 334 people (92%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","92","306","334","40","9"

A few  (out of many many) major drawbacks on the design:\n\n1) The big map system is just a white elephant. Even though it's big, it's 3D, it has hundreds of towns, but you can only travel by the pre-fixed roads. No way to build anything anywhere on the map. How does it differ from a simple 2D map as in San12?\n\n2) The economic system is basically spayed. No matter how many towns/talents a player has, he/she can only assign 2 (or up to 8) to work....\n\n3) It imposes many unreasonable restrictions, like no troop transportation between towns, automatic troop regeneration, no way to recruit people in towns not neighboring to you....\n\n4) I knew San13 is trying to find a balance between RPG and RTS (or SIM), but unfortunately it fails on both ends... The RPG system is so boring and repetitive... NO fun at all!\n\nI really wish I can have my money back!!!\n\nAdvice: IF YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED IT, PLEASE DON'T DO IT!\n","January 31","false","14.2"," 265 of 301 people (88%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","88","265","301","17","1"

Compared with 10, I prefer to play 10 one hundred times than play 13 for only 2 hours.\n\nThe war part is just a simplified version of 12 and you do not need to do anything to win a war. The only thing you can do is to use your ability once, then wait for the animation until you have enough points, needless to say the two dual mode. They're just same and boring.\n\nIn general, I do not think KOEI is a company that can provide good games anymore. I think they only know how to take the money and build "web-free-to-play" game. I would definitely not buy any KOEI games anymore, or just enjoy the free version of the games.\n\n100CAD is just the money I send to you and go to grave, KOEI.  愿你早死早超生。","January 28","false","3.2"," 227 of 265 people (86%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","86","227","265","50","11"

The only issue is if you have enough generals to defend it.\n3) You can have a long campaign, provided the cities you conquered have loads of food. By replenishing it every time you take the city, basically you can conquer the whole map (as long as you dont run out of soldiers.\n\n=====================================================================\nUPDATES: Purchasing certain items will change the weapon type you are using. After playing for 3 hours and battling for countless times... I did not get any change on a duel with any generals. Wonder if there is any conditions to be met.\n\nKinda tough and messy when the map is left with rulers. Especially when u have a lot of land but not enough generals. Still have yet to complete it. The way my game progress kept me playing.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nVery simplified.  Nothing much to do as a general besides fulfilling tasks given by ruler. If u do not select any task, u can only go shopping or visit other generals.\n\nThe war graphics are OK.  But when 2 troops collide, I only see sloppy animations. Rotk 11 animation is better.\n\nChances of duel seems low. Only a few options. Just wondering why they only allow 5 rds of fighting. Items do not have special effect on the duel. Rotk 11 seemed better.\n\nAuto replenish army. Simplified game. Too simplified.\n\nBecame a regional general. Ruler gave me all the cities to govern leaving one to manage on his own . I might as well take over his place.\n\nReally disappointing. They tried to insert new features but simplified the game. Are we low ability players that can't handle complex games?","January 29","false","82.8"," 134 of 155 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","134","155","7","5"

About a week ago, i thought the game developer were greedy and lazy with their game and thats why i was disappointed with the game. But now, i think the developers are retar-ded and the Game is broken. And here are the reasons:\n\n1)This is a strategic rpg, but rpg has zero element in the game, everyone addresses u in the same way over and over. Whether they r your father, mother, siblings, spouse, or friend.......... they all address you the same way. And worse, its like they dont know you some times- For instance, Lu Bu will say something like "I will cut you down" while fighting with her daughter when they r on opposite sides?!! Why !?\n\n2) RPG but you can only play as a ruler................ I'm Saying this becuz, watever role you chose from the begining (peasant, low rank officer, city ruler.), it all ends with you Ruling or Running the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kingdom once you ranked up.I ll explain, you start off as an officer doing some amazing work under your lord. But after 2 yrs you r garanteed to become a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ General and there arent any options where you can reject it. Do you think being a general is cool? ♥♥♥ no, because your king will give you the privilege of running all his cities for him (well, all except one city which is the city hes is currently in). If he has 2 cities, you rule one of them but if u have 55, you rule 54 cities !!!!!! WT F would i want to play under king if i m doing his job? I might as well as just play a lord then....\n\n3) Your AI Boss is retar-ded or the mechanic being a general under the AI King is retar-ded............ continuing from the prev point, after he has given you all his cities. he will never fight, rule or govern shi t. He became non existent in the game.  And this is where the mechanics are really ♥♥♥♥♥ up ------------ > becuz as a general You CANT:\n\na) you cant award/deward or promote/ demote people in your or the kings army. Meaning, if people that just got recruited but are not 100% loyal to you, they will just continue getting lower and lower loyalty point, becuz you cant award them or promote them to better ranks to gain their loyalty. And the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ king will do nothing as mentioned before, he just watch his minions leave. In one game, I have half of my officers leaving my power andi cant do shi t.\n\nb) the King will hold onto the 4 cousel members till he dies and you cant have them change legion between you and the king.  from teh beginning of the game, the king will select 4 of the most elite members to be the cousel members and wen he gives you all the power to rule his kingdom, u were cut off from these elite members forever! Elite!\n\nc) cant suggest a redistribution of land between u and your lord. and can only suggest taking officers from other legions but cant give some of your officers to other ranks??? the ♥♥♥, becuz some legions are in crucial locations that needs good officers and sometime you have all the good officers becuz you r the one doing all the conquering and capturing enemy officers. One time, wen my lord give me the control all his land , he chose to govern the city on the edge of the map and the closest to caocao with only 5 officers....... ♥♥♥ this s hit,  i was like - please just take some of my officers to defend ! but nope, after numerous atttack from caocao, my lord was captured and executed.\n\n\nOn general note. The game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy and warriors doesnt matter alot. Who ever has the most cities will win because its all abt the the number of soldiers you have. you can test this by doing some thing i did......... i created 35 maxed out officers of my own and put them in a city next to liu biao( a b itch that is s hit and considerably weak, and why do i only put them in one city? BECuz there isnt an option to let them govern more than one). and guess wat, they r wiped out in a years time and they didnt even expand becuz they were terrified of the b itch i just mentioned.\n\nThe camera of the game is nuisiating.\n\nyou have zero time to do your own stuff and your own mission.\n\nso many people is like ~ ah, the game is so fun , u can marry 3 cute chicks in the game.......... i m like ............. these people must just die if thats their standard of fun. Plus i dont see the point of marriage or brotherhood, they help in battlefield and in politics but everything else is the same as any other officers.\n\nSeriously, I ve been a big fan of koei's work but i will not be one of COD fan boys who support ♥♥♥♥ products just becuz you r a fanboy. This game is lazy, simple and broken. Definitely not worth 100 dollars. it should be around 40 dollars max in the current market","February 8","false","78.8"," 116 of 144 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","116","144","18","13"

With no English support? And come with a broken release? Seriously? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!\nThe game was titled "RPG style gameplay", yet it has less RPG element than either the 8th or 10th title of the series, (I wanna say "with the least RPG element", but I didn't went through all the RPG style titles, so let's stay conservative)\nNo actual facility interactions, all cities have exactly the SAME buildings, merely no request or mission or anything if you are not hired by a faction.\nAnd the worst part, when you are enlisted in an army as a COMMON SQUAD LEADER, you are FORCED to take control or command or whatever of the whole battle field . WTF? I AM JUST A FREAKING SQUAD LEADER!\n\nThere are some other weird settings in the game , like a man can get three wives; a woman can get three husband; you can play Romeo & juliet in the game coz you cannot hire your own wife/husband from other factions, well, and you cannot hire them if they are too far away either; your son/daughter, husband/wife talks to you like strangers; only you ride horses in the world, other ppl use teleportation or ride horses that makes them transparent; you cannot resupply troops for your army (don't get this) unless you disband your army and gather them again at your home city; your can instantly transport food, money, but not troops (Why? because teleportation technology kills?); shared command point makes most of your generals' battle skills useless in a battle, and many more.\n\nif you are playing as anyone except for the lord/emperor, you will eventually become the general/metro governor. Your lord will give you control of everything except for diplomacy, which means you will have to assign governor for every single city and allocate generals to the cities ONE BY ONE. When some governors are killed or captured in the battle, you will have to assign the governor again! Moreover, since you are in control of everything except for diplomacy, you will have to fight all battles without forming alliances or peace treaty with anyone, you will have to micro manage armies from every city to disband, march, rally, resupply and everything. Something that creates more "fun" is when one of your city is attacked, the governor of the city will NOT resist! you will have to command them to resist. It may happen when you get out of one manually controled battle, you find that your enemy has taken control several of your cities with 100k troops in it, WITHOUT EVEN A FIGHT. Even worse, your lord will sometimes order your armies away when your border is under heavy attack lol. A dump lord is definitely a good way to increase difficulty of this game!\n\nThis is the WORST RPG style ROTK I ever played! should've gone 3dm or whatever other sites.\n\nOK, I'll be honest, the CGs are decent and playing as lord is playable (better than XII), but that's all.\n\nThis game is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED unless the PK version gives this game a complete overhaul!\n\nQA & PS\n\nPS: I read the comments and found that many ppl thought I bought the game without any previous research not knowing it came without English ver., but actually i was fully aware that this game came with no English support when I bought it. I just feel so unfair that it was sold way more expensive in English speaking region without localization. I bought this game with so much expectation, because the ads emphasized on RPG elements of the game which reminded me of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms X PK", the recent RPG style ROTK, thought I could play something similar...\n\nwell, such a disappointment.\n\nQA\n1)\n"Due to massively large complains to RoTK 10's stupid ai, Koei decides to let us players taking control of the whole battle field in 13. I don't think this change is wrong."\n\nLet player take control over friendly AI is never a suitable solution to dump AI. Enemy AI was dump, too, so who's gonna take over that? Making this a multiplayer game?\nPlz improve your AI instead of using that as an excuse and let players fix it for you.\n\nGood thing about X is that it is your choice of how you play. As a common general, you need to fix your boss's dump dicisions, it happens when you serve your lord or manager or board ! It also happens that friendly will just leave you there to die in battlefield, maybe coz they simply don't like you! I bet everyone knows this kind of workplace drama!\nif you don't like friendly AI, just go play as a lord! You can take control of everything! It is kinda how reality works.","January 28","false","114.8"," 373 of 522 people (71%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","71","373","522","67","35"

Compared to NB's ambition:Souzou released one year ago, the game lacks details\nin many perspective, including the rendering of  maps, the battlefield and the interative between people. The battle system is also a simplified version of ROTTK 12, in which very few strategies can be applied.\n\nI still expect the next release of the game and hope that in the coming PK version, KOEI can give us a complete experience with this new engine.\n\n","January 30","false","14.0"," 77 of 89 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","77","89","2","0"

If you are a fan of the San 8 / 9 / 10 / 11, then this is not a game for you.\n\nIn terms of city development, as other reviews said, there is not much you can do. There are no facilities in city anymore, you just have a few clicks to choose and the city will develop (and you don't even spot the different or people working..). You have no places to visit, and no tasks or events to encounter. You can't even relocate soldiers or generals. Feels like any mobile game would be more sophisticated than it.\n\nIn terms of combat system, it's a nice try to go RTS but the AI is dump. You have to micro-manage every unit in a battle or they will not fight the enermy just besides them. Each unit has it own speical ability to use on the expense of skill points, but every unit share the same skill points thus usually only a unit can use the special ability.\n\nSo in short, if this game is a webpage or mobile game for free, I would say you can try. But if it is a game charging players for that amount of money, I would not recommend anyone to buy it. I feel like being ripped off just because I am a fans of its previous series..

The largest amount of official and cities in the entire franchise.\n2.) The portrait  and the background pictures are more alive.\n3.) The technology upgrades for the cities are good to have but most of them are so generic.\n4.) The characteristic of the general is new in the franchise where different characteristic will give the kingdom a different benefit. For example, one of the characteristic raises the loyalty of the officers in the kingdom everytime the season changes.\n\n\nCons\n1.) The ruler AI decision making of the game is bad. Imagine this, your country is surrounded by 3 different country instead of allying with the 1 of the country the ruler just make you march brainlessly to battle which give the opportunity for the other country to backstab you.\n2.) Diplomatic mechanic in this series is overpowered. However, the diplomatic option is limited to the ruler or the ruler's strategist. Other than that, the option will only available once the player achieve a rank up on his/her position in the kingdom.\n3.)The AI during the battle is bad. The AI will always leave one unit in the main base and the unit will almost won't march out from the base. Unless, there are new reinforcement for the AI and the player main base is empty. You will see something like this: ALL YOUR units are surrounding their units nearby their main base and that extra unit will help alot in the fight but instead of advancing the unit the AI just make it standing in the base. You can even sometimes see the AI setting fire on their own units who is weak to fire attacks.\n4.) Customise officer can't customise their 3D models and most of the officers in the game share the same model with each other despite of them being famous officers.\n\nLastly, I only recommand people to buy if you truly want to support the franchise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lubufengxian/recommended/363150/","lubufengxian","Lu Bu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lubufengxian/","148 products in account","Having played through the game normally, I have to say that this game is pretty decent.  It's no 11, but it is still pretty fun on it's own.  One of the main problem I find with this game though, is that most of it are a bit of an "aquired taste".  I will list some of the common issues people had and my own opinion on this.  Also, here is a  playlist to my playthrough https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbfVnXPcuNZ10zUyX9ykn6chaoH-fq-de if one wants a closer look at gameplay.\n\nNow on to the issues:\n1. 90$ - I have to agree, that really wasn't what I was expecting when I looked at the store for it.  But I think the price is "fair" if you are to import the game.  Still, I don't know why they are charging import prices over on steam, but some of the complaints about it being too much simply because it wasn't in English is simply unfounded.  I do hope though that Koei will ease up on the prices in the future because it's definitely getting them negative reviews. (Not to mention its a game that has a long history of being pirated, you don't want to scare away first time supporters)\n\n2. 8 Slots (and Simplied gameplay) - One of the other main complaints is that now you have a limit to how many tasks that can be offered to officers.  With this game I feel like I am playing Nobunaga's Ambition SOI which was a lot of fun.  Nowadays the direction of these games seems to sway towards delegation rather than complete control to give it a more lively feel.  I actually don't have any complaints about that, sending people to watch over a city and have them grow it themselves is cool in it's own way.  Officers in this game will seek out their own tasks and will help each other as well.  Internal policies isn't very deep, but it's not terrible either.\n\n3. Battle and AI - I'll admit the AI can be bad, but then again, every other strategy games I have played have had AI doing stupid things, that's just how it is.  As long as the AI is fun to play with and against it's not so very bad, this isn't a competitive game anyway.  So far I am not too disappointed yet.\n\n4. RPG aspects - ROTK 13 marks the return of the RPG aspect that was missing in ROTK since 10.  Officer to officer interaction requires you to do something for them (So they enter thankful or grateful status) you will likely have to hang around in town and wait for them to do tasks and help them out or host parties and raise relations, only afterwards could you further increase relations and receiving training.  Alternative you could help them out in battles such as performing pincer attacks with them, listen to their advice in battle or defeating powerful generals in duels to awe them.\n\nAfter a certain point (80 relations) an officer will offer you a sidequest for you to do to raise their friendship further,  This is where the language barrier will affect the most because there's a story to each of them.  For example: Zhang Liao wants to repay a friend's kindness but hadn't heard from him, Huang Yue Ying wants to save the starving people outside of our city, to Cao Cao wishing to obtain a special book but instead received something greater, a friend.  There are many and I haven't found a repeat yet, though the actual quest itself isn't like super convuluted and involved or anything, they were cute to watch like something you'd expect from a visual novel.\n\nOther than that, stat increases outside of training with buddies is through daily tasks or on the battlefield.  I honestly don't know why people complain about the RPG aspect it actually isn't that bad.  It's not super involved like RTK 8 where you even raise children, but it's good as it is imo.\n\nWell that's it for my review for the most part.  While I don't think that this game is a masterpiece or even worth the 90$ I feel that this game deserves some credit, it might detract from the norms of ROTK that we are all familiar with, but I feel that it's rather refreshing.  I do wish we get ROTK 11 style duels and debate though, nothing beats those yet.  I mean falling off a pillar to your death after losing an argument?  That's so badass!","February 3","true","126.0"," 51 of 97 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","51","97","12","3"

Some patches even include new content into the game; although the additions are relatively small as far as content goes, it does change the gameplay quite a bit and I feel it is for the better. (Example: on initial release of the game there were no encounters when you travelled between cities; that is now in the game. Also, sovereigns will reward their subjects with items now rather than just rank and money.) I still do not understand Chinese or Japanese but I have taken some time to recognize and understand icons and menus enough to make the game playable, I only struggle to realize when an officer in the same force defects or when an alliance is formed. I will admit that makes the gameplay awkward and frustrating but that might be something we may not need to worry about much longer. I hear there is going to be an option for the english language in May. I am unsure if this is true or not but I am holding out optimistically that there will be an english version soon. Do not give up on this game yet, especially if you are a fan of RotK 8 and 10. This is a fantastic game and I can only imagine what they will do with it when they release the PUK.\n\nUPDATE: The Western release is slated for July 5th in North America and July 8th in Europe, so that will likely fix any pricing woes that anyone has; there is currently an unofficial english patch that is in the works but currently makes the game playable.","March 6","true","73.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","1"

My computer is at least 5 years old.\n\nAbout the RTK13\n\nWell the campaign tutorial was very exciting game, you learn good amount of how to play the  game successfully, so I recommand go through the campaign tutorial first before you striaght into the normal campaign. And yes I completed the whole tutorial section.\n\nHere is some help on Zhuge Liang campaign tutorial section:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QD05zXvBO8\n\nIf you go to play the normal campaign where you conquer everything, make sure you select the option on the start to slow down computer AI- players expansion (it is on one of the tab option on the start) , otherwise the AI just go crazy and keep attacking you. I personally like to expand slowly and found it hard to keep up with the friendship apart of the game going when you have 4-AI armys all attacking me at once.\n\nPro:\n* Good campaign tutorial;\n\n* Good graphic;\n\n* Make sure you get the free officers extension as well, it is good idea to create your own super character to maintain you cities. This game will attack you very quickly if you don't have good officers and you don't have much ally.\n\n* This game feel more like the "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence" except it have less city to conquer which is good, because "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence" is a bit too much, too many cities to conquer. I like Total War Shogun2 better than "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence", just have too many cities.\n\n* Good charaters voice, I like some of the girls voice, very sweet.\n\n* Finally burning cao cao ship in chained ship battle;\n\nCon:\n* Why can't I move troop to other city? I mean I do hear many people complain about this as well, and I feel the same, it is simply unrealitic that you cannot move troop. Their is no reason for cannot move troop to you border cities, that is whatevery do in every strategy game. That makes the game suck!\n\n* No ambush, cannot hide in battlefield;\n\n* War-Horse-unit can climb ladders, LOL;\n\n* Game can go very quickly, if you don't know what you are doing and don't plan, you can lose very easily, because everyone will start attacking you for no reason and you cannot fight every direction.\n\n* Game programming error on officer duel weapon, it changes for no reason. Big error!\n\n* No English version. Why can't Koei just make every games to have english as well, suck if you don't know chinese or japanese;\n\n* Game go too quick, need to set up your alliance, otherwise everyone will attack you.\n\n* This game will be too hard to play if you play as a crappy low status officer with little INT and POWER.\n\n* Game over priced $90USD;\n\n* Traditional tactic like ambush, unit position up the maintain to attack enemy on low position, and attak on enemy flank made not be in the game and instead just mainly depand on magic-speical-skill for each officer.\n\nConclusion:\nGood game, but got some programming and techniques error need to be fix.\nNeed to know how to read chinese or japanese to understand game writing.","February 13","true","172.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","9"

There aren't any other games like 三国志.\n\nAnd in terms of the gameplay, I don't think it deserves that many negative reviews. I think people just assumed that it will be similar to 10.

The new army system is actually quite realistic. You can no longer support a 100,000 army in a city with a 20,000 population. And it actually will make the late game less boring, since you no longer need to build your army supply chain and send them to the frontline.\n\nOverall this is a solid game, I don't think it deserves this many hates.","January 30","true","14.1"," 20 of 48 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","20","48","4","0"

Take the negative reviews with a pinch of salt. The game is realistic, you just cannot raise army at your whims and fancy like the other titles in the series; it makes sense that the army that can be supported is dependent on your city size. Also, if you played as a officer, doesn't it makes sense to take command from your ruler and fulfill whatever tasks assigned to you?\n\nThe combat is refreshing with great level of details which differ from castles to castles. Having played ROTK since ver 1, this entry continues the excellent track records of its predecessors and is unique in its own way.

On the other hand, its aspect as a RPG game also has more to be explored (comparing to text reading & choosing in CK2). I didn't play the previous of the series, but repeating the same genre to the 13th samsara apparently bores a lot of people...\n游戏乐趣、简单性和历史逻辑都相当不错，可能是这个时代我们能玩到的最好的作品了。另一方面，游戏还有RPG内容可供发掘（比P社的CK2那种，读完一篇文章作选择的，高到不知道哪里去了。）我没有玩过前作，但是重复玩同一历史内容的确是蛮蛋疼的=。=。我估计这是导致很多人不喜欢这款游戏的原因。。。\n\nA typical gameplay lasts 10-20 hrs, and it only ends the way you rule the whole country as the supreme leader, the emporor.

Generally speaking, war against AI is not hard as long as player commands, but at this stage, you will have to outnumber AI troops to win, because the player is only allowed to command the war he/she is participating.\n过快扩张会导致AI联盟反对你。一般情况下，手操打AI以少打多很容易。但是玩家不能指挥自己角色没有参加的战斗，所以这个阶段就靠运营、以多打少取胜了。\n\nBTW, this game has started a war between cultural censorship and copyright law affairs in mainland China... Although negative comments are everywhere, piracy lovers have tried hard to access... And after being told cracked games are not available anymore, they chose, well, to evoke people to report Steam of selling games, which are not issued in China, to mainland Chinese Steam-ers. Not to speak of this awful fact, I think their attempt has shown everything.\n顺便，由光荣公司和3dm撕比衍生出来正版用户和盗版用户的撕比……尽管好多地方都说这一作很坑，但是到处有人在求资源……本周3dm开始清理下载页面以后，2月5号部分盗版用户……开始发起众人举报Steam违法在中国大陆发售未经审批游戏……抛开成见不说，我认为此一现象已经是在用脚给这个游戏投票了。\n\nConsidering the negotiation between Steam and Alipay, a(/the) major web payment company in mainland China, has sloped to the abyss of non-speaking, it is maybe the time to farewell!\n考虑到V社和支付宝之间的谈判目测已经成为敏感内容，可能是时候跑路啦~~~\n\nHeil Big Brother\n大兄弟吉祥~","February 5","true","29.1"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Let me just go down the list to explain why they exisit.\nI Getting started.\n1.Yes, the $90 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by western standard. However, just letting y'all know KOEI has been setting its Japanese version PC releases of all their three kingdoms and Nobunaga series at 10,800yen since 1992 (check exchange rate yourself), so this ain't exactly new.\n2. Okay, srsly ppl. READ THE DESCRIPTION......ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOT SUPPORTED.....\nwhat does it mean? well, it's one of KOEI's simul-release, which meant english localization will have to wait, just like the previous nobunaga games. Usually within a year.\n3.Currently this game does not have a in-game option to change system interface from Japanese to Chinese and vice versa, the language displayed is based on what version of windows you're running.  Which means if you ain't running one of those two languaged OS, u will not see the uni-code specific chat log displayed correctly, and it can be really annoying, or to the point of unplayable.\n4. Obviously, you probably want to be profecient in one of those two language supported in order to play this game, otherwise you really got to have better way to blowoff 90 bucks, i mean srsly.\n5. So if you have all of the above sorted out you shouldn't have problem running and playing the game.\n\nII.Game Review\nOkay, I'm one of those KOEI OBs which have played virtually all KOEI games since its debut in the mid 1980s, and naturally I've also played all three kingdom games so I'll be reviewing this game based on how it compare to its predecessors. So keep this in mind. It is a classic JP-Grand Strategy Game, abit different and bulkier than the western counterparts made by companies such as paradox or Firaxis.\n\nSelling Point1. All character play, you get to choose any character instead of just faction leaders, the typical mix of RPG into SLG format. Again, not new, the all character play was first introduced in Romance of Three Kingdoms 7 and again later in the  much improved Romance of Three Kingdom 10. However, they have greatly enhanced inter-character relation with the so called human drama, which is a style of overall character relation map. aha, I see you're learning at last KOEI, someone definetly have played crusader king series, and yes, it's pretty freaking good.\n\nSelling Point2.Massive scale in wars. For a Three Kingdom fan such as myself, Caocao's million strong army has always been under represented in games due to system limitations in the past, not this time. For once, instead of the 5 figure soldier count battles, you get 6 figures, and might even be 7 figure in late game in the biggest military engagement in KOEI game history, and is totally well implemented with a half-real time strategy setting, so for once, it's not boring to engage in countless battles yourself instead of waiting for crappy auto-reslove. Once had 250k engaging another 140k, the immersion factor was awsome,and just when  im about to win, I suddenly realised oops, out of provision......again.....time to reload, totally worth it.\n\nBottomline\nFor once, I felt KOEI didn't just took 90bucks away from me outright. 10/10\n\n\n\n","January 29","true","42.6"," 47 of 110 people (43%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","43","47","110","9","4"

In fact, this feels more like 12 as it went back with 3D graphics and enhanced the gameplay with videos, Chinese voices, role play, battle......so much, it almost covered every aspect. It stayed true from what they are promoting. Although there are still room for improvements.\n\n-Such as the battle scene looking too rough when you zoomed right in.\n-The 3D city felt good but poorly lighted in my opinion (worse than their concept art). you couldn't really recognise each building that well.\n-UI feels clumsy, e.g. like you have to be jumped to another page for each button on creating an officer.\n\nWith that been said, there's potential to the new relationship concept. Overall so far i've really enjoyed it. They do a much better job at telling a story. I really hope they could look into those issues and continue to enhance on what they've achieved and make a much better sequel. I think most of these opinions were formed before i purchased it. I still need to dig deeper into the gameplay. Although currently it was a huge let down about the price being £68 in UK. It's a disappointment and even AAA like GTA5  or other games wouldn't come close to this without any additional stuffs. Hope they can look into it and eventually have english version here too. If they decided to have a different steam page, that might disappoint their fans outside of Asia who have already purchased their game from here.","January 28","true","15.2"," 42 of 104 people (40%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","40","42","104","6","5"

I recommend playing Nobunaga Ambition first for first timer so you will get a jist to how this game mechanic works, except this game is more complex than Nobunaga Ambition but that is all covered with the tutorial in Story mode.\nI would recommend this game. . .and for those who are skeptical I want to assure you guys that Koei never fails their fans, they will try their utmost to get an English version out I am sure of it knowing this as a Dynasty warriors fan from when it's first release on playstation 1.\nIf we from America get it and there are enough to support them, they will give us English, I'm sure of it.","January 29","true","1.4"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","5","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liu2da4rong2/recommended/363150/","liu2da4rong2","劉振雄","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liu2da4rong2/","163 products in account","So edit to my review - I'm still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cost and I can't even play the game, but it seems like Koei fixed the screen saving problem, and the streams so far have been great. You can choose basically any character to play as instead of just the country. So 10/10. Gonna stream some Diao Chan gameplay later.\n\nEdit 2 - So the game download has been fixed and now you can play the game. It's still extremely pricey, but the game itself seems to be really good quality wise. Graphical customization is still ♥♥♥♥ as per Koei, but I fixed that with some manual vsync. There are SO MANY characters, both historical and fictional, that it's just mind boggling to me. I played my very first RotTK on the original SNES. Can you believe that? This is really nostalgic for me and tbh I don't think most people should get this game if they don't already have history with the franchise, since a lot of the value derives from reliving your childhood itself. i remember being 8 years old and not having a clue wtf I was doing. That, and the very harsh fact that there is NO ENGLISH version. Yes what the store page says is correct, but there is hope. For in the Steam database there is in fact a product called Romance of the Three Kingdoms 13 - English, which most likely means it will be getting an English version somewhere down the line. Guaranteed at this point.\n\nI haven't gotten very far into the game. ♥♥♥♥, just staring at the customization menu for which scenario to pick is kind of awe inspiring in that 90's outdated gameplay mechanic sort of way. It looks very retro. Actually Nobunaga seems newer than this. Like, more modernish, idk how to describe it. Then again RotTK always felt like the "older" franchise, although Nobunaga in fact predates the first RotTK, I think RotTK has had more traction in the west comparatively speaking.\n\nI will update my review as I play. Here's to hoping for the best. Don't let the bad reviews fool you, these guys are just angry that they couldn't get in.\n\nAlso, as a piece of advice. It's not expressly stated in the store page, but if you buy the game before February 3rd, you will get 3 EXCLUSIVE SCENARIOS, the Lu Bu campaign, the Chibi campaign, and a custom Heroes campaign. These will probably be sold as separate DLCs in the future. Given the exorbitant price, I don't think it really matters though. Undoubtedly people who really want to get this game will get it.\n\nEDIT -\n\nI AM DIAO CHANA LOLOLOL leading an army to conquer all of China behld the power of pu ssi.\n\nNegative EDIT -\n\nThe Chinese voice acting leaves something to be desired. There are like, 3 different voices, with variations like "thing in throat" voice, "guy who sounds like girl trying to be a kid" voice, and "fake elderly voice". I imagine they have three middling aged guys in a room trying to cover for every character in the game. Also pretty sure all the women are voiced by the same person. I wish they had hired kids to play kids, or just age appropriate people for hteir roles you know?\n\nSUPER POSITIVE EDIT -\n\nThe units in this game know how to get up and down city walls. Holy ♥♥♥♥, CA has been working on this for years with Total War and have never been able to do this. I cannot tell you how relieved I am that my units actually follow my ♥♥♥♥ing orders instead of running through a ♥♥♥♥ing gate and up a ♥♥♥♥ing wall at the same time.","January 27","true","21.9"," 32 of 122 people (26%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","26","32","122","21","0"
