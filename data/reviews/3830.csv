It is an aging specimen, but it will forever hold a status as a highly enjoyable “cult classic.”  If it has piqued your interest, then I suggest you take a complimentary cup of Kool-Aid and join the cult… you won’t regret it.\n\nPsychonauts excels at many things.  The story, the characters, and the writing are all top-notch and well-executed.  The scenes and developments throughout the campaign are quite amusing and should keep you thoroughly entertained.  The many different characters are all interesting in their own way.  They are all splendidly eccentric and unique, if not also reminiscent of typical Saturday-morning-cartoon archetypes.  And, importantly, the voice acting is mostly decent and sufficiently holds everything else together… although it does falter slightly, on occasion.\n\nProviding setting for the narrative is a very inspired and diverse gameworld that is quite atmospheric.  The graphics used are undeniably dated and are only increasingly falling farther behind the curve; however the developers did an outstanding job of matching the environments and atmosphere to the overall soul of the game.  There is a mixture of lighthearted, noir, cartoonish, and psychedelic ambiances which really diversifies the experience as you play through the campaign.   You may not be awed by the scenery like in modern games, but you can still easily appreciate the effort that was put into the creation of the gameworld.\n\nOf course, the intriguing narrative and captivating atmosphere would be for naught if the gameplay wasn’t enjoyable.  Luckily, Psychonauts is quite fun to play.  There is a pleasant mixture of combat situations and puzzle-solving that you would expect from a game like this.  Situations can be approached by experimentation with various abilities and skills, which you unlock as you progress through the campaign.  Also, the various levels will introduce different dynamics to keep you on your toes.  There are also a ton of collectibles and many achievements to keep you busy, if you are into that kind of thing.\n\nPsychonauts can easily appeal to a wide and diverse audience.  The tone is fairly childish, but has many adult themes.  It is also a pretty easy/casual experience, so there shouldn’t be any skill issues.  It takes approximately 14 to 22 hours to complete, depending on if you strive for achievements or not.  If you like 3D action-adventure platformers, I would say this is a pretty safe bet for you.  It is also a good bet for anyone who may be interested in “seeing what the fuss is about,” as you will probably find it enjoyable once given a try.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 5, 2015","true","20.1"," 165 of 190 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","165","190","8","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Senovan/recommended/3830/","Senovan","Sir Senovan of the Holy Spear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Senovan/","988 products in account","Personally this is my favorite Double Fine game. Although it is about nine years old it still holds up as a good game with an interesting art style. Unlike most games built as an atempt at photorealism, the extremely cartoonish graphics and garish colour palette still looks good almost a decade after release. As all games from Tim Schafer the writing is magnificent, the voice acting is well done and the characters always have something important or hilarious to say. The setting of a Summer camp for Psychics not only influences the plot and gameplay but the dialogues actually sound like something children at summer camp would be saying, except that they are about the outlandish topics involved with a world surrounded by psychic weirdness. The gameplay is devided up into two sections, the overworld with some, but not much combat, sidequests, the one shop in the game, and most of the colorful non-essential dialogue, and the insides of the various character's minds. These minds serve as the various levels of the game, each with the same basic controlls but slightly different gameplay. The Meat Circus level is all about fast paced platforming, whilst Lungfishopolis is completely based on the combat system, and the Milkman level(BEST LEVEL EVER) is an old school inventory adventure puzzle mixed with a fever dream X-Files Plot. Throughout the game you gain psy powers that are used in combat and level navigation, some work as a long range attack with the need to collect ammo, and there is a bouncy ball/parachute power that makes platforming much more difficult and interesting.\n\nNow that i have sufficiently gushed about all the things i freaking love about this game it is time to get realistic and talk about the flaws. Most of these flaws have to do with the fact that this was Double Fine's first attempt at an action game. the combat can be a bit annoying with enemy spamming getting overdone at times, that being said most of the basic enemies are too easy to dispatch and clearing the room becomes simply a chore without much actual difficulty. The controlls are somewhat soft and the platforming would be vastly improved by tighter controlls to allow for fine tuned navigation. and if you watch a let's play you can see that the dificulty scale starts off low but when it does ramp up it does so without telling you and later levels,(Milkman,Meat Circus) can become frustrating and take forever to get past, not allways from dificulty of combat or platforming but in the milkman level if you do not know what you are doing it can be almost impossible to figure some of the puzzles out organically.\n\nAll that being said these flaws are really not as bad as it sounds. the increased difficulty lends less to frustraton and more to angry inspiration to just beat this next level and prove that you are better than the game. and for the milkman, a quick glance at a gameFAQ can help if you get too badlt stuck, enough people have been frustrated by the level to have wonderfull walkthroughs made to relieve the tension. in the end the story and experience is so good it makes up for any akwardness in gameplay. 8/10, This game is a love it or hate it, and i love it, fantastic but not even close to perfect.","April 3, 2014","true","13.1"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","67","73","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/recommended/3830/","BloodCultist","Creeping Flesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/","645 products in account","Psychonauts has to be one the greatest Adventure/Platformers of our time, it succeeds in achieving the best aspects of the genre. The controls are tight allowing for great platforming and visually still looks better than most games today. The Steam version of Psychonauts is brilliant, I have not experienced a single bug and it supports HD.\n\nThe exploration this game offers is top-notch, you get to explore a large camp littered with clever secrets and challenges along with some of the most insane levels. The combat is entertaining, especially since you get decent upgrades and new powers as you go along, allowing you to form more strategies so it never feels like a boring slogfest.\n\nThe art direction of Psychonauts is unlike any other game and is vibrant and unique, you have to wonder what the devs were on when making some of the characters and the sound/soundtrack do their job pretty well. The way this game progresses in terms of difficulty and design is persistent and can get fairly challenging later on in the game. The dialogue is extremely well done adding a lot of life to some of the strangest looking characters in video gaming. The game features a dark/twisted humour which adds to the hilarity of the situations you encounter.\n\nThis game gets much better the further you get, the levels get much more abstract and crazier, theres a few here which are total masterpieces and the plot is surprisingly deep for a game of this nature and extremely entertaining.\n\nThe amount of imagination put into this game is amazing, the art direction is it's own, the characters are brilliant, the level design is solid, the combat and platforming are tight, the atmosphere is effective, the humour is hilarious as hell and never feels like they tried hard to make it that way, so it doesn't feel forced like many other games that try achieve a comical effect and is loaded with charm, there really is nothing negative about this game.\n\nTo get this on Steam is a no brainer as it's an incredibly solid experience that should be experienced by anyone who appreciates Adventure and platforming games and timeless classics. Squirrels are liars.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381981602","January 26, 2015","true","30.8"," 68 of 78 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","68","78","3","0"

It's a game worth getting into though, even if your eyes might not agree with the art design. Once I got past my nitpicking, I finally gave it the shot it so very deserved. Psychonauts is a 3D platformer meets an adventure game and honestly, I had no idea about the former. As with all platformers, you'll die plenty from falling, which is partly due to a fixed camera and partly cos you suck. Then there are a couple of areas that just aren't very forgiving, but it's nothing you can't overcome. I'd say the difficulty level is just right for this sort of game, apart from the initally daunting and almost sadistic Meat Circus.\n\nIt's funny, charming and fun to explore. Finding collectibles is made enjoyable, but you'll have to look out for a Point of No Return, otherwise you won't get 100%. The music from Milla's Dance Party is still in my head, a level that reminded me of the club mission in DmC Devil May Cry. I doubt Ninja Theory were influenced by Psychonauts, these games being such opposites, nevertheless I found it amusing.\n\nFirst Double Fine/Tim Schafer game now under my belt and I'll be checking out more from them. If it weren't for the massive development budgets we have right now, we'd see more cool games like these. Games like No One Lives Forever 3, which I'm still rooting for.","June 14, 2015","true","33.2"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","47","50","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/recommended/3830/","TheCitizenErased","CitizenErased","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/","112 products in account","My previous review of this game did not do it justice since I felt it deserved better than that - I'd like to elaborate a bit further on why I love this game ever so much as one of the best innovative games/platformers of all time. Growing up with 2D and 3D platformers like Mario, Crash & Spyro I could easily adapt to the platforming of the game. The platforming itself is solid enough but the actual combat in the game, during times like Boss Battles, can be dodgy as heck if you don't have a controller in handy -- Usually because of several different buttons needed to lock-on enemies and attack or alternatively dodge incoming attacks. You have the option of changing the keys to fit a play-style suitable for yourself, but I still find it frustrating at best namely due to the several important commands required. Here's my advice: Play the game with a controller as it'll make gameplay a bit smoother. So, what makes the game exceptional? Well, first of all it's the premise. The setting is a summer school camp for psychics. The game is brought to us by none other than the master of adventure games, Tim Schäfer (Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle), whose characteristic sense of humor certainly blooms in Psychonauts. One of the long running concepts of Schäfer's style usually juxtaposes a rather mundane situation in a fantastical setting; Such as what you'd expect if Tim Burton & David Lynch teamed up for an all-wacky-superstar tag team line up movie. Which is just as well because creator Tim Schäfer has now acquired his very own Johnny Depp, in form of Jack Black, although he's absent from this game. But I digress - We play as Raz, who's chosen to flee from the circus as opposed to joining it, because being a Psychonaut is a lot more fulfilling than the circus obviously. As he gets accepted into the fold of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp he soon finds himself in the middle of a strange conspiracy, where the brains of the camp's inhabitants mysteriously vanish which leads to the game's funniest moments. The caricatures that show up in the game are so incredibly diverse and... weird? They are truly fascinating as you get to DIG your way inside their subconscious minds to discover their true hidden feelings. Essentially, Schäfer came up with the idea of Inception before... well Inception. This is the unique part of the game - The environments, atmosphere and overall feel of the inner & deepest thoughts of the camp and local areas inhabitants's minds.\n\nLet me sum up some of the fascinating characters. We have a mad dentist who harvest brains, a talking fish whose thoughts involves a sequence where you become a giant Godzilla monster terrorizing a society of talking fish, a mentally ill security guard who's lost in the mindset of a crazy pyromaniac-milkman, Napoleon Bonaparte and his dimwit descendant, An aspiring musical starlet whose cruel mother's treatment of her and eventual suicide has caused her to develop a case of bipolar disorder, a government agent who disguises himself as a housewife by brandishing a rolling pin while talking disjointedly about pies etc. These are the kind of characters you can expect alongside the campers themselves and the local counselors, whom all are very well rounded and have their own personalities. Usually they are defined by interacting with them around the camp or examining the local signs and written letters, to provide character depth. Lastly, I found myself jamming to the game's cool blues-inspired guitar stringing soundtrack. All in all It's seemingly -- Well done. If you love a good platformer, with some dodgy gameplay at times, while every now and then laughing your ♥♥♥ off and maybe, just maybe, find yourself sympathizing with some of the loonies, as you uncover their hidden feelings. Then look no further than Psychonauts! :)","December 25, 2013","true","23.0"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","43","46","0","5"

And who could have? the screenshots dont just justice at all to this game. Trailers? not much either. You have to experience the weird worlds and platforming that takes place yourself.\n\nEveryone probably has this game in their libraries but how many have actually played it? install it now and play it - with time. Don't try to half-♥♥♥ it as this title demands some effort from the player too before the hook sinks in. But once it does it sits in pretty hard. I was sold around the time i did the paranoid kids 'spy-vs-spy' kind of world and the colorful bull-run world and that was later in the game.\n\nThat's all i want to say about this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/recommended/3830/","nBnBB","[nBn] Beebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/","175 products in account","Be warned that this is an early-2000s 3d platformer and it really shows- annoying collect-a-thons and all. A controller is recommended if you have access to one- the keyboard controls work but can be a little wonky at times. Some very difficult platforming throughout brings these niggles to light and can be frustrating.\n\nWhere Psychonauts shines instead is in the hugely imaginative (literally!) world and cast of characters, who play the role of both plot progression and game world. Raz's psychic abilities allow him to enter the minds of those who let him in, in order to arrange their thoughts and solve their problems for them- learning their secrets in the meanwhile. Battle Napoleon in a giant game of Risk, help the Milkman defeat the evil girl scouts, and maybe even help Raz confront his childhood fears. Erik Wolpaw, who would later join Valve to write the Portal and Team Fortress series, lends his talents to these characters and ensures they'll leave a big impression on you. If you can forgive the difficulties with the gameplay, the humour on display here is wholly worth it.","December 28, 2015","true","24.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","3"

This game is absolutely fantastic. It's fun, it's got a great story, great characters, and hilarious (if not somewhat cheesy) dialogue.\n\nThe story is quite interesting, but it's actually really enhanced by the characters. Double Fine did an excellent job of giving every single character (yes even the minor ones) a sense of actual human personality. A 10 year old boy who's running away from the circus to become a psychic agent, a sarcastic girl with the ability to talk to plants and takes no BS from anyone, a timid, socially awkward boy who was told to go to the camp because he kept blowing up people's heads with his mind, and a plethora more of quirky characters really make the game world and gameplay twice as fun and hilarious.\n\nHowever, another thing that Double Fine did that really gave the game some depth is the subtly. If you pay close attention to each character and their dialogue, memory vaults, and figments, you can find out some surprisingly....dark things about them. Even the main character, Razputin, mentions some pretty awful things that happened to him and his family as a child. But these little things add even more character to them, it makes them feel like they could be actual people because who hasn't had bad experiences or trauma in their lives? For a lot of the young campers, how they hint at these really tragic events is very child-like of them, like how an actual kid who can't quite comprehend those kinds of things would describe or talk about them.\n\n(You can see that I love the characters in this game right?)\n\nMoving on, the combat system is a boatload of fun, with cool abilities that are decently balanced with the gameplay. You can levitate and shoot psychic blasts of energy at your enemies, light almost every living thing on fire, and a bunch more cool things that are required to progress through different levels of the game. Speaking of the game levels, they're coloful and vary from each person's mind you enter, with different bosses and NPCs as well as the variety of different objects and missions that really tell you about the personality of the person's mentality.\n\nHowever, there does tend to be a bit of vagueness in certain levels where I'd get stuck because there was no clear objective or direction to what I was trying to do. At times it was more frustrating than other levels and if you've ever heard of the infamous last level of this game, the difficulty curve just spikes suddenly with how ridiculously hard and unforgiving it can be (and this version on Steam is the easier version of it!). But nonetheless, it kept me playing the game in a raging "I'm going to beat this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level so help me" kind of way.\n\nI will say if you're a person who goes for 100% completion or achievements, good luck to you. There's hundreds of these things in the game called figments (like figments of one's imagination) and in some levels they're placed in ridiculously hard to find places. I'm not a person who really cares for those things as much so it never bothered me, but I can definately see how it would irritate some people who either really hate collecting.\n\nBut aside from those little nitpicks and some level frustrations, I absolutely adore this game (and am currently restarting it) and would reccommend it to as many people as possible so Double Fine can come out with a sequel for it already!","June 20, 2015","true","33.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

A game that is worthy of all the praises it got in the past years.\n\nLong version:When Tim Schafer started his own company, Double Fine, in 2001, he was mostly known as the somewhat eccentric designer behind the greatest LucasArts adventures. So when their first title, Psychonauts, was finally released in 2005, it was a surprise to see it commercially fail despite the great reviews.\nAlthough the game eventually gained the following it deserves, it is easy to understand the initial troubles: on the surface, it looks like a typical early 2000s 3D puzzle platformer with 90s kids’ movie stereotype characters drawn as Nickelodeon figures. It took years to finally understand that its greatness lies under the hood.\n\nFor starters, there is the plot. Initially, it seems like a summer camp movie about kids who have psychic powers, but as the story goes on, we learn that this movie was apparently directed by Tim Burton, as it slowly turns into a (kid-friendly) nightmare world for our brave protagonist, the somewhat clichéd sassy tough kid Rasputin.\n\nThis change in atmosphere is anything but subtle, as the game world moves from a somewhat serene campground to a creepy island asylum. Both of these serve mostly as an overworld that ties together the actual levels, all set in the mindscape, the psyche of certain characters.\nThese levels are the main reason behind the late-coming success of Psychonauts. Each offers something brand new game mechanic, ranging from simple platforming to almost point ‘n’ click levels of story-driven puzzle solving. They delve deep in the minds of a character, utilising this to its full extent to tell us an interesting, often bittersweet tale, showing us the full capabilities of the storywriting strength Double Fine could deliver.","May 11","true","26.9"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","2"

This game is probably one of the most creative and artful games ever made. In this game, you are a character named Razputin and you need to travel through people's brains in order to solve their problems and whatnot. Each brain (world) is completely different and can be pretty weird. A world takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete most of the time, more if you're wasting your time somewhere or trying to solve a puzzle (yes, there are a few puzzles, but they aren't very difficult and give you hints all the time). The game itself isn't super long, you can finish it within 20 hours, probably around 5 if you're replaying the game (it took me 17 hours). You also get upgrades in your journey which let you use special powers (levitation, shooting fire, etc.)\n\nThis game is gold. It has great writing and some bizarre humour, excellent voice acting, beautiful environments, good character design, and an awesome soundtrack. On the negative side, the camera can get annoying sometimes and the story continuity kinda drops near the end of the game. Other than that, it's a game that you should definitely try (you can also get in on Xbox Live or the new Mac version) and that is worth every penny. I honestly wish this game got a sequel though. Awesome game, totally recommend to absolutely anyone.","June 2, 2015","true","17.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

But beyond that, the art style and general gameplay is wonderful.\n\nThe game offers a classic platformer in a beautiful and unique visual style, that quickly goes from calm and peaceful to dark and gloomy. Initially the story starts off very much aimed towards children, but as the game progresses it becomes more about immaturity than childishness, and during certain parts of the game you might even find yourself wondering "Who is this game actually geared towards?!" (Spoilers: Madman stealing brains. Lots of kids burned to death. Suicidal/Sadistic/Murdering campmates. And more psychopathic nonsense.) The general story is humorous, surreal, cute, psychopathic, dark and immature, the tone of the game changes on a second's notice and takes you through dozens of surrealistic worlds, all with their unique charm and mood, much like the various characters you will meet throughout it.\n\nIt is by far one of my all-time favorite Double-Fine games.","April 18, 2014","true","27.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","21","24","6","0"

It would make sense if I used this ability!". Should you ever feel stumped on a problem, you could always ask Ford Cruller for advice by summoning him with bacon.\n\nThe writing can be really humorous at times and all the characters are very interesting in both design and personality.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/3830/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.\n\nPsychonauts is a quirky, offbeat game set in a special summer camp for clairvoyant kids, in which a group of psychic children end up in a wacky adventure filled with brain-stealing hijinks, psychic secret agents, and a little romance on top of everything else. It's rooted in the sorts of 3D platforming sensibilities we've all come to know over the years. But there's a SPIN to the game--its psychic theme--which adds some cool puzzle-solving to the usual platform-jumping and swinging associated with the genre. Psychonauts also bears the unmistakable mark of designer Tim Schafer (known for classic adventure games Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, and Day of the Tentacle), thanks to a hilarious array of peculiar characters and a story that never fails to entertain. Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.\n\nIt took four years and two publishers, but Psychonauts is finally here, and no worse for the wear, it seems.\nThe heart and soul of Psychonauts is Razputin--or, Raz, for short--a big-headed, goggle-sporting psychic prodigy who sneaks his way into a mysterious summer camp that happens to be a training ground for the titular psychonauts, a group of psychic secret agents. Raz, it seems, has run away from his home in the circus and wants to become a psychonaut himself. Grudgingly, the counselors of the camp accept Raz into the group (albeit only for a day, until his father can come get him and take him home). However, it doesn't take long for strange things to start happening around camp. Raz, as well as other children, find that they're suffering from similar nightmares. Strange psychic interference seems to be POPPING UP all over the place, and not long after that, the brains of the other campers start disappearing, leaving the campers as soulless, TV-obsessed husks. As the hero of the story, Raz is on a mission to solve these various mysteries and uncover the crazy conspiracy behind it all.\n\nThe basic plot itself reads like typical platformer fodder, but there's a lot more to Psychonauts' story than can be summed up in a single paragraph. This is largely due to the game's bizarre cast of characters, of which there are many. Raz himself is a highly likable hero; he's cute, heroic, funny, and also a little awkward at times. He fits the bill of the overenthusiastic yet not-quite-ready hero to the letter and it's hard not to feel sympathetic to his plight. But beyond Raz, there's a great supporting cast, with roughly two dozen other characters who play parts both large and small in the story. The counselors consist of Coach Oleander, an overly aggressive drill sergeant; Milla Vodello, a somewhat ditzy and party-happy go-go girl; Agent Nein, a pale-skinned, sweater-sporting scientist of indeterminate Eastern European origin; and Ford Cruller, a mysterious old man who seems to exist in about eight different places at once. These counselors join the crazy array of campers, as well as other strange people and creatures you'll encounter, to drive the storyline, and thanks to the game's excellent design, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to get ATTACHED to them.\n\nInitially, Psychonauts feels like a very open-ended game, especially because upon your first venture into the camp area, you'll find yourself able to just wander around, chatting it up with other campers or even just listening in on their completely INSANE conversations. The camp and its many areas make up a hub world, where you can access lots of different things, including a camp store, where you can buy helpful items, an underground tram that cuts down on backtracking, and all sorts of little hidden areas that yield bonus items. However, the biggest boon for the camp world is all the little bouts of dialogue you can discover. Depending on what stage of the game you're at, the conversations change up quite a bit, meaning you're not often going to hear a lot of repeats. This is great, especially because there's just so much of the dialogue. In some instances, you can literally just stand next to a pair of characters while they converse for about five minutes or longer and never hear the same line twice. And it's almost always really funny stuff.\n\nHowever, the most interesting aspects of Psychonauts' characters don't come from their real-world conversations, but rather from their internal monologue. As Psychonauts revolves around a bunch of psychics, the bulk of your time will be spent traversing the perils of people's minds. This is where Psychonauts truly shines. You'll be able to enter the minds of more than a dozen different characters in the game, and each mind serves as one of its main levels. Each level is completely unique. For instance, when you enter the head of Coach Oleander, you'll find a war-torn landscape filled with constant explosions, plants made out of ammunition, and, for reasons not immediately apparent, lots and lots of meat. In another example, you enter the mind of a crazed security guard named Boyd Cooper, who is utterly obsessed with nonsensical conspiracies and someone called "The Milkman." His mental landscape looks like a 1950s-era suburban neighborhood that's been picked up by a pair of hands, twisted into a topsy-turvy fun house, and occupied exclusively by shadowy agents in TRENCH COATS who try to convince you that they're just simple street workers, or hedge trimmers, or grieving widows, despite their obviously ulterior motives. It's all totally weird, but also undeniably unique.\n\nNo two minds are exactly alike in Psychonauts, both aesthetically and in terms of gameplay. Granted, you will be spending at least some of YOUR time in each level engaging in the usual platforming shenanigans, like jumping and double-jumping over platforms, swinging from poles, walking tightropes, and so on. When the game is in full-on platformer mode, it plays very well. The controls are tight, the camera is rarely ever a problem, and it's generally pretty easy to get Raz around without screwing up, at least on the Xbox. The PC version controls well enough too, provided of course you have a good USB controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls just don't feel right for this type of game (and even with a USB controller, camera control can be a bit of a pain). If there's any one criticism to be mounted here across both platforms, it's that the game is rarely ever that difficult, save for a few specific parts that are actually quite tough. You can't call the game a total breeze, either, but most experienced players shouldn't have any problems mastering the basic play mechanics pretty quickly.\n\nThe inside of a person's mind can be a pretty crazy place.\nEven though the game isn't particularly hard, at least it's not repetitive. The goals and challenges of each level are totally exclusive. In one level, you'll find yourself playing a bizarre board game against a mental projection of Napoleon Bonaparte. You'll shrink down to "fun size" to recruit new pieces to YOUR cause, and then you'll return to your normal size so that you can move them around. In another level, you're fighting neon-tinted luchadores and a big, hulking bull in what looks like a velvet painting of a congested Spanish city. It's with this kind of variety that Psychonauts manages to achieve its high level of quality.\n\nIt also helps that the game has more to it than just a lot of jumping around. There are puzzles to be solved in Psychonauts, as well as battles to be fought, and both require use of Raz's list of crazy psychic powers. You start out only with a basic melee attack at your disposal, but as you play and collect items scattered about both the real world and mental worlds, you'll be able to upgrade Raz's rank and earn new powers, like telekinesis. 84/100","June 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","17","27","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rorulon/recommended/3830/","rorulon","Young Steev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rorulon/","244 products in account","The good -\n- A funny, original story with good voice acting and genuinely funny dialogue throughout. Can be childish at times, but it fits with the humor and juxtaposes well with some of the darker and more mature elements.\n- Great art direction, despite its age the graphics still don't look dated and fit with the look and feel of the game perfectly. The character design tends more towards cartoony characters whose appearance give you a good outline of their personality, and the environments vary widely from traditional platformer areas to mind bending levels that twist and turn through every axis.\n- Tight platformer mechanics, moving around and exploring the environments is easy and encouraged thanks to loads of hidden collectables. Its easy to keep track of your progress, and constantly unlocking something new, or being just about to, will keep you playing that one more level.\n\nThe bad -\n- Occasional problems with the camera, the usual having to wrestle it under control from a preset position. Part and parcel of 3D platformers ported from consoles.\n- Some of the latter levels have some downright unfair sections with long runs between checkpoints and unforgiving level design that can become quite frustrating.\n- Optimization problems with Windows 7. There are loads of threads all over the net complaining of crashes and freeze-ups, which seem to only occur on Windows 7. True, running the game in compatibility mode (I used Windows 95) solves this issue but it seems like a glaring problem for a game on Steam, no matter how old.\n\nPersonal Highlights (contains level spoilers, no storyline spoilers) -\n- Lungfishopolis - Destroying a city populated by fish as a giant Kaiju Theatre version of yourself. Complete with gameplay being interrupted by news flashes as the fish report on your rampage of destruction.\n- The Milkman Conspiracy - One of the most head bending levels I've seen in a platformer in recent times.\n- Razputin (the main character) is voiced brilliantly by Richard Horvitz (the voice of Invader Zim). YMMV on this one, but as a fan of the show I loved hearing the distinctive voice throughout.\n\nSummary -\nWon't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like platformers and adventure games, Psychonauts is an excellent example of an original and unique take on the genre. It's fun to play, memorable in both its level design and its story, and, frankly, there's not much out there (especially recently) that compares to it. Let down by minor problems that plague many console to PC ports, but they don't hamper it enough to be a standout game.\n\n9/10\n\nContext - 9\nChallenge - 8\nCatharsis - 8","January 3, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You take the place of Rasputin (which I hoped was going to be the russian leader, but whatever) who has a mysterious past that I will not spoil, as you learn about it as you go on. You end up into a camp for "psychics," and unlike the other psychics, these guys are the real deal. You battle enemies by not just fighting them up front, but by going into their mind and fighting their demons. I can't wait to play more, as even the tutorial level is genius, with a general with a mind full of a whole boot camp.\n\nI never did play this game when it was released, but these graphics are still hold up very well, and the voice acting is amazing, especially the general of the camp. The only voice that was a little annoying was Rasputin's, but that might just be a personal preference.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, and made me wanted to explore around the world the most I could to collect arrowheads, almost like a Banjo Kazooie game. In fact, the entire game reminds me of a remix on Banjo Kazooie, which, now that I think about it, is genius.\n\nAll in all: with the sale for it being only 2 dollars, it is an absolute buy.\nRating: 9.7/10","December 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalladiumPoison/recommended/3830/","PalladiumPoison","JigglyBits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalladiumPoison/","24 products in account","I recommend this game tentatively.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful and Unique Art Style. It reminds me a bit of Invader Zim, but not so much so that I'd declare it a plain rip off.\n- Intricate and Masterful storytelling. The plot is interesting and keeps me coming back for more. I'm never just slogging through something hoping for a payoff. It's all a genuinely fun story.\n- Likable characters. Even the characters who barely get screen time or have no lines seem to be overflowing with personality. They feel very real, despite being so stylized.\n- Fun game mechanics. The psychic abilities are endlessly fun. Levitation is my absolute favorite, mainly because it frees up the movement of your character a lot, but there are several other abilities I really love. On top of being fun, they're necessary. Once a mechanic is introduced, they always give you a reason to use it. While you may eventually stop using it as often, it'll always come back a few more times.\n- Dialogue is witty and hilarious. It's not forced comedy like I see a lot of comedy games try to do. It's just funny, in a really natural way, and I found myself actually laughing out loud. Even jokes that fall flat were meant to do so, because the fact that the joke wasn't funny is part of the joke itself.\n- The vaults are probably my favorite part of the game. They're a sort of slide show deal, and there are usually two in every level. They're in depth explanations of certain points of that character's life, and they're a joy every time.\n- Bosses are challenging, but not impossible. They're all unique and just so fun.\n\nCons:\n- The technology is from the PS2 era, and it shows. Some of the graphics are painfully outdated, and the pitful camera movement is a relic. You have to control the camera movement separately with your mouse, and it can tend to get frustrating during intense fights, trying to control the camera, move your character and target enemies.\n- Strange difficulty curve. The entire first section of the game is tutorials (understandably, considering the huge assortment of psychic abilities and mechanics they're trying to introduce) and at some point in the second half it suddenly jumps up to being extremely hard. I had to resort to a few lets plays at some parts because it was just so obtuse what you were supposed to be doing.\n- Figments and arrowheads were ridiculously annoying. Figments are somewhat transparent, so they tend to blend into the highly stylized backgrounds, making it almost impossible to know where they are at times. As for the arrowheads, they're practically everywhere, but at times the game demands you actively dig them up which just wasn't fun at all.\n- CRASHING. Good god, the crashing. At time of writing, the game has crashed at least 4 or 5 times today, which is why I'm writing this review now, hoping if I let it throw it's little tantrum for about half an hour it'll decide to work so I can continue playing. Perhaps it's just the computer I'm running it on (It's not really a gaming PC, but it is a high powered Mac) but it takes something away from the game when I'm saving every two steps in case the game decides to suddenly freeze and crash.\n\n\nOverall, I recommend it to anyone who wants to try something entirely new and different. It's a purely fun experience with a few technical issues that tend to drag it down at points. Despite the crashing and a few nit picky issues, I will continue playing it because I'm so invested, but if you don't think you could handle that, or don't have the patience for such a thing, I'd only recommend buying it on sale.","May 26, 2015","true","21.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It brings me back to games being $30 a pop, and aimed towards style rather than realism. This is a perfect example of a memorable old game. Like many, it's been forgotten over time. I never even played it till i saw it on steam! (mostly because I could never find a copy) But seriously:\n\nThe art is fantastic, I really love the detail put into the character models and the different stylizations of each level. The voice acting is pretty great, I especially love Raz and Lili's. The story's fantastic! It has it's comedy elements, over all a nice little story, but if you search deep enough you can find a few deep dark secrets... The gameplay is solid, I rarely had issues.\n\nThe only problem I can say with the game is that sometimes Figments are hard to spot. Figments aren't required to complete the game, but they're more so a treasure hunt item so it doesn't matter unless you want to 100% the game. Either way I think you'll enjoy it even if you have to go figment hunting!","April 28, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They don't usually show off the game for what it really is, nor show its true potential. Just from the trailer, I didn't think this was something I would ever play, but I got it in a bundle and it’s actually an amazing game.\nLike any good game, some parts can be frustrating, but it’s all part of the fun. Because it wasn’t the kind of frustration for me that made me want to give up, more so the kind you want to keep trying again, and then when you do succeed, you feel like you've accomplished something. The story is quite quirky and fun, the dialog can be really humorous at times as well, at least to me. You can definitely tell the creative team of double fine are behind it, there is fun characters to interact with and fun little stories to unfold behind each one. Also, there is a lot of collectables and little Easter eggs to find in the game. It’s not one of those games that it seems like a chore to do, for me it was actually fun. But then again, I do like my collectables in games.\nAll in all, I think it’s an amazing game, it’s definitely worth buying, if I didn't get it in a bundle, I would very happily of spent the money on it knowing now how good it is. I even liked it so much as to go back after my first play through and complete it 100%, achievements and all. Which took around 2 and a half playthroughs, it was a lot of fun. Even though I’ve finished it, I can still see myself going back and playing it again in the future. It’s a very enjoyable game, and I’m glad that I did end up playing it, despite what the trailer made me originally think.","February 25, 2013","true","49.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(or not, i'm going to say it anyways), it's totally fun, and really really creative, its fun to play and to progress, funny dialogues, bizarre moments and characters, sometimes you'll get some sad backstory coming from every character.\n\nAlso, to keep in mind this: It's not a kids game. Neither +5, neither +10 or +13, despite the art, it has a lot of humour and dialogues that can be only taken serious or get a pun from the game if you're Teen/Adult, sure, a kid can play the game, but only to play, and follow some cliché things from every story of this kind.\n\nNow like every game, there is no perfection whatsoever.\n\nBy this i mean, there are some bugs or mechanisms that are quite annoying in some point in the gameplay, sometimes you'll fall down, sometimes you won't grab a ledge, usually you'll touch A LOT of invisible walls, and there are some puzzles that are quite overthinked, or the only way to get the puzzle right it's going with the trial-n-error method, WHICH can take a lot of time and it will turn to be a bit boring, but once you get that right you'll feel really good.\n\nCharacters are sure as hell NOT forgettable, they are distinguishable and special, really creative ways to play and make a nice but simple plot.\n\nIn terms of port, you'll suffer some FPS drops in the mean time but they are really random, unless, of course, you use a FPS-locker program, because it lacks of FPS lock, so you will probably get 40 fps and then 80 fps but then 20 fps.\n\nAlso, one more thing, it also lacks of controller support, but thanks to the internet, you'll get that done boy, with this guide\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=spanish&id=256290412\n\nThanks for the respective owners of every link, program and guide.\n\nAnyways, if you got here looking for a new game, i can guarnatee that you'll like this game, it has replayability, really.\n\nSee ya! and good luck out there","December 7, 2015","true","18.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/recommended/3830/","blaxpirit","BlaXpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/","516 products in account","I'm just gonna go ahead and call this game a "classic", "must-play".\nSo, the idea is your character has different 'psychic' powers. The most basic one is double-jumping, and you gradually learn many other ones (some examples are shooting, moving stuff with your mind, burning stuff, seeing things how others' see them). They are complemented with various items, gadgets. All these are used in battle, but, more importantly, for solving puzzles, which will surprise you with their originality. If you pay attention, you will notice hints subtly hidden in what the characters say. And if you need more help, you can always call your scizophrenic mentor using a piece of bacon... yeah.\nThere is also a lot of acrobatics involved. Jumping, floating, various interactions with platforms, poles, ropes, ledges, etc.\nA lot of stuff is frankly weird (and may creep you out if you're very sensitive), because often the action takes place inside other characters' imagination (many of them crazy, like in the asylum where you help the patients overcome their problems). Sometimes space/gravity is bent, which is also a nice addition to gameplay.\nAll the levels are different and unique in some way.\nThe story takes about 15 hours. And that's the minimal amount of time you will need to complete it (at least if you're not intentionally going as quick as possible). There is tons of content. Because there is a concept similar to "experience" and "levels" (which only let you unlock more powers - nothing like the usual RPGs), you can go at your own pace and complete as many side quests (which are usually tied to exploration of the game world) as you want. There is almost no grinding involved.\n\n★★★★★★★★★☆","February 13, 2014","true","16.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As he ventures through the camp grounds completing task for his councilors, he stumbles upon something that could mean the end of the world. Through many obstacles and enemies, you must find a way to stop this calamity from happening all before you are picked up from camp.

The story of Raz and his adventure in a camp for psychics is both charming and at times extremely disturbing, but from beginning to end you can really tell just how much the writers poured their hearts into each and every line.\n\nThe gameplay isn't as original, falling in line with most other platformers in terms of mechanics, though the controls do leave a bit to be desired. The levels on the other hand are some of the most bizarre and interesting I've seen in any game, a few harkening back to Double Fine's adventure game roots with some clever puzzles to mix things up.\n\nEverything is brought together with a fantastic art direction. If Tim Burton and Pixar had a lovechild, it would look like Psychonauts. The music is memorable, the voice acting top notch, and overall it is simply a marvelous game that I can recommend to any fan of Double Fine or just 3D platformers in general!","June 25, 2013","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","5"

Psychonauts is a bundle of joy and love.\n\nThere is nothing I dislike about this game, at all. I used to play a lot of funny platforming game years and years ago, but don't as much now. I loved playing things like Crash Bandicoot or, going back further generations, to things like Earthworm Jim. When it comes to weird humor though, Psychonauts is probably the top.\n\nThe story of Psychonauts starts out simple but gets significantly more involved as it goes along, getting decently complex as things actually become a mystery. But the way of solving the puzzles is the best. Delving into the minds of different characters along the way, using their thoughts as levels, is awesome. Each stage in the game is so unique and interesting that I will replay them all forever. All of the characters are so interesting and have their own ticks, and the graphics and sounds (including voice acting) are so well-done. Nothing is wrong at all with the design.\n\nRaz, your character, gets interesting power-ups along the way, making exploration fun and opening up random puzzles. Finding the easter eggs in the levels is fun, from the basic collectibles (enabling you to buy upgrades) to especially the memories. The most stand-out ones for me are in Milla's mind, but just about all of them are rewarding in some way.\n\nThe platforming itself is clean and not too frustrating, though some levels take a bit of adjusting to, such as the angles in the Milkman stage. And exploring outside of the levels is just as fun because Double Fine developed the world with lots of detail. Wandering around and finding some little incidental cutscene is great, especially since nearly everything in the game is really funny and off-the-wall.\n\nIf you don't find the game's sense of humor enjoyable, then that's a shame. But I have to say that this game is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lrflew/recommended/3830/","lrflew","LRFLEW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lrflew/","435 products in account","TL;DR: A great story with good gameplay. I recommend you play it, but SPECIFICALLY on Windows, with an Xbox 360 Controller, and with the Psychopad mod.\n\nPsychonauts was the first game that I ever bought (with money) on my Steam account. After hearing good reviews (such as the one from Yahtzee on Zero Punctuation), I had decided to pick it up. In the end, I'd consider it one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nThe core gameplay actually feels a lot like a 3D Mario game. It's a 3rd Person 3D Platformer with some fairly intricate platforming. This difficulty is a little on the tough side, but it never really feels vicious other than the last level of the game. The game gives you a double jump from the beginning of the game, which makes the platforming a bit easier, and about a third of the way through the game, it gives you an ability that allows you to fall slower, which makes some of the later-game platforming more bearable. Your main attack is a punch that has a fairly large range. You also gain abilities as you progress though the game that allow you to attack from more of a distance. For these abilities, the game gives you a lock-on system that is very similar to Zelda's Z-Targeting. This usually works well, but can get frustrating at times when there are a lot of enemies on the screen at once.\n\nThe level design in this game is excellent. The story behind the levels is that you are entering the minds of different characters, so each level is designed to represent that character's psyche. Because all of the characters you enter the minds of are well characterized, each level is itself a strong representation of the characters. The most interesting levels are correlated to the most interesting characters, with Boyd's level being particularly famous. There are hidden memory vaults, along with scripted events and cutscenes in the levels that help to further characterize the people who's minds you enter, helping to create a better overall connection between the levels you play in and the story that moves the game along.\n\nThe story in the game is fantastic. You play a psychic boy named Raz who runs away from home (which happens to be a circus), to sneak into a summer camp that trains psychic kids to try to make them "psychic secret agents" called psychonauts. He discovers a conspiracy that threatens the entire camp, and it's up to Raz to save the camp. All the characters that you meet in the game are all well characterized, and makes the story much more interesting. The game has a lot of humor in it, and Double Fine has done a good job of making sure the jokes actually work. Psychonauts is one of the funniest games I've ever played.\n\nOne aspect of the game that I didn't really like was the leveling system. There are a number of collectables scattered throughout the game (both in the levels and the overworked) that increase your level, and leveling up gives you a few required abilities (for the first few level tiers), then upgrades your existing abilities. Some of these upgrades actually makes the game a LOT easier, meaning that if you don't go out of your way to find these collectables, the game can be much more difficult. However, replaying the game to get 100% of the collectables is a lot of fun. Once you complete the story once, it's a lot of fun to restart the game and aim to get 100% of the collectables and achievements.\n\nThis game can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, but the later two ports are actually pretty broken. I played the Mac version first, and I experienced serious performance issues, multiple graphics issues, and crashes. From what I've heard, the linux version doesn't fair much better than the Mac version. While the Windows version isn't perfect, it is certainly better than the other two. You can try to get it to run under Wine, but I can't make any promises about how well that will work.\n\nThe keyboard+mouse controls for this game really suck. The game was designed around a controller, so you should play it with one. I recommend the 360 controller because the game has controller mapping and vibration support for it. If you have a wireless 360 controller already, just get a cheap Chinese knock-off of the wireless receiver (I can find them for around $10 USD) and force Windows to use the official drivers for it in the Device Manager. The game won't have the button prompts for the controller unless you use the Psychopad mod to add them. Be sure to turn off Steam Cloud Sync before running the patcher though, or the controls may be remapped in such a way to prevent the button prompts from appearing.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend this game. I consider this game to be one of my favorite games of all time, and for good reason. It's gameplay is fun, it's story is amazing, and I will always enjoy going back and replaying the game. If you haven't played this game, then you should play it.","September 7, 2015","true","108.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, the game sold fairly poor on release, so a sequel to this game ever being created is unlikely, which makes the ending even more bittersweet.

Raz's ability to penetrate the minds of others creates for a varied and wild experience as each platforming level offers it own unique flavor. My only complaint is that cccassionally the "cute" is broken when Raz gets a bit off-color in his commentary towards the end of the game ... oh, and that they haven't developed a psyquel yet.

Having played Psychonauts apparently makes a person something of a gaming historian. So... I had to try it!\n\nWhile Psychonauts is a true original, it's not without flaws: cut scenes that go on forever; a bizarre lives/hit points system that serves no purpose; a story that wanders about and distracts from the imaginative gameplay; a brutal difficulty curve in the final 3 hours.\n\nStill, give it a try. There's nothing else quite like it, and in today's gaming landscape, that alone makes it worth a look.\n\nLastly: Be aware that Double Fine updated this game in 2011 to improve the gameplay on PC, and released a Mac port, too. 5 years after the original release.

As you can imagine, this leads to some interesting visual design choices and a lot of laughs to boot.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, Raz handles pretty well. One downside is that you can only have 3 abilities mapped to buttons at any one time and so you will be switching these constantly depending on the situation.

Psychonauts is one of those gems you most likely have missed out on. It pulls you through your "victims" brain and you see the world as they see it. This makes the world look brilliantly different when considering that some of the brain-owners are slightly or completely insane. I would play it just for the strange setting and the sheer weirdness of the worlds. At the bottom of it all, it is a semi action-adventure-platformer which utilizes "spells"(or rather "brain spells" such as telekinesis) to get to the objective. If you are even remotely interested in either platformers or adventure games you should already have played this game. Only bad things I can come to think of is that the camera is a bit wonky at times(which sadly was the case for all 3d platformers back when this was released), the difficulty sort of explodes at a certain point in the game(in other words; it's not a natural evolving difficulty curve), and\n\n(SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!! SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!!)\nTowards the end you are locked inside the brain dimension due to actions taken in the outside world.  This makes it impossible to get the remaining collectible items if you are into that sort of things.\n(END SLIGHT SPOILER! END SLIGHT SPOILER!)\n\nAll in all it's an amazing game and you can get it for under 10€ which makes it a bargain.\nGet it, play it, love it.

This is only alleviated by the game autosaving at every loading screen so the player loses no progress.\n-The arrowhead currency is mostly useless except the two times the player is forced to hunt for them to buy an item in order to progress with the game. One of these two items is a dousing rod that only helps find more arrowheads to save up for the more expensive plot-related item.\n\nAgain, even with the near-useless upgrades and powers, the forced hunting of arrowheads, and constant crashing Psychonauts is worth a play. The characters are interesting, the story is satsifying and not even a slightly lackluster platforming experience can detract from that.","June 10, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.","January 31, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, the game sold fairly poor on release, so a sequel to this game ever being created is unlikely, which makes the ending even more bittersweet.

If you're planning on buying this wait until it's on crazy sale (Bought my copy when it was going for practically 1.75$ CAN ) because around the halfway point when there's not much left to learn the game gets MAD difficult, and if you buy it for the 9.99$ current full price, you might feel like you have wasted your money.\n\nBesides that, who honestly doesn't want to fool (Without spoiling anything) agents into thinking you're one of them? Or become Godzilla? Of hell, simply light things on fire? This game really has it all in lue of imagenation (Here's looking at you Godzilla level that took me forever).

Okay enough with the gushing. Ths game is not as hyped as it should be. Double fine and Tim Schafer are quite good and imaginative and that is most apparent in games like this one and Brutal Legend (which i love as well). Originally PS2 era, the steam port is not that bad. A controler wouldn't hurt becuase some of the platforming is a bit annoying with keyboard and mouse. The story? You play Razputin (or just Raz) who sneaks away from his circus life to attend a summer camp for a group of traniee psychic agents known as "Psychonauts". Raz's family, especially his father, are heavily opposed to pyschics, seeing as a pyschic cursred Raz's grand father to drown in  water, thus starting the belief that all in Raz's family share the curse. Wanting to break away from his circus life, he decides to join the psychonauts, who have the ability to enter different worlds in different people's minds. The world's are very creative, my favorite world is Black Veletopia becuase the colors were so great to look at. behind the game's quirky exterior, lies characters who have deep backgrounds and personaities that are hard to forget. This game is pretty under-rated and is worth a pick up.

Okay enough with the gushing. Ths game is not as hyped as it should be. Double fine and Tim Schafer are quite good and imaginative and that is most apparent in games like this one and Brutal Legend (which i love as well). Originally PS2 era, the steam port is not that bad. A controler wouldn't hurt becuase some of the platforming is a bit annoying with keyboard and mouse. The story? You play Razputin (or just Raz) who sneaks away from his circus life to attend a summer camp for a group of traniee psychic agents known as "Psychonauts". Raz's family, especially his father, are heavily opposed to pyschics, seeing as a pyschic cursred Raz's grand father to drown in  water, thus starting the belief that all in Raz's family share the curse. Wanting to break away from his circus life, he decides to join the psychonauts, who have the ability to enter different worlds in different people's minds. The world's are very creative, my favorite world is Black Veletopia becuase the colors were so great to look at. behind the game's quirky exterior, lies characters who have deep backgrounds and personaities that are hard to forget. This game is pretty under-rated and is worth a pick up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicHamster/recommended/3830/","EpicHamster","Hamaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicHamster/","182 products in account","Let me just start off with saying, that i LOVE this game. I have played it through 4 times now and i recently picked it up on steam and 100% completed the game. The story is very interesting and somewhat original. A lot of people say, that the game hasn't aged well, but the cartoony and sometimes dodgy graphics somehow appeal to me more than modern games. I do agree, that the controls are a bit akward without a contoler, but you can get used to them.\n\nThe most important aspect about this game to me is that it scratches an itch... The countles collectibles are not obligatory to collect, but the ranking sistem makes them very rewarding. The feeling that you get after collecting every figment in a level is great and you feel like you have achieved something. (figments are one of the collectible and often hard to notice 2D models that make levels look full and colorfull)\n\nLastly i want to talk about the music. In my oppinion it is very well made and fits in the rather bizzare world of the game very well. I was very happy when i had the chance to get the official sountracks from the Humble Bundle.\n\nThis game is a lovely little gem from the 2005 and it's well worth its price. I can't recommend this game enough.","February 9, 2014","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b1ll1amh/recommended/3830/","b1ll1amh","B1ll1amH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b1ll1amh/","138 products in account","I've never seen people clamor so hard for a sequel as in the case of Psychonauts. The constant hype and praise heaped onto the game can give people unrealistic expectations and keep them away from it, which is a shame. Before I go into trying to convince you to give it a chance, though, I should point out that it is not a perfect game (while keeping spoilers to a minimum).\n\n• As a previous-gen title, the graphics in Psychonauts aren't stellar. They're fine enough to my eyes, but the blurry textures might discourage some.\n• The PC version is pretty much unplayable without a controller. More on that at the end of this review.\n• There's a notorious difficulty curve, though less so if you've played other 3D platformers. You'll spend a bit getting used to the controls and game mechanics, sail smooth for the majority of the game (sometimes being thrown a hard puzzle or boss fight), then spend the last level with half your bloodstream composed of adrenaline as you're forced to use everything you've learned under stressful circumstances. The achievement for the last level got its name for a reason.\n\nOkay, now I can gush and tell you why you SHOULD play this:\n\n• It's funny! I laugh at the same jokes I did when I played it on Xbox years ago, and then some since I'm old enough to understand more of them.\n• Assuming you're using a controller, the gameplay is flawless. Though you might be tempted to blame the game when you fall or tumble, the acrobatics are of the highest quality, which you would hope for in a platformer.\n• The story. I won't go into details here, since it's more fun to let you find it all out for yourself. The Steam product description provides a nice teaser, but it's only a small part of the tale.\n• The characters. Oh boy, this'll be the big bullet point. You wonder why people beg so much for a sequel? This is why. Whispering Rock is a summer camp filled with kids and (technically) employees, with personalities all their own. When I say that the description is only a small part, this is what I'm talking about. Almost all of the characters grow as people through the course of the game's events, and watching them do so is half the fun. Between levels (hell, before you start the first one), you'll want to wander around the campground for a bit and talk to the kids. Pretty much all of them have their own tiny subplots, even if they're just a handful of dialogue spaced out by an hour or two. A band tries to get off the ground, young love is in the air, and boys become men. They're all as compelling. But talking sometimes isn't enough. Some people have their traumatic secrets locked away, and you'll have to seek them out in the darkest corners of their minds.\n• The levels. This is another area where the game shines. Just like the people and their minds in which you'll find these lands, no two are alike. Again, I'd rather let you find this all out for yourself, but if playing through a Godzilla parody and defeating Napoleon Bonaparte at his own game don't sound appealing, this probably isn't for you.\n\nI could probably go on and find more to talk about, but then I'd be contributing to the problem of overhyping the game. It's not for no reason, though. In an industry where the best-selling game are first-person shooters, devoid of atmosphere, denied color, and depicting swaths of people getting killed in massive conflicts, Psychonauts is the antithesis. It's a tribute to childhood adventure presented as a colorful, humorous, varied third-person platformer with no (real) shooting to speak of. When you see 'MODERN BATTLE WAR 2K14: EXTRA GREY EDITION' sell copies by the millions every year, with no sequel in sight for Psychonauts due to underperforming in sales, you might begin to understand why people cling to this game like a liferaft.\n\nIs it flawless? No. I spent the entire second paragraph on that.\n\nDoes it have a deep story making a commentary on the human condition? Probably not, but maybe. Certainly not Raz's; the story of a young boy trying to achieve his childhood dream has been told a thousand times over. But some of Whispering Rock's residents are flawed characters that have suffered genuine tragedy, but who may yet overcome their pasts, if only extended a genuine helping hand (I might be overthinking it, but I just love these characters so much).\n\nBut the most important thing is that it's fun, which is the basis for a good video game. This is a game full of secrets, collectibles, and challenges. Other games with less have found love, and all the other stuff just made it that much better.\n\nThis is where the review stops.\n\nThis is my stop sign.\n\nWant to get that awful forced joke? Play the game.\n\n-NOTE ON CONTROLLER-\n\nPsychonauts' biggest problem is exclusive to the PC version. I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. Your best choice is the Xbox 360 Controller, given its high degree of support and close resemblance to the Xbox and PS2 controllers, with which Double Fine designed Psychonauts in mind. However, while you can just plug it in and be ready to go, inexperienced players won't know all of the buttons by heart. Steam user v00d00man has addressed this problem by developing an application called PsychoPad, which will replace the button images with the 360 controller's (or generic gamepad numeric buttons if you opted for something else).\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2151566\n\nYou might also check out PsychoWide, which crops the cutscenes to your resolution instead of stretching them.","December 27, 2013","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.","January 31, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every character has his own personality and struggles, even the unimportant ones, which is nice to see in this land of Mr. Johnny Testosterone Space Marine and Mrs. Sassy Action Chick.\nThe gameplay is intresting, but it has it’s flaws (they might be forgivable), the psychic powers are awesome and the boss fights really require skill, every boss has it’s own weak spot, you have to deduce it by watching it’s attacks. On the other hand the camera can be a little female dog some times. The combat outside the boss fights is kind of meh. The difficulty curve is a little bit messed up, there were sequences near the end that almost made break my keyboard.

This is an adventure/platformer, from the 2000, so it aged a bit. Adventure features, zeldaish kind of thing. And platformer but the 2000 3D, which means N64 period, the first age of it. You can finish it easily if you are a gamer, you may struggle a bit if you are a casual. It is long, weird and gamerish, so if you are into that, got an X360 controller, you will love it. If not...\n\nYou need even more? This is Tim Schafer last marvel (after that, I gave up on him, unfortunately). So if you loved previous T.S. works of art like Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, or Grim Fandango, and found they too were masterpieces, do not think further and buy Psychonauts.\n\nYou need always more?! This is a BRILLIANT work of art. You can enjoy it as a platformer passionate, because it is really rich regarding that. You can enjoy it adventure wise, because there is TONS to collect, reminiscent of N64 times like Banjo&Kazooie style. You can enjoy it storywise because it is huge, meticulously written, an old souvenir from the 90s point and clicks where you had to WRITE a STORY before developing a game.\n\nGreat music, great dialogues, very original world, very smart and psychological and analytical scenario... and it is a real Tim Schafer universe, the real one, not today's.

A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.","January 31, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubdown/recommended/3830/","rubdown","therubdown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubdown/","293 products in account","I have to preface this a bit;  I love this game as much as anyone, but it's tedious if you want it to be.  When I first played this, I basically marathoned it over two long sittings.  I did everything I could, completely 100%'d the game.\n\nNow, returning to it after having bought it again on sale (Originally played on Xbox), I have to admit the game isn't suited to doing in such a complete fashion again.  Everything holds up, for the most part.  I absolutely adore running around the campgrounds, seeking out various items.  It's pretty basic, but the atmosphere invoked being so similar to that of a Saturday morning cartoon just pulls at my heartstrings something fierce.  When you get into the meat of the game, however, it falls apart a bit.  The platforming is mostly simple, and that's no issue.  It does what it should and it does it well enough.  The game is truly unique in its presentation, that's what makes it worth playing.  The real issue is with the figment collecting.  It's tedious as can be.\n\nIt's like playing Banjo Kazooie or another collectathon, but everything you want to get, runs away from you.\n\nThrough walls.\n\nIt's very frustrating to run through a level more than once to find a chicken that just happens to hide in walls until the very second you turn around.\n\nAll in all though, wonderful game.  A must play for anyone that loves games in my opinion, just don't get too caught up in seeing every little detail of this game.  The little things just hinder an otherwise amazing game, filled with detail and character not frequently seen.","April 23, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Equal parts Nintendo platformer, LucasArts adventure, and 1990s era Nickelodeon cartoon, it was tailor-made to put a smile on your face.\n\nWhispering Rock Summer Camp is the home of our hero for the duration of the story, and much as Hogwarts instructs young wizards, this retreat is a school for psychics.  Using his mental abilities, Razputin will invade the thoughts of friend and foe alike, and these mindscapes will function as a range of diverse levels.  Ever have somebody tell you that some scary creature was more afraid of you than you were of it?  Raz has one of these moments with a giant mutated lungfish, and upon entering its head, he finds himself filling the role of Godzilla in a city of tiny lungfish.  This type of inventive fun has helped Psychonauts climb onto my own top ten list, and only the most curmudgeonly of cynics would fail to say the same.\n\nFor a full review, check out:\nhttp://amanandhismouse.com/psychonauts.html","June 7, 2015","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly, I did not do it well enough to have gotten all the achievements -- I'm debating a second playthrough to get those I'm missing.\n\nNevertheless, it's a truly fun game.  Yes, it's a platformer, so you will spend some time just trying to make certain jump sequences, or hunting for a missing thing when you thought you already checked the whole level, or replaying a boss fight because the camera angles are often terrible. But yes, despite that it's funny and fun and it made me laugh out loud quite a bit at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\nYou play Raz, a young boy who has run away from the circus to join in at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp and hopefully to become a Psychonaut -- an international mental agent.  The levels are insane -- your slightly abnormal summer camp (filled with other psychic children) soon becomes an exploration of the other minds around you, in all their whacky weirdness.\n\nNow ... back to debating whether to finish all the achievements...","September 18, 2013","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In this game, you play as Razputin (or Raz for short), a child acrobat that has ran away from the circus to become a psychonaut, an agent with psionic powers that is able to travel through one’s mind and cure them of their trauma or mental illness. The superpower available are marksmanship (which is Raz’s range attack) telekinesis, pyrokinesis, shield, invisibility, levitation, clairvoyance (which allows Raz to see through the eyes of the NPCs), and confusion.\n\nAll of these psionic powers are not just something Raz can do: they ALL have a purpose in the game. The use of certain psionic powers is required to progress further into the game. As I played this game, repetition was at a minimum as the objectives for each level are NEVER reused. Each of the game’s bosses have different strategies in order to defeat them, so you’ll never feel like you’re fighting the same boss twice.\n\nRazputin actually happens to be voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz, the same voice actor the provided the voice of Invader Zim. Psychonauts was designed by Tim Schafer, who also designed the critical successes yet commercial failures Grim Fandango and Brütal Legend. Just like these two games, Psychonauts was a critical success, but a commercial failure. Out of all the platform video games I’ve played, Psychonauts definitely has the most innovation, which is one of my two favorite words when it comes to video games (the other being “variety”).\n\nWhile I absolutely adore this game, there were only two problems I had with it: one was that the common enemy known as the censor was pretty overused in much of the game. There is also a character called Sheegor who has just the most annoying voice (fortunately, Sheegor doesn’t appear in most of the game)! Another problem I had with this game is it kept crashing (possible due to it being an older game). However, I was able to find a solution and you can find it by clicking  here.\n\nFor the great game that Psychonauts is, I would love see a sequel. Markus Persson (the creator of Minecraft) had even offered to fund the sequel, but later changed his mind. Unlike most platform games, Psychonauts is not designed specifically for kids as it was rated T by the ESRB for crude humor and language. The game has usually minor swear words and some of the game’s jokes did make me laugh a little. If you have not checked out this game, I strongly suggest that you do so. If there was a sequel, I would certainly pay full retail price for it.","August 9, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's really creative and immersive, and just the mere concept is genius. Being able to play as a psychic who goes platforming inside people's minds is pure bliss. Every single level is unique and brings a new concept to the table tied to the personality of the person whose mind you're inside.\n\nAside from that the "real" world is very interesting too. The characters are colorful and memorable, and there's optional dialogue scattered all over the game that makes the world seem so much more real. This is also helped by the consistently strange graphics. Though some might find them dated, they have so many crazy and innovative designs that it's hard not to get sucked in.\n\nThe game also takes advantage of the fact that you have psychic powers to give you some rather creative controls, including a magic hand to punch people, looking from the point of view of someone else and floating on your own magic ball. I think the game probably works best with a controler though, as I have found that the keyboard isn't always very cooperative in a game like this. If your keyboard has a hard time pressing certain buttons together, the last stage can be a nightmare.\n\nIf you enjoy platform games and like strange and surreal stuff, this game is definetely for you.","May 8, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even though I wasn't so enthusiastic at the beginning, I can tell that it's probably the second best game I played this year (well, I mostly play older games, nevermind), after aforementioned Brutal Legend. The story is just fantastic, there are tons of collectibles (which I really like in every game) and intelligent humor. Even graphics is quite good as for game released in 2005, but it's the least important thing. Oh, and I forgot to mention the voices are just epic (Sheegor voice is masterpiece). Game is almost perfect, but well, the controls are definetely not perfect. I used mouse and keyboard, but still it was sometimes hard to move between menus.

Which group you'll fall into depends on weather you're the kind person who can allow things like excellent story-telling and charming arti direction excuse a few minor gameplay issues, or if you're the kind of twitching, Ritalin popping, XBox owner who falls into a coma when they go without killing something for five seconds. I'm just going to list out of context some of the things that occur in Psychonauts: a telekinetic bear, a dentist who harvests brains instead of teeth, and a sequence wherein you become a giant  monster and terrorize a society of fish. A game that features all of these things simply cannot be criticized. It's against the law or something. Now so your next course of action should probably be to buy it if you haven't already.","November 25, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are varied and interesting. The writing is funny. There's a lot of fun, different mechanics/abilities to use. It's an action-adventure with lots of platforming. Judging jumps can be a little tricky in 3D. This made part of the end of the game really more frustrating than it should have been, but that didn't mar the experience much. 20 minutes of 20 hours sucked. There is a bit of puzzle solving in the game. The graphics of course look a bit dated now, but the art style still really helps the look of the game hold up over time and it was often pretty to look at. Overall, Psychonauts is a really well put together game. I was impressed.","August 9, 2013","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While often described as a platformer it really is just another way for Tim Schaeffer to tell a story as he always has, this time through a hub world action platformer rather than a point-and-click adventure. As confident and compelling protagonist Raz you explore the minds of others to learn more about yourself all the while building and adding new psychic powers to your repertoire. If you like action and adventure with some platforming thrown in Psychonauts will gladly scratch that itch and have you coming back for more.

Like a real, physical grin, not just an internal chuckle.\n\nUnfortunately the conventional wisdom about the platforming is still kinda true too. It's not universally terrible, but it fights you just a little too much in key spots. But in the end, it's all good. Deus Ex has goofy voice acting, Thief has bad animations, Psychonauts has glitchy platforming. (Although probably above-average for 3D platformers.) It's still an all-time classic.\n\nLooks pretty great on the PC too, and the PC version works well with my 360 pad.

And even though I wasn't so enthusiastic at the beginning, I can tell that it's probably the second best game I played this year (well, I mostly play older games, nevermind), after aforementioned Brutal Legend. The story is just fantastic, there are tons of collectibles (which I really like in every game) and intelligent humor. Even graphics is quite good as for game released in 2005, but it's the least important thing. Oh, and I forgot to mention the voices are just epic (Sheegor voice is masterpiece). Game is almost perfect, but well, the controls are definetely not perfect. I used mouse and keyboard, but still it was sometimes hard to move between menus. I also had some problems with camera, especially in narrower places, like small rooms or caves. Everything else is perfect. Except the fact that after 8 years there's still no Psychonauts 2. I still hope that cash I spent on this game will one day make my dream of Psychonauts 2 come true.\n\nOh, almost forgot: MR.

Developed by Double Fine and originally published by Majesco, it was released in 2005 for the Xbox, and 2006 for the PC and Playstation 2.It was reviewed well, but sold poorly, and has garnered a cult following. It's not an old game, but a lot has changed since it came out. Let's see how it holds up today.\n\nIt stars the young wanna-be "Psychonaut" Razputin, commonly referred to as "Raz." Razputin sneaks into a camp for gifted children, (I know what you're thinking, and no. Not that kind. These kids have mind powers. Like, burning things. With their minds!) but is caught by the, uh, camp counselors, I guess. One of them looks like Resetti. Anyway, they want to send Raz home, but are unable to contact his parents. So they let him stay. And things start to get weird. Like, kids having their brains removed and walking around like zombies weird.\n\nThe plot is good enough, won't win any awards, but it is charming and well written. The creativity behind the game is exceptional. Levels all take place in people's heads. Literally. Raz gets sucked into their brain through a tiny door. It's basically Extreme Makeover: Therapy Edition. You help people with their mental health, in the most fun way possible. No two levels are the same, just like people's minds. And just like the levels, the characters are great. Highlights include: A paranoid milkman, a heartbroken luchadore, a descendant of Napoleon with split-personality disorder, and a friendly psychic mutant angler-fish. Every character's level reflects their personality, and are all fun, different, and interesting.\n\nThere's not much more to be said about Psychonauts without giving spoilers. This is truly one of those games that you are better off jumping in head first with reckless abandon. Don't look anything up about this game. You'll thank me later.","July 14, 2012","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are all distinguishable and I mean for god's sake the main evil guy is absolutely hilarious.  A dentist who removes brains I mean I wish I could come up with that.  There a about nine different psychic abilities that you get in the game and each one just as important as the others at some point.  Some you use more than others but each a joy to use.  The envirmonments are mainly different characters imaginations and each one is so unique making the experience believable and intriguing.

You run and jump around a 3D world, gaining new abilities over time that allow you to meet new challenges and explore the world in new ways. The classic double jump and hover are represented, allowing you to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms, but there's also a super cool sprint mechanic. Not only does it let you zip around the world really fast once you unlock it, but it also functions as a combat weapon and it can be chained seamlessly into a hover mode. It's really clever.\n\nThe combat works better than you usually see in platformers, which allows Double Fine to include lots of fun little combat challenges and boss fights without it becoming frustrating. There are multiple combat powers to pick from, but you can only bind a few to hotkeys, so it forces players to pick a "build" that they want to use as their go-to combat choice. However, there are also specific challenges that require you to think about your other powers and realize that you can rotate between your entire arsenal in order to solve problems.\n\nLevel Design:Mind-blowingly good. A platformer lives or dies based on how well its levels are designed - they need to be fun to navigate, have interesting puzzles to solve, and provide good flow to the gameplay. Psychonauts checks off all these boxes with style.\n\nIt also employs one of the most unique hooks to its levels I've ever seen. You have the overworld, which is always available, but then all the other levels take place inside people's minds, with their individual psyche dictating the makeup of the level. This gives each level a completely unique feel and provides the opportunity for all sorts of challenges to be immersed in the game world, when they would usually feel artificial.\n\nLater on, you start going inside the minds of people with mental disorders, which gives each level a deliberately uncanny feel and presents all sorts of interesting challenges. Oh, and there's also a giant fish whose mind is full of peaceful little fish cities being terrorized by a Godzilla-like human.\n\nThe levels are full of collectibles, in the spirit of the old collectathon platformers like Banjo-Kazooie. They're all optional and provide varying degrees of enjoyment. The mental vaults and scavenger hunt are the best, while the figments are what it looks like when a developer *wants* to torture someone.\n\nMost of the game is spent gradually teaching you new mechanics, spacing the tutorial out over loads of fun story stuff, but then the very last level presents you with a hard mastery challenge that forces you to use all the skills you've learned at a high degree of mastery.\n\nNarrative:Raz runs away from the circus to join a summer camp for psychics. While there, he tries to impress the instructors and convince them that he has what it takes to become a psychonaut - a psychic secret agent. Along the way, he uncovers a sinister plot at the heart of the camp, and it falls to him to put a stop to it.\n\nThis is the highlight of the game. Yes, it's fun to play, but it's even funnier to experience. It's co-written by Tim Schafer, a veteran of Lucasarts adventure games, and Erik Wolpaw, who is famous for writing the dialogue of the Portal games. With those two behind the story, it'd be shocking if Psychonauts *wasn't* hilarious.\n\nAll the dialogue is master-class. All the characters are phenomally well-realized. And the story itself is both funny and intriguing, with little bits of foreshadowing planted as early as the first tutorial level, so that the mystery of the evil plot builds slowly over the game, but makes perfect senese once revealed. Then there's the adorable romance between Raz and Lili, which manages to tug at my heart strings even though it's relatively light.\n\nThe levels present a textbook on environmental storytelling, with their very design communicating volumes about the personality of the person whose mind you are in. Add in the mental vaults and secret areas, and you have the *level design* by itself telling a deeper story than many entire games do.\n\nThe main story is mostly about a coming of age and realization of potential, and Raz's struggle to find acceptance from his father. We see Raz run away from his family in order to prove himself and pursue the career he's always wanted, and by learning to fix other people's nightmares and insecurities, he also learns to face his own.\n\nAesthetics:Fantastic. Every last bit.\n\nThe art direction is stunning, providing both a unique feel and cohesive style for the world, while also giving each of the mind levels a wildly different, unique style that is unique unto itself and communicates that person's mental state. It's really impressive. Double Fine basically asked its artists to do the same amount of design work usually required for several different games, just so they could make one great game.\n\nPeter McConnel's soundtrack is fantastic, providing lots of upbeat and jangly platforming music as well as deeper, dramatic scores for story moments.\n\nThe voice acting deserves special mention. Every single character is well-voiced, which is an incredibly rare feat among video games. There are no phoned-in or C-list performances. The entire cast is full of different personalities, all delivered with passion and gusto. In particular, they got Richard Steven Horvitz (Invader Zim) to voice Raz, and he knocks it out of the park.\n\nOverall Rating:  5/5","August 9, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even though I wasn't so enthusiastic at the beginning, I can tell that it's probably the second best game I played this year (well, I mostly play older games, nevermind), after aforementioned Brutal Legend. The story is just fantastic, there are tons of collectibles (which I really like in every game) and intelligent humor. Even graphics is quite good as for game released in 2005, but it's the least important thing. Oh, and I forgot to mention the voices are just epic (Sheegor voice is masterpiece). Game is almost perfect, but well, the controls are definetely not perfect. I used mouse and keyboard, but still it was sometimes hard to move between menus. I also had some problems with camera, especially in narrower places, like small rooms or caves. Everything else is perfect. Except the fact that after 8 years there's still no Psychonauts 2. I still hope that cash I spent on this game will one day make my dream of Psychonauts 2 come true.\n\nOh, almost forgot: MR.

First off, the environment is wonderfully designed. The setting is a summer camp for psychics, and the everyday beauty of nature is distorted by the childlike playfulness ofthe supernatural elements. Boardwalks don't just wind down forest paths, but undulate through space, twisting and turning like something out of a Tim Burton film. The characters are engaging and bizarre, their quirks lovingly detailed, both in appearance and characterization, making everyone unique. There are no generic "background characters" in this game; every character has a backstory, a personality, and their own plot that winds through the narrative of the game.\n\nOnce you get into the mechanics, however, there are some problems. There are some control issues, and most of the challenge comes, not from the game, but trying to marshal the controls into doing what you want, rather than actually using them to accomplish goals. The only other blemish on the face of this otherwise wonderful game is that the leveling is a bit grind-y, and centered around a series of scavenger hunts, rather than actual gameplay. That said, I feel that a traditional "Combat->XP" system would not have worked with this game, as combat seems to be something that happens when it has to, rather than a constant method of progressing through the game.\n\nIn short, the play is a little slow and glitchy, but with the engaging setting, you won't mind it much.","December 30, 2013","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This 2005 classic never seemed to get the love it deserved. I've only now gotten to check it out, but its got me hooked from the start. You play as Razputin (voiced by Richard Horvitz, VA of Zim, Billy, Pox, and Orthopox from Invader Zim, Billy and Mandy, and Destroy all Humans respectively) who has snuck away from his circus home to participate in a summer camp for psychics. I hear you thinking: "Psychics? Does that mean puzzles?" To which I say, nay! It means platforming! Literally enter the minds of your victi- er, volunteers, and journey through their mindscapes to learn of their pasts and uncover the horrible truth of the camp. Double Fine isn't known for good gameplay, and while its not the greatest here, I think its deserving of a try.\n\nSounds fun, right? Well it is, but it is not without fault. If you're a stickler for graphics you may be dissapointed in the fairly low budget visuals in this ten year old game, but the atmosphere and mood are set very well. My one complaint are the boss battles, of which you get one every hour or two (at least for the first six hours, which is what I've done at the time of writing). They rely on a simple dodge-wait for weak spot to be exposed-spam attack-repeat formula which is never mixed up very much.\n\nThe story, I feel, is pretty good. Its nothing spectacular and I can't say much without spoiling, but I'm enjoying it.\n\nAll in all, check this game out if you have interest in Double Fine, clever/trippy visuals, platformers, or horror movies.\n\nNOTE: At some point in the game there's an underwater section where you totally lose control of the camera. Near the end of it the camera bugged so Raz was almost never onscreen. Reset your resolution to 800x600 and die a few times to go back a checkpoint. This fixed it for me.","November 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, slightly stiff controls and a weird camera can ruin the game, and most of the side quests are just incredibly long collect-a-thons.

In this game, you play as Razputin (or Raz for short), a child acrobat that has ran away from the circus to become a psychonaut, an agent with psionic powers that is able to travel through one’s mind and cure them of their trauma or mental illness. The superpower available are marksmanship (which is Raz’s range attack) telekinesis, pyrokinesis, shield, invisibility, levitation, clairvoyance (which allows Raz to see through the eyes of the NPCs), and confusion.\n\nAll of these psionic powers are not just something Raz can do: they ALL have a purpose in the game. The use of certain psionic powers is required to progress further into the game. As I played this game, repetition was at a minimum as the objectives for each level are NEVER reused. Each of the game’s bosses have different strategies in order to defeat them, so you’ll never feel like you’re fighting the same boss twice.\n\nRazputin actually happens to be voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz, the same voice actor the provided the voice of Invader Zim. Psychonauts was designed by Tim Schafer, who also designed the critical successes yet commercial failures Grim Fandango and Brütal Legend. Just like these two games, Psychonauts was a critical success, but a commercial failure. Out of all the platform video games I’ve played, Psychonauts definitely has the most innovation, which is one of my two favorite words when it comes to video games (the other being “variety”).\n\nWhile I absolutely adore this game, there were only two problems I had with it: one was that the common enemy known as the censor was pretty overused in much of the game. There is also a character called Sheegor who has just the most annoying voice (fortunately, Sheegor doesn’t appear in most of the game)! Another problem I had with this game is it kept crashing (possible due to it being an older game). However, I was able to find a solution and you can find it by clicking  here.\n\nFor the great game that Psychonauts is, I would love see a sequel. Markus Persson (the creator of Minecraft) had even offered to fund the sequel, but later changed his mind. Unlike most platform games, Psychonauts is not designed specifically for kids as it was rated T by the ESRB for crude humor and language. The game has usually minor swear words and some of the game’s jokes did make me laugh a little. If you have not checked out this game, I strongly suggest that you do so. If there was a sequel, I would certainly pay full retail price for it.","August 9, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, it has a really unfair final level, and a rather steep difficulty curve, but that doesn't matter. Because its charming. It's funny, it's fun to play, it has some of the best level design in video game history and has a charming art style that has made sure it has not dated visually in the same way many "realistic" looking games from the same time have. The gameplay may not satisfy everyone, but I personally love how fluid it is, and the amount of customisation is just right.\nThis is a hilarious game, sure, with some of the sharpest wit and cleverest dialogue in anything ever. Tim Schafer and Erik Wolpaw's (of Portal and TF2 fame) script deserved all the accolades it recieved at the time, and the story itself is also fantastic. But not only is the game funny, it has a surprising and unprecedented amount of heart. Yes, it may feature characters sneezing brains out and a level where you play a Kaiju-sized version of the main character storming a city of Lungfish (which is an awesome level by the way), but it also has moments of beauty, and even tragedy. Yes, some of the tragic circumstances are handled in a comedic way, but in no way does it make them any less powerful or striking.\nDon't let the cartoony look and funny dialogue fool ya into thinking that's all there is. There is much more beneath the surface (not of the actual lake in the game, more the mental variety). It has a great plot, great characters (even the insignificant side characters. You can just stand there and listen to their remarkably long conversations, which I recommend you do because they're HILARIOUS), and more specifically a great main character with Raz, who is brilliantly handled. He's never too irritating, too goofy, too heroic. He's just the right quantity of everything you need in a relatble main character who you enjoy playing as.\nOverall, Psychonauts is a wonderful game, and although it has some flaws later down the line, all the other previously mentioned stuff (and more that I don't want to spoil) more than make up for them. And at the price it's currently at considering it's around a 15-20 hour game, it's an absolute steal.","April 22, 2013","true","50.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In terms of gameplay, it could use some polish - the combat can admittedly get repetitive and the platforming can get frustrating, especially in the notorious Meat Circus - but what truly makes this game great is everything else. The character design is wonderfully weird and oddly endearing. I could probably count on one hand the number of characters with believable skin and hair colors, but even with their odd proportions and designs, I couldn't help but love people like potato-shaped Coach Oleander and stick-thin Fred. The levels and overworld are filled with detail and little tidbits that add charm and personality. And the story! And the CHARACTERS! My friends, you will believe that a giant mutated lungfish can be a magical lady. You will find yourself "aww"-ing over a Brazilian disco girl and her German mad scientist crush. You will bawl your eyes out upon discovering their pasts. You will find yourself weirdly intrigued with the story of a summer camp filled with a bunch of strange campers and counselors, the nearby rundown insane asylum, and the little kid wearing goggles that barges in one day and saves the world. But most of all, you will laugh. A lot. I have no problem calling this game the funniest of all time. No go play it.

Developed by Double Fine and originally published by Majesco, it was released in 2005 for the Xbox, and 2006 for the PC and Playstation 2.It was reviewed well, but sold poorly, and has garnered a cult following. It's not an old game, but a lot has changed since it came out. Let's see how it holds up today.\n\nIt stars the young wanna-be "Psychonaut" Razputin, commonly referred to as "Raz." Razputin sneaks into a camp for gifted children, (I know what you're thinking, and no. Not that kind. These kids have mind powers. Like, burning things. With their minds!) but is caught by the, uh, camp counselors, I guess. One of them looks like Resetti. Anyway, they want to send Raz home, but are unable to contact his parents. So they let him stay. And things start to get weird. Like, kids having their brains removed and walking around like zombies weird.\n\nThe plot is good enough, won't win any awards, but it is charming and well written. The creativity behind the game is exceptional. Levels all take place in people's heads. Literally. Raz gets sucked into their brain through a tiny door. It's basically Extreme Makeover: Therapy Edition. You help people with their mental health, in the most fun way possible. No two levels are the same, just like people's minds. And just like the levels, the characters are great. Highlights include: A paranoid milkman, a heartbroken luchadore, a descendant of Napoleon with split-personality disorder, and a friendly psychic mutant angler-fish. Every character's level reflects their personality, and are all fun, different, and interesting.\n\nThere's not much more to be said about Psychonauts without giving spoilers. This is truly one of those games that you are better off jumping in head first with reckless abandon. Don't look anything up about this game. You'll thank me later.","July 14, 2012","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm sure if I had played the game when it came out the clunky platforming wouldn't have been as frustrating (okay yea it would be but at least I would be used to it) but it still didn't hinder the gameplay all that much (except when it bugged out during a boss). It reminded me of the platformers from when I was a kid and had charming humor you just don't see anymore. Raz is a spunky little kid who is joined by a colorful (and colorful MOUTHED) class of superpowered children who need a better adult than they got at camp.\n\nThe story is wonderfully told through the "minds" of some eccentric people and through the eyes of a naive and hopeful child. It's sure to throw you for a loop and back again. The art style is off putting at first because of the weird and just purposely ugly designs but they grow on you. The levels are just beautiful (especially Black Velvetopia) and I've never seen anything like them before. They make your head spin and frustrate you, but it's all a part of the fun.\n\nThe only bad parts of this game I think are the clunky outdated controls making it hard to platform, missable achievements, the final level Meat Circus... even the achievement says "i thought that was unbeatable" and for a slow computer it is!, and let's not forget the monotonous collecting of all figments.\n\nBut it does have replay value if you miss some things, you just won't want to 100% it again. It's unforgettable dialogue and one of a kind cast really leave a lasting impression on you. I'm glad I got to play it first as an adult because I wouldn't have gotten half the jokes 10 years ago. I think it would do well to have a remake (or at least remaster with better controls) because I already miss this game.

I had played Psychonauts briefly on PS2 but picked it up on Steam sale with the intentions of finishing it someday. After I started the game, I couldn't stop playing! The writing in Psychonauts is what sets it apart but the tight controls, varied level designs, and artwork are all great too. As you learn new psychic abilities, you'll use them to reach new areas but it doesn't feel like a locked off area akin to a Metroid or Zelda game. Anyone with an interest in how the world looks to other people and battles of the mind would love this game and it's worth the retail price easily!","November 25, 2013","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Awesome storyline, great environment, lots of fun stuff to collect. It's worth noting (if you're into achievements) that many of them are entirely missable, also that it goes dark part way through the game making finding stuff outside much harder and there is no free roaming after you finish the game so you will be wanting to grab everything as you go along. Having said that, exploring in between everything you do will allow you happen across many funny little things that deserve not to be missed.","May 20, 2013","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't the best platformer ever, but it's not bad. Combined with the various psychic powers you get throughout the game, it makes for a lot of fun. It's not super difficult most of the way through. (The final level is notoriously difficult, but supposedly they toned its difficulty back with the Mac release; I don't know yet, I haven't made it that far since the Mac release came out.)\nThe graphics are a little dated now, but the art styles are very fun. Every mind is different with its own unique styles. It's also a very well-written game, story-wise. Be sure to take time to go through it; they've put in all sorts of little details, including ones I didn't even realize were in there until I had to go hunting for them from the achievements!","December 22, 2011","true","40.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Psychonauts is fun and it does get challenging towards the end as well as it gets just a bit frustrating, contrasting with the rest of the game. There's also a lot of stuff to do, lots of collectibles and secrets to find, achievements are a blast to pursuit. What they always seem to make perfect, however, are the characters. Voice actors are amazing and writing is excelent. There is variety in levels and boss fights, although the rest can be a bit repetitive. I mostly recommend trying to get the "I LOVE PUNCHING!" achievement, as it's one of the most anoying yet satisfying once completed achievements in a video game.","September 23, 2013","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, hands down, has the best I've ever played. You care enough about the characters to drive you forward, humour is packed everywhere, and is mature and funny, little details, easter eggs and extras are scattered anywhere you can think of. I routinely come back and run through this game every couple years, and find new things I completely missed the last time.\n\nMistakesHonestly, practically none. You could argue that one of the few thousand set pieces are flawed slightly to make a challenging section frustrating, or go wrong once or twice, but even that is a stretch on what is pretty much a perfectly designed and polished game, which somehow still feels quirky and personal.\n\nBuyingPsychonauts is routinely available for $5 or less, and has even hit as low as $1 on Steam and Indie Bundles. It will not leave you feeling like a jerk after paying full price, and given the quality and fun it's worth at least that.","December 27, 2011","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I ended up buying it with a few other games, not in a bundle, just together. I left it in my library for a few months, and I got bored and played it.... And I didn't stop until I finished it.\n\nYou will regret your purchase of this game, but the part you will regret is not the money, but the time in which you waited until you played it. I know I regret it, I regret that I didn't find this game earlier, that I didn't play it WHEN it came out. But it's not too late to play, and the game has aged quite well (not that it was that old anyway).\n\nWhat makes this game so good that I am building it up so much? Everything about it is good.\n\nThe whole theme of this game is insanity and telepathy. These themes are darkly and nicely woven into the levels and into the game. Going into other people's minds and seeing dark recesses of insane asyulms. Characters who are strange and twisted, phycopaths, Narcissists, multiple personalities, suicidal children, etc. The characters in this game will not disapoint, especially not Mr. Pokeylope. ;)\n\nThe graphics stlyes are different depending on environment, which gives a very nice feeling to the game. It can be very dark and colourful, and go to being very bright and cheery. Which makes it practically impossibe to completely hate the stlye of the game, if you don't like the dark levels, you'll like the bright levels, but sometimes, you like all the levels.\n\nThere is very little wrong with this game, some achievements are hard to get (but that's a plus), but other than that, you have little reason to not buy this game and play it. It is sitting up as one of my favourite (if not favourite) game. It was just such an enjoyable experience to play, and it's one that doesn't seem to be played by as many as it should be.","November 24, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You run and jump around a 3D world, gaining new abilities over time that allow you to meet new challenges and explore the world in new ways. The classic double jump and hover are represented, allowing you to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms, but there's also a super cool sprint mechanic. Not only does it let you zip around the world really fast once you unlock it, but it also functions as a combat weapon and it can be chained seamlessly into a hover mode. It's really clever.\n\nThe combat works better than you usually see in platformers, which allows Double Fine to include lots of fun little combat challenges and boss fights without it becoming frustrating. There are multiple combat powers to pick from, but you can only bind a few to hotkeys, so it forces players to pick a "build" that they want to use as their go-to combat choice. However, there are also specific challenges that require you to think about your other powers and realize that you can rotate between your entire arsenal in order to solve problems.\n\nLevel Design:Mind-blowingly good. A platformer lives or dies based on how well its levels are designed - they need to be fun to navigate, have interesting puzzles to solve, and provide good flow to the gameplay. Psychonauts checks off all these boxes with style.\n\nIt also employs one of the most unique hooks to its levels I've ever seen. You have the overworld, which is always available, but then all the other levels take place inside people's minds, with their individual psyche dictating the makeup of the level. This gives each level a completely unique feel and provides the opportunity for all sorts of challenges to be immersed in the game world, when they would usually feel artificial.\n\nLater on, you start going inside the minds of people with mental disorders, which gives each level a deliberately uncanny feel and presents all sorts of interesting challenges. Oh, and there's also a giant fish whose mind is full of peaceful little fish cities being terrorized by a Godzilla-like human.\n\nThe levels are full of collectibles, in the spirit of the old collectathon platformers like Banjo-Kazooie. They're all optional and provide varying degrees of enjoyment. The mental vaults and scavenger hunt are the best, while the figments are what it looks like when a developer *wants* to torture someone.\n\nMost of the game is spent gradually teaching you new mechanics, spacing the tutorial out over loads of fun story stuff, but then the very last level presents you with a hard mastery challenge that forces you to use all the skills you've learned at a high degree of mastery.\n\nNarrative:Raz runs away from the circus to join a summer camp for psychics. While there, he tries to impress the instructors and convince them that he has what it takes to become a psychonaut - a psychic secret agent. Along the way, he uncovers a sinister plot at the heart of the camp, and it falls to him to put a stop to it.\n\nThis is the highlight of the game. Yes, it's fun to play, but it's even funnier to experience. It's co-written by Tim Schafer, a veteran of Lucasarts adventure games, and Erik Wolpaw, who is famous for writing the dialogue of the Portal games. With those two behind the story, it'd be shocking if Psychonauts *wasn't* hilarious.\n\nAll the dialogue is master-class. All the characters are phenomally well-realized. And the story itself is both funny and intriguing, with little bits of foreshadowing planted as early as the first tutorial level, so that the mystery of the evil plot builds slowly over the game, but makes perfect senese once revealed. Then there's the adorable romance between Raz and Lili, which manages to tug at my heart strings even though it's relatively light.\n\nThe levels present a textbook on environmental storytelling, with their very design communicating volumes about the personality of the person whose mind you are in. Add in the mental vaults and secret areas, and you have the *level design* by itself telling a deeper story than many entire games do.\n\nThe main story is mostly about a coming of age and realization of potential, and Raz's struggle to find acceptance from his father. We see Raz run away from his family in order to prove himself and pursue the career he's always wanted, and by learning to fix other people's nightmares and insecurities, he also learns to face his own.\n\nAesthetics:Fantastic. Every last bit.\n\nThe art direction is stunning, providing both a unique feel and cohesive style for the world, while also giving each of the mind levels a wildly different, unique style that is unique unto itself and communicates that person's mental state. It's really impressive. Double Fine basically asked its artists to do the same amount of design work usually required for several different games, just so they could make one great game.\n\nPeter McConnel's soundtrack is fantastic, providing lots of upbeat and jangly platforming music as well as deeper, dramatic scores for story moments.\n\nThe voice acting deserves special mention. Every single character is well-voiced, which is an incredibly rare feat among video games. There are no phoned-in or C-list performances. The entire cast is full of different personalities, all delivered with passion and gusto. In particular, they got Richard Steven Horvitz (Invader Zim) to voice Raz, and he knocks it out of the park.\n\nOverall Rating:  5/5","August 9, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What's neat about the abilities is that for most of them, you don't use only one for a level and then stop using it for the rest of the game. Each ability has its place in plenty of areas, from when you get it to the game's end. (The same kind of applies to the items you're given/you buy, many levels have extra goodies for you to go back and obtain with them!)\n\nThe gameplay is super super fun but the camera can get a bit wonky at times, especially during levels that require elevation(like the area above the theatre level, which made me lose my sh*t :^) )\n\nThe characters are all excellently characterized and the game does a very good job of thawing out their backstories. Another thing about the characters is they're all incredibly memorable; each and every one of them have fitting (and very talented, may I add) voice actors and unique designs that it's almost hard to forget any of them. (*Note: I am the Milkman.)\n\nI remember almost every scene from this game, and I mean maybe that's because it's only been 2-3 months since I've played it buuut I do believe I'll still remember them a year or two from now. Especially Goggalor... GOGGALOR!!!!!\n\nTo be entirely honest, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. If I had to give it a personal ranking, it's probably either my second or third favorite video game of all time beside Kingdom Hearts 2.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys please, if you're reading this and you're genuinly interested in getting this game, by all means do it. It's definitely worth the price and you will put a good amount of hours into it, especially if you go for a bit of achievement hunting like I did.

You run and jump around a 3D world, gaining new abilities over time that allow you to meet new challenges and explore the world in new ways. The classic double jump and hover are represented, allowing you to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms, but there's also a super cool sprint mechanic. Not only does it let you zip around the world really fast once you unlock it, but it also functions as a combat weapon and it can be chained seamlessly into a hover mode. It's really clever.\n\nThe combat works better than you usually see in platformers, which allows Double Fine to include lots of fun little combat challenges and boss fights without it becoming frustrating. There are multiple combat powers to pick from, but you can only bind a few to hotkeys, so it forces players to pick a "build" that they want to use as their go-to combat choice. However, there are also specific challenges that require you to think about your other powers and realize that you can rotate between your entire arsenal in order to solve problems.\n\nLevel Design:Mind-blowingly good. A platformer lives or dies based on how well its levels are designed - they need to be fun to navigate, have interesting puzzles to solve, and provide good flow to the gameplay. Psychonauts checks off all these boxes with style.\n\nIt also employs one of the most unique hooks to its levels I've ever seen. You have the overworld, which is always available, but then all the other levels take place inside people's minds, with their individual psyche dictating the makeup of the level. This gives each level a completely unique feel and provides the opportunity for all sorts of challenges to be immersed in the game world, when they would usually feel artificial.\n\nLater on, you start going inside the minds of people with mental disorders, which gives each level a deliberately uncanny feel and presents all sorts of interesting challenges. Oh, and there's also a giant fish whose mind is full of peaceful little fish cities being terrorized by a Godzilla-like human.\n\nThe levels are full of collectibles, in the spirit of the old collectathon platformers like Banjo-Kazooie. They're all optional and provide varying degrees of enjoyment. The mental vaults and scavenger hunt are the best, while the figments are what it looks like when a developer *wants* to torture someone.\n\nMost of the game is spent gradually teaching you new mechanics, spacing the tutorial out over loads of fun story stuff, but then the very last level presents you with a hard mastery challenge that forces you to use all the skills you've learned at a high degree of mastery.\n\nNarrative:Raz runs away from the circus to join a summer camp for psychics. While there, he tries to impress the instructors and convince them that he has what it takes to become a psychonaut - a psychic secret agent. Along the way, he uncovers a sinister plot at the heart of the camp, and it falls to him to put a stop to it.\n\nThis is the highlight of the game. Yes, it's fun to play, but it's even funnier to experience. It's co-written by Tim Schafer, a veteran of Lucasarts adventure games, and Erik Wolpaw, who is famous for writing the dialogue of the Portal games. With those two behind the story, it'd be shocking if Psychonauts *wasn't* hilarious.\n\nAll the dialogue is master-class. All the characters are phenomally well-realized. And the story itself is both funny and intriguing, with little bits of foreshadowing planted as early as the first tutorial level, so that the mystery of the evil plot builds slowly over the game, but makes perfect senese once revealed. Then there's the adorable romance between Raz and Lili, which manages to tug at my heart strings even though it's relatively light.\n\nThe levels present a textbook on environmental storytelling, with their very design communicating volumes about the personality of the person whose mind you are in. Add in the mental vaults and secret areas, and you have the *level design* by itself telling a deeper story than many entire games do.\n\nThe main story is mostly about a coming of age and realization of potential, and Raz's struggle to find acceptance from his father. We see Raz run away from his family in order to prove himself and pursue the career he's always wanted, and by learning to fix other people's nightmares and insecurities, he also learns to face his own.\n\nAesthetics:Fantastic. Every last bit.\n\nThe art direction is stunning, providing both a unique feel and cohesive style for the world, while also giving each of the mind levels a wildly different, unique style that is unique unto itself and communicates that person's mental state. It's really impressive. Double Fine basically asked its artists to do the same amount of design work usually required for several different games, just so they could make one great game.\n\nPeter McConnel's soundtrack is fantastic, providing lots of upbeat and jangly platforming music as well as deeper, dramatic scores for story moments.\n\nThe voice acting deserves special mention. Every single character is well-voiced, which is an incredibly rare feat among video games. There are no phoned-in or C-list performances. The entire cast is full of different personalities, all delivered with passion and gusto. In particular, they got Richard Steven Horvitz (Invader Zim) to voice Raz, and he knocks it out of the park.\n\nOverall Rating:  5/5","August 9, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Psychonauts has problems. The positives vastly outweigh the negatives.\n\nTo get my issues with it out of the way first:\n- The platforming was difficult for me in parts prompting a lot of trial and error. This sounds like a small point but when the result is continuous repetition to make a  single jump it gets really annoying.\n- Some enemies were difficult/annoying to fight.\n- It's sad that you can't bind your powers to more buttons, as tabbing into the menu to swap powers out was just a little too much effort. It was released on the Xbox at the same time so you can see why this was done.\n\nOkay now onto the positives:\n- The story, the environments you find yourself in, the characters and the dialogue are all great. I can't stress this enough. The Steam trailer shows a range of levels of the game but it doesn't capture how excellent the dialogue and delivery is in this story where weird psychic kids go to summer camp.\n- The graphical style still holds up. For a game over 10 years old, it's not difficult to watch.\n- Collectibles matter. You level up almost exclusively through collectibles and several of them give you extra things to read/memories to watch. They're all very whimsically created and perfectly integrated into the game.\n- Some real thought has been put into it. Example: the main character Razputin gives a reason as to why he can't swim (that normal video game limitation). They mention it several times and justify it. Nothing is done arbitrarily, making for a very solid world.\n- It's a good length. Maybe 8 hours if you rush from place to place. Which you shouldn't do! Talk to as many other characters as possible, the dialogue is wonderful.\n\nIt's so close to being a game I would say young kids should definitely play (or watch being played). However there are some words I'd call 'not okay' used, and a few moments spring to mind which could be really scary for kids. The comedy gets dark at times. Make your own judgement if you're in that situation.","August 9, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Years later I find this game on steam and it made my heart flutter - the controls are a little wonky with the keyboard, definately, but simple enough to use when you bind everything to what you're more comfortable with!\n\nThe plot is captivating and the artistic style this game holds is very unique. It's usually an open-world exploration type with its gameplay, and the plot usually isn't very hard to follow but players have been known to get stuck here and there (especially when using the button item to meet Sasha).\n\nThe graphics aren't the greatest but there was certainly a lot of detail put into its scenery and surroundings.

Sounds bad? Oh, you just wait.\n\nConsidering this is a 3-D platformer, I'll start at the platforming then. Unless your computer is complete poop and you lag on everything (even Microsoft Word, yes, I know. Soak in the badness) the response you get from jumping, climbing and...uhh...swinging around a pole and then launching yourself. Speaking of jumping, you can double jump.\n\nMoving on from jumping on platforms, combat is the other third of this game (the last third is the stages, or 'minds' as they refer to in-game, since your 'levels' are you travelling into other people's minds, most of the time solving an issue they have or getting a power-up). You have your basic 1-2-3 karate chop then force palm combo and your 'palm bomb', a smashing attack when, you guessed it, slam into the ground with your palm (surprising, I know). Now to mention the multiple merit badges you earn to use other abilities, like setting things on fire or turning invisible. This allows you to come up with your own tactics against all enemies, let alone have some fun with non-combat abilities, like Clairvoyance, haha, always a blast to use.\n\n(Oh god, that paragraph)\n\nAnyway, I've rambled on for long enough. SO LET'S RAMBLE ON MORE!\n\nLast, but definately not least, are the minds and psyche of the people you meet. Before I go in-depth and all, Edgar's mind, or Black Velvetopia, is my favourite mind, just so that's out of the way. Each level doesn't feel the same, and every mind has it's own theme, look and way to complete it. For example, in the very first stage, Coach Oleander's mind called 'Basic Braining', has you going through war, which in this case is a massive obstacle course. Might I add, even though this has nothing to do with the levels, is that the dialogue and humour in the game is absolute bliss.\n\nSadly, we come to the bad parts of the game. Uhh, sometimes for me, at least, (even though this only happened to me at the end of the game) the controls will just kinda cut out, leaving you with a falling Raz and a loss of your astral projection layer in the current mind you're in. Or just thrown into a very inconvenient spot. Also, (and also only at the end of the game) the camera direction can be kinda irritating at times. As in, the kind of "WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?!" camera. This rarely happens and is only for small segments. Finally, enemies that you have no idea how to beat. This is a personal complaint and you can say, maybe a stupid one. I'm talking about enemies, particularly bosses, that you have no idea how to beat and you're left with something kicking your ♥♥♥ and there's nothing you can do about it. This is the biggest complaint here, and you can make a counterarguement stating how that this is just learning the game. Yeah, it is, but without a walkthrough, it can be irritating at times.\n\nNow, before I go on about more tiny aspects, I'm gonna wrap up this review. This game is a beutiful blend of humour, tight controls, variety and lovable characters that combinates into the best platformer I have ever played, heck, it's definately my favourite PC game to date! Yes, I like it that much. So, unless it's completely obvious, do I like this game or not?\n\nWell of coarse I like this game! I recommend everyone with a sense of humour and a love for indie games. From me, an average gamer who just completed this game for the first time, gives this game a 9/10. It's amazing, easy to pick up and play, and hilarious to experience.\n\n~Horris","December 24, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Initially, I first came across Physconauts as a picture, one of those random pictures that sometimes appear on google images for some reason or another, intrigued by the oddball style of character design, I looked further into the game, and I was struck by it's capacity to keep you interested. The music for all stages reflected well not only upon the mind of who you were exploring, with each person's mind receiving a unique piece.\nThe character designs are not based on traditional aesthetic values, but still create a diverse cast who, while a great many of them are barely mentioned in the actual plot, are prominent in the many little side affairs that make up camp life (which I found created a realisticness in a place where not too many would expect it).\nOne of the main things I really liked about the game was the exploration factor, in that, the Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp proved a vast place to poke, jump, burn, and run around, in fact, a moderate chunk of late game fighting capacity relies on your exploration. Interestingly enough, Psychonauts doesn't rely on overt violence to keep you entertained, although there usually is mental censors of some kind to fight through as minor obstacles in most minds. Instead, you must explore through various places, figuring out how to best get around (One case being how to go up a street without being run over by a bull.) That isn't to say the boss fights aren't challenging. Far from it, as the boss fights I've encountered here, rely not on overt violence, but rather figuring out how to use various psychic powers to exploit the enemy's weakness and win from there. Combine this with amusing dialogue, jokes for all ages, and minor plot arcs which lead one to speculation about real life people based on fictional characters, and many other things which make the Game of Psychonauts a Must Play.","November 25, 2015","true","78.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This 2005 classic never seemed to get the love it deserved. I've only now gotten to check it out, but its got me hooked from the start. You play as Razputin (voiced by Richard Horvitz, VA of Zim, Billy, Pox, and Orthopox from Invader Zim, Billy and Mandy, and Destroy all Humans respectively) who has snuck away from his circus home to participate in a summer camp for psychics. I hear you thinking: "Psychics? Does that mean puzzles?" To which I say, nay! It means platforming! Literally enter the minds of your victi- er, volunteers, and journey through their mindscapes to learn of their pasts and uncover the horrible truth of the camp. Double Fine isn't known for good gameplay, and while its not the greatest here, I think its deserving of a try.\n\nSounds fun, right? Well it is, but it is not without fault. If you're a stickler for graphics you may be dissapointed in the fairly low budget visuals in this ten year old game, but the atmosphere and mood are set very well. My one complaint are the boss battles, of which you get one every hour or two (at least for the first six hours, which is what I've done at the time of writing). They rely on a simple dodge-wait for weak spot to be exposed-spam attack-repeat formula which is never mixed up very much.\n\nThe story, I feel, is pretty good. Its nothing spectacular and I can't say much without spoiling, but I'm enjoying it.\n\nAll in all, check this game out if you have interest in Double Fine, clever/trippy visuals, platformers, or horror movies.\n\nNOTE: At some point in the game there's an underwater section where you totally lose control of the camera. Near the end of it the camera bugged so Raz was almost never onscreen. Reset your resolution to 800x600 and die a few times to go back a checkpoint.

Everything about the game is unique, from the art style to most of the abilities to the characters to the dialogue. Black Velvetopia especially is a beautiful piece of art. Wonderful game all around but is also has minor annoyances.\n\nFor example, the mouse and keyboard combination takes getting used too and some parts of the game are down right infuriating with them. Small parts of stages have awful design (I'm looking at the Waterloo mainly). Found myself exploiting the hell out of levitation.\n\nStill, I highly recommend this game.\n\nNOTE: If you are using Windows 7, I recommend going to Psychonauts.exe > Properties and sticking it in Compatibility mode with Windows 95. The game up until Gloria's Theater ran fine, but then the graphics started messing up and the fps hit the fan. Doing the above fixed it and I encounter no issues past that.","May 20, 2015","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scutlei/recommended/3830/","Scutlei","Sack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scutlei/","83 products in account","Whenever I think about this game I get a tear in my eye because this is one of the most inspired games I've ever seen.. 9.5/10\n\nEvery level is unique and revolves around a few specific psychic abilities that you're given. What's neat about the abilities is that for most of them, you don't use only one for a level and then stop using it for the rest of the game. Each ability has its place in plenty of areas, from when you get it to the game's end. (The same kind of applies to the items you're given/you buy, many levels have extra goodies for you to go back and obtain with them!)\n\nThe gameplay is super super fun but the camera can get a bit wonky at times, especially during levels that require elevation(like the area above the theatre level, which made me lose my sh*t :^) )\n\nThe characters are all excellently characterized and the game does a very good job of thawing out their backstories. Another thing about the characters is they're all incredibly memorable; each and every one of them have fitting (and very talented, may I add) voice actors and unique designs that it's almost hard to forget any of them. (*Note: I am the Milkman.)\n\nI remember almost every scene from this game, and I mean maybe that's because it's only been 2-3 months since I've played it buuut I do believe I'll still remember them a year or two from now. Especially Goggalor... GOGGALOR!!!!!\n\nTo be entirely honest, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. If I had to give it a personal ranking, it's probably either my second or third favorite video game of all time beside Kingdom Hearts 2.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys please, if you're reading this and you're genuinly interested in getting this game, by all means do it. It's definitely worth the price and you will put a good amount of hours into it, especially if you go for a bit of achievement hunting like I did. It'll also make you more excited for the upcoming sequel!!!(which I'm super super hyped for!)\n","March 23","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since I beat it I always had that elusive Rank 101 in mind, having only gotten somewhere around 70-90. Now that I rebought the game I spent a good three consecutive days hunting everything down and getting the ***** to display my name and call me a psychomaster. It got a little frustrating from time to time when I couldn't find the last collectable in a few worlds as they hid in plain sight, but overall... I liked the game. I kinda wished that some of the characters were a little more fleshed out, but for what it is I enjoy it. If you do play this game, don't just rush through it (Unless your goal is to go fast). Instead, take your time and explore the world a few times, you might witness things you didn't expect. Getting all the achievements on Steam really showed me how much of this game I didn't see before. So many new things to do and learn about that my mind was boggled by the sheer amount of stuff.\n\nAim for the highest rank possible, but if you get stuck wondering how to do that *ONE* thing, or where the last collectable is... It isn't necessarily the best idea to get yourself worked up trying to figure it out.\nOkay, spoilers.\n\nSPOILERS TO SOME DEGREE:\n\n\nIn the end, it ends up being a bit disappointing that there really isn't any... bonus, for Rank 101. You do get something for rank 100, but not 101. Well, you get the achievement but that's it.

I'm not saying this game is like those, it certainly has the qualities of a platform game; jumping puzzles, collectibles, abilities that help you overcome new obstacles. But it executes those things in a way that is different from those other games.\n\nThe game deals with psychic powers and travelling through the minds and dreams of others. You will get different psychic powers, some of which are awesome to use all the time, that will let you access different areas and overcome different enemies while travelling throuh the minds of people and dealing with their fears and issues which will transform into monsters that you will have to defeat.\n\nThe story is hilarious, the characters are so cool and memorable, the Milkman comes to mind. The art style is pretty freaky, everything looks otherwordly and rightly so, as you will mostly be travelling the dreams inside the minds of your friends.\n\nI truly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games and weird, unique wrolds with very funny stories and characters.\n\nDo play with a controller, it is much more enjoyable in this game to do so.","April 8","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are the big-name platforming mainstays, such as Mario and Sonic, that rely on their own brand of rules and obstacles to overcome. You have the run-and-gunners, the hop-n-bops, the Metroidvanias, the collect-a-thons, those with realistic physics, the platform hells, the list goes on and on...\n\nHowever, there is a rare breed of platformer that comes out every so often that defies many of the traditional sub-genre aspects and manages to be it's own unique experience.\n\nPsychonauts is one of those games.\n\nThe story of the begins with Raz running away from home to become a Psychonaut, a kind of mixture between a secret agent and mental projectionist. He is taken in by the training camp, set into a journey that has him entering mind after bizarre mind to solve a sinister brain stealing plot.\n\nWith mental focus being the theme of the game, Raz learns many useful abilities such as levitation, telekinesis, and even seeing how others see the world. Upgrades and useful items are everywhere and the unique locals make the exploring the various mindsets to be all the more enjoyable. The humor is also some of the most well-written and goes hand-in-hand with the stylized look. One could easily picture a Nicktoon based on the game.\n\nInfamously bombing on it's intially release, it's earned a new life as time went on.

I only recently finished my playthrough of Psychonauts, and i loved every little minute of it. Previously, i had heard many say that Psychonauts was an underappreciated hidden gem, that deserved so much more. To be honest i thought these people were simply over exaggerating the greatness of this game. As i soon learned my opinion was that of a fool's. Psychonauts blew me away as I began to play it. From the very beginning i knew that i would love this game, and its estetic. One of the very first things i noticed right away was visually, how everything looked. There is a distinct style that every character, and environment has: Nothing has perfect edges and corners. Everything has a slight bend, or at a peculiar angle, but is not to the point where it is jarring to the eyes, or unpleasant. This gives the game a unique look, that is not easily duplicated. Every environment seems different from the last, with it's own singular theme, that makes it look as though it could stand on its own. I enjoy this, because different places and levels SHOULD be solitary in their style. Different characters personalities reflect their their subconscious, giving you the true impression that you are in THIS person's mind. And each character has their own distinct personality, from the kids in the camp, to the coaches teaching. They all have a trait, or something more to them that grants them lots of... I guess the best way to describe it would be quirkiness. There is just something to them... I just love the way they act, the things they talk about, actions, responses, jokes, etc. Many a time have i been playing this game with a giant ♥♥♥♥ eating grin on my face, because of something somone did.  All of the characters in this game, even the protaganists, and enemies, are lovable. However the most lovable of all is your main character Razz (can't remember if im spelling that right). He somehow captures the essence of childlike wonder, and reminds me alot of myself when i was a kid. He somehow just has this... draw to him, somehting about him that makes you proud to play as him as you progress to the story, you see his character grow immensly. Moving right along to the story, I won't say much, you can watch the trailer if you want a preview, but I'll leave it at this. I couldn't  stop playing. I wanted to see what would happen next; who's mind I would enter, I just wanted more and more and more. I was entranced in the deep and moving narrative. Even at the end of the game, i found myself wanting more, and was genuinely sad when i realized I was probably on the final level. This was partly established because of the story, but also because of how engaging and fun the gameplay was. You utilize your own psychic abilities, which you earn via merrit badges. You earn these throughout the story, and by occasionally ranking up (which can be done by various means.) Every ability has their own time and place, and unlike most games (cough cough Tomb Raider reboot) you dont learn a certain ability and then never use it in the game ever again. There's always a time and place for  to a certain ability, and all of them are useful. Now some of these abilities are combat based, others movement or puzzle based. Psychonauts blends solid platforming with puzzle solving (I'm not really talking Legend of Zelda style puzzles, more puzzles you need to use your head to solve. Yes that pun was intended), along with a banjo Kazooie esque exploration. Along with fun combat and a ton of collectables to... collect. There is a lot to do in Psychonauts,  one can spend hours engaged in this masterpiece. However, this game is not that difficult, I didnt have that hard a time playing through it. There are moments where it has its difficulties, sometimes it may be vague (but this isnt too jarring or game breaking. Just a little difficulty finding where or what one must do to progress. I only had this problem once). But on the upside no major glitches, or save problems, etc.  Personally i love this game, and i knew it after about 20 minutes of playing. So i was thouroughly happy when i got more than my money's worth for a far longer game than i had expected. So am I here to tell you that Psychonauts is the most underrated games of the century and that Tim Shcafer is a god, like most of the internet (or people on the internet ive hear say that), no. I'm here to tell you that Psychonauts is a damn good game that I'm glad as hell glad I got it. And I'm not here to tell you its an underappreciated gem, I'm just here to tell you its a gem. I love it, and I'm sure you will too.\n","December 8, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeventhAgeAvatar/recommended/3830/","SeventhAgeAvatar","Seventh Age Avatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeventhAgeAvatar/","528 products in account","---CONTAINS SPOILERS---\n\n4/5 ☆\n\nHaving spent 30 odd hours on the game and finally unlocking all of the achievements, it's time for my honest opinion and review of Psychonauts.\n\nA fascinating game with a somewhat odd, edging on bizarre story - but that's what's so appealing about it. It's a great 3D platformer that can keep you going for hours if you want to do everything 100%, with plenty of collectibles and secrets to uncover. If you like games like Ratchet and Clank, you'll enjoy this one.\n\nThe environments are vast and have plenty of exploration potential, some a bit more simple like the campgrounds and others considerably more complex like inside the minds of some of the characters you encounter, twisting and turning three-dimensionally around you. It's a great big basket of weird shaped fruit that you just want to dig into, fiddling and raising an eyebrow at each new stage's design and mechanics which in all comes together as a big ball of appealing 'wtf' that the game's story is in general. The music and sounds also help to fit in with this asylum theme of the game, they just seem to click nicely together and set the stage (pun quite literally intended in Gloria's mind) of that particular character's psyche, with the crazy and slightly disturbing nature of the last stage's music topping it all off.\n\nThe story seemed to escalate quickly, going from training and learning about your psychic powers to suddenly thwarting an evil brain snatching plot to take over the world. I suppose it again adds to the bizzaro charm of the game. You encounter along your way people with multiple personae, anger issues, traumatic events and resentment and the like. I find that sort of stuff very fascinating, even more so how they managed to get it to blend together in a story as it did.\n\nIt did however have it's fair share of negatives, though most are technical.\n\nCrashes for example are a big issue. Within my first couple of hours in the game I had several rather annoying crashes as I tried to make my way up to the Basic Braining segment. The message of 'Psychnoats is not responding and needs to be shut down' popped up a fair few times on my journey through the game. I advise anyone interested in playing this game to SAVE VERY OFTEN - which isn't a bad practice to get into the habit of doing so anyway for any game. There are also instances where the game 'freezes' but doesn't crash. Watch out for these, as you can still play the game, as long as you don't fidget with your keyboard or controller. Basically, the screen will freeze, but the music may still play. Give it a few seconds and it will start moving again. It usually stutters a bit before this happens (at least in my experience), a decent indicator to quickly hit the save button!\n\nControls. You can play this game with a controller OR a keyboard and mouse. From the start, I would have preferred to use the controller, I believe given the type of game it is, it would have not only been easier to use a controller, but perhaps also more comfortable. However, there are teething issues with plugging in a controller. In my experience, it tended to crash MORE often when the controller was being used, and it had this strange issue where, even if you weren't touching the analogue sticks, Raz would start moving in a random direction, which also applied when operating the menus. I had to in the end unplug the USB receiver for the controller, shut down steam, re-launch and then play with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nThere are fixes I believe out there via forums and guides, I believe there may be one or two on Steam's community forums, and you can work around them. But the player shouldn't really have to go looking elsewhere for third party fixes when it should have been checked and double checked before throwing it out there by the producers of the game. I used the default keybinds throughout the game, and they were ok, but did feel a bit clustered and clumsy at times. Whether that was my own fault or not is up for debate, but in a frantic battle situation, I found myself constantly hitting the wrong key for my psychic power, or something like Telekinesis cutting out halfway and accidentally dropping the thing or enemy you were engaging with. Things like this I believe would be considerably easier if you used a controller. But you can always change the keybinds to whatever you prefer.\n\nNow my biggest pain in the backside with this game. The camera. Oh my lord do I want to strangle that camera. It lets you down in places you need it most, such as to try and get an angle right for a jump, such as that 'don't drown' ascending acrobatic bit in the final boss area and that hovering spiralling segmented climable netting/mesh bit. That was the single most frutrating part of the whole finale, if not the whole game. It's smooth sailing with the odd bumps up until there and after it, but by God did that take me a while - because you had to wrestle with the camera WHILE attempting the difficult manoeuvre, a sort of manoeuvre you hadn't faced before in any earlier part of the game, and one that I adamantly believe cannot be done without deliberately taking damage from a burning section of the mesh in order to gain enough height to make the tricky jump.\n\nWhen you want to look around to explore and scout out collectibles, you feel rather restricted. Even with high mouse sensitivity, I found myself having to skid the mouse over and over again to have a good look around and even then it seemed to move just as slow. It just adds unnecessary frustration when you're trying to enjoy and immerse yourself in the game's surroundings and puzzles. Again, I believe this wouldn't be an issue if you were to use a controller to play instead of the keyboard and mouse.\n\nTo finish off my criticisms (in case I start to inflate and turn purple, becoming a Jasper the Critic 2.0 and spit my popcorn at you), I'll have a quick snip at maps. In short: there aren't any! Ok, well, yes, there is one, for the campgrounds, an area that you won't be visiting as often after you can cross the lake, and an area you can't even return to after you hit the 'Point of No Return'. No other map. At all. For any other area. And yet, there is a MAP TAB on the main menu, which only displays as 'out of map range' when you're in any area other than the campgrounds. That was a bit disappointing in my opinion, a huge potential for additional exploration and aiding in finding collectibles was missed there.\n\nFinally, the achievements in this game – be careful everyone! It's one of those games where after you hit a certain 'Point of No Return' – you won't be able to go back to some areas to collect stuff for some achievements, and you may miss some 'witness' achievements altogether unless you know when and where to go look for them in-between the different points of the story. I had to start another game from scratch to get the Pokeylope related achievement for example. I'd suggest making lots of separate saves  to help counter this.\n\nTo close, it's a weird and wonderful game that I enjoyed very much and would recommend to others. But to those others that are interested, I would strongly suggest you grab a controller and get that working properly – I believe it will make things a heck of a lot less frustrating and smoother to play with. As well as SAVING EVERY OTHER MINUTE to prevent getting setbacks from those nasty random crashes and freezes.","December 31, 2014","true","32.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's platforming, and alongside that there are enemies and obstacles to overcome. The platforming at a few times felt clunky, but for the most part was an enjoyable experience. But the game's fun isn't in the platforming or whatever, it's everything about this game that makes it the wonderful experience that it is. And that's what it is, an experience. It's strange, quirky, full of personality, and original. No matter if you're just sitting around listening to character's clever dialouge, or exploring the vast enviroments searching for plentiful goodies, you're always going to be entertained.\n\nI can't go any further without spoiling any of the plot, but I can whole-heartedly say this game is utterly fantastic, and has aged like fine wine. Yeah it's old now, and it's not the prettiest looking thing, but it's still beautiful and elegant in it's own little way.\n\n>Good characters\n>Great, unique story\n>Good gameplay\n>Funny DIalouge\n>Excellent score and voice acting\n>Decent controls (as long as you're using a controller that is, idk about the mouse and keyboard but i wouldn't try it)\n>Fun enviroments that are each unique\n\nThe only shortomings I've had with the game are some parts of levels that were very frustrating, because sometimes you on't have a good idea on what you should be doing at some point. But when you figure it out, you feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. Not really the game's fault, more or less my own, but I still would have liked more direction at certain points.\nAlso some enemies that kept respawning were annoying but whatever.\n\nOverall, this game is fantastic, and you should totally get it.\nTL;DR : ♥♥♥♥ing buy it you nerds.","April 10, 2015","true","53.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story of this game is amazing, well thought through, and overwhelmingly humorous, and very challenging. It actually feels like the creators took more than 2 months like normal games do to make the plot. Overall I really cannot explain the plot in depth to give a great feeling, so just go enjoy it yourself. Psychonauts is also a giant game- leaving 48.2 hours of mine JUST for the story, and not for going back for the thousands of collectables this game has to offer.\n\nWhat some people assume and will assume is the strange art of the game. The art looks a litte odd, but overall it gets normal, and cartoonish and funny as well. Sure, its not your average realistic art, but as you venture deeper into the art, it really shapes the game as to what the gameplay is; which is traveling inside the minds of others and fixing their mental state, which appears to be either a compact, organized mind, as simple as a theatre, or even a twisty and odd, but amazingly humorous neighborhood.\n\nOverall, this game I think deserves a 10/10 for me. This is one of the best games over the thousands I've ever played, including cross platform. Yes, I'm talking about one of the top games I've played compared to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, handhelds, Nintendo consoles, iOS and Android, and desktop/PC/computer.\n\nI've never in my life played a story in a game as good as this. My only regret of this game is beating it, as I don't know what to do now.......\nAnd also for Notch to not fund a sequel to the game. Why Notch, WHY!!! It's only 18 million, thats 1/300 out of your pocket.","August 17, 2015","true","49.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

In his quest to join the Psychonauts - an elite group of international psychic secret agents--he breaks into their secret training facility: Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. But this is no average psychic summer camp! A mysterious villain has kidnapped Raz’s fellow campers and stolen their brains. Now he must use his psychic powers of Telekinesis, Levitation, and most of all his ability to project himself into the minds of others--to find the loose noodles and keep them from falling into the wrong hands. Fight mental demons! Uncover hidden memories! Sort emotional baggage!\n\nPsychonauts has a quite unique story and level design in addition to various kinds of psychic abilities. Raz's character is pretty well developed. He is perhaps the best voiced character in game. However the other characters are pretty dull and not quite well developed. They are pretty forgettable.\n\nIn terms of visuals Psychonauts is pretty decent with some pretty good art work complimented with some wonderful sound production which plays a huge part in the game. The level design is great and solving puzzles can be fun as every puzzle has something unique to offer\n\nPros:\n- Stunning Visuals\n- Wonderful sound production\n- Voice Acting\n- Save Anywhere\n- Decent Puzzles\n\nCons:\n- Troublesome Camera Controls\n- Few blocky objects\n- Forgettable Characters","February 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

At some point, the game decides you’ve spent enough time learning how it’s supposed to work and assumes you can effortlessly pull off a series of challenging jumps, or that you’ve mastered its fumbling combat system. You haven’t; of course you haven’t, and what follows is a chorus of curses and rage-quitting or, in the case of the poor saps trying to play this on a keyboard, uncontrollable rage. But for those who can work past these flaws, Psychonauts has traits that seem largely forgotten in today’s conveyer belt of annual sequels and follow-the-fad gameplay. It’s genuinely funny, for one and has just the right amount of surrealist endearment and adolescent awkwardness to make it completely unique. There’s nothing else out there quite like Psychonauts, where you can be fighting a lucha libre wrestling cat pretending to be an eagle in a neon pastel ring one moment, then be terrorising a city full of tiny lumpy fishmen as a Godzilla-sized monster the very next. Where you can be listening to a classmate tell you that his tin foil hat stops him accidently exploding faces or another one trying to sneak time on the camp radio to return to her home planet, because she feels this world is doomed.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12430/pc/psychonauts/review.html","December 13, 2014","true","27.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Psychonaut are special people gifted with psychics abilities. You play the game as Raz, the new kid of a psychonaut summercamp.\n\nWhat makes this game intersting is the variety of game mechanics that it introduces.

Although it came out in 2004 and got remastered in 2011 it is a perfect game.  The originality of the game is great.  The level design is so creative.  Great voice acting with halarious gameplay makes this game beautiful.  This game is one of a kind and should be looked at.  It got awards like 'The best game no one played'.  $9.99 for a great game is hard to come by in this economy. 11/10-warrior1612, 11/10-ebloomy, 11/10-(TFT)SheeplockHolmes.","August 7, 2014","true","44.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each character has a unique and interesting mind and the dialogue is quite funny. However, there are also has some control issues and the camera sometimes gives you the impression that it's actively trying to make you fail. All in all, definitely worth playing.","September 4, 2013","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The good news is that there is a free patch that fixes both of these things, PsychoPadLite by voodooman.

Rare is the sort of mental physique Psychonauts flexes in its deliciously captivating stages; rarer still is the sort of video game that joins such eccentric design to a bevy of wildly fun tricks and gadgets available for probing and prodding its velveteen landscapes. Fluid platforming through all three dimensions builds but the theater in which these fascinating loons unfurl their scripted pandemonium. From the unbound depths of a whispered mutant lurker and a stout facsimile emperor to the hypersurreal reaches of an acrobatic butcher and a Milk-and-road-crew neighborhood, the plucky and precocious Raz maketh his way to the finale: A rendezvous...with the mind.

It's a very strange game to be sure.  It is a very unique concept playing a child who is training to be a psychic warrior, battling monsters inside other people's minds.  The game is very well written and despite being so stylized, the characters are quite realistic (though a few of them are fairly annoying.)  It also still manages to be quite humorous despite its age.\n\nThe game's setting at a kids' summer camp and the art style lead me to believe the game is aimed at kids, yet the subject matter is a bit more mature.  I think the game would be much too difficult for children as well.  It's a bit confusing for me.\n\nNow Double Fine was nice enough to update the game for Steam after many years which I greatly appreciate.  After putting in that effort though, I'd think they would have fixed some of the outstanding bugs.  I ran into quite a few ladders with broken dismounts at the top (one was so bad it took me about 10 tries each time to get off the ladder at the top and I had to climb it 10+ times) and a few other level glitches.  There are quite a few really badly placed fixed camera angles throughout the game.  The "smart camera" won't turn off despite changing the setting so the keyboard/mouse controls as essentially unusable.  I highly recommend downloading a mod called PsychoPad which gives you a modern gamepad layout with proper button prompts for the standard 360 controller (something else I think Double Fine should've taken care of.)\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game, though I wouldn't go so far as to call it a classic like many people do.","December 14, 2012","true","26.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ironically, I had already owned this game TWICE and never gotten around to playing it. I'm a firm believer that disappointment is always the prelude to something much better. My 21 hours with Psyhonauts was proof enough for me because I know had I played it on when I owned it for the original Xbox(or the atrocious looking port that slipped it's way on the PSN store) I would have not have likely enjoyed it as much as the PC version.\n\nYou play a young boy named Razputin(Raz for short) who sneaks his way into a summer camp specifically for kids with psychic abilities. You start off with some basic "braining" missions to get your feet wet only to find out there's a secret plot to take over the world being hatched under everyone's noses.\n\nThe visual presentation is something I immediately noticed when I booted up this game. My laptop has some fairly decent specs. Since this was already an older game I naturally turned all the settings to max(the game allows for full HD display at 1920 x1080 pixels, btw) and was literally blown away. Characters and environments(though somewhat dated looking)were sharp and clean, on-screen colors were vibrant and lively and textures(especially on Raz and some level segments) were highly detailed. Couple that with the game consistently running at a solid 60 fps and you have quite the throwback here if you never experienced it before like I did.\n\nThe overall gameplay doesn't do much to reinvent the wheel but the controls are solid and most of Raz's abilities are fairly unique in comparison to most other platformers. In short you're getting a game that shines more through it's delivery of quirky worlds, clever level design and and a bizarre yet highly memorable story.\n\nThe characters are fun and some even hilarious, the music is practically an orchestral masterpiece and every single level has a unique flavor that will stick in your head even after you've finished. My favorite without a doubt was Black Velvetopia with it's high contrasting neon colors, clever symbolism and absolutely badass theme music that all came together making me think "Mexican TRON Laser Tag".\n\nThis game is by no means a staple in gameplay standards or mechanics, but it doesn't have to be to succeed as well as it does. It's colorful, charismatic and so well thought out. Everything from story to gemeplay and sound design is executed on a level that many games of today aren't even achieving.\n\nThe last 10 years of game releases has been missing the kind of flavor that Psychonauts brings to the table. Creativity has been mostly been traded for "sellability" and unique and original concepts like these are almost non-existent in most AAA titles.\n\nIf I had one(and ONLY one) real complaint with this game it's that the rendered cutscenes look like absolute ♥♥♥♥ compared to the game itself. Had they rerendered them in higher quality or just did something to imprive their appearance this game might be damn near perfect as it stands.\n\nThis is seriously one crazy cool game. BUY THIS GAME.\n\nSupport funding for Psychonauts 2 so we can get a sequel!\n\nhttps://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2","December 13, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","1"

Memorable characters, timeless art design, great story, solid platforming.  Soundtrack's great as well, it runs on pretty much anything, get hyped for Psychonauts 2.\n\nPsychonauts doesn't look impressive judging by Steam's front cover, but store pages could never be more deceiving.  Psychonauts is definitely a must-have, that much is clear.  Excellent writing and level design make for an overall memorable game with plenty of secrets and lore to find on your own.  The story is very well-done and definitely grabs you within the first hour.  Not only this, but the choice of odd, cartoonish characters make the art style rather timeless despite being an Xbox Original.\n\nUpdated to be compatible with all modern platforms and with the excellent soundtrack for sale, you definitely need to get this one.  I'd talk about cons, but other than the occasional time getting lost (especially with Waterloo and the camp hubworld), I've got nothing bad to say.  Besides, let's face it, Psychonauts 2 is probably going to be excellent, so why not prepare for it?\n--\nOh, and one last note: For a low-end PC, this game's got you covered.  I was able to play through it on a Pentium E6600 and Intel GMA... even running on something that can't handle FEAR at 12 FPS is impressive, but it was fully playable at 800x600 with this extreme example of outdated hardware.  With Intel HD, 720p with a special effect won't be in the slightest a problem, and with a low-end GPU like the GT 620, it'll run perfectly at 1080p60.  With this little discussion on the hardware required now dealt with, you have no excuse to play it.","December 6, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Psychonaughts is just an all around great game. Sure you may encounter a glitch or 2 and some parts are frustrating because of how lock-on the controls are but those minor annoyances hardly brings down the overall experience. The dialogue is weird and hilarious at the same time and for me it's some of the best I have experienced in a game. Took about 20 hours to fully complete and get all the achievements. If you are a completionist i'd recommend googling the missable achievements just so you are aware of where and when to get them.

You do not need to spend long in this game to fall in love with it, but, if you spend too long in the game, the controls may drive you mad.\n\n[EDIT]\nUpon further inspection (i.e. playing through the last two levels) I have changed my mind. This game is pure punishment.\nI am a level headed person, but, by-jove, do I want to put my fist through my computer screen right now.\nThe game design as the game draws to a close is so poor that it makes you wonder whether they actually tested the last few levels.\n\nIn the penultimate level, you are climbing a precarious tower, with all the possibility of falling right to the start at any point, and the enemies are swarming rats. Now, this is not a bad point, but the fact the rats explode, leave a mist of confusion in their wake, turning all your controls around and also mirroring your screen, whilst doing nearly three points of damage each as well, is crazy.\nWith the narrow paths that you are taking at this point, you cannot kite the rats, and with the horrible camera controls, you can rarely see them, meaning you cannot target the rats with your psi-beams. Melee attacks cause them to explode anyways, so you’re screwed.\nIf you get hit by one of these rats, you get hit by all of them.\nShould you survive a wave of rats, they are infinitely respawning. So when you inevitably fall, or reach the next set of rats, you will get attacked again, and die.\n\nThat’s not even the part that got me most wound up, though.\nI worked through the god awful controls; the input lag; the counter-intuitive puzzles; the unresponsive scenery; the hideous camera control; the inaccurate, floaty jumping; the infinite spawning enemies, all the stuff that comes with old, out-dated games. The thing that really got me was the last level. It’s a bloody escort quest!\nNow let that sink in. An escort quest on a 3D platformer, where you have to protect an NPC from infinitely spawning enemies. It does not end there.\nThe NPC jumps ahead of you, and in order to protect him, you must platform over to him, completing puzzles as he gets attacked.\nOne of these puzzles is baiting knife throwers into hitting a rotating target-board, so you can grab the knife and then swing and jump onto the platform. They have a wind up, and a reload animation, and most of the time you won’t be able to grab the knife automatically.\nSo, whilst the NPC is getting wailed on by three evil bunny rabbits, you are waiting for the perfect knife throw, just so you can go round the board, only to realise that the jump at the top of the board requires you to leave at the perfect angle and move in the air despite the camera swinging around mid-jump. Queue plummeting to the start of the level. Queue the NPC dying and the level restarting. Queue my fist through my laptop screen.\n\nSave yourself a lot of hassle with this game. Find a YouTube play-through of the game with good commentary and relax.\nBuy this game at your peril.\n\nTL;DR - This game is like pulling teeth. Whether it's story line makes it worth it is debateable.","April 4, 2015","true","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The story is tight, and everything comes together seemlessly. I love the art and the soundtrack, and the characters have... well, character. Every time I play this game I find out something new. There are lots of hidden rooms, extra cutscenes, and little tidbits of information that you pick up each time. It's such a well-built world filled with character. I'm a writer by trade, and I love all of the ironic moments and plays-on-words. This game has what can only be described as charm.\n\nThe gameplay is great (I've played on the Xbox and the PC). Fighting is easy enough for those of you who aren't hardcore gamers, but it's still challenging and strategic, so it doesn't get boring.\n\nPsychonauts is my favorite game of all time.

It's a platformer in the same mold as games like Spyro or Ratchet and Clank and manages to be a lot of fun. The level design is amazing with some really entertaining and original levels, for example theres one level where you find yourself as a giant in a city  populated by fishmen and you have to rampage through it like Godzilla.\n\nThere's a lot to do in this game as well with lots of collectibles and different powers to unlock so theres plenty reason to explore the different levels and areas and there's a good 15-20 hours of gameplay if your looking to do everything.\n\nThe only downsides are that the graphics look quite dated and the camera angles canbe a bit awkward at times but not enough to impact on enjoyment of the game. Also while the game is probably better played with a controller the Xbox controller symbols haven't been added so it's a case of figuring out for yourself which buttons do what.Again this isn't a major issue.\n\nOverall this is a really fun game thats really worth playing.

I wish I would have played this back when its 3D was cutting edge, but it still holds up well enough thanks to the cartoony nature and Tim Burton-esque character and environment design. Following weird kids studying military combat at a psychic summer camp built on an indian burial ground (do you capitalize "Indian" when it's not technically the correct word to use?) the whole world is wonderfully warped and twisted, each drunken tree home to birds that explode from the power of your mind. And yes...the tin foil hat is an actual item. You don't have to play Psychonauts with a controller, but you'll probably prefer it if you have one to plug in. The gameplay itself is nothing groundbreaking, but the "flavor text" spin of the steps is very refreshing.

I first played it back in 2008 on the original Xbox and while I haven't yet completed it on steam, I still think it's one of the best single-player games I've ever played. Fantastic story, memorable characters, unique and fantastical art style and excellent controls (which are an essential for a platformer) all lend themselves to create an incredibly satisfying and fun game.

The trailer and screenshots didn't work that well on me and I mostly wanted it for the other game in the pack. And yet... I played this and... Whoa... This game is a masterpiece! It's a very entertaining game, without voilence, so good for all ages and those who simply don't enjoy killing. Also for those who normally do like bloodshed, I still think you'd find a refreshing change playing this. What genre is it? Hard to say. Kinda platformish, kinda RPG-ish. You control a boy learning to become a psychonaut, travelling in people's minds, where you jump around avoiding the dangers, collecting figments and sorting emotional baggage. You level up as you progress, which is why I say it's RPG-ish a bit too. It also contains a great story with lots of cutscenes, some minigames and it's extremely colourful and pleasant. I love it.","December 27, 2011","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An epic masterpiece on pretty much all levels, Psychonauts has it all. Platforming, exploration, collectibles, crafting, and of course - an absolutely ZANY world full of loveable characters (and not so 'loveable') set in a vast mostly open world that brings back childhood memories in bucketfulls of mischievious gaming bliss.\n\nAn absolutely superb game that has no equal = 9.5/10  (.5 taken off for camera 'weirdness' at times) = a MUST have and a MUST play!!","July 26, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Never played this on the original xbox, so there are no rose tinted glasses here. This game holds up very well for its age. When old games are hyped up a lot, I'm always skeptical, nostalgia is a powerful thing.\nBut this game absolutely lives up to the hype around it, and deserves its cult following.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone!","June 3","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played this for a little while I was shocked, on how good this game really was. I can always reccomend this game!
