Edmund wasn't ~amazing~ at making games yet, and it shows, but there's a lot of value here. The level design is cool (most of the time) and the music and stuff is all nice. Controlling Gish was quite fun and once you got the hang of it you could get him to do really neat things. You could throw enemies across the screen, do really cool parkour-esque platforming and tricks and stuff to get through levels quickly.\n\nYou've got to look past a few flaws, though. The unique platforming mechanics are hard to get used to it's turned many people away from the game, keeping them from giving this more than an hour or two of attention. I understand this. It's not a game for everybody. It's not rewarding enough for most people to warrant all of the trial and error, I think. Despite this, It's one of my favorite platformers and I love it.\n\nAt least, I used to love it.\n\nGish was recently updated. The achievements are now working, which is cool, but the game itself has gone completely to hell. You can now instantly kill yourself by moving the wrong way, or by squishing yourself against the ground or a rock, or by moving too quickly through a tight space. I've recently been playing the game for like an hour and a half and I killed myself dozens of times. Right now, the game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess and it's almost unplayable. I don't know if Crypric Sea are planning on fixing this or not, but as of right now, this game is terrible. It's a shame, because I really loved it a lot. If they fix the engine to where you aren't commiting suicide every 15 seconds, I'll change my review and I'll most likely play the game again and enjoy it thoroughly. Until then, forget about it.","April 17, 2015","false","34.6"," 65 of 84 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","65","84","5","12"

This is largly because of the game's unique mechanics. People who "get" them downvote negative reviews, and those who "don't get it" downvote the positive reviews.\n\nI've been playing this game with many people starting with the demo around 2004-5, specifically in sumo mode. I have not played the campaign, as I rarely play without friends. I have played 1000s of matches, and learned how to play.\n\nJumping is hard for some people. If you're a hater, you'll probably hate this game and give up, but if you learn how to jump, you'll admire the jump mechanic. If you play against serious players who've rocked this game 100s of times, you'll have a blast. It's a fun balance of creativity, reflexes and strategy that never gets old.\n\nThis is a great party game. Hooked up to a TV with 4 wireless xbox controllers, this game was a staple at a burger night. Everybody played, and even new players had a blast. The quick game resets and no load times make restarts a snap. It's also fun to watch.\n\nIf you don't have a TV and wireless controllers, use a projector 4 keyboards, or game controllers - they're $10 on ebay, or mix and match.\n\nIt's old, but it's good. This game was created in 2004, so the textures are a bit low res. The controls may seem alien at first, but once you learn, you can use crazy combo wall jump moves and squish the competition.","June 22, 2013","true","14.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","0"

Kind of disappointment." was my initial impression a few years ago when I first got it. I gave the game another shot recently and for some reason it clicked with me more. The game is absurdly frustrating at times, but it can be pretty compelling if you keep at it. The controls take quite a lot getting used to, and you should most definitely swallow your pride and play on easy mode! (the game is still plenty hard on easy mode, especially later)\n\nI do want to say that this is a CAUTIOUS thumbs up. The game is really a 6/10.","January 27, 2015","true","32.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaiier/recommended/9500/","xaiier","Xaiier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaiier/","87 products in account","I am writing this review primarily for those who have also reviewed it and have claimed that the controls are somehow bad.\n\nThe simple fact is that if you are finding the controls difficult, you are trying to play the game wrong. Trying to play this game like a normal platformer, staying on the ground, trying to time your jumps, and ignoring many of Gish's abilties will result in abysmal failure. Instead, your main focus needs to be on your momentum. Knowing the levels is key, so that you can plan out a route before hand which is fluid and smooth. Even a tiny change in your path can drastically change how you move across the terrain and can be the difference between leaping across a huge gap or flopping and losing all your speed. Jumping is everything. Setting yourself up properly for a good jump, even if that requires you to go out of your way or backtrack, can often lead to significantly improved times due to the extra speed you will carry out of it.\n\nThat being said, this isn't easy. Even beyond the ~15 hours I have clocked on Steam I had played the demo extensively many years ago. One of the great things you can do when you do get good at it is speedrunning it for fun, as I stated before the gameplay revolves around keeping your speed, and there are also a number of shortcuts, alternate routes, or even somewhat abusable physics bugs which you can use to your advantage.\n\nAs for other things, the Edmund McMillen style is nice, though the graphics and interface are clearly dated. There are a number of minor bugs in the physics which can be frustrating until you learn to work around them. Overall I think the uniquness of the gameplay outweighs the flaws.\n\nI'll end with a couple tips for those who want to become better:\n-tapping sticky while climbing allows you to climb much faster, it also helps while moving across the ground\n-being at high speed and then pressing sticky will cause you to compress down, allowing you to get a good jump in\n-holding slippery+heavy while in the tiny tubes will make you go faster through them, and sometimes you can launch out of the exit\n-slippery+heavy is optimal for pushing blocks around without getting caught up on them\n-while climbing, you can swing around 90 degree corners by tap-releasing sticky and using the arrow keys to shift your weight","January 1, 2015","true","29.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game's atmosphere is pretty dark and the story is kinda silly (ball of tar rescuing his human girlfriend from the ball of whatever that gray thing is...).\n\nOne of the main aspects of the game are it’s infamous controls which are hard for some to get into. Everything has to be done gradually. For example: you can’t just press jump and expect it to jump as high as it can, you need to start with small jumps first. The character has his “flow” that you must go with.\n\nIt’s not a bad game, it just isn’t for everyone. Controlling the character isn’t hard because "devs did bad job", it’s hard because it’s the challenge that is part of the game - which is going through levels and doing various stuff as a ball of tar that is affected by physics.\n","October 28, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The five worlds are made distinct by little more than sprite-swapped square bricks with new lighting colors.  There is a charming bit when you open the game  where the loading screen shows a poster of a pop culture icon with the main star replaced by Gish.  The Gishorcist, Gishheart, Gish Fiction.  But the real draw here is the unique and simple-but-deep gameplay, which still shines through today, making this a game worth a look.\n\nGish can jump, but it’s a pretty ineffectual maneuver.  To reach a ledge, you’ll need to gain momentum by jumping, compressing him down, and then releasing all that energy into a jump again.  Gish can also modify his body in a few important ways.  You can slide through narrow passages, increase your weight in order to crush enemies or obstacles, or make yourself sticky to cling to objects or surfaces (even ceilings).  The whole game is based around learning these different modifiers and applying them through each (relatively short) level.  This is a deep physics-based platformer, and you’ll develop a working understanding of momentum, trajectory, and crushing things with a tar ball.  Pushing a box onto a pressure switch is a much different experience when you can’t pick it up with hands.  You’ll need to stick yourself to it and propel it, or make yourself rigid and heavy to push it along.\n\nSome of the levels can get extremely frustrating, and a single mistake can cost you quite a bit of time spent retreading platforming sections.  Some jumps have very little margin for error, and the unique controls take a while to get used to.  This leads to situations where you know exactly what you need to do, but getting Gish to actually accomplish that in the physics engine can be difficult.  Especially frustrating is when objects like catapults or swings, which you need to use to progress, end up killing you randomly and draining you of precious lives.  A few bugs like this are irritating, but not game-breaking.\n\nBesides the main quest, there’s also a “Collection” mode and a Versus mode.  Collection mode tasks you with collecting all the amber pieces on a level within a certain time limit, and can be a fun challenge, and a great way to learn the systems at play before diving into the main story.  Versus mode is exactly what it sounds like.  You and up to 3 other friends compete to kill each other using different tar balls.  A fun little diversion, but not much else.  For as long as the game has been out, it seems the Steam achievements haven’t worked, but it appears that recently they have been fixed!  Finally, validation from Steam of my success in this game!  They’re still really difficult to get, however.\n\nWhile the game shows its age, and there are a few irritating bugs present in the systems, this is a title worth checking out for the sheer novelty of its control scheme.  Manipulating Gish’s body to take advantage of the physics at play is hugely rewarding when you finally master it, and Gish’s descent down to Hell and back is quite a fun ride.","April 5","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do know one trick on how to fool the program into using a controller but it's been so long since I've done it I've forgotten how. Trick is getting your controller directional buttons and buttons to read as key strokes and then match the keys in the keyboard set-up in the game to the controllers. But like I said I've forgotten how to do it or my system doesn't have the sub-routeens anymore. Either way I'm out of luck and this game is fun enough for me to try to get that old trick to work again. Until I do, I won't be Gishing because Gishing on a keyboard cramps fingers and gives me a headack.

Pretty fun, until you realize how frusterating this game is due to buggy deaths. Many of the platforms that move kill you randomly when they move fast, the lives system is terribly designed and just outdated. This becomes obvious once you hit the hell themed levels (world 3) and it gets significantly more difficult. You get 6 lives to get though every world which consists of 5 levels. If you die 6 times in any of those levels, you are sent back to the first level in that world. That may not sound so bad, until you experience randomly dying from stuff you didn't die from earlier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/9500/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1776 products in account","The idea of mechanics in Gish are innovative and creative, but the controls and implementation are absolutely horrible. The music gets repetitive, as it remains the same for several levels without changing. Then, there is the awful pseudo metal music with wailing that is completely unbearable. The game does not fit the entire screen even if you selected full screen in the settings. There are additional bonus levels as well as fan made levels that can be downloaded, but there aren't any reasons to bother. Plus, there are the local Versus multiplayer and Collection modes, with multiplayer possibly being where Gish may shine, as two people suffering through the horrible controls, physics, concept, and design might actually be funny. Each level is short but of adequate length because of the horrible controls, mechanics, and the time it actually takes to complete many of them. The story is nearly nonexistent, and the few parts where you are given a bit of background information on the character, it cuts off prematurely, without giving you a real chance of reading it. The level design is not well done, nor is it clever. They rely on the repetition of them for longevity and game play. The more difficult levels will force you to repeat them an extreme amount of times until you are able to get the horrible controls tamed. Once you are able to pass these levels, there is no feeling of accomplishment, and you are not rewarded for any of your success. The artwork is plain and unmemorable, going along with the game's general lack of charm. There is simply nothing interesting to look at while playing. Gish is not a platformer. It is an exercise in frustration and patience. The controls, mechanics, and physics are the worst I've ever experienced in a game. Accomplishing a simple, single jump, is something synonymous with a miracle, or some kind of supernatural phenomenon, if you believe in these sorts of things. The platforming (if you can call it that) is so disastrous, it is comparable to bouncing jello/jelly off of pieces of Legos, and hoping for the best. The controls are outrageous. I have never attempted a game with controls this unreasonable. It's like playing with a severe physical handicap. Gish is nearly unplayable. In the later levels, the only reason why they are able to be completed is almost by pure luck. The skills garnered by playing this game are so unprecise, that they can not be considered actual skills at all. It is a matter of chance that the physics of this train wreck behaved a certain way in order for you to proceed through the levels. I am a veteran of old school platformers, and never have I been so frustrated at the shortcomings of games of the genre before Gish came along. It is an example of game development malpractice and poor implementation of all aspects involved. Gish is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played. There is no excuse for a game of such rotten design to come out in 2004, let alone charge people to play it. Gish is a perfect example of how not to make a game.\n\nGish is awful.","March 20, 2014","false","7.5"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","10","29","0","0"

Originally released in 2004, it has stood the test of time boldly. Gish can best be explained as a puzzle platformer, but it's gameplay is unlike anything I've seen before. On top of that, the style and story are equally refreshing.\n\nThe main character is very likeable although he doesn't speak a word, and his unique moves make you chuckle every time. Hanging upside-down from a ceiling never gets old and neither does listening to the sound of snapping enemy necks.\n\nTechnically, this game works like a charm as well with hardly any hiccups and is still visually pleasing, not only because of its scaling resolution, but also because of its nice light effects.\n\nGish has a lot of charm, but not that of the cutesy type; it's really gritty, which combined with the excellent soundtrack makes for a hell of an experience that you'll remember long after first playing it... not something I'm able to say of a lot of games.","December 18, 2010","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At some point I just said to myself, why, why am I doing this. Am I enjoying myself? No. Am I enriching my life by playing this? No. So I uninstalled it, there, done, no more little shitball rolling around.\n\nIf you like moderately difficult repetitive platformers then this is right up your alley yo.
