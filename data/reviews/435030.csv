If you don't...then stay away. Even as a free game I rated it down due to the micro-transactions and energy system which really annoys me with these types of games. This game does have great parts but it is clearly following the mobile and facebook micro-transaction games that require you to wait time before you can do more levels or pay to get more energy or pay to buy items and unlocks. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are on a mobile platform or on facebook but I just feel that these sorts of games should be as far away from Steam as possible.\n\nAs a game, the graphics are great, the drawings and icons and world map and all the graphical elements are done really well, I do have to hand it to the devs who made this game for that. The storyline scenes at the start however are so low res you can see the pixels and how faded it looks due to the upscale of the video. Very poorly done.\n\nThere are some great puzzles in the game though especially when opening chests and having to connect the coloured dots. That is quite fun but time limited. I think overall it's a game that will appeal to those who are used to micro-transactions, and I'd enjoy this more if it didn't shove the desire to purchase at my face every two minutes. In addition, I cannot stand any game that has energy and stops you from playing and having to wait or pay for it to refill to continue. Games are meant to be played, not spent waiting until you can play it.","March 14","false","2.2"," 186 of 212 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","186","212","5","5"

The storyline is the same, the cut scenes are the same, the backgrounds are the same, the music is identical and of course the same beloved micro transactions.\n\nGames like this pull casual gamers in with the 'free to play' tag attached to it and once you're hooked on it, Awwwh, you're out of energy.

It reminds me of something you can find on Facebook, if it isn't there already. I guess it's alright if you like Mahjong with an adventure twist, but if you are looking for just a simple Mahjong game then I suggest looking elsewhere. This game is based around energy, just like any other Facebook game. If you run out of energy you can no longer "explore" to progress through the game without waiting or buying more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/435030/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","I wanted to write the review yesterday but my mind was elsewhere. Anyway, I've played a little more the game. So what's with this free-to-play game?\n\nLost Lands: Mahjong is based on the universe of Lost Lands, a hidden object adventure series set in another dimension or I suppose so because the games are done by the same people, with the same title. However, here, you take in your hands the destiny of the Elven Nation, crashed on a lost island, rebuilding their civilization and ready to set sail elsewhere if only a magical storm wasn't preventing them to do so.\n\nThis is the second free-to-play released by Five-BN. The first one, Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure, shares the same story, the same quests and the same mechanics. It means that apart the core gameplay (hidden objects - mahjong), nothing changed when the second was released. I've played Mahjong first because I love the solitaire version of this game and A Hidden Object Adventure came after. It also means that some passages have been copy/pasted to my review of the first game and that others have been rewritten.\n\nAnyway, I love Mahjong, especially the version here, the solitaire gameplay where you have to remove all tiles by finding pairs of them. There is nothing wrong here, I'm enjoying this.\n\nQuests, while needing explorations for anything (weapons, tools, ressources, etc..), can also involve "fights" with enemies, repairing buildings or using tools. Also, the more you're earning experience, the more you're leveling up and the more you're unlocking. There are also chests you can open, with various minigames (and not always easy). Everything is timed and the explorations, as the chests, cost energy.\n\nAnd that's bothering me, the energy regenerating slowly unless you buy some potions with the crystals you're earning. Crystals are pretty rare but there is the easy way: spent real money to acquire them (or to acquire more golds). Gold is mainly used for weapons for example. Here's an idea for the cost: 10 crystals = 0.88 euros - I've checked the next price and it's already nearing 10 euros).\n\nI don't mind having quests to do and I don't mind the level up system to access new locations. Even the shop isn't really bothering, as far as you can use the gold you're earning. However, preventing me to play a game because of a decreased energy on Steam, that's something I can't imagine. For me, that kind of gameplay is reminding me of my Facebook games time. Weirdly enough, it would have been on Facebook, I would have find it normal. Here, on Steam, I'm not at ease with the concept. Ubisoft released games about CSI and Assassin's Creed on Facebook, yet, the main series were totally different.\n\nYou'll probably find it weird that I'm bothered by the Facebook-like when the game is a free-to-play and that the concept of the energy is also there to push you to buy some (the game is also released on Android and iOS devices). But that's my feeling. Many people will feel that they're trapped and will want to advance. However, I tend to use a simple thought to avoid spending money: there is no rush. You're there for fun (I'm not reading the story though).\n\nAs for the rest, the graphics are acceptable and pleasant, the soundtrack being the same. If you played any other Lost Lands, you'll be in an familiar setting.\n\nIt's still mahjong, so I can overcome easily the energy bar, the game is still enjoyable. It's free basically, so try it but DON'T FALL INTO THE "NEED ENERGY" TRAP. If there are indeed micro-transactions, don't fall in that pit of addiction. You don't need to go forward immediately. Just quit the game and come back later. It's the best way to play these kind of games, because after all, you're not going to be attacked by another player, your quests aren't timed and besides, why would you rush?\n\nLast for all, why did I thumb up both games when only the gameplay changed? I'm enjoying them, they're free and besides, it's not like I'm wasting my money here...","March 23","true","68.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

This is a Mahjong game within a time management/puzzle type game.  You play a round of Mahjong to obtain items, gold and power-ups. You use the items to combine and reach a goal, which gets you more gold and power-ups. Yes...it is also a game with micro-transactions where you can buy extras that you aren't able to get. If you're a ♥♥♥♥-poor Mahjong player and/or want to play for hours at a time, then you'll probably have to spend money because you'll run out of energy. Normally, however, if you play about an hour or so and then return the next day, all your energy is restored and you can build up gold and gems to purchase incidentals without having to lay out actual hard cash. Also, every day there is a new bonus; it encourages to boot up the game on a daily basis. There are also puzzles to figure out to open chests where you can get more items. And leveling up gets you access to more places.\n\nI also like the natural sounds of birds, crickets, etc in the background along with light flute-like music.\n\nPersonally, so far, I like it. It's different. And, hello, it's free. It's ridiculous to complain about the micro-transactions aspect when you're not having to pay for the game and purchases are not required unless you're impatient. If it gets to a point where it becomes too annoying, I'll just delete it. Mahjong games are common place.\n\nI give it a 4 out of 5.","April 2","true","203.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/435030/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","One of those "quest" games with a lame story, that uses mahjong as its main game element.The premise is that you, an elf king of sorts, are stuck on an island and need to find a way to escape. There's not much of a story except you need to go find or gather items to help get yourself and your followers off this island. Booooooring.\n\nNot for those who want enjoy no-frills mahjong.This one contains loads of inane story dialogue, which is basically just you trying to transact with other creatures on the isle to get what you want. Though mahjong is the main game type here, there are other types of minigames as well, but I found them a tad lame, non-challenging, and just not fun in general. And the mahjong games are way too simple, and the interface too low-res to be appealing in any manner.\n\nI guess the point is to make you spend money.I didn't feel bugged by having to make any in-game purchases (though obviously this was the intention) to advance in the game, but this was simply because the game couldn't hold my interest quite enough to reach this point. I did get the (very strong) impression that paying actual, real-life money, was a bit of a necessity though. (Which I wouldn't have minded had this game been more interesting.)\n\nIt's just way too blah.I dunno. If I wanted to play mahjong, I'd download a "serious", "actual" mahjong game, and not this thing. And if I wanted a story-rich, narrative-driven game, I'd choose an actual adventure game and not this. This is neither here nor there - it tries to be both, and fails miserably.","April 28","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

O melhor Mahjong que se pode encontrar aqui na Steam.\nO unico con que eu percebi foi o fato do jogo abrangir aquele sistema de jogos do facebook: você só tem XX de energia, se gastar, ou compra energia ou espera recuperar em XX tempo.\n\nFora isso, o jogo conta com uma história muito legal, ótimas animações, ótimas artes, conquistas e o melhor de tudo: MUITS PUZZLES! Tem uma penca de puzzles diferentes pra completar, sempre visando missões.\n\nOBS: O jogo conta com um mapa, onde cada área tem seus 20 puzzles diferentes -ou mais.","April 25","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Especially if one needs to calculate which stones to remove if there are 3 available, so that you won't stuck at the end.\n\nAnd not to forget about the most annoying energy system, along with the fact that it's a pay-to-win "free" game.

Though this game has micro-transactions the player NEVER, EVER has to buy anything so this IS NOT a pay to win game.  The player can, of course, spend money for crystals and coins if they chose.  Remember this is a coffee break or lunch break game, meant to be played in 15-20 minute increments over days, weeks, possibly months depending on one's dedication or committment to the game.  This game can not be played to conclusion in one sitting.\n\nThis particular game Lost Lands: Mahjong (LL: M)  has the exact same storyline and pretty much the same achievements as Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure (LL: HO).  However, the developers have taken to heart all the comments, compliants and suggestions offered about Lost Lands: HO and improved the overall gameplay of Lost Lands: Mahjong immensely.\n\nFirst of all, steam achievements are earned at the first in-game achievement level up instead of the last as in LL: HO so LL: M is not the grind LL: HO is.  Secondly, the amount needed to level up has been adjusted to fit the achievement such as needing an immense amount of coins to earn that achievement versus earning a location and critter achievement which only requires a very small amount play or items.  10 stars per location and 10 weapons per critter to be exact.  (Just a note:  The coin achievement is very high, and seemingly impossible, however remember there are 15 locations and a player needs a rank of 21 to open the final locations.  Trust me the coins needed to level up that achievement will eventually come just through game play, just as night mode and silhouette mode achievements will come through play.)  Third, the utterly useless achievement UNLUCKY found in LL: HO (not being able complete the scene within the time limit) will probably be one of the first achievements anyone earns in LL: M considering the challenge some Mahjong boards present.  (Any board that runs out of moves is considered eligible for the count on the UNLUCKY achievement.)\n\nI definitely recommend this Mahjong game for just the amount of Mahjong boards that eventually can be played (10 per location x 15 locations = 150 Mahjong boards total.)  As far as achievements go (for those that care) I will probably have all these achievements before LL: HO (lololol)","March 15","true","16.8"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","12","27","2","0"

In the beginning it can be slow, as you have low energy and not very many gems or coin to spend. However, as you gain ground in the game and open new areas, you have more energy to use, you level up more, and overall things go a lot faster. From what I've played, its fun and you don't have to take it completely serious unless you're someone that likes collecting everything in-game, and even that doesn't seem very challenging.\n\nGive it a go if you've got nothing to do, you might find yourself enjoying it more than you thought.","March 28","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes the ancient game of mahjong more interesting having goals to shoot for and items to collect. I like to go a few rounds between my usual multiplayer games. I play free version and have no problem advancing and collecting stuff needed so far. Would like to find a 2 person or even some sort multi-player version of Mahjong again. Played one long ago but it was bit different than the traditional Mahjong solitary style layouts, which would be ok with me, something inspired by old style play. This game combines old style with new for interesting twist.","March 29","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is energy based so you will not be able to play for hours, yet... carefull use of level-up and energy items found in game can allow you to play for a decent amount of time. No more energy... go do the dishes or something.\n\nIf you have to buy some items, I'd suggest some stop timer (that I haven't use yet) since 3 staring a layout require you to beat it under 5 minutes.  You could also consider magnetic dust, for those times you did great on the time and layout but got screwed on the last few pieces (it shuffle them, success is not garanteed even then, so beware... yeah, I used the free ones given to me by the game).","May 1","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Also got motivated in rating this since I got something in return, but either way, I'd still reccomend this to any casual gamer).\n\nIt's a standard mobile to pc game, except that there's no real neccessity to pay, as nothing is overly demanding in that get everything right (what I mean to say is that messing up doesn't mean you have to pay real money to try again). The leveling up is an interesting enough part in that it makes me feel like I'm making progress regardless of if I remain in he same region for quite a while. On top of that, there's an assortment of rewards which might make for a longer gaming session until you wait, but I digress.\n\nThis game is worth it if you simply have a few minutes to spare (5-10 minutes), which means you don't need to invest yourself for a long period of time. At least, I highly suggest that's how you play, unless you want to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the energy system.\n\nAnyways, I don't know if this review will help, but long convoluted story short, it's an okay free to play casual game.","April 15","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also aggrivates me that full energy bar refills will be triggered (sometimnes more than one) and you already have a full meter.  Honest games will give you that additional energy until you have used it up, something this game needs to do as well to be fair.","April 11","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly there's a major drawback with only a limited supply of "energy" which is needed to do stuff (read your playing currency) and as you progress more energy is needed per map/field in order to progress further. Luckily you can expand your very limited energy level by getting xp or completing certain buildings, it's not an ideal situation.\n\nI could only play for about 30 minutes per session before running out of energy, a lot less time if I simply spend my energy on opening chests. Then a long wait is needed to get new energy or you have to spend crystals or items you farmed/bought in order to continue.\n\nIt's pretty addicitive if you like to complete stuff (achievement hunter) like I do, but there's still a few errors in this game, a very very low droprate of a certain key items somewhere mid-game that can take eons to get and some other minor issues like the reshuffle tiles item not really helping at all.","March 24","true","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this version has some improvements over the hidden object one, they didn't fix the ladder issue. As you play the game, you explore different areas to do the mahjong puzzles. Some areas you unlock later on will need "access keys" everytime you need to explore that area. All access keys can be farmed through buildings you repair - except ladders. You also need two ladders for every mahjong game you play in its area. You have no way to reliably aquire these ladders, which makes for a lot of unnecessary grinding to progress in the game. Really, after a few hours of gameplay (probably spread over a few weeks if you're not microtransacting your way through), it's all just grinding.\n\nIf you like mahjong, and you liked Lost Lands: Hidden Object, you'll probably like this game too. But I really don't recommend it to anyone. I wasted hours of my life for the achievements and now I hate myself for my worthless struggle.","June 2","false","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
