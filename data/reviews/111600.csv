Serious Sam Double D was probably the best result: a 2D sidescrolling shooter/platformer, where your shoot, jump, shoot, use a jump pad to jump higher, and shoot some more. This game likes shooting.\n\nThis game likes shooting so much that it implemented probably the stupidest, yet coolest weapon handling system in gaming history: you can find wrench-shaped connectors that let you stack any weapon on top of each other. Want to fire a shotgun, plasma rifle, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, flamethrower, and assault rifle with a single trigger? Now you can do it.\nThe XXL update also added a shop system, where you can buy additional weapon mods to enhance your guns with a variety of abilities. As a drawback, this introduced money grinding.\n\nThe plot is the funny kind of stupid, taking you all over the world (the series-defining ancient Egypt, the Jurassic era, and Pompeii) battling Mental’s forces, including new enemies like kamikaze kittens or rocket-legged monkeys. (The story mode in the base game is voiceless, but the XXL edition is fully voiced now.) It’s not much, naturally, but this game is more about the fun action, just like the original series.","October 20, 2015","true","10.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/recommended/111600/","thesickboy","SickBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/","483 products in account","This game got a lot of poor reviews since it isn't something that is likely to appeal to the sheeple mainstream, but I absolutely adore it. It is the most fun I've ever had in a 2d sidescrolling shooter, and for speedrunning or just generally screwing around it is a blast (especially once you get the jump pad and master its use). Sure, the premise/story/gunstacking/etc. stuff is silly and over the top, but this is Serious Sam! It's all *about* the insanity, and despite DDXXL being a kind of 'side game' to the FPS trilogy, it is actually one of my favorites.\n\nIf you like frantic shooters, tons of secrets to discover, advanced movement-based abilities, completely ridiculous scenarios, a very unique visual style, a decent amount of challenge modes, and just generally blasting the hell out of everything you see... Serious Sam Double D XXL is for you. Screenshots absolutely do not give it justice, and many of the videos I've seen just don't capture how fun it is to *play*.\n\nFor the traditional Serious Sam fans: I understand why you wouldn't really be interested DDXXL, but give it a shot as if it's a totally different franchise... I think you'll really enjoy it once you get used to its oddities. Yes, the campaign is fairly short. Yes, some of the challenges are just spam-fests. But it has fun enough gameplay and mechanics that you'll love to replay it over and over.\n\nAnd for those that like to speedrun, glitch, etc. this game is a treasure trove of awesomeness. Some may consider that a symptom of a buggy/predictable/whatever game, but it's really only like that if you're intentionally trying so I consider it a feature. Have fun breaking it to bits and seeing what kind of insanity you can cook up!\n\nMy only real complaint: the unlocked difficulty levels really aren't that much harder since you start with all your guns and upgrades that you got during the previous playthroughs. I really wish they had made the harder difficulties packed to the gills with more enemies and more difficult situations, but unfortunately the first few levels are pretty much exactly the same on harder difficulties as they are on the easiest. This really isn't that big of a deal (as I'm sure many find the game very, very difficult as-is), and more just a wishlist item if devs ever returned to it.","January 28, 2014","true","52.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/111600/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Serious Sam Double D XXL is a 2D shoot'em'up, one of the games that were part of Indie series of Serious Sam franchise, made by non-Croteam developers. Main feature of this shoot'em'up is ability to stack guns on top of each other. It was made by Mommy's Best Games in 2011, only to come out on XBLA in 2013 as XXL edition and then get Steam version updated to XXL as well. You can choose to play both Double D or DD XXL edition.\nIt also came out on Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade, but there isn't any reason to prefer it over PC version.\n\nMultiplayer is local only. So don't expect to play online.\n\nThe first thing you see is selection between Double D and Double D XXL edition. I suggest you to go after XXL edition immeditly. Double D has no vehicle levels, no coop and no special upgrades for weapons. Without special upgrades for weapons it just doesn't make you think much, you just open gunstacker menu anytime and put weapons into single stack for highest DPS and that's it. And thinking about choosing weapon is important aspect of Serious Sam so it's dissapointing. Other difference is saving anytime, editing gunstack anytime, your own explosions harm you and golden guns which are just lazy direct upgrades you get after beating game.\n\nI also can't help but to recommend a gamepad for this one. Well, it's XInput only, so preferably Xbox 360 one. Aiming with mouse really feels bad in this one.\n\nAnd indeed, at first it seems like an average twin-stick 2D shoot'em'up. It's not very hot. Art style is that ugly sloppy Flash style that scream comedy Indie. Music is also not good, either being annoying ambient or somewhat cool yet generic fight music.\n\nThen after some time of playing you will collect some guns and finally a wrench which is Gunstacker Connector. Trademark. Copyright. Awesomeright. You have a few stacks and you can put up to 6 weapons on top of each other in each one of them. This feature by itself wouldn't do much by itself, but thankfully they also implented Shop and Special Upgrades in XXL update. Pistol that allows you to hover in air while shooting, thompson that splits into two bullets after the first target it hits, shotgun that slows down target. That, and being able to edit gunstack only at checkpoints makes sure that you will create different stacks for each situation that you think of. Mind it, it has just enough depth only for lenght of this short game, but that's fine too.\n\nIt's just a shame that more of core gameplay is pretty unrefined. It does have some occasional puzzles and dynamics, but it also has some silly stuff, like when enemies spawn right in your face or just drag on.\n\nIt also has a bit more to it, with jumppad that you can throw anywhere. It's mostly used as the second jump. But sometimes you can use it to either reflect bullets nicely, though it's rare, or make enemies jump over you. But mostly, you use it to cheese challenge levels that you can unlock. Plus, vehicle stages are good fun. That unicycle.\n\nYou also unlock Serious difficulty and the second character in single-player after you beat the game. Character is same one as the second player, only some dialog changes.\n\nIt also has 2-player local multiplayer. As it's local I didn't get to try it. But it should be fun. There is cooperative where the second player can drop in and drop out in campaign anytime. And you can unlock arenas where you can shoot at each other, I think. So, coop and competetive. Yey.\n\nBut it's a pretty fine. Unrefined game with interesting idea that it goes with. Pretty good for a single walkthrough.","May 9","true","22.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The gun-stacking mechanic is fun and useful, and goes a long way in helping out your crowd control abilities. There are several unlockable challenges to try out, so the replayability is good.

Set in the Serious Sam universe with the types of baddies as well as the sheer number of them makes this an easy game to spend many hours within.\n\nYou start with just a basic gun, but soon you will have shotguns and tommy guns as well.  Instead of having to choose when to use them, or worse, which to use and which to leave behind, you can use them all AT THE SAME TIME!!  There are a total of 8 types in the game and you can have up to 6 guns in a stack.  Do you want laser gun, rocket launcher, tommy gun, flamethrower, chainsaw and grenade launcher, or maybe just 2 rocket launchers and 4 chainsaws if they get up close!\n\nYou can setup different stacks and easily switch between them in battle.  As you get the idea, there are a lot of options which open up quite a bit of strategy!\n\nAnd what about the cannon fodder (enemies), well, there are 20 different types ranging from the classics of Serious Sam to some new awesome and hideous contraptions.  The headless kamikaze, gnaar other foot soldiers and everyones favourite enemy to hate (the Kleer) all feature early on.  Later you will see the Biomechs, both red and blue .. and a surprise later!\n\nNew enemies will grab your attention and your aim.  They include the the Chimputee who has jetpacks for legs with a grenade launcher and an axe.  He sort of reminds of me Quakes Ogre, that is until you kill him, he squeels like a monkey and explodes in the air.  Other new monters include the Vuvuzelator which is a stack of pancakes that has forks for legs and vuvuzelators for weapons.  If you remember the 2010 Football World Cup, you will know what these are.\n\nThe enemies both old and new provide a challenge, but aren't too frustrating to battle with.  This is a good thing as you have 10-50 times the normal amount of monsters you experience in a regular 2d platformer!\n\nThe level design is great, there is a great mix from outdoors of Egypt, inside temples and some things which are just off the wall, but fit in well.  There are fun secrets to find, sometimes its just run and jump at the false wall, or platforms to find, perhaps there is a rocket jump to do!\n\nDo you know what else is great too?\n\nFun challenges in small arenas\na metal soundtrack that pumps up your adrenaline\nonce you beat the game, you can unlock "golden guns".  You are rewarded by using the guns and they get much more powerful!\nEasy to get 100% achievements\n\nFinally\nThe XXL DLC is free and really adds new dimensions to the game.  Weapons can be modified to get new abilities.\n\nSo do yourself a favour, pick up this game and install it.  Play it for 2 hours to get to the good guns and enemies and tell me if you think I'm wrong!","September 5, 2011","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Double D was one of 2012's most pleasant surprises, a budget-priced promotional title that managed the unthinkable and outdid the game it was designed to get people excited about. Normally I'd be in favour of leaving well enough alone, but Mommy's Best Games has taken everything that worked about Double D and built something even more spectacular on top of it.The 2D-action is crazy, there are lots of secrets to be discovered and Sam's humour is back to its old glory.","March 21, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's basically a not-so-pretty sidescrolling action/shooter game, similar to Probotector/Contra. You can jump up and down platforms, and there are quite a few secrets to be found as well. Other than that, it's just shooting at everything that moves. Except... there's a gun stacking feature. Meaning you can combine weapons to create the ultimate weapon. Have a rocket launcher ? Check. Have a shotgun ? Check. Combine these and you'll be shooting bullets and rockets at the same time. You can stack up to 6 weapons so near the end you'll have a lot of firepower. The humor is simple and a bit childish at times, but it's nothing big. There isn't a lot of story involved anyway. So you like Serious Sam ? And you like platforming AND shooting ? Get this ! If you said no to both of these questions; skip it.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","September 7, 2011","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well there is one way: if it were an adult swim game or show, because those people are devoid of any brain functioning whatsoever. Thankfully it isn't because the adult swim stuff is all garbage unfunny nonsense. Considering how the Serious Sam games are an aquired taste, or in other words suck ♥♥♥♥, I was expecting jack ♥♥♥♥ from this game. The last SS game I played was SS3 and it is one of the worst games I've ever played. The main thing the SS games have going for them is the wild creativity factor and that's about it. Everything else about them just sucks. Not surprisingly, this 2D version of SS is about a thousand times better than any of the regular SS games. Which considering how god awful they are, means that this game is just above average, just like the man, the myth, the legend, Mike Sanders.

You can stack guns, whats better than one shotgun?  How about 4 of them at one time.  Great game for new side scroller players and Veteran players since after the game is completed it unlocks Serious Difficulty which adds massive amounts of enemies everywhere.  Tons of replay value with arenas or challenges.  This game is so much fun its like being hit in the face with a bottle of Grolsh!\n\nFor SERIOUS gamers, play this game, dont have it?  Go get it!

But my doubts were fixed pretty quickly. This game may even be better than the main series in many ways. Now before you call for my hanging let me explain. Besides the gun stacking thing (which is very cool and highly appropriate for the series) this goes way past 11 in the ridiculous scale. For example, you build bridges and ladders out of the bodies of the monsters you kill and you ride around on such contraptions as a dynamite powered unicycle.\n\nThe game is also just plain surreal in some ways. Moreso than the "kill all the things that spawned in ancient egypt because time travel" thing. It would appear that Mental's army was taken over by a freakishly tall (but somehow still having tiny legs)... Thing that resembles a combination of prawn and human. The designs of the monsters are pretty weird even by Serious Sam standards. The other art like that of weapons and NPCs is pretty good too despite being a little disconcerting due to the proportions. Which is intentional I'm guessing.\n\nand yes, there are also secrets. Many of which are weirder than the main series'. There is also a notification icon that appears when you're in proximity to one. Something I really wish Serious Sam proper had. Some may argue that it defeats the point of a secret to have an icon. But those people are silly. Also you can disable it.","December 26, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The “gun stacker” is a cool new feature which literally lets you stack multiple weapons on top of each other in order to increase your output of chaos and mayhem. The system itself is not very deep because the guns have very little functionality beyond doing more damage; there is nothing particularly unique about the new guns that are obtained during the game. The art style is good for the eyes, and the monster design is outrageous to the point where it’s amusing; there are giant hamsters on wheels that can kill you! The environment variety is plentiful, I wish can say the same thing about the music. Sadly this iteration of Serious Sam has very weak replay-ability, beyond just getting the achievements and secrets.","August 16, 2012","true","18.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I always try to be fair and find something good to say about a game but in this case I honestly can't think of anything. Its difficult to aim with a mouse and jumping doesn't always seem to work when running. Enemies have an annoying tendancy to spawn in your exact position, even when you're moving around, making it impossible to avoid taking damage. The story is non existent (it makes SS1 and 2 look like works of Shakespeare), and its very short. I got to the end boss in 2.5 hours, although there are some challenge modes if you really want some replayability. And its nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is.

I'll be honest, i bought it on a sale with 0.99 Euros. What a deal! The game deserves more than this. For that price at least, the game has a lot of content an replayability. So, theres the story. Not very long, but fun. Some lighthearted humour here and there. A lot of secrets though, and some are realy intresting. There's the 1v1 arena, for two players. You can change damage multipliers, time and your loadout. It can get quite hectic. There are challanges too. The cool thing is they have a goal, but can keep going forever. The fact that the story and the challanges can be played co-op instantly adds to the replayability. Co-op is local only though, and whent things start to get crazy, it can be difficult sometimes to find yourself on the screen. The gun stacking is cool, i'll admit, but it looks a bit stupid. Not the plethora of different projectiles, that looks very cool actualy, but the guns look silly on top of each other. Also, if you put a tommygun on top of the stack, it'll probably miss the enemy. I's not that big of a problem though, you can play just fine. And the enemy model also look nice, very hi-res. Those are my thoughs about it. You should grab it if you like chaotic sidercrolling shooters.","April 30, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since the "Serious Sam" bundle was so stupid cheap not too long ago (Oct. '14), I installed it just to see what it was about.\n\nWhat I found was a glorious hybrid of "Contra" and "Borderlands". The gun stacking mechanic can be as ludicorus as you want... provided you've found enough weapons and connectors, and purchased the mods. Gameplay is not at all complex, though there are a few physics puzzles that will challenge you. Old school gamers who know when to run left, jumper high, or look for hidden paths will be rewarded.\n\n"Double D" is even more over the top than the regular Sam games, and is genuinely funny. Especially on a second playthrough after you unlock Huff. After a few hours of Sam Stone's ultra-serious machoism, you get to experience the whole thing again with Huff's ultra-redneck belligerance. Really, the plot is non-sensical and non-existant. The characters are cartoonish, and the worlds full of in-jokes and Internet memes. So yeah, a lot of "Borderlands" flavor, only you're not stuck with just one gun at a time.\n\nI highly recommend a second playthrough with Huff on higher difficulty. You'll have all the mechanics down pat (and all your upgrades), and will need to be challenged. Plus, Huff's dialogue and cutscenes are great fun, even if you're blasting the same enemies. There're just more of them.\n\nController support is just fine, so it makes a great pick-up and play game. The graphics have a hand-painted look that hold up very well in HD. I haven't tried local co-op, but it's a shame there's no online feature. Not a dealbreaker by any means, though. Good value for under $10, a steal at anything less. Don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for yourself or gift to a friend. Seriously!","October 24, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's practically devoid of any challenge. Everything about the game makes it needlessly easy. You start off with aiming assistance and a nice big line of arrows aiming for your targets. You can climb higher, meaning enemies can't reach you and they run around uselessly. So the typically destructive kamikazes run around screaming while you pick them off from a higher platform. And then there's the weapon stacking. They let you fire multiple weapons at once. That sounds awesome, but it makes the game practically impossible to lose. I turned off all the assistance features and restarted the game on the hardest difficulty and it was still one of the least challenging games I've ever played. And I'm not exactly a champion speedrunner, I'll still go down like a truckload of anvils if I play sidescrollers like Contra or Alien Hominid.

Serious Sam Double D is a 2D sidescroller with guns... allot of guns. The mechanics in this game aren’t too different from other 2D shooters, just walk right and shoot everything in your way. However the innovation comes in when you start to use the guns. Every gun you have can be stacked onto each other and all shot at once. This allows the player to choose how to kill in whatever way they want. The weapons are also varied; from chainsaws to flamethrowers to laser rifles there is little reason to be disappointed. The enemies are varied too, from the signature kamikaze bomb hands to dinosaurs you won’t run out of things to shoot at. The game doesn’t look to special in its presentation but it’s not likely you will have time to admire the scenery anyways. The length is also a disappointment clocking in at  3-4 hours on normal difficulty, but with such a fun gimmick its still worth a purchase.","July 13, 2012","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Serious Sam: Double D successfully translates Croteam's signature chaotic FPS action into a two-dimensional format. Perpetual growler "Serious" Sam Stone once again goes rip-roaring through time, slaughtering Mental's alien hordes en-masse, once more in Egypt but also in the Jurassic and to Pompeii, circa the infamous Vesuvius eruption. Netricsa, the snarky AI in Sam's head, is once again audible as seen in Serious Sam II, providing running banter. The game has very tight controls for a platformer and mouse aiming in the vein of Abuse and other 2d PC shooters. Double D's signature gimmick is a nifty item known as a "gun stacker". Gather enough of them and you can stack any six weapons on top of one another and fire them all at once. It's exactly as ridiculous as it sounds, and twice as entertaining. As Sam himself says, "double your gun, double your fun", so why not keep going? There are four copies of each weapon to be found in the game, including series staples such as the repeating laser cannon, chainsaw and rocket launcher, as well as a newcomer in the flamethrower. Each can also be upgraded into one of four specialist types, such as adding a prism to the laser that splits its beam into three. Sam also can use a redeployable jump pad that sticks to virtually any surface. Combining this with a particular upgrade to the basic machine pistol that allows Sam to glide is necessary to access many secret areas. Series regular enemies appear, including gnaars, biomechanoids and of course, the headless kamikazes, but several new, even more ridiculous enemies appear, including animate stacks of carnivorous pancakes, monkeys with axes for hands and jet thrusters for feet, and lava men riding pogo sticks. I can't make this ♥♥♥♥ up. Overall the game's difficulty is significantly lower then its parent series, possibly due to the ability to wield six guns at once, but its no less a zany and entertaining experience. This "Double Extra Large" version features 2 player coop local or online. In addition to the campaign, several standalone challenge levels are available, as are versus arenas, but these must first be unlocked in the campaign. If you love the Serious Sam games as much as I do, then you'll love Double D, especially for the price.","August 25, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perpetual growler "Serious" Sam Stone once again goes rip-roaring through time, slaughtering Mental's alien hordes en-masse, once more in Egypt but also in the Jurassic and to Pompeii, circa the infamous Vesuvius eruption. Netricsa, the snarky AI in Sam's head, is once again audible as seen in Serious Sam II, providing running banter. The game has very tight controls for a platformer and mouse aiming in the vein of Abuse and other 2d PC shooters. Double D's signature gimmick is a nifty item known as a "gun stacker". Gather enough of them and you can stack any six weapons on top of one another and fire them all at once. It's exactly as ridiculous as it sounds, and twice as entertaining. As Sam himself says, "double your gun, double your fun", so why not keep going? There are four copies of each weapon to be found in the game, including series staples such as the repeating laser cannon, chainsaw and rocket launcher, as well as a newcomer in the flamethrower. Each can also be upgraded into one of four specialist types, such as adding a prism to the laser that splits its beam into three. Sam also can use a redeployable jump pad that sticks to virtually any surface. Combining this with a particular upgrade to the basic machine pistol that allows Sam to glide is necessary to access many secret areas. Series regular enemies appear, including gnaars, biomechanoids and of course, the headless kamikazes, but several new, even more ridiculous enemies appear, including animate stacks of carnivorous pancakes, monkeys with axes for hands and jet thrusters for feet, and lava men riding pogo sticks. I can't make this ♥♥♥♥ up. Overall the game's difficulty is significantly lower then its parent series, possibly due to the ability to wield six guns at once, but its no less a zany and entertaining experience. This "Double Extra Large" version features 2 player coop local or online. In addition to the campaign, several standalone challenge levels are available, as are versus arenas, but these must first be unlocked in the campaign. If you love the Serious Sam games as much as I do, then you'll love Double D, especially for the price.","August 25, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A side-scrolling shooter based on a frenetic FPS? Turns out I was wrong to be sceptical. SSDD features a unique gunstacker system, oodles of replay value, and humour that is faithful to the original games. A worthy addition to your Serious Sam collection.","October 26, 2011","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
