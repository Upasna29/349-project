A lot more character, but unfortunately a bit less substance.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Unique and mostly well-executed theme. The barren hopelessness of the Old West combines well with fire and brimstone. Sluggish but hard-hitting Western firearms combine well with demonic powers, even if the source of these powers aren't all that explained.\n\n+ Story is creative and compelling, drawing well from the "Weird West" genre. Several characters' stories intertwine into a bigger plot.\n\n+ Mimics a lot of what XCOM does well: positioning, unit building, a variety of guns, consumables, and throwables that are mostly fairly useful.\n\n+ Large amount of equipment available. Clothes provide buffs, throwables are one use but can heavily disable enemies, consumables replenish or modify stats, and there's a decent variety of guns. After the standard Winchester, Colt SAA, Henry and the ilk are taken care of, they delved into a weird selection of failed prototypes that time forgot, as well as a few interesting creations of their own. While some direct upgrades are present, there's good reason to stagger your types of firearms and equipment used.\n\n+ "Deck" system allows you to stat buff characters using playing cards you find in your travels. These modifiers are very powerful but need to be carefully allocated and usually have a tradeoff.\n\n+ The "Luck" system is a great "check and balance" system to XCOM's RNG bullsugar. All characters start off with a luck bar which can be modified with consumables. Luck is used for powers as well as the more luck in your luck bar means you're harder to hit. If an enemy misses you with a 50% chance of hitting you, you lose 50 luck, meaning you're safe from damage but will be easier to hit. Additionally, helpful AoE and insta-kill powers will consume 80-90 luck, gambling an all-out offense by sacraficing your defense. Milder 10-30 luck powers can also be used. GREAT system.\n\n+ Difficulty is tweaked well. There's a casual romp, a decent challenge, and a flat-out punishment should you desire any of those.\n\n+ Sound assets are well done. The only voice acting I've encountered is your humble narriator who plays the part excellently.\n\n+ The writing in the travel sequences as engrossing and intelligent. Text isn't often wasted.\n\n+ Maps are well designed on the technical plain. Asthetically, they can look a tad samey but are gorgeous nonetheless.\n\n+ On the technical side, the graphics aren't impressive. On the asthetic plain, the visuals are grimly beautiful.\n\n+ Minimal performance issues.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+- Themes might counteract each other too much to some. Those looking for a good Western might be put off by shrieking demons and cannibalism. Those looking for a good horror game might be washed out a bit by historical context.\n\n+- Between battles, there is a map your little marker can traverse. To compare it to anything, it's like a "choose your own adventure" book, or the system jumping in FTL: Faster Than Light. Each scenario has their own spin on this. One scenario leaves you struck for cash and restricts your travel with crimelord taxes. The other segment makes your character progessively more insane and debuffed as he "jumps" to different locations. Others leave your travel much more free but have different systems like managing your small army of explorers or following a compass.\n\nWhile it's neat that each scenario has a new mechanic to work around, the fact that each scenario only lasts about 1-3 hours means once you've fairly effectively learned how to curtail setbacks, you're forced into a new scenario and have something entirely new to learn. It's interesting but removes the engagement of strategy learned over time.\n\n+- Scenarios involve lots of reading. Between the paragraphs of flavor text are little bits of vital information used for making decisions. While the writing is definitely well done, I am a man of horrid attention whose pet peave is having to read in video games. The game could have benefitted from a bit more voice acting.\n\n+- No manual saving. This would be a flat-out con if the scenarios were longer. As it stands, I think not being able to revert a save in a two hour engagement adds tough, but fair consequence to choices.\n\n+- Some levels offer a stealthy "setup" phase. It's a neat little risk-reward feature where giving your posse stealth-related bonuses, stripping them of tougher weapons for higher concealment, and staggering them throughout the battlefield can potentially make the objective a lot less painful. However, the sluggish pacing of mobilizing units and exploring the map in this phase, as well as the lack of fleshing out leaves it as neat, but hardly noteworthy.\n\n+- The music. What's there is not Call of Juarez or Red Dead Redemption impressive but it's more than serviceable. Some great rustic slide guitar tracks sit alongside organ and choir-driven demonic chantings. HOWEVER, these tracks are quite short and loop frequently. Couple that with the fact that there are only about five or six tracks in the game and you will be SICK TO DEATH of the music by the game's end. Definitely needed more themes, but those that are there are enjoyable.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- The enemy variety; compared to something like XCOM, was a bit lacking. The only diversity in enemies comes from their differing stats and choice of firearms. The only thing special about demonic enemies is their truckload of HP and occassionally you might have to shoot one of their alters to pieces in order to make them vulnerable.\n\n- No "Overwatch" feature! (This is sacraficing an action point in the turn to set up your units to attack anything that moves in front of their view during the enemy's turn.) This is something I gravely miss from XCOM. Mockingly enough, all the enemies are in passive "Overwatch" if you approach them too closely.\n\n- Scenarios can be replayed for different choices but there's not much reason to play beyond that. You can spend a lot of time outfitting characters for a scenario that's over in about 1-3 hours. The only way to return to that posse is to restart the scenario with none of the gear. As detailed as character building is, you don't have long to use them.\n\n- Character avatars are simplistic and often misrepresent the character's appearance. Running out of text in this review here; put simply, character portraits and most awesome looking firearms are not mirrored on the 3D battlefield.\n\n- Some scenarios have random loss of party members. One scenario in particular had pushed me to the point of fury in which about three party members were shuffled in and out toward the end. It's extremely frustrating having spent a good fifteen minutes purchasing and organizing equipment and skills amongst gunslingers just to have two of them swapped out in the last second and have all their carefully chosen upgrades thrown back into the upgrade pool.\nIn this respect, the narriative annoyingly interrupts the gameplay.\n\n- A couple different endings. They're both a tad underwhelming considering all that multiple parties have done to get there.\n\n- A couple crashes to desktop, as well as the character outfitter UI lagging inexplicably sometimes.\n\n\nOVERALL:\nA great strategy game. Some great ideas that do fights extrarordinarily well.\nOutside of fights, the writing details bizzare and unique locales justly. If you're looking for pure XCOM "build your units and put them to the test" gameplay, you might be dissappointed. Narriative takes the front seat, meaning your planning can be occassionally compromised and your progress often reset just so the story can be told.\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\nA prolonged campaign, perhaps similar to XCOM's "Long War" mode or even just its normal 20-30 hour campaign. Also; while the AI is usually smart, I'd like to see its tactics/units change a bit more. Perhaps even a more nuanced soundtrack?","December 25, 2015","true","16.9"," 165 of 174 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","165","174","3","2"

No base building, but mining for cash/other ways to get items\n– Supernatural horror elements, doesn’t feel “magicky”\n– Cards offering special abilities are well done & cleverly integrated, doesn’t feel tacked on\n– Combat is pretty simple – a little too much for me – with use of cover the most important thing. Being out of cover is sure to get your people killed.

The look and feel of the west is great from the sound effects, music, narration, and art direction.  The cell shading, fantasy/horror plot, and story telling really nails the comic book vibe.\n\nThen you have the game play, I've played my share of games in this genre and this one does cover/terrain as good or better than any others before it.  You are pretty much a glass cannon no matter your build and if you stand in the open you loose.  Careful movement and placement are a huge part of the outcomes of the battles.  j\n\nOn the mechanics side, the luck system is a nice resource management system, the cards add a lot to combat and making hards for buffs is a nice bonus to make it more complex.  They could add the whole deck to make it better, once you get so far it does get repetetive.\n\nThe downsides are there as well.  Inbetween fights is not the best, the stories were good but it got bland.  The chapters are short and you start over after each one loosing a sense of progress with your team.  After you finish a chapter you go back to the main menu taking you out of the game and ruining any imersion you have.\n\nNot a perfect game, it has flaws but a really great game and I hope we get a sequal because if they iron out some of the flaws it could be a really epic game.","December 6, 2015","true","23.6"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","51","55","0","0"

It uses many of its mechanics but that's only normal for a game of the same genre. Think XCOM combat together with a world á lá Heroes of Might and Magic and some Commandos resemblance.\n\nHard West is dark, emotionally strong and it gives you the freedom to write your path with role playing present. After completing the first scenario (see it as a map you complete after exploration and combat missions) you're given the choice to take different branches that will, in one or another, be related with the main story. You start by believing in this wild west theme and it is but after some clues you quickly understand there's something more, something super natural. I would have preferred to keep it real but have to give them the credit, it's original.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a First Look into the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehWE2UHDHC4&list=PLBqXrq67D6ooHk9drYSFDxURYRMCCUc-v&index=1","November 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 56 of 69 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","56","69","0","0"

Here are my 6 hours in observations:\n-Difficulty is quite serious. For now, hard feels actually hard. Far harder than Dragonfall on very hard or Wasteland 2 on ranger in Arizona\n-AI seems decent. Enemies are good in flanking. Usually when enemies are leaving cover they do it to make more damages to the player, althrough sometimes they stay in the open carelessly. Also they don't know how to effectively fight against players using top building floors.\n-No hp sponges. 2-3 bullets and both enemies and players die\n-First mission after tutorial has a good encounter design. (defending a house)\n-There is a possibility to start the tutorial as a tutorial or as a normal mission. There is written a promise that it is short and to the point which is true. The best part: if player declines playing it as a tutorial then he must deal with a quite strong opponent on the start which is not attacking during tutorial:)\n-As most enemies and player can't stand more than 2 hits, positioning is vital. Fighting is deadly and fast. Enemy can quickly turn tables with a good shot.\n-Encounter design is fantastic. Had a rescue mission which looked as it was supposed to be done with minimal killing. Game respected my choice to kill everybody and after eliminating everyone on the map mission was successful without a need to complete an objective of opening the prison doors. Had an optional mission which starts the player surrounded and outgunned. It was thrilling and challenging. Maps are small, often reused, but different enemy placement makes encounters feel distinct.Big number of covers and hight places offers many approaches on how to tackle objectives.\n-Ricochet ability is fun.\n-Luck mechanic is really interesting. It works as a mana pool for abilities, but it protects from being hit. The more severe a hit chance is the more luck it takes to stop it. Luck is automatically used for that purposes. Being hit and losing hp replenish some of it.\n-There is some environment manipulation. Could open wells doors to improve its cover. Environment can be destroyed like windows.\n-Abilities are presented as cards which can be assigned to characters. Looks like 1 ability cannot be used by 2 different characters. You can take 5 of them on missions. Depending on which one you have chosen, you can get a passive buff on top of their standard uses. I suppose those bonuses are poker inspired.\n-Rotating camera is horrible. Don't understand why they can't bind it to the mouse. It's worse than Wasteland 2 camera. Also when the enemy from different hight attack, camera should change the height, now it is always on the same level when it was left during player turn.\n-Height seems to influence aim and range.\n-Enemies can do overwatch. It looks player cannot use it. I had many times when I was begging for overwatch.\n-The biggest surprise: CYOA. This part is good enough it would be acceptable if it was a game in itself. There are many C&C moments which actually include consequences! Game autosaves, so I didn't retry anything but results were enough specific it seems highly unlikely both options led to the same outcome. In scenario I played the main goal was collecting gold, which was quite complex with many tools, ways to do it and hidden mines. Got even an optional mission.\n-Writing and story are really good. Love the character of the devil who is a mysterious, well dressed gentleman who appears and disappears on the whim tempting people.\n-Game has a nice aesthetic and art direction.\n-Looks like there are secondary objectives/consequences to missions (having to pay gold if hired merc dies)\n-Always had luck with bugs but so far haven't encountered any. Enemies think a little too much before turn. Game runs smooth, but I have a good pc.\n-There is an ironmode and a mode in which being low on hp gives debuffs, but there is more xp.(or skill points, whatever is used)\nHad a good feeling when buying it, but (as for now) it surpassed expectations. I recommend this. We may have got a sleeper hit.","November 20, 2015","true","31.9"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/307670/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","The resurgence of XCOM inspired a lot of hopeful talk over other settings and themes to apply the squad-based strategy formula to. Hard West follows up on one of the more promising concepts, a turn-based western shootout. Honestly, who wouldn't want to maneuver a team of gunslingers through a dusty town, sending bandits Wilhelm-screaming off of rooftops? After a few hours with Hard West, however, I found myself doing a lot more number-crunching and restarting than gunslinging.\n\nThe first thing you'll note about Hard West is that it is not a grand campaign of cowboys and desperados, but rather a series of isolated scenarios. Each contains five or six battles split up by a sort of text adventure played out on a game board. You travel to different locations, trade for weapons and items, and make choices that can have dramatic impacts on your characters. Most scenarios also have unique gimmicks, like prospecting for gold or patenting inventions. These parts of the game are charming and feature some decent writing and a few surprises.\n\nBut you're not here to read, are you? You're here to gun down bandits, and I guarantee it doesn't work the way you'd expect. Battles in Hard West play out on familiar grid maps, with movement ranges, action points, full and half cover, and hit percentages that you probably remember from XCOM. However, there's an additional system layered over this called Luck. Each character has a reserve of Luck, and when someone shoots at them, the hit percentage is compared to their current Luck. If they have more Luck, the shot misses and an equal amount of Luck is deducted. If the percentage is higher, they get hit and gain some Luck back.\n\nWhat this actually means is that everyone has two effective health bars in Luck and their real Health. You can flank an enemy and fire an 80% likely shot into their face, but if they have enough Luck you're still going to miss. Conversely, a group of enemies shooting at someone in full cover is inevitably going to hit them no matter how low the shot percentages, because all those bad shots will eat away their Luck. Gaming the Luck system with poor shots before firing the real one then becomes a priority, which takes a lot of the excitement and tension out of battles. Cover is also vitally important, doubly so because weapons do less damage against half and full cover, often only a single point against full cover.\n\nThese systems not only make battles more deterministic, but also limit your options in terms of gear and skills. You'll find tons of strange and beautiful weapons in your travels, but only the ones with the highest damage or can fire more than once per turn are desirable because of the cover and Luck rules. Skills are even more restricted because many of them require a Luck expenditure to use, so if they don't get you almost entirely out of danger somehow they're not really worth it. The card system that grants skills is clever, though, allowing you to form poker hands for additional bonuses. Ironically, cards are granted randomly after battles and are limited to the scenario you find them in so you're restricted again in both strategy and progression.\n\nThat's the essence of Hard West, a clever game limited in some very unfortunate ways. The story is an interesting tale of revenge, monsters, and madness but it follows too many character across the scenarios to grant any really gratifying resolutions. Since it's all story-driven, you'll always have characters that earn you a game over and a reload if they bite it. Usually the non-essential characters stay dead if they die as well, which can lead to some aggrieved reloading that fans of Fire Emblem will be familiar with.\n\nThe 3D maps and characters look good and are well animated, but run into graphical quirks like shots passing through cover and geometry more often than not. The 2D cutscenes are presented in a pretty unfortunate style as well that I can't see anyone really enjoying. I could go on, but it pains me to do so. The world deserves a good strategy western, and Hard West had all the marks of one going in, but a mountain of poor design choices are bound to hamper your enjoyment of it. I'm not even sure I'm going to stick it out to the end, so I can't rightly suggest anyone else do the same.","May 8","false","8.3"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","46","61","2","4"

(more details below)\n_Good voicework and script.\n\nCons:\n_Graphics ain't gonna blow you away.\n_Could use a better tutorial.\n_UI isn't the cleanest.\n\nIs it worth the $20 price tag:  You bet your ♥♥♥, Billy. It's fun and unique, and stands on its own strength. I mean, I put down Fallout 4 to play this. Enough said.\n\nNow for more details...\n\nThe gameplay hook:  A turn based shootout sim focused on cover and positioning. You take cover and carefully plan your next move, while taking every pot shot at the enemies you can. Combat is very familiar here: You move, try to flank your enemies, shoot, move, reload, use abilities, etc. It's super competent, and fun. Not to say there's nothing new here, but we'll cover that more below. Hard West trades in XCom's base building and research for a choose-your-own-adventure naration between combat missions. It feels more like an RPG with meaningful choices and an emphasis on story-telling. There's also a skill system that feels a lot like the perk system in older Fallout games and give your characters a lot of uniqueness.\n\nOn the topic of interesting game mechanics:  Characters have luck, a visual representation of their survivability. A shot that might look like a hit could miss if your character's luck is high enough. As good thing happens, though, their luck will start to drain, putting a more literal meaning on the phrase "out of luck." It's really cool, fits with the Western setting and is an interesting mechanic. The game's unique supernatural edge also makes gameplay more interesting. For example, one of the skills you could pick up gives you the ability to canibalize corpses to regain health. It also gives you some oportunity to fight demons and cultists alongside your standard bandits and cowboys.\n\nThanks for reading!\nIf you liked the review, consider hitting the thumbs up so more people can see it, and join my Steam group in order to be notified everytime I review something, as well as meeting and interacting with new people.\n\nSubscribe to my Youtube channel, where I cover new, obscure games in video format.

After each scenario, the game sends you back to the main menu as though you'd just finnished a chapter in a book, but the next chapter wasn't out yet.\n\n-The combat is straight out of XCom/Jagged Alliance.  That's not a critisism as much as it is an observation.  If you don't like those types of games, you won't like this one.\n\n-Even though it seems like there are different approaches to reach the objective for a map, so far they just boil down to "kill any and everything that moves".  That may change further along in the story, but the only "stealth" mission I did still ended up forcing me to gun down all the bad guys to escape.\n\n-Characters come and go pretty much on a whim.  Fortunately you don't lose any equipment as the character dumps their gear in your inventory pool when they bail, but anticipating an upcoming battle only to end up having to go in a gun down with nothing to say about it is kinda rough.\n\n-Difficulty options and ironman modes add replayability.\n\nOverall, the game seems solid and decently put together.  Yeah, one gun looks like the next but ultimately, if you see a guy with a rifle, he's got a rifle.  If that rifle has a scope, it's a sniper rifle.  Pepperboxes have their own look as do revolvers and shotguns.  It would be nice if everything had its' own unique image, but there aren't any surprises.\n\nAll said and done, Hard West is a very functional tactical strategy game set squarely in an old west setting with a supernatural spin.  First impressions give it a solid 7/10.","December 28, 2015","true","21.4"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thuzar/recommended/307670/","thuzar","Thuzar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thuzar/","478 products in account","Where to start - this game has some phenomenally well-written story in choose-your-own-adventure style on the tactical map, with twists that follow basically every decission you ever made in the scenario. The main story-line (dealing with Warren, from the "Hard Times" scenario all the way to the last scenario in the line to the right, a total of four scenarios) has been a blast to play, and I have yet to tackle the remaining four scenarios (and I reckon it will take me double, or even triple, the amount of time to clear everything on hard+injuries+ironman mode). The game has that strong Deadlands vibe to it (the devs have admitted that they've drawn inspirations from the popular Wierd West pen & paper game), and mixes it well with your Spaghetti Western tropes of a man searching for vengeance, or money... or death in general.\n\nThe lack of save feature doesn't bother me at all - on the countrary, it just lengthens the experience even further by allowing you to replay the scenarios on harder difficulties (with optional injuries and ironman mode), hunting for the remaining relics that are often the rewards for your decissions. The dead-zone (overwatch) feature that AI has is also an additional challenge and I welcome it (tip: if you move to a place without previous line-of-sight of the enemy, there won't be a deadzone a.k.a you won't get shot, and the enemy will be intimidated by your pressence, thus allowing you to land a free 100% shot between his eyes just like they like to do).\n\nFinally, if I had to nitpick to find a flaw in the game, I would say that the ocassional freezes when entering the barter screen and lack of more content are the cons. The first can easily be remedied with an optimization patch, and more content will surely come in form of DLC (keepin' my fingers crossed for a full-blown expansion of 4 more scenarios, or even a sequel). As a fan of Spaghetti Westerns and Deadlands, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an ominous, grim story bundled with some true grit tactical combat.","November 21, 2015","true","21.7"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

For its price I even would recommend it but I somehow felt cheated (by other reviews) and wanted to warn other users about the shortcomings of the game.\n\nI love TBS games and what I read about Hard West and saw on the screenshots convinced me to buy it. Somewhere I read that this game can be compared to Jagged Alliance (2) or Silent Storm but this is just wrong. Hard west is nowhere close to the brilliance of those 2 games (or the old X-Com parts). It is rather a dumbed down version of the new X-Com with some fresh ideas and an unused setting but it just doesn’t catch me (and probably most players) in a way the famous games I already mentioned did.\n\nThe unique features of that game are the luck and the perk (poker cards) system.\nLuck is a really clever idea (at first) to counter the RNG frustration that most games of that sort have. It also is kind of necessary because you can’t save/reload during combat and when an important character dies it is game over so the luck system basically eliminates most randomness of the game. And after a while, you realize that in fact this is missing. There are nearly no moments of joy because you scored a lucky hit and there are still moments of frustration, but because of other shortcomings I will mention later.\nLuck works this way: Most characters start with 100 luck. When you shoot at someone with e.g. 40% hit chance you don’t hit him (usually… I’m not sure about the exact rules, it is possible to hit someone with ~60% chance at least) but instead subtract 40 (the hit chance) of his luck. So when the next character has a 60% chance to hit, he effectively has 100% now because the enemy only has 60 luck left. Depending on the weapon (they have different effective ranges) and the character (aim value) you can also have 100% hit chance right from the start. For your characters it usually means that they are positioned in a way that the enemies have a 20-30% hit chance so every 3rd or 4th bullet hits them.\nThe other big combat factor is cover. You are either in no, half or full cover. When behind full cover most of the weapons will only deal 1 hitpoint of damage (which is really few, because most characters have around 10 hit points and you can get items or perks that heal). Half cover also sometimes reduces damage to 1 but certain weapons will penetrate half cover with higher damage and without cover you can take up to 8 points of damage.\nCombat would be really getting slow if everybody just hides behind cover but luckily you can catch enemies in the open by flanking them and there are several special perks that grant ways of attacking that are kind of overpowered.\nThe perks are available via poker cards (9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, Joker) and some have a great influence on your playstyle. You will also get bonuses when you select cards on one character that lead to a certain poker hand (like +40 luck with a set). I will spoil one example for perks and how that can influence the game:\nIn the second campaign you are playing an “undead” character. He has a perk of equalization which will give all characters in combat just 1 hitpoint meaning instant death on hit. He also has regeneration in the shadows and shriek (which damages all visible enemies). So a valid tactic is to use equalization at the start of combat. Evade enemies for some rounds to regenerate hitpoints or use either a healing or luck restoring item (those active perks need luck as resource to use them). Then just run into the middle of the enemies and use shriek to kill them all. There is also one perk called transfusion which switches your hitpoints with the enemy, very handy (and risky) in a boss fight.\nSo the perk system is a nice idea because they give some cool options to your playstyle but there is one major issue and the reason for me why this game is far from ingenious: The perks and characters are totally replaceable! So welcome to the bad sides of the game:\n\nYou play 8 campaigns, each around 2 hours play time (I played through 3 of them at the time of this review) and they always start from scratch meaning you will lose everything you got from the previous campaign. If this wasn’t enough the “story” will let team members just leave whenever they want, often substituted with a new (or old) one. But in fact, this doesn’t matter at all because your team just defines itself by its weapons and perks so there is no other progress than unlocking poker cards or scavenging/buying weapons or gear (there are also 3 gear slots, 2 useable items and one passive trinket). The characters have basic stats but I think they are all (roughly) the same and they don’t increase with level ups or something like that, only by items. At the end this just means you don’t care about the characters you play at all.\nThe other major flaw is the overall presentation of the game. The combat areas are nice but the rest of the game is presented on an overview map and one popup message after the next. The complexity reminds me of a mobile game but nothing close to X-Com or Jagged Alliance…\nSo the usual flow is: Win a battle, unlock some new cards and weapons, click away some messages on the map, move to next location, click through some messages, make some (unimportant) decisions, unlock new location, click on it, attack now or later (I don’t know why later is an option anyway), next battle, rinse and repeat. It is really uninspired most of the time…\n\nSo the focus of the game is combat, but not only is it getting repetitive and the luck feature makes it very calculable and somewhat boring, it also has other issues. The main problem is how line of sight in regards of cover is calculated. You sometimes flank the enemy and have full vision on him but the game still sees him under full cover. This is happening because it only seems to check the coordinates meaning as long as you are not on the same “height” as the enemy the wall he is behind is still seen as between you and him. Not sure if my explanation is intelligible… Once you know that problem you can avoid it by turning the camera and be sure to move into a position that removes the cover. It is still a big annoyance and just feels wrong and it happens quite often that you use an action point to move into place and once you are there, you have to move back because you realize the values (cover and hit chance) are not what you expected them to be.\nThe cover system itself has a visual problem in my eyes, because you are standing behind a solid wall, in order to shoot you just take a glance around the wall when it is your turn and hide back behind the wall after you shot, but still the enemy will hit you (through the wall) the next turn.\nAlso the overwatch feature is a little strange. Each character has a small circle around him and when you enter it in your round he will open fire (which is quite deadly). I don't know if you need to have action points left in order to do that (none of my chars ever fired during an enemy turn) and if the enemy even turns around to fire (the circle suggests that). After I nearly got killed because I entered that circle (and deaths mean to start over) I rather avoided them instead of finding out how exactly they work.\n\nShort version: The game has a fresh setting and uses some nice new ideas but it lacks content and stays in mediocrity therefor.\nIt either would need one big campaign with real progress and character development or the combat needs to be more refined and varied e.g. destructible environment, or both, to be on par with the big titles of that genre!\n\nIt is still ok for its price and one positive fact I forgot to mention: I never played a (big) game with such short loading times! :)","December 21, 2015","false","6.9"," 68 of 103 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","68","103","2","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakossan/recommended/307670/","dakossan","Nurg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakossan/","239 products in account","Note to other reviewers: The game HAS an alternative overwatch system, "reaction fire". Your units never use it because the enemy AI never moves into the zone which triggers it, because that would be dumb. You CAN run up to an enemy for point blank blasting by starting your move out of their line of sight. If they don't see you coming they can't use reaction fire (And the red circle won't appear). A full overwatch as in XCOM would break the other mechanics of THIS game. This is not XCOM. (XCOM2 February, YAY!)\n\n++ Tightly designed turn based combat, fixed damage, high mobility. Very satisfying when you get under its skin. Favourite tactic: Charging into point blank range with a group of enemies and using the Barrage or Chain-Kill skills to shoot them all down at once. Do it right and you have 100% chance of success thanks to the "point blank" aim bonus. I've seen several reviews that say you can't do this.\n\n++ Deterministic chance-to-hit. 75% chance to hit doesn't mean random, it means it will cost 75 luck to dodge the shot - or the target takes fixed damage and gains luck points. It's really elegant and drives lots of new tactics. The only randomness is that you don't know how much luck the enemy has. - Note: This is how I understand it, please someone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n++ Linux support. I haven't used it much because the Linux version doesn't work with my Steam controller but massive thumbs up for Linux support!\n\n++ Western setting, fantastic. Love the art style.\n\n++ Budget price.\n\n-- No saving in missions - major oversight. It needs to auto save every turn and save on quit. I always play Ironman so doubly important.\n\n-- Not so keen on the magical, weird, demonic, satanic elements. Just a personal preference but more pure western stuff please.\n\n-- Game is too easy on Medium Ironman. I'm about to start my Hard Ironman run so I may have to retract this line.\n\n-- Small, squinty fonts are hard work on even a really big tv+couch.\n\nConclusion: Love the game, everyone should buy it and support it, and try harder to understand the actual mechanics instead of moaning without understanding. It doesn't have the depth or longevity of an XCOM but it's not priced like an XCOM either.","December 20, 2015","true","60.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

What comes out is a fresh idea of a story-driven, innovative tactical game with RPG elements and an awesome setting in the "Weird West" (It's like West... just weirder... and with demons... and rituals... and it fits GREAT!).\nLet me point out what makes "Hard West" so exemplary:\n\n- The "luck" system that governs all the shooting. No longer can you miss those 90% Chance to Hit shots 3 times in a row. Now all of your missed shots take some of the enemy's "luck" and once its value is lower than your Chance to Hit, you WILL hit. That's it... It's simple yet very satisfying and adds more tactic to the old genre that usually was just based on chance.\n\n- You can change the environment to create new covers. Did you ever find it irratitng that a table cannot be overturned to give you cover. Well, now it can :D\n\n- Awesome abilites. The abilites that your characters can use are simply awesome. Ever wanted to shoot 6 people at once in one second? Just "Barrage" the s^%t out of them. Want to make a battle into "sudden death"? Use "Equalization" and change EVERYONE's HP to 1.\n\n- The story. The plot is just the right amount of cliche & some twists that make the "weird west" setting even more unique. It's immersive and the entire game is based on it, so it's VERY DIFFERENT from XCOM.\n\n- Wacky weapons. The game takes some strange designs from times long past and introduces them to the game. And it's amazing! Ever wanted to shot a 9 barreled shotgun in somebody's face? Well, now you can!\n\n- Experience system is based on cards. An wesome idea to customize your characters using poker cards. Each cards improves the character's statistics but also gives him an ability. HOWEVER you can combine cards into poker hands that give powerful bonuses. Great idea!\n\n\nThere is much much more I could tell you about this game. It also has its flaws, of course, but which game doesn't? The cons are vastly outmatched by the pros.\n\nWant to experience something new and fresh?

It was released on November 18th, 2015 for $19.99. A review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels. Initially a Kickstarter project, 4,398 backers pledged $94,183 CAD to fund development.\n\nHard West is a turn based strategy action title with some similarities to X:COM and other tactical shooter type games. The movement and combat mechanics are streamlined and the game plays very well. Artistically the game is very thematic, showing off a western style and some interesting illustrations. While stability was a slight issue, there are various graphic settings that can be adjusted to ensure smooth play. The replay value is moderate due to some variance in certain characters surviving events. There is also an option to turn the difficulty up or down for each scenario.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nScreaming theme – Hard West is extremely thematic and stylized with a western theme. There are additional layers to the thematic aspect including gold mining and battling Mexican cartels. The theme is very well constructed and fits every aspect of story and game play. It is clear that during development making this western theme scream was a high priority.\n\nTactical is practical – There is something to be said for turn based games of this nature. Allowing players to spend time picking what they hope will be the perfect move for each character is engaging and thought provoking. A major benefit of these types of games for my personal situation is that my toddler often wants attention randomly. Turn based games afford the ability to walk away for a bit and come back to them at your convenience.\n\nSimply elegant – One of the outstanding aspects of Hard West is that the game mechanics are streamlined and simple. This is not to say the game isn’t difficult, just that manipulating your characters and their items or upgrades is very easy to comprehend. The system of playing cards which give your characters various abilities and bonuses is a fantastic example of the elegance of design. These cards along with weapons and gear are very easy to change or set up due to an intuitive interface for each character.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nEnvironmental challenges – The area that I found to be a bit of a let down was that most of the battle environments seemed very similar. The layouts were different at times, but the option of sunny Mexican villa or burning western landscape was somewhat redundant. There is certainly room for expansion in this game and if development does explore that option, more unique environments would be a necessary addition.\n\nJammed revolver – At one point in my preview video there was a full crash, seemingly due to rendering both the first and second floor of a building at once. These little stutters were seen a handful of times. I was reverted back to the start of an entire mission in the case of the crash which is always a bit of a let down. The issues while distracting are not debilitating and shouldn’t keep anyone from finishing the game.\n\nCovered sight – The mechanics are fairly solid minus an occasional miscalculation or bug in the combat system. There were a couple of instances where the percentage for hit was below 20% but there was clear line of sight and no cover for the enemy. This was not common enough to be a major issue. I will say it ruined my tactical advantage in the instances that it did occur.\n\nTactical turn based games are generally fun and provide a substantial amount of thought to play. Hard West is worthy of being mentioned alongside a title like XCOM. It may not have the depth in terms of long term character advancement but it’s a solid experience with a fantastic theme. If you like western themes or tactical shooting games of this type then this game is certainly one to enjoy.\n\nScore: Buy it now","November 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","2"

It's a pitch-black story of revenge and brutality in the vein of "High Plains Drifter", wrapped in a keen appreciation for and understanding of cowboy folklore and western mysticism--battle-ready priests, noble gamblers, good-hearted nuns, and more acts of Satan than you can shake a stick at.  This is all compounded by the introduction of a Fallout 1-style overworld, dotted with queer characters, strange encounters, and more.\n\nSome bugbears in the form of game stability, lack of replay value, and lack of saving after a mission are painful, and sabotage what is otherwise a near-on peerless tactical experience.  Should be played by fans of XCOM, fans of Westerns, and fans of good games in general.","November 21, 2015","true","43.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","3"

Excellent\n\nThe Best was to describe Hard West, is a western XCOM. But its much more than that. Its much more of an RPG, while XCOM has very few RPG elements, this game has a ton of them. You can choose the weapons you carry, armor (if any), and the skills and perks of each character. IT also has some elements of those "Choose your own adventure" games.\nBetween combat you have missions you can choose to do in coloration with the story in the individual scenarios (BTW, each scenario has different characters, for different playthroughts and difficulty settings for replay ability) Choosing to focus on one mission, while ignoring another will has different results. and choosing one option over another in the missions will have even more different results.\n\nThe Setting alone is great, Why aren't there more western games? Hard West has this really cool mixture of western and horror.

There are 8 chapters, within which are several scenarios where there may be combat or puzzles to solve. The puzzles aren't really heavy duty, and the combat (once you get used to the system and weapons) is pretty simple. Concepts of cover apply here; there is also a "setup" real-time phase that allows you to explore and do things if you stay out of sight and not shoot anyone. Once you shoot someone or if they discover you, turn-based combat begins. You also get to collect cards that can boost your stats if you play the right poker hand. All in all:\n\nPros:\n\nI like the western theme. As far as I know, there aren't any of this genre in a turn-based combat RPG\nThe narrator, Death, is a nice (albeit common) touch\nThe audio was authentic sounding (guns firing don't sound like modern guns, for e.g.), though music became a little repetitive after a while\nStats, loot, etc. only carry forward within each chapter, once you complete the chapter, you start fresh. This can also be a con, but I think it keeps the player on their toes\nThe game has you play the roles of many characters (not just the "hero" character), which is refreshing\nThe stat boosting cards are a nice feature\n\nCons\n\nInventory is too limited. You only get 2 slots for usable items, so there's a lot of effects you don't get to try out, or strategies, unless you keep replaying, but\nGiven the structure/design of the game, there's limited replay value\nThe game can be completed in around 20-30 hours\nThe campaign is fairly linear; there's pretty much just one story arc and one route to follow. Sometimes it feels very scripted\nOnce you get farther in the game, the load times took a while. You also can't save within the scenario, the game only auto-saves between chapters. This is not a big deal, but I have to mention it\n\nI'm still recommending this game because I think the devs took a risk, and did a decent job with the released product. Although the backstory could be tighter -- why the Stranger appeared, the role of Purgatory, etc. -- the multiple viewpoints and different characters you get to play make up for it. And in the end, the overarching lesson that "bad things sometimes happen to good people" is all too true, and all too tragic.\n\n7.0/10.0","April 28","true","26.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/307670/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","Western is not a genre we stumble upon in gaming world on a daily basis. Therefore, we're always happy to lick scorched blood and whiskey off our dust covered, dry lips. For me personally, the beginning and the end of western video games is Outlaws, there are multiple reasons why and I don't think anyone is interested in hearing the whole list.\n\nCreativeForge Games and its Hard West were two unknowns to me, but the premise sounded promising. It mentioned cowboys, occult and X-Com, so it was enough for me to pick it up.\n\nHard West is single player TBS with RPG elements. Game consists of eight scenarios loosely connected by a story that didn't quite deliver. It wasn't enough western nor occult to fully occupy my brain. It would be unfair to say that some aspects weren't good, but as a whole, I was more 'meh' than 'yay' about this one, and when I am 'meh' as a person who READS and PLAYS ANYTHING and EVERYTHING and often gets overly excited by extreme stupidity, well... it's bad.\n\nYou unlock scenarios as you play. Scenarios could be interpreted as mini universes inside a bigger one, each revolving around central character. There's fighting and choice-and-consequences entwined: you fight in a missions, then you move around the map represented as a buffalo skull picking different options and influencing your game in different ways. Every scenario contains different mechanism - some ask of you to feed your players, other are allowing you to predict the outcomes via clairvoyance. When the time to fight comes again, you enter something I call battle screen where you equip each character with different guns and consumable items you earn by fighting, trading or completing objectives.\n\nHard West introduces several interesting systems which unfortunately fail to help the game rise above the average. Poker hands is one of these systems. You can equip each character with up to five cards. Each card is a perk by itself, improving luck, sight or shooting skills. When you combine cards together, you may assemble a poker hand. High card, pair, flush and so on, each of these hands deal another set of bonus improvements to characters. While this sounds great, it proved to be of little use in the game. I didn't feel too much difference between carefully and randomly picked hands. Another system that creates pressure on players is luck system. When the enemy's bullet misses you, your luck goes down, so at certain point you need to move away to stay alive. It would be great, tense and hard to have enemies push forward with this system, but unfortunately, enemy AI is horrenous and most of the time, you're dealing with enemies that take awkward positions and shoot without any tactics on their mind. Game also introduces ricochet shots, typical part of any decent cowboy movie, but most of the time, you won't utilize these. Shooting pans and anvils is not something you need to do in this game, no matter if you're able to do this.\n\nFighting missions are why Hard West gets compared to X-Com. I didn't spot any other similarities. And to be quite honest, thanks to clunky controls and bad camera positions, Hard West feels pretty cheap. I am almost certain this one was built in Unity because as I've played it reminded me of Wasteland 2 (which I love, by the way) and all of the bad moments that I've encountered while traveling and fighting in radioactive desert. What I've liked about X-Com is the fluidity of the fight, the movement, the complete experience. It makes me happy to see weapons inspired by Wild West's real and -state-of-prototype instruments of death, but it just isn't enough. To add insult to injury - there's no option to save mid mission, so at certain points you're doomed to 40 minute fights. If you exit and/or die, you need to start again and that causes quite a frustration.\n\nWhat I've really liked about the game is its audio. Music is appropriate and mystical in a way. Weapon sounds wear "Standard Quality" badge and the narrator, a guy named Death - he's FANTASTIC. Really, a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome job. Death personally kept me on pushing through the storyline in the moment where I just wasn't willing to continue.\n\nAnother huge disappointment for me personally was implementation of occult elements in the game. The whole experience felt like this:\n\nOffices of CreativeForge Games.\n\nTeam member 1: I don't know, these western guys aren't really convincing. We need something more...\nTeam member 2: How about we make some of them worship Satan? Hail Satan! Pentagrams!!!\n\nSince Western-meets-Horror is one of the selling points, I was thinking we will get something DarkToweresque, but it turned out that shallow characters couldn't even be saved with addition of cults and ocassional demon spawns. Mostly because demons in this game are SO stereotypical they have red skin and horns. Really? I mean, really?\n\nWhen you're done with the campaign, you'll realize another and major flaw: replayabilty is none. OK, you can always try to get higher difficulty or beat the game in Iron Man mode. Sadly, the fact you can't transfer your loadouts and earned cards from one to another scenario and combined them all together makes the second playthrough nothing short of forced grind fest.\n\nHard West promised a lot. I've expected even more because you can't really resist and stop drooling when someone says they'll deliver X-Com type of game with Western and Satanic themes. It turned out Hard West isn't that hard nor way too western, not to mention how desperately 'unevil' it is. It's a cheap looking game with some great elements and it wouldn't be fair to recommend it at the current (14,99) nor its regular price (19,99) when X-Com and its DLC's prices are dropping like flies every now and then.\n\nIn case you really need your western'n'cult fix, wait for a discount to get it.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review?

The interesting weapons and the abilities from the cards provide a lor of variety in turms of combat.  The art direction and stage design are solid.  The narration is top notch and the soundtrack really adds atmosphere.\n\nAs for the XCOM and Jagged Alliance comparisons, Hard West really is it's own game.

If you're a fan of turn-based strategy especially X-Com EU you will find a lot to like here. However the game has some glaring flaws that are very frustrating:\n\n1.The cover system is great but doesn't really make sense at times - for example: standing in front of a guy who has his back to a wall and the game still says he is in cover regarding your shot. This really screws up your tactics.\n\n2. LOS is sometimes equally as weird in that you should clearly be able to see the guy but the game just says no. This is really frustrating in a 2-action point turn systen (a-la X-Com EU) where many turns involve running into position then shooting. I've lost count of the amount of times I've run somewhere then had to run back into hiding due to the game saying I don't have LOS.\n\n3. The missions are very long for a game that has no save/checkpoint feature. Some last upwards of a hour and can be all for naught if a turn is messed up due to the reasons given above.\n\n","November 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and addictive, the story is really stylish and original in its own way. The soundtrack is fantastic, however there is not that many tracks, which can make it feel repetitive at times.\n\nYou will not find any spaghetti western stuff in this game, so the overall feel is somewhere between the Call of Juarez series and the good ol' Blood by Monolith. This gives the game a very mature and violently depressive theme, which is unfortunately rarely seen in modern games.\n\nA lot of people in the reviews section are salty at the lack of saves, however this is actually one of the best decisions taken by the developer, as your every decision on both global and battle maps really means something and you actually feel like taking the risks.\n\nSome of the game flaws include the lack of balance (some card combinations are completely broken and getting them earlier in the campaign allows you to completely faceroll your way through, such as shadow regeneration+equalizer), having basically only 1 type of enemy (if you do not consider generic dude with shotgun, demon dude with shotgun, Mexican dude with shotgun and Indian dude with shotgun as different enemy types), the overall low budget feeling such as reusing the same 3D models and sounds for different people and weapons. However, it is kind of amazing how 2D portrait of a guy and his generic description provided in text or by the narrator is enough to make each one you meet totally unique and badass, while AAA games keep failing to do that even with full voice-over (Sup Bethesda!).\n\nOverall, if you enjoy playing turn based games, reading a lot of text and games having their own charm, Hard West is going to become one of the biggest surprises of 2015.","December 2, 2015","true","22.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I thought that it would be something like an absurd gore-y homour-ey western about demons and zombies, but instead it appeared as a serious tragedy with high emotional impact.\n\nOther than that, it is a pretty solid tactical game about a squad of different units with different skills, who move twice per turn and shoot each other. There are, however, some little things, which renew your image of a typical tactical game - for example, final probability of getting shot is not random - there is a scale of "Luck", which depletes when your enemy missed and fills when you get shot. So there won't be any kind of situation, in which some unaccessible unit will snipe others from long range with 0% chance to get hit, and that's good. Also, gameplay on a world map differs in different campaigns - some campaigns will make you collect food, so you won't starve, and other will give you mysterious powers, which you may use to your advantage. This is also pretty cool.\n\nWell, I guess that I would like to recommend this game to anyone, who like turn-based tactical games, westerns and great storylines. Other people are also invited to buy this game, but preferably when it's on sale - there is a chance that some gameplay basics can be seen as tedious and repetetive.\n\nFor myself, however, I would like to praise this game and say that I liked it very much.","February 19","true","27.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the dark and gritty Western, Turn Based Strategy game Hard West. Hard West was released by Developer CreativeForge Games and Publisher Gambitious Digital Entertainment.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZtakAnVJ0oE\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nSolid Western take on the Turn-Based Strategy style. More than just "XCOM" in the Wild West.\n4/5 and worth the $20\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nHard West is, at first glance, just another take on the Turn Based Strategy genre that has seen an uptick since the popularity of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Don't sell this game short though, it is it's own beast for sure. This is a western with a twist! It's dark. I mean, demon-dark. There is GREAT story going on here. The gameplay is superb. It's Turn-Based Strategy, but there are some great mechanics in play as well. One being the "Card" system. Each charterer can carry cards (Essentially, you'd like to build a poker hand) that add to your perks. The perks can boost attributes during the Combat scenes. The visuals are grand and the sounds are great as well. This score is fantastic. I am really excited to play this one and very happy about it. In between battles you explore the area and mine for gold, learn more about the town and story, have your choices make for consequences, etc. There is a lot to do here and it seems as if there may be multiple stories/endings to pursue as well. Fans of Turn Based Strategies and Westerns are going to simply LOVE it. A western gem for the genre. 4/5 and loving it. Spend your $20 without regrets.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Sure, it's a turn-based strategy with a Wild West theme (or rather, Weird West) but this is not an X-Com wannabe with a simple WW reskin. The game plays very differently, and pleasantly so. You can grant your posse members various abilities by assigning them poker cards, and some of these abillities are especially interesting and provides tactical depth and variety. Imagine being able to ricochet your shot through several objects before killing your target, or being able to regenerate when not under sunlight.\n\nI also enjoyed the "luck" mechanic. It really gives meaning to phrase "♥♥♥♥ out of luck". :)\n\nIf you read the negative comments, common complaints are the use of checkpoints (i.e. you can't save mid fight) as well as the game being broken into scenarios, with each scenario being independent (i.e. you can't carry over your characters or equipment from one scenario to the next, except for certain unlockable equipment). While the use of checkpoints can be inconvenient, I don't find it much of an issue. Yes, it can be time consuming when you have to replay a fight from the beginning when one of your key character is killed, but I believe it is designed as a such to encourage effective planning and strategy, especially on missions that allow your posse to "set up" their placement before commencing the fight. You will be constantly outnumbered and outgunned, so rushing in with your guns blazing usually means failure. Thus, unless you devise a viable strategy, be prepared to keep replaying the same mission many times.\n\nAs for the independent scenarios, each one has an interesting mechanic and story to tell. The varied scenario mechanics, ranging from gold mining to science research to temple raiding expedition, are both refreshing and creative, so much so, they feel like  standalone mini-games in themselves. I am only half-way through the campaign, but thus far, each scenario has kept engaged and asking me for more.\n\nAll in all, this is a very solid turn-based strategy game with high production value. In my book, it's a solid 8.5/10 and definitely worth the price if you enjoy TBS games.","November 24, 2015","true","25.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

There's alot done well and alot left to be desired from what I have seen so far. Strange is the rating I am giving this one because well "Strange" is the most appropriate word for this title on multiple fronts.\n\nShort Version...\n\nAtmosphere and Innovation to the core X-Com mechanics highlight this experience. The suprise good-times driver for me was the story.\n\nThe core combat mechanics are servicable and enjoyable enough to get a slight plus one all bythemselves with extra points for trying different things. As a pure tactcial game I am still forming an opinion but overall I would say its a pretty fun take on the "cover and advance" aspects of X-Com.\n\nLonger Version....\n\nI enjoyed this story. On paper its a relatively straightforward plot from a narative prospective. I was pleased to find have some ability to change the course of the story through your choices and actions. Like most modern video games character development is lacking but to me it did not seem all that relevant to immersion or to me giving the storyline a big plus one. As with many tales of gunslinging revenge in the old west the romanticism and sheer kick-assery of the setting has no problem occupying center stage in this production. The depressing and grim nature of this particular tale had me thinking back to the horrifical brutal version of the West painted in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian which is really more of an epic poem of brutal ♥♥♥♥ murder mayhem with touch of the supernatural and devilery thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe gameplay shakes down to tactical combat battles connected via a choice your own adventure style world map. Yes it's a strange as it sounds when you read that last sentence. To further twist up the bizare factor you are going to find that while there is a pretty solid central storyline its delivery is done through multiple view points across several scenarios with check points rather than save points. Still with me? Okay finally there is some core differences between the way the world map challenges you between these different scenarios that add in elements of resource managment/simulation type mechanics. Yeah so kinda strange.\n\nThe execution has been suprisingly decent in my playtime thus far. At least on the easy and medium difficulty settings much of the before mentioned game mechanics seem a bit underwhelming in their overall impact on the core of the game (tactical map battles in case you forgot).  The different meta game elements seem to shift just as you feel that your getting close to mastering and growing bored with it.\n\nI would say the graphics are pretty solid Infinity Engine level production status. Which is to say miles behind the Triple AAA titles of the here and now. I enjoyed the comic book esque cut scenes and narration but the overall look of the game could stil use some polish. I found no issues with slowdown or memory leaks.\n\nWill finish and add more to this review later....\n\n7/10","November 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I''m really taking my time with this one and have already replayed the same scenarios a couple of times before moving on to the later ones.\n\nPros:\n\n-Interesting Storyline\n-Awesome aesthetic\n-Well thought-out tactical gameplay\n-Choices matter\n-Very punishing at times\n\nCons\n\n-Very punishing at times\n\nI see some people complaining about the lack of a save function, but I think that's entirely intentional. These scenarios are meant to be played through multiple times as there are a lot of different ways to go about it. It's pretty easy to ♥♥♥♥ up and lost a character or let debuffs go on unchecked for too long, but in my opinion that's part of the appeal. You can't save constantly and just go back when you make a bad decision; you'll have to start the whole scenario over. Luckily the scenarios aren't too long and considering how many different ways you can go about completing them, it's fun to go back to square one and approach it from a different angle if you feel you've made the wrong choices.\n\nI started on the lowest difficulty (still a challenge if you're not versed in tactical turn-based gaming), but I quickly moved on to the normal difficulty which was immensely satisfying.\n\nIf you don't like turn-based tactical games then there's probably no way you'll like this, but as far as strategy RPGs go this is one of my favorites already. People are comparing it to XCOM, and I think that's a fair comparison, but I actually liked the narrative and level structure in this game a lot more than I liked XCOM (I did really like XCOM).\n\nIt feels oldschool while still being innovative and fresh. I think it's a must-have for people who like tactical strategy RPGs, and worth checking out if you have a soft spot for Wild West games.\n\nI should mention that this game was gifted to me for free from a random person online, and I knew very little about this going in so my expectations weren't very high. I do however think that if I had been excited about this game before it came out, it would have satisfied me. I'd go as far as to say that I would purchase any DLC that comes out in the future, as I can see myself playing and replaying these scenarios for some time to come.","November 20, 2015","true","17.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The weird west could be way weirder, especially when I desire demon exorcism and witchcraft along with my shotgun and dynamite.\n\nThe fact that the enemy have reaction fire and you don't seems a bit unfair; this is obviously a rules bandage applied to discourage players from certain tactics the designers don't like or felt would diminish the experience.\n\nIt is narrated (in English anyway) by the most boring-sounding voice in the world; make sure you have a huge cuppa coffe to sip before each mission, or you might fall asleep and miss the whole thing.\n\nIt's pretty linear, so replayability is based on cranking up the difficulty, rinse and repeat.\n\nMy biggest criticism, though, is that there's simply not enough of it.

I love challenging games and do not care about the no-save feature.  However, as other reviews have echoed, this game does not give your characters the ability to do cover fire/overwatch while allowing enemies to do so.  What ends up happening often are enemies doing suicide runs up to your character behind full cover and blowing them away in a hit.\n\nI read the discussion boards and the developers defense are that they excluded this ability in order to provide a challenge for the player.  There are other ways to increase difficulty without limiting a player's tactical options, what is the point of confining players to a single play style?\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned there is actually an ability card for cover fire on your characters.  I have not come across this yet, but will give the game another try.  To be fair, I don't think this is a bad game. The graphics, characterization and other gamplay so far is top notched for $20.  It's just the design decision to limit the option of cover fire for your characters is too big of a flaw for me to over look.","November 20, 2015","false","9.9"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","41","74","0","4"

For once there is a game that doesnt penalise you if you fancy an evil murder spree (cough cough mass effect and skyrim).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/307670/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","This game keeps drawing parallels to XCOM, but other than the 2 turn nature of combat with cover that's all it really shares. I have over 300 hours in XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, and even more in The Long War mod, and I simply cannot recommend this game. It's labeled as a Tactical Turn-Based Strategy game, but honestly the tactical and strategy part simply isn't there. The AI in this game is garbage, and that's putting it incredibly lightly. The AI will constantly disregard cover[imgur.com] to get a "flanking" shot on you, completely exposing themselves in the process. I've never met more sucidial AI put in place with the simple goal of killing you. This isn't fun, tactical, strategic, or testing my mechanics as a player. It's just me pressing a button to roll dice over and over again with nice graphics. The lack of depth doesn't end there.\n\nWhereas in XCOM you can destroy cover, denying your enemy bonuses, you simply can't here - though to the game's credit, there is very much an awesome feature where you can create additional cover through the environment(such as knocking over a table, or raising a basement door), but I've never even seen the AI take advantage of this. In XCOM there is Overwatch, an ability everyone gets to pressure/punish units from advancing on you in the open, there is no such feature here whatsoever. The only equivalent is simply XCOM's Assault Soldier's Close Combat Specialist ability, where they get a free guaranteed shot on you if you come within ~4 tiles of them. However, YOU don't get that. Only the AI does. On the harder difficulties, they just flood your screen with more enemies, making flanking sometimes downright impossible because all of these ♥♥♥♥ heads have it.\n\nThe numerous amount of cover, that can't be destroyed, combined with the increased number of enemies you'll fight makes fights usually boil down to taking pot shots at each other in full cover. There is no Flush ability to get them out of cover, there is no Suppression, no Overwatch, no Hunker Down, and no Run and Gun equivalent. Your only abilities are gained through a card system, which admittedly is quite awesome. If you mix and match the different cards to get hands similar to Poker, it gives you additional bonuses which was a nice little touch...However, the abilities are gated by a "Luck" system/resource. In terms of items, there's a couple not really worth mentioning. I never found myself using Tabacco for increased aim or anything else. Frag grenades(Dynamite) are also incredibly rare and don't really alter the environment anyway, with most people on higher difficulty having at least 4+ HP and Dynamite only doing 3. So again you're reduced to shooting an enemy in cover, until he mindlessly charges you to get a cheap shot in.\n\nThe nature of the AI also makes Ironman mode needlessly more frustrating than it should be. In this game if you lose a story centric character, game over. You have to start the ENTIRE scenario over again. Like one of the other reviews said, the scenarios in this game can take extended amounts of time, some of them possibly an hour+. To have to keep starting a scenario over, because one of the numerous shitbag AI decide to just throw their body at you, makes it not even worth playing. There's also no persistence between each scenario, so nothing carries over, and because of the scenario based nature of the game it doesn't offer much in the way of replay value.\n\nThere are also numerous things that make navigating the UI a pain, such as it not differentiating a 1 turn movement versus 2 with any color coding. It's just a solid yellow, that makes it easy to slip up especially when trying to go upstairs/downstairs in a house/building. It can also become incredibly confusing trying to figure out who you're aiming at, when there are multiple enemies on screen, because there is no cinematic zoom/change like in XCOM. I find myself physically clicking each guy to make sure that's who I am indeed trying to hit. Very frustrating.\n\nI just find myself walking away from this title disappointed than anything else, with it feeling paper thin in comparison to XCOM both in terms of gameplay and replayability. I can only give the developer to this game the benefit of the doubt and say that hopefully in time they will add more features to the combat, improve the AI, and at the very least add a Save function to the game.","November 25, 2015","false","4.4"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","28","50","0","1"

The graphics are very good for this genre. Originally the wild west cross supernatural theme was off putting. However this does allow for some interesting game play options and interesting storyline progression.\n\nCons are the terrible story mode 'scenarios'. You invest time into equipping your team with weapons and items for tactical purposes only to have no connection with the next scenario. I would rather have the entire family, or introduce the family throughout the story. Another complaint is the way you explore the map. Reminds me of wasteland 2, not a huge complaint although it's very disappointing when compared to divinty.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is still a very good, solid game. The story line does improve throughout the game and is backed with very impressive turn based mechanics.

I did not know about this game until 5 minutes before I had bought it. Something aesthetically pleasing about the screenshots and audio samples from the trailor.\n\nHere is another Polish Wild West game. As usual with sublime audio and atmosphere but this time also with a little quirk. Demons. And the involvement of the devil.\n\nNow, this is a low-budget title as you can tell by the price-tag. And yes, it is sub-par to current visual standards. But what the heck does it matter when you get a great authentic and immersive albeit mythical world to play around.\n\nThe game is challenging enough what with "Iron Man" mode - never understood what's so iron about having to actually face the consequences of your actions. The AI is on par with what you get in any other game three times as expensive. Even if the individual scenarios are a bit short, there is enough replay value due to exploring and experimenting with the campaign map quests that come along with the tactical combat gameplay. Each of the scenarios has a slightly different set of gameplay elements and rules. The supernatural abilities of the player characters can be combined in multiple synergetic ways.\n\nI was probably supposed to have mentioned XCOM by now. So ... 'Hard West' is fun.

It was so greaaat!".\n\nI'm one of the kickstarter backer, and I can tell the work done between the kickstarter and the release is really astonishing. I'm really surprised. The game is even better than expected (for me). And for me, this is a kind of proof for a talented developer team. This ability to prove that they can make a great solid game, on the base of a little alpha and some pictures.\n\nWhy I love this game:\n- Awesome atmosphere; we are really inside it when we play.\n- Original and great story, with some hard choice to make.\n- Very nice global UI.\n- The Card System to remplace a classic and ugly skill tree! This is really, really cool and badass! And creative.\n- The exploration system. This is "simple", fluid and interesting! No boring walk or ♥♥♥♥ like that to resolve a quest.\n- Being a powerful cowboy!

The care and consideration that went into this is immidiately apparent.\n\nThe setting is truly unique( at least in my expereince). Old school western mixed with  superstitious heebee-jeebie folklore and a zest of steampunk(just a pinch) to make it all to come together. The art style speaks volumes about the people and athe setting.\nFrom the glassy eyed undertaker to the intense features of the inqusitor a lot can be said about a character just by looking at him.The sound design also reflects this. Sound design is appropriate and passable but fails to impress. Its aparent the devs were aiming for something like Call of Juarez Gunslinger but came short of the mark.\n\nThe stories are engaging but fail at a long lasting apeal due to their brisk pace and short nature. There is also zero character interaction which missed the necesaricy peaks and valley for a good story.\n\nThe gameplay is standart top down turn based rpg ala fallout or baldurs gate or xcom but the game manages ot carve out a unique niche for it self with the unique mechancis that it provides. Addtitions like magic poker card bonuses and different items as well unique abilites like ricochet shots ( you dont know how satifying it is to ricochet a shot off a few surfaces to reach a hidden foe)\n\nThe game has a very fair difficulty curve but not without typical annoyances of the genre. Imporbable luck based occurances, wonky enemy ai to name a few. The game is also lacks a player given safe feature and intead opts for a checkpoint system. This dont not work i nthe games favor. Some of of the longer scenarios are especially difficult on higher difficulties and the game is unfortunately not too stable. A liberal saving option could remedy that but the devs deserve a special place in hell for when doing a bank mission I was all but done and the game decided to crash as I clicked the ''end mission button'' nesesitating a complete retry.\n\nThe game build a solid base that I can whole heartedly reccomend I surely hoep the devs would continue this franchise and learn their leasons for the future.\n\nWishlist/impriovement suggestions: More voice actors, transferable loot from scenario to scenario, a few more varied settings and color palette ( too much brown plenty of places to visit and vary), maybe a fully fledged open world game with one character/party ala fallout or baldurs gate and finally flesh out the occult part of the setting. Maybe some rudimentary magic or magic weapons cursed tomahawk or devils crossbow etc.\n\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Very polished, great tactical gameplay. I seem some similarities to X-Com in that its a top down turn-based strategy game, but it's by no means "a clone."\n\nThis game could easily be more than $19.99. If I paid $39.99 for this, I'd feel good about it. I've put about 6-8 hours into it and I'm through 2.5 scenarios. Great combat, weapons, and storyline. The setting / voice acting really adds to it.\n\nSome people bashed it because there isn't a heavy RPG element to the game. But there is.\n\nThe game has one of the coolest equipment / skill / combat systems I've seen. There are a multitude of factors that will modify your character. Based on choices you make, you will get certain perks / disadvantages. You will also reveal "cards" - this is how you give characters specific skills. Each character gets a hand of cards they can equip which bestows certain skills / perks to the character for example, being able to consume bodies to gain health. If you combine cards into hands, eg full house, four of a kind, etc. you will get additional attribute modifiers.\n\nSome skills work in sunlight, some work in darkness. For example, there is a card that makes you invisible in shadows / darkness. Very cool strategic element to the gameplay.\n\nCover game mechanics are excellent, so flanking and tactics will almost always win vs. brute force. It is really the type of game where if you run out in the open, you will likely get one or two shotted.\n\nYou can only see enemies if they're in your line of sight or if they make noise. However, lighting can reveal shadows of enemies hiding. Never seen this in a game before.\n\nYour luck rating is how you activate some skills. If someone shoots you and misses, you lose luck. If they hit you, you gain luck. The more luck you have, you can dodge hits (eg, if your luck is low, then you have a higher chance of getting hit). This all happens automatically. So everything you do has a tradeoff - this is pretty much the core concept of the game.\n\nSo basically, this game offers almost a dozen modifiers to your playing style at any given moment and has elements that most AAA games don't include.\n\nSome reviews said that the non-combat "game world" seems like it was quickly put together. I agree the first scenario is a little lackluster. However, after an hour or so and especially in the other scenarios, the non-combat gameworld feels very polished. The majority of the storyline happens here including player choices to the story.\n\nOverall, excellent game. Will 100% buy the expansion. Certainly a steal for anyone who likes tactical games like Wasteland, Fallout Tactics, X-Com (though no super weird close-ups) but in a new Western meets The Devil setting.","April 7","true","28.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Losing character progression after each chapter - nothing overstays its welcome and you get to play new characters in each vignette, which I've found just fine.\n3. In between the shootout levels you move around a map, choosing locations to visit and clicking through dialog trees, reminds me of playing a text based adventure game. It's not terrible and unfolds the stories well enough though.\n4.

So it was almost a guarantee I would like this from the start just based on that, but here's the rest of it!\n\nOh, let's also get this out of the way: Yes, it is similar to x-Com: Enemy Unknown in some mechanics. It is strategic combat with movement distances and shooting and percent chances to hit and cover mechanics and all that. If more of that sounds good to you and you don't want to wait for X-Com 2 (or like....7, depending on how you count) then by all means, just buy this.\n\nOk. Still on the fence? Neat. Here is where it shines. Between shootin' missions, you have some really compelling, interesting moments. In the first scenario, you and your father are trying to build a life after a tragic event, trying to find gold in a series of prospecting sites. But then it opens up and the story has you going around trying to save a neighbor's farmstead from bandits, dealing with the consequences of your father's increasing guilt over his inability to stop the aforementioned tragedy and making a literal deal with the devil, and getting in bed with a local crime lord and the consequences of that. All of those things happen due to choices you make and that's what is the best about this game.\n\nI found myself really thinking about not only the consequences of my choices but also what the characters in the story would realistically do. When presented with an opportunity to make my own deal with the devil I felt like the main character in the story wouldn't even consider it after hir father's moment of weakness led him to do the same.\n\nHere's the TL;DR for you: If this looks even a little interesting to you, I highly recommend it. It's clever and fun and mechanically sound.","November 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No overwatch for your team, but the enemy has it- First of all there is NO overwatch in the game, however enemies do get "attacks of opportunity" if you move within a certain radius of their location -  they get a free shot at you.\nBut -\n1. The game clearly shows you by means of a red circle the extent of each enemies attack of opportunity radius, and\n2. If you approach the enemy from behind their is no attack of opportunity, so try to out maneuver them.\n\nEDIT: As of 11/30/2015, with a new patch the devs have confirmed that enemies too will stay out of your area of influence, i.e. you also get an attack of opportunity if the enemy steps into your area of influence, except that they wouldn't -  so that is fair.\n\nNot every game needs to be XCOM and I applaud the devs for doing things differently.\n\n\nB. Enemies running up to you at the end and one-shotting you:\n1. The game has items (consumables, vests and totem like objects) and skills that increase defense and HP, use them!!\n2.  Not every character is essential to the game's progress, protect ones that are and sacrifice, if necessary, the rest.\n\nAs for the save, I can understand why the devs chose to implement the checkpoint system - it takes the tension to a whole new level. It ensures that like XCOM, I do not dash, I use one movement on peripheral characters to first get an idea of what is in the general area before I dash with the others, if I dash at all. I generally have AP remaining on most characters when I end my turn - better safe than sorry.","November 23, 2015","true","28.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game has a SUPERNATURAL twist to it as it has to do with DEMONS and presumebly the DEVIL itself.\n\nSome things I wanna point out.\n\n- The combat is simple to understand, fun and tactical. There's a "full cover and half cover" system and based on the character's "luck" the enemy shot will miss or hit. (Just a very basic explanation)\n- Instead of leveling a character with a skill tree u find or get poker cards with stats and supernatural abilities for example SHREAK hurts all visible enemies in the character's range.\n-The weapons also have different abilities. a Shotgun can fire a cone shot at close range damaging everyone in it while the revolvers have the option called "fanning" to shoot 3 rounds at reduced accuracy.\n-On the world map u can free roam around and explore, mine gold,buy or sell items, find people to join u, complete side tasks, It doesn't matter when u wanna continue with the main objective.\n\nThe music and sounds help the game even more to get the western feeling going.\n\nSo yes I enjoy my time with this game and hope to continue spending alot of hours into it.\n\n\n","December 15, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, the AI is sometime dumb poor and may need some enhancement, the game in general may need some optimization but as it is a turn based game it isn't game breaking.\n\nEvery scenario has a gimmick mechanic in the world map but every combat scene is played the same with, for the most part, different characters. The combat scenes are a well rounded turn based strategy game and the world map plays like a write your own adventure book.\n\nThe save system is a bit awkward at first but you get used to it pretty quickly.\n\nThe real selling point of Hard West is its story, characters and its setting.

The American folklore woven throughout the story is amazingly well done, and truly epitomizes not only the American Wild West, but the tall tales that surround that "mythological" period. Demons, the Devil, tales of revenge, luck and fortune, mad science and weird magic all come together to deliver a satisfying narrative filled with more guns than you can shake a boomstick at.\n\nOne serious flaw: there are no 8 -value cards for the skill deck so you can't make a Dead Man's Hand.

However, for me, this appeared to be blown out of proportion. Let's review those criticisms first.\n\nLack of Persistence\nThis is part of the game mechanics, essentially. The game features various abilities, items, and statuses. Each scenario, you start with a certain set of these. A lot of times the starting circumstances are thematic. Personally, it was enjoyable to rebuild your posse's abilities, and try new combinations of abilities and gear.\n\nOverwatch\nBasically, the enemy gets a circle, that if you enter, you will get shot automatically. The player does not. First, this is to prevent the PLAYER from running up point blank and shooting the enemy. Secondly, you are smarter than the AI, so it needs aids like this to keep the challenge. Third, it helps the "puzzle" aspect of tactics. Manuevering is extremely important in this game, so the overwatch zones challenge you to think about how you want combat to move, and how you are going to flank.\n\nEnemy Point Blank\nThis almost never happened to me. I think what it might be, is the AI trying to position, then coming around a corner very close to one of your characters. Instead of backtracking to cover, like you might do, the AI instead takes a shot that is likely to hit, and does full damage (as cover reduces damage). Usually, the way this occured for me was the AI running out into the open at medium range from my characters. My characters luck (a form of expendable defense) usually protected them from these attacks, which resulted in the AI enemy getting gunned down, sans cover.\n\nOK, onto the review...\n\nTHE GOOD\nCombat mechanics - Imagine the typical tried and true XCOM mechanics, plus a few twists, and it moves faster (only 1-2 hits to kill your average guy). First, you have LUCK, which causes enemy shots to miss, but then depletes in proportion to their hit chance (in other words, the better the shot, the more luck is burned off to protect your character). When a character uses certain items, or gets hit, they regen luck. Luck is also spent to perform certain special abilities, meaning you have to choose between defense and (typically) offense. Secondly, if you have partial cover you take less damage... and full cover even less (and the same for the enemy).\n\nRPG Mechanics - This was really enjoyable. Your character does not level up, but instead gets weapons, usable items, a talisman, and playing cards. This last one is really important. Your characters can have up to 5 cards equipped. Each provides a passive bonus, some provide and active bonus, and (here's my favorite part) if you can arrange a type of poker hand (like 2 of kind, full house, straight, etc.) you get additional passive bonuses. These, combined with your characters natural stats, and equipped gear allow you to create awesome combos.\n\nLevel Design - The levels are great. They are complex enough to provide a variety of strategy. The best part is that most missions have some sort of objective to complete, and a lot of them have secondary objectives that give you bonuses. Lastly, certain missions start off out of combat, where your characters can sneak around the guards, completing objectives before combat even starts (which is initiated by your actions).\n\nThe Campaign - First, it tells several stories, each of which help flesh out the main story line and give you an idea of what happened before, after, and during the main campaign. My favorite part was how most of the campaigns had their own system of how it worked. In one campaign you have to keep track of men and food while leading an expidition. In another you have to research different things, and use tools to track down an important quest item. It reveals how flexible the game engine really is.\n\nThe World - It is a great marriage between Clint Eastwood and HP Lovecraft. I love it love it love it.\n\n\nTHE BAD\nLine of Sight - Every XCOM style game I have ever played suffers from this, so it's not a huge negative in my mind. However, you will find the enemy making shots you swore were impossible, or set your characters up to be behind cover when they take full damage.\n\n\nTHE WEIRD\nThe writing - I didn't want to put this down as bad, even though it technically is, because it didn't stop me from enjoying the game. So, the story is great, but occassionally the writing just breezes through details. You will get lines like "And then you used your powers to kill everyone ever." WOT. That's not an actual line from the game, but I'm paraphrasing to illustrate these odd lines found throughout the game.","November 27, 2015","true","34.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like XCOM and want to try something that's roughly similar, Hard West MIGHT be for you. I wish I could give it a neutral review.\n\n- The setting is really interesting. Wild West + demons. Why not.\n- Some really nice ideas, like the luck resource and abilities/bonuses granted by cards and card combinations.\n- It's fun for a while. Gets old fast once you know how to combine cards and abuse the weak AI.\n- The AI is not great. It will kill you when you make a mistake, but if you stay in cover and play carefully, it's pretty hopeless.\n- There's no overwatch. It works surprisingly well with how the game is set up, but it might be a huge deal for some people.\n- There's (basically) no RNG, even though the game shows % to hit. Missing just depletes target's luck resource, once you get hit you gain some luck back. Basically it's just another form of armor (that can also be used as a resource for abilities).\n- The way the game is set up is weird. You play short "episodes" of 3-4 battles, then lose all progress even if you use the same characters.\n\nOverall: good effort, alright game with a lot of issues, in my opinion only for people who like turn-based tactics and don't mind some huge changes from the typical rules.","December 16, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You’ll play as a series of poor souls who were unlucky enough the cross paths with the Devil himself. Overcoming the hardships and tortures of life is only a meager victory compared to the supernatural horrors plaguing the West.\n\nNow, before anything, I think it’s safe to say that Hard West has rightfully taken its place on my list of favorite turn based strategy games. It draws some clear inspiration from X-COM, yet it’s nothing close to a copycat. This game is entirely fresh and adds its own little spins to the genre.\n\nSo, as you’d expect, gameplay is pretty solid. Players are equipped with a limited amount of actions, which are spent on movement, the consumption of an item, or attacking. The game offers a series of abilities which can either be purchased or found randomly as you traverse the ruined landscapes. The combination of 1800’s lifestyle and demonic upbringings is not something I’ve seen before in a game, so the results are… surprising: Anything from fanning your revolver to controlling the powers of Satan is available to you.\n\nAlso, Hard West has a more lenient feel to it, opposed to other turn based strategy games. It's hard to explain it properly, but maneuvering my characters and setting up flanking positions and whatnot felt so fluid to me. You can utilize almost every inch of the battleground to their favor, and the variety of ways to win a fight is staggering.\n\nAs for cons, one thing is SERIOUSLY irking me, and I’ve noticed a fair amount of other reviews bring this up, too. There is no checkpoint/save system when in combat. Fights could last a very long time, depending on the player’s strategies, and if a main character is killed nearing the end of a battle by some stray bandit, you’ve gotta start ALL OVER again. This has happened to me a handful of times, and I could only quench my rage by shutting the game down and taking a break.\n\nSecondly, I've encountered a bug when the enemy is taking their turn in a battle. Sometimes... they just wont do anything, and I end up locked on the 'ENEMY'S TURN' screen. Had to restart a single battle three times before it finally fixed itself. This game's issues are few, but damn, they can be annoying.\n\nI really hope the devs patch this bug, but apart from those gripes, I'm really loving this game.\n\nIf you want an intense and addictive turn based strategy game with a hint of satanic horror, Hard West is the place to go.","November 25, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each scenario has different mechanic on the map (sometimes to lead exploration expedition, sometimes you mine gold, sometimes you just want to kill and burn and cause chaos) and few tactical missions.\n\nIn each scenario you manage a group of up to 4 characters who do not level up, but as you play and find loot and ability cards you can customize characters to your liking. Although ability cards are given at random and as soom as much better than others, each time you play your characters will have to be customized differently.\n\nTactical turn based combat is simillar to XCOM, but since cover also reduces damage greatly, the focus is much much more on flanking oponents or using unique ricochete mechanic which allow one of your team-mates to fire and bounce bullet from metal objects like bells, buckets etc to hit oponents behind cover.\n\nAll that in a devilish mood of western and six-shooters.","February 23","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great game for the price, I got about 18 hours of play in at $20 USD and that was doing all the scenarios on Normal once.  If you are a completionist and want to get all of the unlocks (which does have gameplay impacts), you could spend another 20-30 hours playing the scenarios multiple times.\n\nThe story is well written and it's interesting to see the scenarios weave together with the main characters.  The game allows you to choose a few different paths to take to learn it all so everyone's experience will likely be slightly different as they go through it.  The map mode allows some choice/consequence actions to take place adding more variability in how the story plays out overall.\n\nI only played on Normal so I can't speak to the other difficulties but overall it wasn't too difficult with a little bit of strategy.  The AI was pretty dumb in many cases allowing me to take advantage of positioning often.  The best example would be them ending their turns in a small area where I had range through a window.  I was able to kill 3-4 guys that way over 5-10 turns as they refused to take advantage of their numbers and kept ending their turns right where I shot their buddy after a move or two.\n\nI also enjoyed the card upgrade system and the different types of guns available; the progression was quite noticable during gameplay and they allow for quite a bit of customization for each of the characters you can control.","February 25","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm still getting to grips with the ability cards/deck and how they combine to give additional bonuses but I like what I've seen so far (just finished the game on easy setting). These two mechanics lend a very strategic layer to the tactical squad based combat. You could build a character with high luck values and some "expensive" abilities that chew through luck to turn him/her into a demonic juggernaut, or into a character that spams out prayers/buffs every few turns to make them shoot the wings off a fly from half way across the map. Due to the random supply of cards you can't munchkin/twink your way through the game, at least not in the early parts of each scenario until you have a larger card stash.\n\nI was somewhat puzzled by the "metagame" in each scenario as the mechanic changed in each scenario with no real explanation in the game itself (the manual had some info). In one scenario I need to recruit servants, keep them fed and healthy in order to secure certain positions or to do certain tasks, in another scenario I needed to mine gold by myself (no servants), in another scenario I had to manage my premonition power to avoid tactical disadvantages later in the scenario or to secure advantages later in the scenario. These changing mechanics in each scenario  were interesting, but puzzling at the start with some as it was not clear how best to use them or when they should be saved/stored.\n\nAll in all I like the game, in particular the squad/tactical combat parts. A Kickstarter/crowd-funding success in my opinion :-)","February 5","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is told through eight interlocking scenarios and while the writing can be somewhat uneven, the narrator's understated manner is quite memorable. The AI is dumb, however the fact that characters can die in one or two shots makes the game sufficiently challenging. Also, this game has one of the best random number generator I've seen. Unlike some titles, Hard West will not have you constantly miss on a 95% hit chance so RNG rarely ruins your plans. I recommend this game for its setting, original and thematically-appropriate progression system as well as decent replayability. At the time of writing this, version 1.3 has been released so I haven't encountered any performance or game logic issues throughout my entire playthrough.","December 26, 2015","true","20.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobmanbob/recommended/307670/","bobmanbob","Bobmanbob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobmanbob/","104 products in account","Short Version\n\nSuperb blend of supernatural/demonic themes and Wild West tactical gunplay. What impressed me the most is the unique way the story is told and new areas are revelead based on the decisions you make. Battles are solid, turn-based firefights made interesting with the hugely customizable skill system: equippable playing cards yield direct bonuses and extra effects by carrying a poker hand. Weapons and items add an extra layer to this customization and are also upgradable if you look in the right places. Cover and luck systems are great: choose almost anything to duck behind/under and take your shot, shattering windows along the way and if you miss, it's not a total loss becaue you'll detract from your target's luck which is needed to activate powerful and interesting skills.\n\n\nRead the full version with screenshots online[www.bobmanbob.com]\n\n\nFull Version\n\nTrue to it's name, Hard West is a tough tale set in the unforgiving wilderness of the Wild West. In the opening scene, your mother is lost to bandits. Left with low hope and little choice, your father ropes you into the dangerous gold mining trade from which you struggle to eek out a living. Opportunities belie misfotrune at every turn; caves collapse upon discovering their riches and working relationships become very soured when your new friend is captured. With prospects hitting rock bottom, your father succumbs to a suspicious offering from a mysterious stranger: an amulet that will cure bad luck and heal your woes. Unforuntately, your woes are not at an end and the amulet forever curses the owner to bring bad luck wherever they wander. Burdened with a poisonous aura of misery and the guilt of his decision, your father exits your life.\n\nHard West's story begins like a sombre western, except it includes all of the action they promise but usually fail to deliver on. Soon enough, clues begin to drop to suggest that this is not your typical wild west world and you begin to get the feeling that something big is gonna go down. The fantastically voice-acted narrator is suddenly revealed to be Death himself, the mysterious stranger no longer shows up on foot but instead materializes out of thin air and it's not long before you're battling horned demons and cannibalizing the corpses of your assailants (not a mandatory activity). It's an effective transition from ordinary to supernatural that makes for a refreshing backdrop to this tactical RPG.\n\nWhat surprised and impressed me the most is the way in which the story is told. While visiting areas on the overworld map, text-based branching dialogue options will open up various opportunities and potentially reveal new places. Narration flows seamlessly from cutscenes into map exploration and battles, which helps to tie them all together nicely into a singular storytelling device. Once again living up to it's name, Hard West is littered with tough choices that have far-reaching or sometimes immediately impactful consequences. Curious promises will be made in return for your help, risks will surround the paths to riches and pursuing the local myths and legends is a trepidatious endeavour with unpredictable outcomes. Your morality and trust will be called into question as you are presented with these hard choices and you'll have to carefully consider whether you want to play the role of a selfish, profit-driven individual or a selfless, helpful character. It's a hugely interactive method of storytelling that deeply involves the player and the decisions they make.\n\nEvident from the outset is the attention to detail Creative Forge Games have applied throughout the game. Check out the first screenshot: how's that for a snazzy main menu with all the animated bells and whistles? Battle maps extend beyond threadable ground to include a multitude of extra buildings and scenery, which is nice to see while you're scouting around for enemies. Almost every wall, piece of wood and object lying around can be used or turned into cover. Shotgun shells and rounds of ammunition shatter windows and send glass in every direction. The user interface is also highly-detailed with decorative silver flourishes surrounding every button and piece of canvas.\n\nLet's talk action. Encounters are turn-based, tactical firefights which see you choosing an area to take cover behind and line up your shot from. That giant boulder may offer you full cover but will consume all of your action points reaching it whereas the nearby barrel will offer half cover and leave you with enough AP to take a shot. Skills add new layers of depth to this would-be familiar system: pray for random bonuses, ricochet shots off obstacles, reduce all friends and foes to 1 HP and much, much more. These skills are obtained as rewards, in the form of playing cards. Sacrificing the skills and passive bonuses of individual cards can be beneficial, because special bonuses are obtainable by equipping a set of cards whose combined face value amounts to a poker hand. Combine this tinkering with a wide range of weapons, relics and items and you're in character customization heaven. I personally loved the level of customization this allows, especially given that the skills are tied only to cards and are therefore completely interchangeable amongst characters.\n\nDeath is permanent in Hard West; if a character dies in battle, they're gone. However, most extra party members are fleeting due to the fact that the story moves on between chapters. Mess up once and you'll have to restart or move on without them. After making a few rash decisions myself, I was left with only 1 party member to take on the next mission: a siege against a high-profile criminal and a mob of his best shooters. Herein lies the beauty of the skill and exploration systems. While wandering around the map for the best equipment I could find, one store owner had a new dialogue option: he offered to add an extra barrel to my double-barreled shotgun. Yes please. Talking to him again, he offered to add a 4th. Hell yes! I also now had a large deck of cards to choose my skills from, since my other members had bit the dust. I won't talk about the combination used because it was one of the highlights of the game for me and I don't want to spoil it. Suffice to say, I was transformed into a supernatural, quad barrel shotgun wielding force to be reckoned with that went on to kick some serious ♥♥♥. It still wasn't easy, but boy was it glorious. I found playing around with the skills, stats and weapons and then using them to successfully enact your own strategies and theories on the battlefield to be hugely entertaining.\n\nGameplay is challenging but always fair. Positioning yourself effectively is paramount if you want your shot to have a high chance to hit. Missing is never a total loss though, because you will detract from the enemy's luck instead, which is needed to use skills. Taking a hit from an enemy adds to your own luck and brings you closer to activating powerful skills that can really help to level the odds. Even when I had to restart a battle, I wasn't cursing the decisions I made but instead found myself excitedly looking forward to trying out new strategies and skill/item combinations. There are so many other good ideas and little secrets knocking about in this game too copious to cover here, but they await any pilgrim who ventures out into the Hard West.","January 2","true","5.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's an interesting idea but given the way the campaign is set out, the enemies you encoutner and the fact that luck doesn't regenerate by itself, means that if you get shot at two or three times, means you barely get to use any of your abilities. I'm not sure if this is the way it's supposed to work. I like the way that luck works in regard to hits and to-hit, but keying abilities to amounts of luck seems a bad idea and in my experience it doesn't work. Would have been better if abilities were on a number-of-turns cooldown based on how powerful each ability is. It's strange that some abilities have both a luck cost and a cooldown.\n\nEnemy overwatch: This is never explained, but some enemies in some situations will ahve a red ring around them where if you cross into that ring the enemy will fire at you. You don't get that ability on your own posse. This can be really annoying if the enemy happens to run into a room with only one entrance and where they can't be seen from the outside.\n\nThe campaign: The exploration part of the campaign is equal thirds interesting, boring, and awkward. They tried a lot of different ideas and each part of the campaign plays differently. Introducing mechanics that exist just for that campaign's exploration. The problem is that most of these mechanics are just awkward and boring and don't add anything more than tedium to the game.\n\nGood Stuff:\n\nRicochet: this ability is a lot of fun, but often you find that either you don't have a line of sight to a ricochet object or there's only one object. Still, it's a lot of fun to chain ricochet off a bell, anvil, washing tub, bucket, another anvil, and hit a guy behind full cover that you can't see directly.\n\nInteresting Ideas:\n\nPoker hands bonuses on deck construction. It could have been much better - more cards, persistent cards between campaigns, cards that you could improve in some way.\n\nRandomised event outcomes: This sort of works as well, although it's never really explained which events are random.\n\nDoesn't really work for me:\n\nMost of the exploration stuff just doesn't work for me, nor does the quirky variety of guns. Ultimately there are just 3 things you're looking for  - damage, damage against full cover, and magazine size. Most weapons deal a maximum of 1 damage against someone in full cover, unless you flank them.\n\nIt feels like a lot of ideas were sort of tried here, as if the developers werent sure what would or wouldn't work, but it leads to a very inconsistent and confusing feel to the game, and often just adds awkwardness to the experience.\n\nStill, it's a good enough game and it's set in the wild wild west, which is awesome.","January 24","true","31.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Really, I did. But instead, I'll likely finish this playthrough and never touch it again. Not bad, but not great.\n\nI'll cut to the chase and say that the main problem is that the turn-based squad combat is missing a few CRITICAL elements to make it tactical. The key missing ingredient is an 'Overwatch' or 'Held Action' mechanic. This alone dumbs down combat significantly. Also conspicuously missing is an option to 'Defend' or 'Hunker Down.' It may not seem like a lot, but what these mean is that most of your squad's actions are... nothing. In XCOM (which admittedly set the bar high) every action is important. If you can't get a squad member into position they can usually do something that feels useful, even if that is Overwatching on the off chance an alien comes barging through. In Hard West there is just a lot of skipping actions, turn after turn, hoping that the enemy AI makes a mistake... because other than sitting in once place, there isn't anything else you can do to prepare for it.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere of the game is amazing. The storytelling is great, as is the ambience delivered by the music and graphic styles. The optional objectives really add to the immersion. They let me make choices to match a player's playstyle or to give notably different appriaches to missions. The interface is fairly intuitive, and even though a few mechanics are never explained, they're easy enough to figure out.\n\nIt is a shame that the core of the game (the turn based combat) is not as tactical or exciting as other games in the genre.\n\nOverall:\n-If you like 'weird west' settings, definitely get this game! Between the art and the narration, it feels like playing in a Deadlands campaign!\n-If you like turn-based squad combat, meh, it's certainly not bad for the price, just don't expect an XCOM challenger.","November 19, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xylonez/recommended/307670/","xylonez","xylonez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xylonez/","31 products in account","I think the game has a pretty interesting theme. It has an interesting storyline and great voice over. It has some serious glaring flaws tho, which is why I don't recommend this game.\n\nFirst though, I want to talk about the 3 features that I really like from this game and I think the game do really well at.\nThe Luck System - I think this luck system is just fantastic. For one, your character's abilities consume luck in order to use it. Now here's the interesting part. For every shot that the target dodges/hit, the targets luck gets reduced/increased. This makes the RNG in the game less random.\nThe Card System -  For some events that occured in the game, you could get cards that gives you a bonus stats as well as an active/passive ability. Each character can have up to 5 cards, and if these cards form a hand (think of it like Poker), such as Full House, Four of a Kind, Double Pair, etc, you could get additional bonuses. There are also 2 Joker cards that can become any card and help you get a better hand.\nThe Cover System -  It's pretty similar to XCOM's cover system. The difference lies in the fact that cover also gives you additional defense. For example, without cover, 1 shot will deal 4 damage. With half-cover, it becomes 2 and with full-cover, it becomes 1. No more bulls**t shot that kill your guys behind a full-cover, and it puts heavy emphasize on actually flanking your enemies.\nNow to the glaring issues.\nLacks of Progression - The story is divided into a few scenarios. After you completed each scenario, you can play another scenario. The thing is, any progress you've saved up from the previous scenarios isn't brought to the next one. All the cards you got before? It's now gone. All of the weapons and crew setup that you got before? It's gone as well. The lack of progression makes it hard to continue playing, especially in a story-driven game like this.\nNo Load/Save - You would think that a strategy game would have at least basic feature like this, but nope. There's an autosave kind of thing, so that you can pick up where you've left off before, but there isn't a manual one. And for me, it's not for save-scumming during the game either. It's so that I could explore all possible options in the game world without the need to play the whole scenario again, just so I could know what the outcome is for the other option.\nAI gets defensive overwatch - Well, it's not exactly an overwatch. It's more like XCOM's Assault class' Close Combat Specialist. All the AI units have this, while your units don't. So they can just walk up to you, flank you, and shoot your units. That's not where the problem ends though, if you want to reposition your flanked unit, well you need to kill it first, otherwise your unit will get shot. It's a pretty dumb mechanic IMHO.\nThere are some balance issues with the cards, the bonuses they provide and the abilities, although it's to be expected on a newly released game.\n\nOverall, I think the story itself is pretty solid, although the lacks of progressions kind of prevents you to be immersive with the story. The combat is pretty fun and refreshing, if you don't mind the defensive overwatch that the AI gets. It's worth a buy if you don't mind these issues, otherwise wait for a sale before getting it.\n","November 27, 2015","false","7.3"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","15","30","0","0"

The story is great but the combat is terrible.\n-enemies can shoot through whole buildings, not one wall but several.\n-the ricochet  ability has limited use.

Have you ever seen someone pump a double barrel?\n-abilities do not carry over from one campaign to the next. If they had allowed this some missions would have gone smoother. Instead you find yourself playing pick a boo untill you are surrounded and shot one hit point at a time.\n-cover system is useless.  enemies will be crouched next to barrels etc but in full view of your character and recieve full armor bonus.  You also cant crawl or step through openings , windows, making doors your only option.  Door = bullet magnet.\n- very little customization in regards to abilities, character apperance and available weapons.\n\nThis game had the makings to be something great but instead falls flat on its face.

By this I mean, each chapter you progress through the family tree is ended abruptly. It really annoys me because all the time and effort you invest into any chapter is eventually dissolved because when you transition into the next chapter, it is like a fresh new game, (yes some are different character stories). All the weapons, items, leveled up, and bonus cards are removed. You repeat this cycle 7 or 8 times. After I got through 5, I'm like "I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done."\n\nThe gameplay is fun, mechanics are adequate, and the wild west theme is great. It just doesn't matter because it is all deleted when you finish the chapter.\n\nIs this really an RPG Strategy game or an Arcade Strategy game. It feels more like the 2nd one.  I wish I could get my money back because it was a massive disappointment.\n\nI recommend that this game is worth $7.00-$10.00.

If the developer continues to smooth and polish it, I can see HW becoming a regular series with a strong fanbase.  Now, it's a game that captures a lot of the good parts of the first two Fallouts, interesting setting and story, and a strong theme.  It's mired by some difficult camera and movement, as well as a bit of framerate or otherwise visual determent.  If you like strategy and tactis games, and especialy if you're tired of video game gunplay that only goes between WWII, modern day, and the space future, you'd probably enjoy Hard West.","November 21, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is a really fun strategy game. I completely recommend this game if you are going to sit down and play it through on one session.\n\nBiggest failing is that the save state is broken. I am showing the first two scenarios at 0%, yet I am on the last mission... The checkpoint fails to load, always wanting me to replay the tutorial--which loads the first mission regardless of how I answer. So you have to restart the mission to play the desired mission... If you fail, you are looking at about an hour of replay. Which means if you do not have a full hour or so for a session to complete the mission, don't bother. And even if you do, it may not persist your accomplishment! So, yeah, I am probably not finishing this game because it is not so good that I am willing to completely restart a very long mission.","May 3","false","8.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is heavily focused on flanking which works very well and is rewarding to do. However with the unique "luck" system, accuracy by volume is very viable, and that is a nice touch.\n\nThe setting takes the cake here. A generic western would have been boring, but the supernatural elements are executed perfectly to keep the player interested. The narrator's voice is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThe game plays out in several 1-3 hour scenarios that connect to each other to form an overarching storyline. I'm hopeful for add-on scenarios, since the layout is perfect for that.\n\nSome people complain about the lack of overwatch and no saving in missions, but I find them to be fitting with the theme and the setting.\nMy only real complaint is that the combat missions have no procedural elements in them, so it is very easy to find a certain tactic for a mission that works every time. Its more like a puzzle game in that sense.\n\nSo in conclusion: I'd highly recommend this game for anyone interested in the genre of turn based tactics. With such low price its almost a steal.\n","November 25, 2015","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I would recommend it to people who enjoys tactical combat, although it has some problems (such as; being unable to shoot a guy properly, while he is right in front of you and you have clear line of sight to him, just becouse he is touching a pieve of cover :P)\n\nI also came across a very funny bug. I didnt found a way to report it so i am writing it in here.\n\nIt involves spoilers so you have been warned.\n\nDuring the masked man quest line, towards the end when facing Diego, the game gives you the task of finding Diego, you are supposed to talk to him. I was using the golden bullet special ability with the holy musket, one shot killing enemies without even seeing them and Diego died to such a shot before i was able to talk to him. And than i came near his corpse and i was tasked to kill diego, who was already dead. Being unable to kill the dead guy (duh!) i was unable to complete the mission even though everybody in the map was dead. It is an annoying situation since you can encounter it towards the end of the chapter, and you have to play it again.\n\nBugs like these are expected in games like this. But it is not a very big deal. This is a fun game with nice atmosphere and a good soundtrack. Encounters are challenging but not hair pulling hard in normal difficulty.

Could have been really great.\n\nPROS\n\n-Decent graphics\n\n-Liked the idea of the converging stories, although slightly muddled.\n\n-Risk versus reward and injuries that turn into advantages was one of my favorite elements.  Reminded me of Darkest Dungeon (which you should also check out).\n\n-No saves. Even though I protested at first, it melds well with it's risk vs. reward system.\n\n-Interesting characters. Always looked forward to meet the next one. Could of easily identified with them if only we could get more involved with them. Maybe some dialogue or back story.\n\n-Combat system feels like X-COM\n\n-Nice atmosphere and music. Dark, Hard West.\n\n-Pricing at 15 euros or 20 dollars. it's a bargain.\n\nCONS\n\n-Animatons. I like when they stand around and use their talents but that's about it. All weapons appear EXACTLY the same and are divided into pistol and rifle animations. It doesn't even distinguish aiming or firing from the hip. Even the deaths are basically the same.\n\n-Detailed character customization would have been nice. It relies on trinkets and deck cards but feels lacking a bit.\n\n-Overwatch ability. Enemies have it. You don't. Prepare to learn it the hard way.\n\n-So much running around for trinkets, guns and cards, only to use them once or twice. MAJOR dissapoitment. NOT ENOUGH BATTLES.\n\n-Balancing issue with progression. Starts fine, even died a couple times only to completely overpower the enemy later on. Last mission(supposedly the hardest mission) completed it in 6 turns. Played it on medium difficulty. I will also play it on hard. Maybe that fixes the issue.\n\n-Short.  No scenarios, maps, multiplayer etc. Just the campaign? Maybe with the price it is justified, but I expected more.\n\n-Tutorial is laughable. Had to post a question in the forum just to understand the BASIC mechanics of some stats, such as defense and heat.  No pop ups?!\n\n6.5/10","November 20, 2015","true","40.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like adding a "set-up" phase where you can sneak without drawing the enemys attention on you to complete certain objectives before the combat starts or allowing you to get a drop on a few enemys getting you an advantage.\n\nBut expect some crashes and freezes. I've had like 7 crashes playing this game, the most of them when starting the game, the rest when the transition between overworld and combat map happened, which is also the point where the game saves, so it's not bad or broken, just annoying.\n\nAnyways, i recommened it, but maybe you want to wait for a patch.","November 22, 2015","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't like the way of simple metagame and jumping to other heroes and equipment from chapter to chapter. You won't feel much of XCOM vibes as some say. Items and weapons are ok, nothing special. Has some nice interesting elements e.g. how you work with environment (roll over the table for protection etc). Even on easy difficulty, there's no game saving during neither tactical nor strategic gameplay (between playable checkpoints), there's no excuse for that especially that a crashed game can ruin your whole chapter - for me personally that's a single good reason to uninstall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rolldig/recommended/307670/","rolldig","Insept","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rolldig/","28 products in account","Hard West is a western themed story based tactical RPG, which combat reminiscent of XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012). Scroll down for my impressions on the game, or you can watch the video if  you prefer:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=568367661\n\nThe tactical layer of Hard West has a unique setup phase which involves sneaking around and sometimes subduing foes to prevent them from raising alarm for a few turns. I thought it was a fun and thematic addition to the gameplay.\n\nCombat in Hard West feels similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown because of the cover system, but it works a bit differently. Cover both reduces the accuracy of incoming shots, and decreases damage taken. Hard West also has a unique character attribute called Luck which reduces a character's chance to get hit, but each time an enemy misses them, they lose some Luck. Each time they are hit, their Luck replenishes. These two things combined result in a game where units in full cover are incredibly time-consuming to kill. Flanking is too dominant a strategy, which leads to invariant gameplay that quickly gets old.\n\nHard West's character system has a cool poker theme to it. Each character has card slots, and each card has a passive bonus, plus a unique passive or active ability. Creating poker hands in these card slots gives the character a unique special bonus. For example, four of a kind grants a bonus to aim. I like the system, but didn't find much use for the active abilities.\n\nThe game also has an overworld map which allows you to travel between areas. Each location gives a small dialogue popup with a few options. Sometimes these are basic things like trading at a store, or asking for information, but on occasion you get to make choices with meaningful gameplay consequences.\n\nThe narrative of Hard West is told through cutscenes, text, and a voiced narrator. The main story line is about exacting brutal revenge, which is perfect fit for a western setting. I think the plot is structured well, but the characters are weak. There's not much that demonstrates each character's personality. That being said, Hard West absolutely nails the setting. The themed game mechanics, the sounds, and the visuals all  come together to make the game feel like something special. The religious horror aspects are interesting too, although the actual demons were introduced a little abruptly.\n\nOverall, Hard West is a very polished game that has some unique ideas and a stellar atmosphere, but I found the combat lacking in the variation and depth that I had hoped for.\n\nI want to mention that it was hard choosing not to recommend it. I am very much in the "maybe" file when it comes to this games, as it does some things very well, and others not so well.","December 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

The fact you can customise everyone Shooting Ability base on Cards are cool, but it weird you can give anyone any kind of ability with no lore tied to it. How the heck can a lady in distress gain the ability to transform into a demon? Its just get absurd here and there.\n\nI would give a Thumb down for now until they fixed some of the bigger bugs. For a 20 buck game though one cant really ask for too much these days, but not really Values for Money right now.\n\nThe story been cool, but then again, it leaves tons of unanswered plotholes in my opinion: does that mean DLCs will come in the future? I do hope so, otherwise its a game that look promising but kind of ended up meh due to the very short campaign which one can finish under 12hr on normal mode.","November 27, 2015","false","19.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

That is, until the second homestead defence mission which I had to restart 5 or 6 times because Florence would get killed (more often than not while in cover) by one of the last remaining enemies.  So I quit out of frustration and came back in an hour, and upon pressing 'continue' found that I was taken back to the very first mission/tutorial.

I expected it to be like Wasteland 2 or Divinity: Original Sin, but it's more like a poorly excecuted Banner Saga (a game I liked). I guess what separates this games from the ones I just mentioned, and what makes it boring, is that it's impossible to get invested in the story or the combat.\n\nSince the game is broken up into combat missions (like Banner Saga sorta, only they actually mattered in the Banner Saga), which are further broken up into scenarios, the game is constantly interrupting your progress. The scenarios only last like 2 hours or so, and at the start of a new scenario, the story picks up somewhere completely new, possibly with a new set of characters that you don't care about or who have nothing to do with the previous characters you were playing as, and thus you lose any equipment you had in the last one. Basically, the game keeps uprooting your progress and placing you back at square one. Companions who you may have thought were cool and who you wanted to get attached to are gone, only having ever gotten two lines of backstory or dialogue, and who you only got to play with for two missions, maybe a half hour.\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, the combat is pretty uninteresting, too. As you progress, you may get some pretty cool abilities that you want to use against enemies. They are actually pretty useful, but you hardly ever get to use any of them. Abilities use luck, which starts at 100 +/- any modifiers on that character, and luck is regenerated by getting shot. You actually get a lot of luck for getting shot, enough to use a basic ability from nothing. What makes it terrible is the whole point is to not get shot, so if you're good at games like this, you position yourself where the enemy has a low chance of hitting you. The problem is, you lose luck equivalent to the enemy's chance to hit whenever they miss, so you end up never having enough luck to use an ability when you want to. So, if you're like me, you're only left with your gun, which gets boring pretty fast, like the rest of the game.","May 16","false","6.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

You can "flank" somone behind full cover only to find the cover hasn't reduced. The movement path for characters isn't shown resulting in sometimes bizzare pathing choices. The chance to hit and the AI are both obviously broken under some conditions - you can find yourself shooting round after round at an ememy without them ever moving or firing back, they just "pass turn" every time.\n\nI've just quit the last playthrough after firing over 50 shots at a demon that wouldn't move or fire back at 53% hit chance, and missing every time. It doesn't take a genius to know that missing 50 out of 50 shots at a 53% hit chance is pretty unlikely. I could shoot at him but not hit him despite what the percentage said, and he wouldn't move or fire back. I finally went closer and spotted his shadow but could not fire at him despite him being out in the open, the option was greyed out. The next round he charged and one-shotted me. Not very staisfying.\n\nClearly this needs work, which is a shame because it's a great idea, but with the combat mechanics so unreliable at this stage I won't be playing it until they patch. I like challenging and dangerous games, but only if the mechanics are clear, reliable, and not bugged.","January 30","false","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWith only a few minutes in, I have seen what made this game so apart from other good tbs:\n-no game saving during the scenario: which means long, weird strategies where you have to begin again when you need to replay or situations where you actually have to replay the whole scenario to do something, tragically, you lose everything from one scenario to another;\n-the obvious defensive tactics: I mean, you cannot defend, overwatch (duh!) or make complex strategies with your turns, just attacking when your time comes;\n-weird AI: I mean, usually in TBSs, we have the conscious AI that do not throw themselves in an attempt for self-preservation. However, not in this game, you don't. They usually run across the map, on the open, just trying to flank the hell out of you with one hit kills. Quite frustrating indeed, considering their numbers and weird situations.\n-rpg elements: well, the story have strange, unnecessary parts and you usually expect your decisions to matter. Not this time, though. Temporary allies, text progression and desperate meaningless warnings.\n\nDespite that, if you are curious and have frustration-denial abilities, it does have some nice art and UI, interesting mechanics (luck-defense, card-perks and cover making) and great maps/scenarios to fight in.\n\n(Maybe the next one!

It should be listed as early access. I've played for less than two hours and already encountered several baffling bugs which makes me think there's been minimal playtesting on the game.\n\nI played the tutorial, and it was sufficient to teach me combat basics. But after the first fight, I was dumped into the overworld map and told to "mine until your licenses run out". Huh? So I start jumping to each spot, spending money on one of three confusing options, until I found an herbalist selling healing herbs. I bought the herbs and distributed them to my characters, only to find I was now stuck. I had mined all the $15 mining options and now needed $40 to mine deeper. But I had less than $40, and there was no trading post yet, so I couldn't even sell something to get the remaining money to continue. Only option was to restart the game...\n\nSo the next time I played, I didn't do the tutorial, but still had to watch and listen to the narrator telling the story. I couldn't skip it. Back on the overland map, I made sure to click on things in the right order. There's really no strategy to it, other than making sure you leave enough money to pay for the lowest mining operation you have access to. Once I discovered this, the overland map was just a chore: "Check off the boxes in the right order or restart the game!"\n\nEventually, I found Florence and she was added to my party as another main character. She had her own derringer, and I gave her a card that provided shrieking ability. I was starting to get into the game despite it's flaws. But it was getting late, and there was a big fight coming up with the Mexican crime lord, so I decided to exit.\n\nThe next morning, I fired up the game and "loaded from last checkpoint". I headed straight to the fight with the Mexican crime lord. But on the setup screen, Florence wasn't in my party anymore. What the hell? Her derringer was in my inventory, as well as the card I'd given her. But she was no where to be found. I thought, okay...I'll exit out and reload the last checkpoint again, maybe it's just a glitch. I couldn't hit ESC from the character screen, so I went into the card screen and hit ESC, and quit to main menu. When I loaded from last checkpoint though, the Mexican crime lord fight was now RESOLVED, and a couple of NEW PLACES opened on the map! WTF?\n\nFor some reason, the game had assumed I succeeded in the last combat with the Mexican, even though I NEVER EVEN ENTERED the combat. And Florence (a main character) was still gone. And worse yet, this jacked-up mess was now my new save "checkpoint", so I can NEVER go back and actually fight the Mexican OR get Florence back. Only option? Restart the whole thing again...\n\nSo, two hours into the game and there are glaring playtesting oversights. And I'm not the only one who's noticed these issues and reported them - a quick search turned up other reviews and discussions. Until the game is playtested and patched, I can't recommend it.\n\nSome things I liked:\n+ The poker card mechanic is actually pretty cool. I liked trying to make "hands" with my cards to get extra buffs for characters.\n+ The art style is nice. Kinda cartoony and painterly, but still gritty.\n+ The combat is pretty fun. I especially liked the ricochet shot, even though there was no tutorial explaining it. Very neat and fitting, though.\n\nOther annoyances:\n- Can't zoom out on the overworld map. The camera is way too close to the ground.\n- Checkpoints. I can't tell when the game is saving, or what it's saving. I never saw a save indicator.\n- Can't skip narrator's storytelling, which is frustrating since you have to re-load due to bugs so many times.\n- AI seems to always know where I'm at. They are able to make a bee-line straight toward me, even if I'm hiding.","May 15","false","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

People who are fans of the dark arts will be sorely disappointed by this gibberish, and normal people will just be treated to a grab bag of cliches. This aint no H.P.Lovecraft or Blavatsky-inspired gameworld and it's use of esoteric themes is muddled garbage.\n\nThe campaign interface is crap, and the single player campaign is about 4 or 5 seperate campaigns that have little to do with each other in a gameplay sense.\n\nThe turn based combat is so simple and basic it can only be described as a step backwards for turn based combat.\nIn this game you can move then shoot....you can't shoot then move cause that would just be crazy and unrealistic right?\n\nRemember the 90's?... When turn-based combat was king....with the original jagged alliance or the original x-com, we used to be given Action Points, and we could "spend" em how we liked. Run, throw a grenade then disappear around a corner at a run with the last of your points. That caused you to calculate quickly if you had enough points to do what you wanted. That,in turn, made character stats and abilities relevent to the gameplay in a big way.\n\nThe "new", dumbed down form of turn based combat found in this game and others like Wastelands 2 need to be taken out back and shot. In my oppinion this style of turn based combart is damaging to this wonderful genre, and does not show its glory or potential in the modern age.","March 2","false","22.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Cover is basically a hit modifier, so there is always a chance to get hit if enemies can see you, and without any kind of overwatch or opportunity fire, the AI can rush straight at you at no penalty. This would be tolerable if the game had some form of mid-mission saves or checkpointing, or if your troops were expenable but alas, no. The end result is a game that apes XCOM's combat, but forgets some of the key lessons at the same time. A real shame.

Unfortunately experience in XCOM means you notice the flaws in Hard West alot more.\n\nThe game has full controller support but I found I was playing with my mouse/keyboard for some sections and xbox 360 controller for others. I couldn't stick to the controller because the movement was too responsive, despite messing with the settings.\n\nI didn't think the tutorial fully explain things so it wasn't immediately apparent what i could and couldn't do. In only the second mission I was left in the lurch trying to use stealth and steal a key. I ended up having to turn around and just shoot all the enemies I should have avoided.\n\nThe story was far more text based that I had expected. On a number of occasions I was told my character was killing people and doing stuff via a text window, when these things could have been their own mission. Therefore the story moved on far too quickly. Go there, do this, travel here, dig there. Some quite important story elements could be glossed over if you are just eager to go round digging holes.\n\nI quit during mission 6 or 7 after i was killed trying to rush the mission at the speed the story wanted me to go.","November 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Instead, I was given an entirely convoluted version of Chess with a meak story that, to me, looks more of an Alpha than a full release.\n\nAt certain points in the game, it was painfully obvious that the developers had rushed to finish their product. Animations are janky and disjointed, most character models seem to be palette-swaps of each other, a linear story masquerading as a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, and the gameplay isn't anywhere near as fine-tuned as the developers have claimed. With a lack of a proper save feature, the game requires the player to devote several hours of time to something that would fare much better as a casual game.\n\nSo, I leave this with a downvote for now. If the developers continue to work on it and adress the problems highlighted by the community, I may remove this review.","November 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

However you're not really given the tools to tackle them in any clever ways. I find the biggest advantage you have is the ablity to move more tiles per turn, so I find myself running away the whole time hoping to clip them as they leave themsleves exposed.\n\nThe enemy also have a death wish so will just charge you down, no cover, usually to their own demise. However, if you have characters that must survive the mission you're screwed because anyone of them can succomb to a flanking suicide run followed by a shotgun to the face. This combined with the fact you have no real defensive abilites such as covering fire / supression it's hard to figure out how exactly you're meant to handle combat.\n\nIn addition to this, i've found the mac version unstaible in parts with certain chapters crashing on certain missions (repeatedly) to the point where you have to just avoid that quest.

I was able to buy it on sale on steam and I got every penny back 100 fold in hours of enjoyment.\n\nEssentially, you play different "scenarios" with different characters. In these "scenarios" you explore the Hard West map making decisions and discoveries that can lead to big turn based gun battles. Through all of this a new story is told and as you play all the different "scenarios" you come to understand how the Hard West became horrifically cursed and tainted with evil.\n\nOverall, I loved it. It was unique, challenging and kept me playing. However, like all games it had a few things that could be better.\n\nKeeping in theme with the game there is a lot good, some bad and a little ugly with Hard West, in my opinion and here it is:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Combat is solid, you sweat every turn and the AI is smart\n- Your decisions matter. Decisions you make in the world play can help or harm and really cant be reversed. In combat getting hit hurts and character deaths have impact. Also, you can not just save in order to re-load and avoid your mistakes\n-Luck Points are unique aspect of the game that make combat more nerve wracking and/or rewarding\n-  Unique environment and style that is maintained through the whole game\n- Interesting (but simple) stories. "Scenarios" feel like a module series in a classic pen and paper RPG\n- It does a good job of rewarding your for characters for selling their soul, the powers truly tempt you\n- While graphics are not "cutting edge" the game art is great\n- Perks and weapons are fun to discover and use\n\nThe Bad:\n- While you really think about your choices in the World Map Exploration, it is a tad lacking and feels more like you are choosing your own adventure than making big strategic decisions\n- While the combat is solid, it can get redundant after you have played a few of the scenarios especially cause the characters can all use the same guns and perks\n- Stealth, is a little hard to grasp initially y and when you do understand it, it is kind of dumb\n\nThe Ugly:\n- When in the world map I would often have crashes when switching to my character inventory, this made me lose some weapons and perks. Which is frustrating considering you can not really save your game and you work hard for all your gear.\n\nAll in all, if you like tactical turn based games and you want a unique setting, I say get Hard West. Personally, I hope they make more Hard West games,   I think there is lots more they could do with this world.\n","February 15","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as various characters, taking both sides of the story, so in some scenarios you will be working against and fighting characters you played in previous ones. The story is great, definatly worth buying just for that.\n\nHard west is made by a small development team and there are some minor issues, but nothing that will put you off while playing. A few of the texts are not worded well, maybe as the dev team is polish, and some of the menus can freeze for a few seconds while opening, but this very minor and happens out of the main game play.\n\npros:-\nGreat story\nstylised and atmospheric graphics\nreplayability\namazing soundtrack\nfun gameplay\n\ncons:-\nocasional slow (freezes) inventory screens\nwording in text dialogs could be better.\n\nVerdict:- 10/10\nI love this game, the story and atmospher well out weigh the cons.","February 15","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wisely, it borrows a lot of strong ideas from XCOM, and the combat plays out pretty reasonably.\n\nI didn't like the "out-of-combat" part much; lots of times I was just speed clicking through story choices to get to the next fight.  I didn't find any of the little mini-puzzles or games in the story section interesting.\n\nBuilding and equipping your characters wasn't amazing.  The cards were a reasonable idea, but there wasn't an enjoyable progression to them.  Through each section of the campaign, you'd hope to find some of the strong abilities (eg. Shadow Salve, Shadow Kill, Golden Bullet, Cannibalism) but you didn't feel like you were training up a character or building something.  You just kind of get what you get, and make a few reasonably clear choices about what to combo together (ie. put the luck generating item on the same guy you gave the ridiculous luck ability to)   Their "fixed story integration" setup meant you couldn't have the sort of control you do in XCOM, and I missed that part much more than I liked the story, which was sort of cheesy and repetitive (oh I'm selling my soul now? again? oh maybe that guy I'm selling my soul to is the DEVIL? WOO).\n\nLastly, the game could have used more variety in terms of weapons, abilities, enemies, and tactics (you did a lot of engage at distance, flank, repeat).\n\nBut... there isn't a bunch of good games in this space.  Most of them are garbage.  And this definitely isn't garbage.  If you want something to hold you over to XCOM 2, this could be your game.","December 21, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shooting and cover mechanics all work well and you get cards which buff your dudes. The weapons are varied and interesting. One unique thing about this game is the luck mechanic, which is a bit complex but impacts your strategy in interesting ways. Some people have complained about the overworld layer of the game but I liked that too, it's diverting in the same way that the text quests in Space Rangers 2 were. You'll spend 90% of the time playing through pregenerated levels, about 5 per small campaign. The main campaign quest line consists of four campaigns, which took me more than 12 hours to complete on Hard mode (non Ironman). I recommend Hard mode, but Ironman would be really brutal. People have also complained about the lack of a save system, which I agree is a little annoying but the levels generally only take 20 mins so I didn't mind retrying when I screwed up. This isn't an AAA title but for an indie developer it's really impressive work. There's easily 20+ hours of content here in a single playthrough (maybe 15 on Medium difficulty), even if there isn't much long term replayability. Basically, if you are waiting for XCOM 2 like me, then this is an excellent stopgap!","December 24, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the other  hand, if your character starts turn out of sight then you can get as close as you want.\n-Cover affects both hit chance and damage.\nThese encourage you to constantly maneuver your characters in small groups and flank enemies from multiple directions.\n\n3) Gunshots and blood are satisfying.\n\n4) You play multiple sides, which is an interesting narrative choice.\n\nSome quick shortcomings:\n1) Some systems aren't explained well on the campaign map.\n\n2) The hit/miss conditional on luck system, while interesting in concept with no randomness involved at all, can be somewhat unreasonable, depending on your perspective, and easily played. For example think of a situation where same three people shoot at one enemy. The enemy has 8 health 60 luck left, your group has 4 damage (35%)/ 5 damage (50%) / 3 damage (90%). The only shot sequence that would kill the enemy is 4/5/3 (assuming they gain 50 luck when hit), and any other sequence of shots will leave the enemy alive.\nWhen it is impossible to kill an enemy in one turn no matter the order if your highest damage shot has low percentage, and you want it to hit, drain luck first with weaker shots. It will be a sure hit.\nManipulating enemy luck differently according to different situations simply by changing the shooting order can make situations drastically easier (in my opinion--some might say it is tactical).\nOne might argue that since you don't know the starting luck of enemies, it does not matter. However most of the time the remaining luck is simply identified within a sufficient band for manipulation.\n\n3) Once a character has the JINX passive ability, you can drain most of the enemies' luck during setup stage to zero if you want.\n\n4) When you reload or restart tactical battles some bonuses seem to disappear. (not sure about other stuff but HP often decreases)","January 5","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My biggest problem is that I found the difference between hard and normal mode too big. Normal mode was too easy and boring, I finished most fights with everyone being at max HP, but hard mode was too hard, I restarted a mission at least seven times, but still could not complete it. Finally I got enough doing the same thing again and again, so I went back to normal mode. I think the best would be if you could have at least 1-2 more points in a mission where you could go back, if you fail. At least you should be able to restart after the setup phase (it was pretty annoying doing the setup phase again and again).\n\nPROS:\n- really good tactical possibilities, the fight is almost fully deterministic, so you can carefully plan the turn.\n- the luck system is a great idea, and I think it works pretty well.\n- despite other people, I like that the game is split to chapters. So if I liked one, I can try it again in harder difficulty.\n- the cards are a very interesting idea, I enjoyed optimizing the layout.\n- good atmosphere (especially the music and voice)\n- covers reduce damage, so no more unavoidable death from some extremely lucky enemy (how I hated that in XCOM).\n\nCONS:\n- difficulty levels are too rough, there should be something between normal and hard\n- no save during mission. I understand that the devs wanted the player to face the consequence of their acts, but currently you cannot continue a mission if you had to suspend, for example if something IRL prevents you to play on. Also the game has some bugs, which I can accept, but if I have to restart a 1 hour mission because of the bug, then that is not fun.\n- bad optimization: the game freezes many times (even during menu manipulations)\n- the UI just feels bad, several things are hard to see. For example on the card screen I can hardly tell which cards are assigned to a char, if I want to create a flush for example.\n- the adventure part (or whatever it is between missions) feels repetitive and boring (probably only me, I bought this game for the fight)\n- some abilities are not balanced\n\nEDIT: It turned out that on the mission where I failed hard mode I was fighting with two waves of enemies at the same time, which I supposed to kill separately. So my comment about hard mode being too hard is no longer valid.","February 13","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't strong, but for the genre, I don't recall too many western video games that have really good ones.\n\nThat said, I like the turn based game-play. When you're not running the scenarios, the story is a choose your own adventure where the decisions you make have an affect on your next choice (an interesting spin on resource management), and I would go so far as to say that this is where the replayability resides. Between scenarios, you are also dealt carts from the four suits from Nine through Ace. These cards give bonuses to your character, but the really neat thing is that you can combine the cards to make poker hands which offer more bonuses that stack with the cards you have allocated.\n\nI give it a thumbs up for the genre, the complexity and effort that Creative Forge has put into this.

Id say its fair value for the price and no doubt i will buy the next one.. while still wishing it was longer.\nI think my biggest grievances are\n1. View is FOUR points of the compass only!!, not veiwable from 360 degrees and elevation is not an option either (although you can change the height by veiwing upper floors of buildings, thats not the same).. The A.I. all shoot through lined up windows at you but u will almost never be able to do it yourself because you cant line them up. This one really annoys me.\n2. The stuff in the shops goes off the bottom of the scroll.. you have to pull 4 or 5 items into your buy window sometimes to get at the bottom item. not such a huge issue but i missed the op to buy great weps a couple of times b4 i noticed.\n3. The choppy story and constant re-allocation of characters... a "feature" or a "flaw"?

I was sceptical at first but it has a (to me) very appealing combination of sort of dark story telling and addictive combat. There will be many people saying there should be an ingame save system. But to me part of charm is living with the consequences of what you do. For instance when digging for gold you might hurt your hand, for the next battles that will hamper your ability but in time you will actually be stronger because you lost a finger (optional).\nThe story goes from sort of melodramatic to sorta batshit insane. Either you like it or you definately won't.
