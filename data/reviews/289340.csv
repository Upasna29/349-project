"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/289340/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","Echoing and further summarizing what reviews before me have said, this is a pretty cool game with some major, perhaps deal-breaking flaws.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple, straightforward, and works the way you expect it to. You start with a lump sum of cash and are expected to buy your first vehicle. Could be a car (meaning self-contained transport, like a flatbed or an armored car) or a truck, requiring a trailer. Afterwards, hire a driver that has the required licenses. In both cases, you have a lot of options.\n\nVehicles can be selected on the grounds of:\n\n•	Price\n•	Storage/transport capacity\n•	Speed\n•	Reliability\n•	Ease or difficulty of repair\n•	Predicted lifespan and depreciation rate.\n\nEmployees can be selected based on their starting wage, experience, and skills. Drivers have certain licenses which you can train them in and get faster as they gain experience. Managers have additional skills that make your business more efficient, however do not have much effe-....well, actually no. They do just as much as managers do in real life\n\nBuy things, hire drivers, get contracts, make money. Fun, right?\n\nBugs:\n\nThis game is horrible, like, unfathomably horribly coded. Minor bug: The personnel market *completely* changing every couple of hours (which is about a second at the slowest game speed), so you have to pause every time you want to hire someone, because their portraits move, but the buttons stay the same, so you click the button that was for person A and you hire person J because in the last microsecond, his face moved up the queue. This is the same for contracts as well, so again, unless the game is paused, you might accept a contract that is far too big for your vehicle or must be completed faster than you can drive.\n\nThe game has no concept of retaining sound settings and must be configured via launcher. Actually, no settings can be changed inside the game or on the fly.\n\nMajor Bug:\n\nAll contracts must be completed within a certain amount of time, notwithstanding it takes about 45 in-game days to drive what appears to be no more than ten miles, you are given an average speed your vehicle must travel at in order to satisfy the contract. However, up to a certain point it is impossible because traffic affects whether you complete or fail a contract. If there is a car in the passing lane, your trucks will rarely make an attempt to pass in the slow lane. Furthermore, if you fail a contract, your truck may simply stop. That's it, road closed. It will never move and cars will back up behind it indefinitely. You cannot resolve this bug because your vehicle and driver must be in the garage in order to be sold and fired, respectively.\n\nDeal-breaker:\n\nDespite the fact that most factories have large, large, loading zones (that only get bigger as you make them more profitable), the maximum amount of vehicles that can exist within the loading dock is two. However, the maximum number of vehicles *that are moving* within the loading zone is one, meaning that if you ever have three trucks doing business with the same factory or, god forbid, you have a competitor doing business with a factory, you will have a line of trucks five cars long waiting for the one guy who is moving his truck in the loading zone. This will invariably cause you to fail all contracts that includes that factory. And since any good competitor AI does business with a multitude of clients, all factories will see competitor trucks and cause you to fail, this makes over half of the game maps unplayable.\n\nAnd since the previous bug makes any map not playable for long, the amount of time you can play this game instead of restarting it is pretty small.\n\nCool concept, poorly executed, I do not recommend this game, however consider trying it sometime if a friend already bought it, or if it is ever on sale more than 50% off.","September 28, 2014","false","28.6"," 95 of 106 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","95","106","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinryu_steam/recommended/289340/","shinryu_steam","Shinryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinryu_steam/","909 products in account","Freight Tycoon Inc is a management game where you are entrusted to develop and maintain a Freight company that delivers goods for various manufacturing plants around the map. The game is set on a number of levels that provide you a certain challenge, each in its own way. While to some the levels system may seem out of place, in actuality, its a good thing. Once you have completed the level, you are given the option to continue playing on the level permanently. Just click yes, save your game for that level once it reloads and off you go, continuous play.\n\nIn Freight Tycoon you have to manage a number of things. The purchase of vehicles and trailers, the hiring of staff from managers, technicians, drivers, repair trucks, etc etc. Its also been done in a very nice style. You cannot just pick any truck or driver or job. Each truck in the game has a top speed it can travel at so you want to ensure jobs you get for that truck don't require more speed than your truck can go at, otherwise you will fail your contract. The truck also has a type, which means the type of carriage it has and what it can carry, this is also important as it determines what contracts you can acquire which need to be of the same carriage. The driver you hire has to have a license to drive the truck type you have bought.\n\nThis may seem daunting but the way the interface is laid out makes doing this so very easy, it is a genius UI here. The graphics are also surprisingly good in this game and the map comes to life the more you deliver contracts with houses and building slowly being built, upgraded by the game mechanics filling the map with life, it is quite an extraordinary mechanic that I have not seen done before automatically by the game.\n\nThe only con I find in this game is the options menu. For one, you cannot play in window mode, there is no option to do that in the options menu, so your stuck in full screen mode. This may not be an issue for a lot of you, but for me because I work too, I like to have my game running in window mode in the background, that's not possible here unless there is some ini file I haven't found that can do that.\n\nThe other con is Sounds. You cannot turn them off from the options menu when you go to it from the main menu. I'm not sure if there is an ingame menu to do it from, I have not found one.\n\nOverall Freight Tycoon is well worth the money to purchase. I was very sceptical about it when I got it but I was pleasantly surprised. Give this game a chance if you like Tycoon games, its well worth it.","April 4, 2014","true","7.9"," 81 of 91 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","81","91","0","1"

It has so much potential, but it suffers the same fate of many a tycoon game. There is always a best decision that can be made by a crude guess and the worst decision leaves you no worse off than the best.\nNow, I don't mean that there isn't always a best decision in other tycoon games, but usually the campaigns change that and you end up with a reasonable choice between say fuel efficiency, reliability or something else and the campaign helps dictate that. But unfortunately here the best cargo carriers are in the form of either the really small vans that you can use to spam contracts, or the much more expensive lorries. Most of the inbetween vehicles are too slow to get most contracts.\nSo once you've got your obviously best array of vehicles I assume you're ready for a tough decision over which contract you should make? Okay, well it doesn't really matter, just pick any that your vehicle is both big enough for and fast enough for. Will it make a profit? Of course! Does it matter which cargo you choose to haul? No, of course not! They're all roughly the same cost to carry and the same profit. What about your staff members? Don't you worry, when you're hiring there'll be a best candidate by far and little to no extra cost!\nSo now you've made those tough decisions, what will you do? Just watch the money roll in of course and make them again whenever you have to.\nZen Tycoon.\n\nThe UI is friendly. It's simple and for the most part it get the job done. Though it is occasionally a little clunky.\n\nThe problem is without the depth (no training for staff members, upgrades for lorries, fuel consumption to be considered, different benefits to different cargo, or interaction with competitors/clients, what about routes? Nah.) or bredth (no involvement in other industries like Railroad Tycoon, no trains or ships for cargo, no direct involvement in road development) the game is left feeling very samey very quickly.\n\nIt's the sort of game you'll probably play once or twice and leave by the wayside.","September 9, 2014","false","2.9"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","47","60","0","3"

The sound can't really say, because I play with the sound off :)\n\nSo all in all, I find it a really fun game (and isn't that the purpose of a game?), that just motivates you to play more and more and advance.\n\nIt is not too difficult nor to easy.

It has nothing to do with the game. Check the screenshots instead. It should be obvious but still worth reminding.\n\nThe game could be more challenging. By could I mean should. But it's pretty cheap so... might be worth checking out  if you like this kind of tycoon/company simulators game.\n\nYou buy vehicles, hire people, upgrade company, buy and upgrade garages, sign contracts and assign vehicles to work on them.\n\nAs you complete contracts, your rating with each enterprise will go up allowing "special" contracts and the enterprise will be improved.\n\nThe game is cool but not challenging at all.\n\nYou can "cheat" by placing multiple vehicles to work on the same contract. That way you can complete contracts that require a higher load or speed than a single truck could do. The load might in some cases be possible to divide irl, but no matter how many trucks drving at 54km/h you use, you would never be able to complete a contract that requires you to go at 70km/h as this game accepts. Even when you actually fail a stage because your truck was much slower than the minimum requirement, multiple trucks allow you to ensure you don't fail the remaining stages and get the money and ratings for something you didn't do.\n\nalso... get ready to spend a lot of time in this game if you want to see the "over 100 car models".","April 15, 2014","true","6.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Relax set up lines of transport, pick up contracts make cash etc.\nThere are some game breakers in this though and the developer really has not tried to fix them even though its been out for years. For example the campaign has a bad map in the middle of the series. You cant go past it, I have not been able to win it due to some horrid map planning and the way your trucks behave at load and deliver points.\nBasically on map 12 of the campaign you lose due to almost all freight you have to deal with goes to one place and the AI competitor on that map basically clogs this point up so bad that no matter what you do most of your contracts will fail and make you go bankrupt after a while. The map would do fine as a sand box map but since its a campaign map and you need this delivery point you will simply not be able to play the campaign maps past this point which is still about half the maps in the campaign.\nThe second bad thing is that after every play session you need to start the game through your steam library and not from the desktop short cut because it wont have sound. When started through the library you have the option to bring up a settings menu which you will need to bring up every time, then start it through that or you simply will not have sound. This game has been out for years but the only thing ever patched was something to do with it not launching on Vista.\n\nIn short if you like these sim type games its not a bad game, but it feels like the developer just tossed it on steam years ago and never looked back let alone fix or improve it other than that vista fix (edited twice because i cant type lol).","May 30, 2014","false","46.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

Freight Tycoon sounded and looked somewhat promising as I enjoy truck-based games too, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy this game.\n\nThe mechanics of Freight Tycoon are relatively solid and it is a very easy game to learn, it doesn't take a long time before you're all clued up on how to play, so that's a good start. Once you get into the main game however, it ultimately feels pretty shallow, like there is no sense of satisfaction from doing well at the game.\n\nPerhaps I haven't given this game enough of a trial to have experienced it properly, but I found myself getting bored relatively quickly after a couple of the default scenarios, I dislike the art style used for the user interface too, it's not very easy on the eyes but hey, it could be a lot worse (see anything published by UIE, ugh!). Tycoon games are typically grindy and require a lot of micromanagement, but Freight Tycoon feels too easy in that department, at least that's how I found it to be.\n\nSo for now, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. It has potential but it feels like it's missing something, maybe it is just a game that hasn't aged well and would have felt better around it's original release date. If you're willing to have a gamble for a new Tycoon game this may be one to look at even though it seems to be very hit and miss based on other user reviews. I wouldn't say this is one to be avoided, but I think Freight Tycoon is very much down to personal taste. I am planning to give it another run some time as I don't like games I have purchased to just sit and gather dust, if my thoughts change I will rethink this review, but for now I'm not really interested in trying it again.","November 22, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

For a game released in 2007 and it being 2014, its decent. It has its ups and its downs.\n\nPros:\n-If you like Logistics, this is a game for you!\n-A wide amount of types of merchdise to transports\n-Graphics are pretty solid for a DX9 game\n-See as the villages turns into towns and towns turns into cities.\n\nCons:\n-a metic EF TON of micromanaging, once a truck is done with a contract, you have to manually assign it to another one. Sounds simple but once you get about 15 to 20 to 30+ trucks, you become overwelmed quickly with unused trucks.\n-Very little amount of upgrading options\n-Very poor UI design, its just a mess.\n-Notifications are just bunched up in a small section near your minimap\n-Minimap is practically garbage\n-You can't simply upgrade trucks, if you wish to purchase newer trucks you have to unhook the trailers, sell the truck, buy the new truck, reattach the trailer, and then rehire the driver you apparentally fired because you sold the truck.\n-Very LIMITED amount of trucks to pick from.\n-The tutorial is just nothing but a textbox simulator, it's useless and utterly boring. I learned by trial and error.\n-Once you get to a later point in the game (Lets say about 3-5 hours in one playthrough), there is almost nothing left to do. I got bored once I practically dominated the region and upgraded all of my garages and HQ.\n\n-------------------------------\nFinal Verdict: MicroManagement Simulator 2007\n\nWhile the algorism does work, it only works for the beginning of the game. This game gets real boring really quickly after 10 hours. The idea is great, but the excution is poor. The UI is the biggest mess at this point. If the UI was improved TREMENDOUSLY then I would say, give it a shot. But I simply can't. I shouldn't need to switch screens constantly just to buy a new truck from 1980 to replace my old one from 1950, when the game first started.","October 8, 2014","false","28.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It works up to a point, where all contracts go south because of delays in deliveries. A truck running 109 mph with double capacity ends up breaking it's 60 mph contract because of too much cars on the road slowing the fast truck down.","June 7, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is simple. You can play for hours (or maybe a whole day), because it is not monotonous. Your trucks could be broken, your employees retire, new companies come, and you have to react all these problems. You have to make a strong base for your company (just like in real life), with various type of trucks to make sure you can do your job the best way. For me this game is 10/10.","June 18, 2015","true","170.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have some annoyances to deal with. Like the fact that on the first time you start a game you need to resize all of your in-game stat windows or that for some reason my sound dosn't work atall but besides that. For a game that I bought on a summer sale for such a little ammount that I forgot about it until 3 months later. It is really great. I would consider this game a great value at 5.00 and acceptable for 10.00 if you paid more then that you will be upset.","August 24, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
