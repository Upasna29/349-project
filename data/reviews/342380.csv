"http://steamcommunity.com/id/achawcx/recommended/342380/","achawcx","Psychii™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/achawcx/","99 products in account","Who writes serious reviews?...Seriously.\nFirst of all let's get this out of the way. There is no nudity and there is no sex. Everyone is just trying to be funny because...steam reviews...\n\n\nStory:High school student, Kenta, keeps thinking about monsters. He has constant dreams about them that haunt him. When a monster does appear in front of him on his way to school, he thinks it's the end for him. Suddenly, two guardian angels, Sayaka (Yellow-Brown Hair) and Hikari (Red Hair) appear before him and eliminate the monster. Later on, The two angels transfer to Kenta's school. Their job is to protect Kenta from the monsters. That is the basic setup for the novel.\n\nVisuals:Compared to Sakura Spirit, this Visual Novel has a similar art style and has some improvements. The lighting on the backgrounds will change a bit so that the picture isn't just "still" and the backgrounds are more vibrant. The fight scenes are more interesting to watch. There are some CGs which actually show the girls fighting instead of just reading how the fight goes. Something that bothers me is that I wish the artist could draw some people in the background. For example, in school, Kenta states that everyone in the class was looking at the angels, but not a single person is in a desk.\n\nChoices:You are given choices but most of them just lead to different dialogues that don't effect the story too much. Sometimes, you can choose what you want to know and eventually you will get to pick all the choices.\n\nSound:Because I can't find the soundtrack anywhere online, I've just resorted to leaving the game's Menu theme on. Someone was nice enough to upload the soundtrack on Youtube, just got to search it. The main menu them just sounds relaxing. Other than that, the soundtrack fits the tone of the Novel, but I wouldn't really say it is anything interesting. This Visual Novel has no voice acting, only text. It's kind of a shame, and I hope that maybe in a future VN, they can add voice acting. . As of 9/8/2015, I guess my prayers have been answered. There is now voice acting (only when certain characters talk). Sayaka is voiced by Ayano Yamamoto, Hikari is voiced by Asami Sanada, and Yuzuki is voiced by Misako Sekiguchi.\n\nShould you buy it?If you liked Sakura Spirit, including the fanservice, you may like this one more. It has a present high school setting and still has some magic to it. Don't expect this to be a serious novel by any chance.\n\n- Psychii","June 20, 2015","true","11.3"," 405 of 434 people (93%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","93","405","434","34","27"

However let me be honest here, I saw it coming when I realized the similiar names and art styles. However the R17 CG and artwork here are good and I bought the game because of it.\n\nThe game takes place as you causally going through your day as Kenta and the "usual" anime route, encounter appears. You are then saved by two girls who happen to be magical. You eventually found out they are your new classmates. They protect you after getting involved. You have a few options in this game and you will always have an ending. The game in itself makes you have the option of an end between the two girls, Hikari and Sayaka. Now there is also an ending where you can get both and that route well is balanced.\n\nA few thoughts\nUsually in some VNs there are characters there that you know you can't date and I found that with Yuzuhi. It's like you have that antagonist you like but couldn't have. That was another defining interest. It's like wanting to know the face behind Tali from ME. Or having that one antagonist you wish for that one bed scene you wish. Yes we've been there and if it appeals and attracts, people will buy it.\n\nNonetheless the game filled the time and made me like it. Enjoyable. The story seems short like before and needed a bit more. A route with Yuzuhi would be nice! Same with what they could have done with Sakura Spirit with Tsuyuri.\nNonetheless the game cg firs a 5/5.\nThe story 3.7/5.\nOption choice and dialogue, some amusement, some we saw coming. 3.6-4.0/5.\nGive it a shot if you like. I can give a recommend for the art and that's another thing that sold me. However I think there needs to be more to VNs than just that.\nIf I start being more detailed and do this out of 10 well I'm thinking 6-7/10 might be it.\n\nBasically if you want to get the game go ahead. Enjoy it. However if price not for you, you could wait. There's no rush. There wasn't any continuations like other games too for instance that came about. For instance, indie developers who make games don't include a dlc or include expansion after release which is sad because I do believe some games need it. Otherwise it's just a quick one that people can see then pass up on.","January 16, 2015","true","1.4"," 432 of 507 people (85%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","85","432","507","51","4"

It is another production by Winged Cloud, who have released several VNs with a similar aesthetic theme.\n\nThe storyline is not going to win any prizes for originality or scope; however, it is sufficient enough to drive the novel from start to finish. There aren't really any emotional investments made into the story, nor are there any distinct moral or philosophical undertones apparent; however, that does not detract from the experience, because the game does not necessarily try to construct a pretentious plot or theme. Instead, it is focused on providing a cute, entertaining experience for the reader, and in that regard it succeeds. There are some choices made in the game, but as far as I can tell they don't really have too much of an impact on the final story. The characters are not deep, but that doesn't detract from the story; I still found the characters to be entertaining and loveable.\n\nThe artwork is quite nice. The protagonist's guardian angels are both cute and well dressed, being presented in several different outfits over the course of the novel. The background images themselves are also pleasing. The artwork of the monsters, however, leaves a little to be desired, although the antagonist is sufficiently well presented in her own right. One aspect of the story I wish was more presented is combat; there is no real effort made on screen to make the characters appear to be engaged. The erotic artwork also borders on the rediculous; then again, there is probably a significant clientele that is looking for such an exposure in this game, so I don't hold it against the novel. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the quality of the artwork and find it to be beautiful and enjoyable to see.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the music as well. While you may not experience such music as John Williams or Hanz Zimmer, the novel has an engaging and pleasing soundtrack that fits well with the game. The only complaint in this regard is that some of the music during combat scenes was not used to its full potential.\n\nThe novel's length is short -- about two hours or so. I am, however, a very quick reader, so your own experience may be closer to three hours or more.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this visual novel as long as you know what to expect from it. While it may not be a masterpiece of the visual novel genre, you will be entertained for several hours. I guess if you are into the erotic aspect of it, that is an added bonus too; however, my recommendation doesn't require that you desire that part of the novel in order to enjoy it. I didn't buy it for its near-nudity, and still enjoyed it; nonetheless, with its price point at $10, I would advise waiting until it goes on sale before making the purchase.","January 29","true","2.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","34","38","5","0"

Sakura Spirit wasn't exactly a quality title, although the artwork was pretty. However, after reading through Angels, I have no regrets on purchasing it. Although, the writing isn't exactly top notch; it is far from terrible. I found myself smirking quite a bit all the way through. It doesn't try to pretend to be anything other than a cutesy story based around magical fights, making breakfast & awkward romance. The artwork is top notch as well! I found myself appreciating how well done it was moreso than gawking at all the anime jubblies in said artwork. This is seriously some 5 star art! The novel also isn't COMPLETELY kinetic like Sakura Spirit. There are a lot of choices to be made but it doesn't change much outside of some dialogue for a few sentences. It stays on a set path (for the most part).\n\nBasically, if you're buying this in hopes of getting an experience close to Planetarian or Cho Dengeki Stryker, you will be disappointed. This is just a 2 hour (maybe 3 if you read slow) cutesy little novel full of fan service.

No, I did not skip 90% of the dialouge and only stared at the CG images like most of the people that bought this game, I read through it and I still don't know what's going on. Sakura Spirit at least had something you could follow, you were warped to some sort of past dimension with fox spirit girls with large breasts, in Go! Go! Nippon! you were Weeaboo McBasement going to visit two internet friends with large breasts (well one of them at least) in Japan.\nIn Sakura Angels you play as Socially Awkward Protagonist™, who is on his way to school but suddenly you get attacked by Satan! But luckily two big breasted girls in skimpy outfits come save you. Or you run away (yes, this game has multiple choices!) but run into the two anyway. These two turn out to be some sort of guardian angels (hence the same I guess) that protect the world from evil, which turns to be lurking at Socially Awkward Protagonist's™. Now here's the thing with the two girls: at day they're generic waifu material schoolgirls and at night they become some sort of rescue rangers or Sailor Moons and fight Satan and/or tentacle monsters or that mean white-haired girl from school.\nIf there is one thing I can appreciate in terms of characters, it's the fact that this time our protagonist isn't so full of respect that he doesn't even dare to admire his guardian angels looks like our good old friend Default McProtagonist from Sakura Spirit. In some occasions he even dares to stare at pink-haired girl's butt, which is already a great step-up from Sakura Spirit.\nANYWAY, remember those multiple choices I mentioned before? Turns out that the choices that are related to the two girls actually affect the ending... kinda. You can either chose to always root for blonde boobs or pink-haired boobs OR if you need two waifu in your laifu, you can pick both by just altering between the two, yes this is some heavy stuff. The other choices don't affect the story at all, you just read some different dialouges. At first it may seem to bring a bit more variety, but as it turns out it's really nothing life-changing. This game suffers from the same problem as the other two games, the storyline is not interesting enough so they just market the game with the barely dressed, big-chested ladies, which works for most people, and I could forgive the whole "90% boobs, 10% story" thing, if they really tried with the art. The thing with these visual novel games is that the art for every character is just one image that changes it's face every now and then with the occasional CG image that's only there for you screencap, might as welll just sell those images for 5 bucks because that's the only reason people buy this.\nHowever, if there's one thing I can mark off as good is the fact that they at least tried with the multiple choice thing, but out of this, Sakura Spirit and GGN, GGN still takes the cake with actually giving you a different line of plot depending on what your choices are. This game tries, but that is still underwhelmed by the sexualization of every female in it.\n\nI can't even think of good jokes at this point/10.","June 18, 2015","false","1.5"," 110 of 173 people (64%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","64","110","173","40","0"

That being said, it doesn't necessarily gets a "good" score from me, but rather a somewhat mediocre "good enough".\n\nIt has very nice drawings, an entertaining character study, but there are (again) no H-scenes and your choices hardly alter the story in an interesting way. The plot is very thin, and I wouldn't mind it that much actually if the writers had invested more time in writing independend routes for each of the 3 heroines, instead of 3 very short and generic ones for Hikari, Sayaka and a neutral one. Which leads me to another waste that is Yuzuki, which packs alongside her devilish hotness hints of an actual intriguing and deeply psychological backstory. Which isn't elaborates upon much, of course.\n\nIf Sakura Spirits desperately needed a patch to make any sense of anything it was trying to do, Sakura Angels only needed some fine tuning to actually be a quite decent casual western VN. Most definitely not a great one, mind you, for that there was not enough time and thought invested. Otherwise it could have gone far.\n\nAgain: The game has 3 endings in which you either become sort-of-but-not-really-a-couple with Hikari or Sayaka, or neither of them (this third option should have been Yuzuki OR a harem ending, but what do I know, right?). I say sort-of-but-not-really-a-couple because what we are really presented with is kiddies stuff: the furthest you'll see them getting intimate is a hug. Now, I don't think explicit sex is necessary to convey love through a VN, but at the very least the writer could have gone with a kiss to give us a romantic visual cue or sign of affection that, you know, shows us that someone likes the other person seriously. I would have been okay even with a kiss on the cheek, but no, this was probably considered XXX hardcore pornography. That was, in my humble opinion, just plain immaturity on Winged Cloud's part.\n\nThe potentiality of Sakura Angels was heavily lost on the decision to almost fully ignore Yuzuki as a 3 dimensional character. It would have been interesting if the creators actually gave quality some thought, to see a Yuzuki route that actually expanded on the little info we had on her, making her's the only that is told in the aftermath, when Hikari and Sayaka have to go, and how the main protagonist Kenta would deal with it. But the writer didn't even care to establish if Yuzuki is human or not, nor for what entity the other girls are actually working for.\n\nThe climax of this VN is about how Kenta has difficulties concentrating enough but ends up saving the world anyway. The climax. Is. Literally. About. HOW. The protag. Can't concentrate. Or rather, forgot a detail of what he had to do to SAVE THE F***ING WORLD. You could have done SO MUCH to make it epic, but nope, that would have required creativity and investment. I could make a better climax on the spot, like, let's say, maybe a fight inside Kenta's head against "the evil", or a message from his badass ancestor on how to reseal the enemy. It was just way to lame for such a great task as saving the world should be.\n\nAnd let's talk about that: saving the world. Really? The bloathed ego of the writer couldn't content with, I dunno, the city or the region in which the VN plays? I think even going as far as saying that the main cast was fighting a national threat would be making things way too dramatic for the proportions of this VN. If THE WHOLE WORLD really depended on Kenta and the evil sealed within his blood, don't you think THEY, whoever they are, would send their best and most capable magical girls, instead of Hikari and Sayaka? Who demonstrated several times that they weren't working together for too long.\n\nWhich brings me to another point.\n\nThe VN likes to play with the unsaid, that is, Hikari and Sayaka never reveal too much from where they are, who send them and their backstory. Everything supposedly top secret and to protect Kenta. See, such a technique isn't necessarily bad, but you need to know how to use it, otherwise you end up in a literary catastrophe like here. A good video game example would be Guilty Gear Xrd's story mode and how a lot of technical nonsense terms are thrown around,- but eventually explained or presented in such a way it doesn't become a bother to the watcher. We had no idea who "the Conclave" was in the beginning, but from the way everybody talked about them and how they were presented TOLD us, the watchers, that they were up to no good. Who really cares about the "Schwarzschild Radial Limit", as long as it rocks in that one scene, giving the protag a chance to kick butts in a cool and flashy way? See, if you manage to suspend your audience's disbelief, you are doing it right! If you just omitt something that is ESSENTIAL to develop your characters deeper than the surface, you are writing yourself into a dead end.\n\nSakura Angels didn't need, but freely choose and is proud of being shallow. They had everything in their hands to make a  great casual western VN, even the experience of what not to do to make at the very least a decent one, and they wasted all their potential. For what I don't know. So many plot holes, so little character development (although the little bit they have ARE admittedly fun to read), so few routes to choose from, such a big letdown.\n\nScrew this game. It is WAY better than its predecessor, but I guess it's only good to fap to the pictures. And those you can get online for free.","May 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","32","45","2","0"

The story, I just can say is good, it is not. We play as the descendant of a old witch hunter who managed to trap a way too powerful witch for eternity. Of course we have no idea who we really are and that that whole eternity business is nothing but just a thousand, or so, years. And here is where the story actually matters, at least in the background, since we are blood related to the hunter it could only means that our blood is needed for the witch to be released, and you can imagine the rest.\n\nStoryRepetitive, predictable and boring. A normal guy, two saviors, an formidable enemy who doesn't show up, her minion who wants to kill us, and that's it. And since this is another Sakura game it is full of weird encounters, "plot" all over the place, and stupid situations. 5/10\n\nCharacter art StyleNice and clean, Japanese anime style, I have no complains here. 9/10 (yeah, plot all the time)\n\nMusicI do not remember it. 3/10\n\nBackgrounds art styleMy favorite thing in this game. 10/10\n\nPros.\n- Art style\n\nCons.\n- Story\n- Music\n- Too much "plot" for my liking.\n\nNow, to recommend or not to recommend, that is the question.

I think that's important to keep in mind when looking at reviews on a gaming platform to realize that a visual novel is not a game. I'd also like to note that this review may contain minor spoilers on some of the general trends of the game, but I will do my best to avoid specifics for prospective buyers. I also turned off the music and sound effects, so I can't comment on those aspects either. With all of that in mind, please enjoy the rest of the review.\n\nThis is a visual novel, which means that explaining the story too much is going to outright spoil it. The basic plot is that you essentially are taking the perspective and role of the main character, Kenta, which I believe is still in high school but don't quote me on that detail as it could be later education. Anyways, he has been having intense headaches and sleeping horribly without understanding why. That is, until one day on the streets coming home from school when his intense headache is swiftly followed by an attack by a supernatural creature! Just when things are looking most grim, he is saved by a couple more supernatural beings. He finds himself in the hands of two guardian girls with magical powers that are tasked with protecting him from these evil creatures. Who are the creatures? Who are these two mysterious girls? What could all of this mean? Well, you'll have to find out for yourself.\n\nI think it's important to explain why I DO recommend this title. The story is alright. I didn't find it to be anything spectacular, but it functions just fine. The various options and multiple pages open for saves are very convenient for managing your experience to your liking. Plus, there's even a skip function. This is helpful for replaying the game so that you can quickly skip over parts you've already experienced in order to get to the new parts faster. This is because you can actually make a few choices in the game that will effect the following events and ending. So using the skip function to test out different paths in the game is highly useful. There are some reused images for the characters and backgrounds, but every so often you'll be rewarded with a custom drawn image. This is where most of my enjoyment of the game comes from. I think the two main girls are very pretty. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the people looking at this game are looking at it for the promise of hot anime girls. I can say that it delivers. There are three attractive cartoon women to look at, with a few expressions, outfits, and custom pictures. All of the custom pictures can be found later in the gallery so you won't need to play through again just to see them. So, as the general fapping tool that it tries to market itself as, it works just fine. And hey, I even found myself getting somewhat invested in a couple of the characters.\n\nHowever, let's address the shortcomings here. Again, the large selling point of sex appeal can't exactly be ignored. While it does work for some one-handed fun, I do think it could be a little lacking for most. There are mainly two girls you see the whole time. You see some of the third, but not nearly as much. Each one has a standard pose they're always in, with sometimes altering their poses slightly, changing their facial expressions, and a few costume changes. And, of course, they have their few custom pictures. This isn't bad, but I think there could've been some more variety, especially with the limited number of girls to gawk at. Plus, there's always the possiblity that you won't find any combination of the three attractive. Even finding just one unattractive takes a huge hit to that main selling point. I guess it's probably pretty shallow and harsh to judge such a thing, but I think it's very fair considering a large portion of the audience will be here for the obviously intended sex appeal. I do have to give it a little credit, though. Unlike Sakura Spirit, the characters feel a little more realistic in their actions and reactions rather then it being about tons of inuendos constantly being stamped out by an unbelievably decent protagonist. This time around you can at least feel that the girls are more restrained and the protagonist more human. It makes the title feel a lot more natural and compelling. I guess that's the trade-off, which may be a turn off to some.\n\nI also took some issue with the in-game choices. I think the feature is nice and has some interesting results, but it feels out of place. You aren't really the main character here. The main character is Kenta, and he seems to have his own personality. You're just in his perspective. So when you make choices for him, it feels almost out of character. So either the story should've been more static and true to his character, or more open with choices and allowed you to be the main character instead.\n\nThis next part gets a bit spoilery but stay with me if you're not too afraid, otherwise skip to the next section.\nI also found that the three routes you can go weren't all satisfying. I think the best route is the neutral route where you don't have a preference for either of the main girls. The ending feels a lot more like the start of the game, wrapping it all up in a nice, familiar bow. I enjoyed the Hikari ending the most because I got the most attached to her. I fel like she was hard to get close to, but that she appreciates that relationship the most and it just felt so natural to want her. And the events that play out as a result all feel very natural. When I played it over again favoring Sayaka I felt bad. She seems so light and happy, but she has trouble listening to me half the time and it made Hikari seem a lot more lonely, jealous, and mean. It seems like Sayaka could make herself happy with or without me so it didn't feel like my feelings were mutual. Plus, she teasingly torments Hikari a lot, which seemed playful in the Hikari route but just plain mean in the Sayaka route. I also thought that having a Yuzuki route would've been nice. She seemed to have such a compelling backstory that I could've found myself feeling for her, but the game didn't offer that as an option. Her destiny is set in stone regardless of what you do, which is a real shame.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of all is just that this game ends with a lot of new questions and old questions unanswered. We still barely know much of anything about these magical beings. We don't know what will happen to the characters next. We barey started learning about Yuzuki. Whatever relationship you pick seems to lead to very little in the end aside from future possibilities. The main plot is resolved, but the end isn't necessarily satisfying. And I really was hoping for a kiss from Hikari... sigh. I guess we'll just have to cry for a sequel and hope it happens.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Sure, it's by no means a game. It's a bit lacking in a few areas. It's not amazing. I recommend it because... well... not only did I have a fun time with it, and I know you know what I mean, but I also found myself caring about Hikari, a fictional character. Maybe that says more about me than it does this title, but it's something worth experiencing for yourself, regardless of who you get attached to. It's probably not worth the full ten bucks for most people, but get it on sale. Especially if you like the Sakura series in general. Besides, sometimes it's fun to give your fapping a little context.","March 9","true","10.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","4"

And you always end up with one girl or the other, there's no third option.\nAlso to be noted: This game has only BGM (background music), no voice actors (not even a single line).\n\nFor (translated) japanese visual novel readers:\nNo good. The chances are this will be among the worst, maybe the worst visual novel you have ever read. No thrill, nothing interesting, story from the typical shounen mange, that's it. Slightly fun, not an absolute waste of time.\n\nVisual Novel beginners:\nRather mediocre, but still chances for a lot of fun.\n\nIN THE END:\nThis game simply cannot compare to a good japanese visual novel - it's nowhere close.\nFor those interested: There are hundreds, maybe more of translated japanese visual novel masterpieces on the net to buy - or download.\n\nSpoiler regarding the romance level down below (how far can you get with the girl(s):\n\n\n\n\n\nYou alwasy end up in sort of a kiddy-style relationship with one of the two female protagonists.\nNothing above holding hands.

I really wish it was more then 2 hours worth of interesting stuff but oh well, it was alright but the only thing I would have to complain about besides the shortness of it is the cost of it, for 2 hours worth of gameplay I think at least it could be $5.","February 7, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I can't tell."\nA fantasy/slice-of-life themed Visual Novel, which is quite short for its kind\nbut is the perfect lenght for the type of VN it is.\n\nThe story's pretty simple, you've got your typical average protagonist boy Kenta, who starts having nightmares followed by morning migraine. Lucky for him, two magical girls appear before him to help him out! Story's not deep at all, and the antagonist of the story is also rather recycled, then again he/she/it didn't seem too important to the story. Heck, the story  itself isn't as  important as the main selling-point of the game. Which is...\n\n"Plot". The one that we also refer to as "jumblies","melons" or anything else that bouncily comes to mind. This game has quite a lot of those, in different angles, and while not 100 percent accurately portrayed, they do make for a great sight for sore eyes. To summarise, the artstyle of this VN is great to look at.\n\nAs for Background music.. it's decent. Decent enough not to annoy you during the playthrough. Can't promise you'll remember the tunes after a few days though.\n(Note. With the announcement of Voice Acting being implemented into the game in later time. For those who enjoy listening to voiced VNs by Japanese cast - this may become quite the cookie.)\n\n\n\nAll in all, I can recommend this VN for those who are looking to look at pretty pictures drawn in a certain Asian artstyle.\nIf you're hoping for a deep story, this is not the VN for you.\nBut if you're looking for a light (and slightly) silly read with enough fanservice to get you through it - get this VN.","June 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is embarrassingly short, with both paths lasting a combined total of just under 2 hours, and makes only limited amounts of sense even for an animated work that is approached with some suspension of disbelief.  It also only seemed mildly concerned with these things, as the game was more interested in ecchi visual displays.  Sure, there were a couple of cute/funny moments, but it didn't really make up for the overwhelming blah~ I got from the rest of the game.  If this was $2-3 I would suggest buying it as a time waster.  However, like most of the Sakura games on Steam, this one is overpriced in order to let the studio cash in on the "anime graphics" fanbase's tolerance for overpriced products.","June 5","false","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really these games are honestly about friends somehow I'm not even joking. The game has more charm and more frequent genuinely funny scenes (cliched as they may be) than the first title (not that great of a feat to be fair) while taking up the same amount of time. It also takes only about a quarter of the time to actually get to your waifus in this than the previous title. Just putting that out there for those interested.\n\nAfter playing the first it is evident the developer is getting more confident at writing the characters in the standard harem fashion that any otaku will notice and either hate/enjoy, and he's also getting more confidant with choices and branching paths.

What you will find is some decent art, again improved from the first, with a cutesy little story and silly characters in a fast food VN. Quick, cheap, interesting at the time, but fairly forgettable in the long run. Better than the first but overall a sub-average VN. That doesn't mean it's bad in fact it's great to eat up the absurdity of harem stories every once in a while, but after all is said and done they are always incredibly shallow. It's great to see the developer learning and advancing as he releases more VN's, so hopefully this trend continues and a VN worth talking about for more than just the woman's cleavage and "fappability" is released.\n\nPros:\n"plot"\nFunny cliched circumstances\nbranching waifus\n\nCons:\nNo more kitsunes :(\n\nThis can only be recommend to those who find this genre hilarious for all the ridiculous writing and cliches.

Just look at their faces, not a single corner guys, this is the example of perfect aliasing, GTA, Far Cry 4, they all can bow down to this amazing monument created to display the best graphics possible in a computer game at the moment. And that's not all: Even my crappy pc can run it smoothly without dropping any frames. This game is a technological masterpiece, Star Citizen is dead before it went out of Alpha.  Graphics: 10/10\n\nSound: Oh my gosh don't even get me started on the sound this soundtrack is one of the most catchy themes i have ever heard. Forget the Portal soundtrack because Sakura Angels is all you need.  Also a huge plus compared to benchmarks in the sound category like Portal is that it has more than one track and all of them are equally amazing i just have to give it a full 10 points. Sound: 10/10\n\nControls: God damn guys the controls in this game are awesome. You can use the mouse, you can use the spacebar and you can even let it play all alone, this game has it all, forget your 400apm in sc2 using a steering wheel with force feedback. This game will make you enjoy yourself even more and it doesnt even require 1 apm if you play it on automode. This game is easy to learn but hard to master since one of your hands is always occupied anyway, but with the built in support for Beginners and advanced Zweihander strategies this game is your first step at becoming a professional. Controls: 10/10\n\nMultiplayer: Forget the war between Battlefield and Call of Duty! The real multiplayer game is here to stay! Playable with an unlimited amount of friends at home or through skype everyone can play together. Just wipe out your Joysticks and start playin. Auto-mode makes sure you dont have to fight about whoever gets to click and lets be honest, we are far too concentrated on our joysticks anyway. Multiplayer 10/10\n\nAs you can see there is literally no point speaking against this game. Sakura Angels is the best game of all time, it's the game Duke Nukem Forever promised us to be. Overall rating 40/40 ladies and gentlemen thanks for your attention, this will be the last message going out from my side, because Sakura Angels completed my life and theres nothing left for me to wish for.","January 16, 2015","true","16.7"," 84 of 166 people (51%) found this review helpful 174 people found this review funny","51","84","166","174","3"

This game also understands the interactive part of an interactive story because you can make decisions. The villian I felt a connection to because I have been in her shoes. The charecters feel like actual people and not just eye candy.  I would recomend this game but I would also recomend playing it away from other people because there are some weird parts.","January 18, 2015","true","7.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GangstasParadise/recommended/342380/","GangstasParadise","FoxyTrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GangstasParadise/","39 products in account","Sakura Angels is the first VN of the Sakura series that I have experienced. Before going on to a more detailed review, I'll give you the TL:DR version: !!!BUY IT!!! Hikari is best girl btw\n\n\nStory:\nThe story, in my opinion, was not as unoriginal as many would have you believe. While it has many tropes that are shared by these fantasy related titles, it does have a fresh spin on things. And by that I of course mean our wonderful guardian angels. Sayaka and Hikari, along with our immediate antagonist, Yuzuki, are what bring this story full circle and give it life. Our story begins with our protagonist, Kenta, having vivid nightmares that get progressively worse and drain his energy. As our story progresses we're introduced to our guardian angels under strange circumstances and they're thrust into being part of Kenta's life in a way uncommon of any guardian angel. The girls know more than they let on about Kenta's nightmares and headaches, but they keep us out of the loop until we near the climax, which makes it a very strange but not unforseen revelation on why Kenta is tormented as he is. I'll get into the characters later ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but to finish on the story, it's not the most original but it has new life that makes it forgivable for it's cliche moments.\n\nCharacters:\nThe Characters you're introduced to are the strength of Sakura Angels, since our protagonist is a pretty one dimensional character with very little growth. Let's start with best girl Hikari! From the moment we meet here, she's completely against getting to know us, yet shows signs of interest in our wellbeing. Hikari and Sayaka are polar opposites and are shown time and time again to be very competitive, with Hikari sometimes being drawn out to act as she truly is instead of in her typical reserved self. She retains a lot of her seriousness near the end but is much more open and accepting of our protagonist as the story ends. Now on to Sayaka, she's the life of the trio, with a mouth much faster than her mind. While she typically comes off as outspoken and optmisitic, it's clear at times that she does this in order to remove stress from the situation at hand, both she and Hikari are very observative and can change their demeanor to meet the task at hand quickly. We find out that they're pretty fresh as a team, given their lack of teamwork during their first encounter with Yuzuki. That is another part of them that grows as the story progresses and we see them truly come into unison as we near the end.\n\nVisuals and gameplay:\nThe visuals of this VN are pretty good, the artstyle is easy on the eyes and very appealing. We are the viewer are given multiple heapings of fan service and the voice acting makes it a whole lot better. As far as gameplay goes it's pretty much nonexistant, all we do is click and listen. While I didn't have any problems with this I would've liked to see some more options for us to choose in this story, and the ones we do have aren't as minor as you may think, your decisions impact who you think is best girl. And if it's not Hikari, you're wrong.","January 27","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This game (sadly) does NOT have a hentai patch, so sorry about that. It is the second in its franchise and is the only one with voices (for now). It has steam cards, no achivments and much material to make you night... special? Loved it, if you can't buy the game, watch it. This has no news for a sequal but since they went as far to put voices in it they may think it's special enough for one, I mean it's not to far streached, another one of there games is getting a sequal. Anyway loved the game, stongly recommended it, and the most important of, enjoy it for it's story as well and not just the "Plot", but you know love the "Plot" too XD.\n\nBoobs\n~DarkPlasma","February 28","true","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The dialog is like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shonen manga that runs like 10-20 chapters. and the main character describtion is somewhat like it's  fake , like you will never describe it on such way in the real world. the BGM is kinda good and the CV sucks real time.. the art is acceptable and its not even fappable....\n\nRecommendation even KonoSora worth more than this game, i suggested not to buy this game because somewhat disappointing. i read many good visual novel but this one not worth of my time so let it dusted in my library for a while.. but, if you want this game so much... i bought it like 270 yen... so its one time bento on convinient store...","April 19","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sakura Angels isn't breaking records. It's fun to imagine what is actually happening animation style in your head. The cute Japanese voices definitely help give you a good image on how the characters would walk, move, interact and the like. The CG is beautiful. And the writing gets you giggling. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and why should it? I'm not going to give any spoilers, but these girls definitely aren't culinary masters.\n\nAnd now for me to complain a bit - Why is the CG so disconnected from the writing? It's a visual novel, if you're going to put the protagonist in particular situations, why not draw it? Yes, our imaginations are the ones that need to work here. But black screens would have been enough if you wanted that. There are so many points in the story where I really wanted to see what was happening. It's a visual novel, so let me see what I'm reading! Not to mention how many unanswered questions I have...\n\nThat aside, I'm glad I picked this up at the five dollar price. I can say that the tease is only worth that much. But pick it up if you can, because it's a mighty good tease, and there's going to be more, so support the artists and creators so that they can support us, and give us more of what we need. A deeper story with more characters (wouldn't mind seeing some male characters for diversity. There needs to be something there to make the story more intersting!) More CG to depict the various parts of the story (Be a visual novel more) and perhaps be clear with your aim for the choices. If they could branch more and allow the story to take different directions, that'd make the story fun to play multiple times. Or just make your story longer, and leave the choices as spice to make scenes slightly different. Either way it was a joy to read, and I definitely want more.\n\nTL;DR version: Get it while it's cheap. It's worth the laugh, the awe and the distraction. Just not the full ten dollars.","September 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was instantly drawn into the main protagonists life as we start off by going to school but on the way we are intrupted by a monster which leads us to being saved by two girls who are blessed with magical powers, they defeat the monster and reveal themselves to be you're guardian angels. From that moment on his life changes rapidly as he's draged into dangerous battles agaist dog like beings, dark angels and big slimy tentacle monsters (yes i know what you're thinking). His only defence are his recently dicovered guardian angels who may seem more trouble then there worth. While one is very optimistic and cheerful the other one is grumpy and shy around new people but they are a great team who puts in there all to keep you alive even tho throughout the game they are always teasing and embarrassing one another they always tend to work hard as a team nicely to ensure you the protagonist survives as you are more importent then you realise.\n\n(Overall Likes)\nThe game is great and was fun to read and interact with the characters of the story as you build a bond with them through the conversations you go through in the game. The humor is great as it made me chuckle quite a bit and the characters also feel alive with how there personalities are portrayed.\n\n(Overall Dislikes)\nOnly two dislikes as i thought the game could have more interactive options to chose which would make me feel like i have more choice within the actions i make and i wish the game was longer as it really was a great visual novel game\n\n(Overall Score)\n10/10","November 1, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sakura Angels isn't breaking records. It's fun to imagine what is actually happening animation style in your head. The cute Japanese voices definitely help give you a good image on how the characters would walk, move, interact and the like. The CG is beautiful. And the writing gets you giggling. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and why should it? I'm not going to give any spoilers, but these girls definitely aren't culinary masters.\n\nAnd now for me to complain a bit - Why is the CG so disconnected from the writing? It's a visual novel, if you're going to put the protagonist in particular situations, why not draw it? Yes, our imaginations are the ones that need to work here. But black screens would have been enough if you wanted that. There are so many points in the story where I really wanted to see what was happening. It's a visual novel, so let me see what I'm reading! Not to mention how many unanswered questions I have...\n\nThat aside, I'm glad I picked this up at the five dollar price. I can say that the tease is only worth that much. But pick it up if you can, because it's a mighty good tease, and there's going to be more, so support the artists and creators so that they can support us, and give us more of what we need. A deeper story with more characters (wouldn't mind seeing some male characters for diversity. There needs to be something there to make the story more intersting!) More CG to depict the various parts of the story (Be a visual novel more) and perhaps be clear with your aim for the choices. If they could branch more and allow the story to take different directions, that'd make the story fun to play multiple times. Or just make your story longer, and leave the choices as spice to make scenes slightly different. Either way it was a joy to read, and I definitely want more.\n\nTL;DR version: Get it while it's cheap. It's worth the laugh, the awe and the distraction. Just not the full ten dollars.","September 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After the absolute bunk that Sakura Swim Club was, my initial plan was (unless it's, specifically, a Sakura Fantasy title) to never touch another Winged Cloud product again...but, it turns out that I had bought this thing on a sale at some point.\n\nSo, I'll address the pros first, as few as they are. To be perfectly fair, it's an improvement. Maybe, it's the fact that they couldn't try to excuse abysmal writing and terrible production value with nudity, but... Whatever the case, it's a step in the right direction. A small and shaky step made by a drunk dog onto the surface of a recently frozen lake, but a step forward, at least.\n\nNow that credit given where it's due, I still have to say that it's not enough to justify a recommendation.\nThe writing, while certainly a step up over Swim Club, does a passable job of building things up...just in time to wrap everything up in what I can only describe as a premature ejaculation. Everything having been transfered to the "being up and resolved" train, having forgotten "pacing" and "flow" at the station.\nThe music is better, though hardly anything notable.\nThe art...well...it worked the first time around, until I realized that the character models are, quite literally, being recycled through every game.\n\nIn short, Winged Cloud, keep trying with these side projects. Maybe, one day, you'll work up to having your products be on par with something like what a studio like Frontwing can produce.\n\nP.S. Where the hell is Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/342380/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","OVERVIEWSakura Angels is yet another anime-themed high-school visual novel. The game tells the story of the protagonist, Kenta, a male high-school student suffering from headaches who one day encounters something dangerous and otherworldly, and is protected by two young angelic body guards, Sayaka and Hikari.\n\nThe setting is fairly familiar, seeming like countless other animes, mangas, and visual novels, but the story is well told and the characters are likeable. A couple of gratuitous panty shots give the game a slightly guilty feel, and add the 'mature' and 'nudity' tags to the Steam page, but really it's all harmless enough, and suprisingly fun.\n\nGraphicsThe sets are nicely drawn, although I was a bit disappointed with how much they were repeated. One street scene, for example, looks the same on a fine sunny day as it does on a day on which the characters are complaining about how much it is raining.\n\nThe character graphics and occasional risque gallery shots of the three main female characters are all very nicely drawn and suitably attractive. Small animations add to the life of the characters, as do the character graphic overlays moving around the screen to follow the action as described in some scenes. Very nice!\n\nSoundThe music is relatively atmospheric and suits the story well.\n\nThe three main female characters all have nice Japanese voiceovers. Not being able to understand anything more than rudimentary spoken Japanese, I can't vouch for the accuracy, but they sounded okay to me.\n\nGameplaySakura Angels plays like any other visual novel. You read some text, click for the next paragraph, and look at the pretty pictures, occasionally making choices as the story presents them.\n\nUnfortunately there's only really a small number of decisions that affect which ending you see, and even then you can't really 'lose' (there is no bad ending), but the game includes a useful 'skip' feature that allows you to rapidly move over areas of the story that you've already seen on previous playthroughs, making it only a small effort to go back and try the different options for that one important decision.\n\nThe story is fairly typical of the genre, but the writing is excellent for the most part; I only saw a handful of typos throughout. The story itself isn't really 'mature-themed'; it's only the inclusion of some fairly mild gallery shots that makes this Steam tag appropriate.\n\nPROS AND CONS\nPros:\n+ Sayaka and Hikari are great fun\n+ very nice art, particularly the characters\n+ Japanese voices\n+ trading cards\n+ great writing quality\n\nCons:\n- a bit short; I completed it in just over two hours, then spent another hour or so going back to see the other choices and what differences they made\n- no achievements; these could have been easily included and mapped to each gallery shot, as a nice addition to the game\n- the protagonist is a bit of a putz; I wanted to give him a slap in a few places in the story\n\nCONCLUSIONSakura Angels is a good, fun anime visual novel.

It's a good game, a really nice job. But I must say that is too easy, most of the decision didn't affect the final you get, also after checking the flowchart I discovered that you just have to take few desicions in order to get the route you wanted, and those desicion were too obvious. I'm not an expert in VN but what I really enjoy in this kind of game is thinking about the desicions I make in the game and how those can affect the story. Concluding, if you want something good with nice character, nice art, great soundtrak, a really good sense of humor, easy and fast to play, I recommend Sakura Angels. But if you want to sit to read and really feel a story with deep characters and a an extensive plot, is better if you check other options.

Well now you can, and not only one, but two! Sakura Angels is a pretty short VN compared to other VN's, slightly longer than Sakura Spirit (There's no direct correlation with Sakura Spirit, its an entirely different VN). There is somewhat of an Arc for the heroines, yet there isn't much time to just marinate in the loveliness of being in a state of something able to happen that can evolve into a romance. Unless you just read the same line, over, and over.... then by all means. The one thing that is find wrong in this VN, is that the transitions take longer than they should, like a couple of seconds more.

This second game in a major increase on the story.  The first game had little to no options (I think one) as to how the story turned out.  This game, so far, seems to have some options which reveal different paths (pics) of the characters.\n\nI have to say I enjoy the writing.  Sure, it's a little cheesy and long at times, but the writers do a good job at explaining what our hero is going through.  The artwork is obviously enjoyable (As a single man) and the choices i've faced so far unlock different outcomes.\n\nIn the end, Sakura Angels is what it is.  A virtual novel, with some VERY adult themes, and an enjoyable experience.  Here's what I promise you.  Buy the game, and you will have 5-10 people join your Steam Live Stream almost instantly but never admit they are watching it!  lol.\n\nWe have the dev team's official release to produce video of this game with commentary, so I hope you enjoy it.  We at Rogue Ocean Gaming interview a lot of developers of indie games, major games, and games you might have not heard of to get the questions answered.\n\nPlease like, comment, and subscribe to see more footage!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSzjBphQfsU","February 3, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the story is straight forward, you get to make more decisions than in Sakura Spirit, which this game needed badly. Those decisions change the walkthrough just slightly, but makes the game more interesting and motivates to replay it.\n\nWell... no about the art...\n\nThe art is obviously the reason for buying this game, and sweet goddess of the sun, the developers are great at their work. The girls and their outfits are well drawn, but they are never showing everything, so this game is, as sexy as it is, SFW.\n\nBasically a interactive, sexy manga.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/recommended/342380/","aka_candy","Candy-Sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/","75 products in account","So I didn't really like the Sakura Series as a whole, but I got this game as a gift and might as well do a review on it. Let's get started I guess. Take note, where I might be saying some aspect is bad in an aspect of the game, I did not mostly take into account everything else. I was looking at each aspect individually.\n\nStory - 5/10\nThe "Plot" wasn't good. Really. There were a couple of cringy moments at the start of the novel that made me want to drop it instantly. For example, the overuse of the Protaganist thoughts during times like when they first met Yuzuki was really cringy and uneeded. The only reason I stayed was for the so called "romantic" choices with Sayaka or Hikari, and storyteller really butchered it. (I wanted a kiss scene. Why. ;~;)\n\nMost romance/(insert any genre here) has to have a kiss scene or at least something really... (kawaii? Moe?) to make up for it at the end or any kind of build up. Not to mention that the romance build up between Hikari and the MC, since I only played her route, not too keen on doing Sayaka's since I don't like her character (N-Not that I like Tsunderes okay! There wasn't any Dandere/Kuuderes...) was really bad...\n\nI mean, all you did was talk to her on the roof, even thought it wasnt much, then waltz in on her in bathroom and what, chose her over Sayaka at the beach? Theres wasnt much buildup to make her go all "caring" after you, and even throw away her so-called "Tsundere" attitude... Felt too rushed for that.\n\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nConsidering that this is an english-based indie game made by developers from all over the world, the gameplay is actually pretty good. Then again I have been playing games from some I guess the "most publicised" and (AAA?) companies like Pulotte and Sprite, my standards were kind of high...\n\nBut you need to work up the choices better in my opinion. How? Like you should have maybe, just maybe, given a chance to kiss her.. (I want kawaii~ The art works so well with this! Voice Actors aren't really that needed. Thought it will be a huge gain.)\n\nArt - 8/10\nNow, I'm pretty sure overall everyone came because of the art. I mean, it's the only thing that appealing to this game and mostly th reason why people want to see how to the story came out. The art is great. Real great. Tons of fanservice though, not exactly what I wanted. But it was to appeal to the main crowd here on Steam so I guess it's normal. Oh, and the enviroment was well animated. Why? Have you not notice the sunlight filtering down, literally, on the rooftop, and the animated sea on the beach? Now that was nice. Almost felt like NekoPara there. Hue.\n\nHowever, there was a few flaws tho. Scenes like the "Cafeteria being crowded" with a really empty cafeteria is kinda... not there. I get it that the alternative is to have some sort of imagination. But really, you should have draw people inside to really emphasize on this..\nTrue, it's pretty hard to draw, since I'm a Game Artist-in-study myself, and trying to get the poportions according to how far the perspectives are is pretty hard. Then again, maybe you devs should have taken more time to spread out your deadline for games and really work on each aspect of the game, then we might have gotten a better impression of  you guys.\n\n\nOverall Conclusion- 6/10\nWith all these fast games coming out so fast, and then patches for Voice Actors and all coming after, I really think your just looking to milk us of our money with this games. I mean, the story wasn't thought out well enough, none of the background art to be put together properly, It all points to fast deadlines and stuff.\n\nWhich makes me wonder why would you want to have fast deadlines? Why all the need for this? The only logical reason for all of this is basically to milk us of our money to have funds. But for what, I don't know. Maybe they need some base funds to have longer deadlines and good games, that might be a good thing. But why not make a kickstarter for that then? Your publisher is Sekai, you have of alot publicity there. They can help you with increasing publicity for your kickstarter. It dosen't make sense.\n\nThen again, if your just trying to make Steam-standard VNs for the others on steam to be introduced to Visual Novel scene, then I guess you kinda failed there. Flight Diary and the other actual VNs from Japan publishers that posted their games on Steam have it down pat.","June 25, 2015","false","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I'll likely pick up another Sakura title at some point.\n","September 25, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game actually offers more choices, eventhough they seen to have little to no impact on the outcome of the story. The story itself is alright, and I did like the two girls' personalities. The fanservice is, as in the Sakura Spirit as well, a bit ridiculous. Somehow something always ends up destroying the girls' clothes. LOL Anyway, it was an enjoyable visual novel regardless, but rather short though. They added voice acting recently, which makes it a lot better.

Eventually the dark force catches up with you. Just in time two super girls kick the snot of the evil thing and are with you from that point on. You are given the option to side with one or both of them as the story goes on and it effects who you hook up with later basically. Also magic.\n\nPositive\nIt does improve over Sakura Spirit quite a bit. The story is better and you are actually given some options that do something. The artwork is slightly better as well.\n\nNegative\nIt still suffers from reused bodies. It uses generic anime tropes way to often and the story although better still won't wow you in the slightest.\n\nConclusion\nThe game is still basically about presenting practically naked at times cute anime girls to the viewer.\n\nValue\nIf your into date sims get this one on a big sale and sell the trading cards to gain back some of the loss.","August 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is adequate, maybe C-. But that being said, too much is left up to the imagination to call it a "visual novel" when it is far more novel than visual. Not to mention how very, very long, needlessly so, the story is. It's not exciting to have 5 lines of text all about toast. And that's really 33% of the story: food. Seemed uninspired, unless the writer took all of his inspiration from The Hunger Games. The hero was also a pansy wuss who I practically wanted to shout suggestions to as I read his every weasle thought.\n\nThe best part would be the music. It doesn't grate on your ears, despite the obvious loop. It's not catchy, but it's no unpleasant either.\n\nBut the worst con, again, I have to say is the writing. Magic is well and good, but it's far too cliche for me personally.\n\nOh yeah, there are bewbs.

The story was much more interesting, the characters were more interesting, the MC was actually likeable, I actually felt myself caring for everyone in the story. This was soo much better than Spirit was, you could tell that they learned from the mistakes they had previously made. With Spirit it seemed like they were just adding filler story to get to the lewd pictures but with this one it really seemed like they focused much more on the actual story. There are quite a few more choices in this one too and they affect the story a lot more than the one choice in Spirit did. The music was also better and more varied. I was so into the story I kinda just glossed over the "nudity" bits [which again like Spirit aren't actually nude bits]. I really enjoyed this and will probably play through it again to see how the other choices affect the story.\n\nAnd yes, I understand I'm probably one of the very few people who actually took this game seriously. lol\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSakura Spirit Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonvytube/recommended/313740/","June 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/recommended/342380/","aka_candy","Candy-Sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/","75 products in account","So I didn't really like the Sakura Series as a whole, but I got this game as a gift and might as well do a review on it. Let's get started I guess. Take note, where I might be saying some aspect is bad in an aspect of the game, I did not mostly take into account everything else. I was looking at each aspect individually.\n\nStory - 5/10\nThe "Plot" wasn't good. Really. There were a couple of cringy moments at the start of the novel that made me want to drop it instantly. For example, the overuse of the Protaganist thoughts during times like when they first met Yuzuki was really cringy and uneeded. The only reason I stayed was for the so called "romantic" choices with Sayaka or Hikari, and storyteller really butchered it. (I wanted a kiss scene. Why. ;~;)\n\nMost romance/(insert any genre here) has to have a kiss scene or at least something really... (kawaii? Moe?) to make up for it at the end or any kind of build up. Not to mention that the romance build up between Hikari and the MC, since I only played her route, not too keen on doing Sayaka's since I don't like her character (N-Not that I like Tsunderes okay! There wasn't any Dandere/Kuuderes...) was really bad...\n\nI mean, all you did was talk to her on the roof, even thought it wasnt much, then waltz in on her in bathroom and what, chose her over Sayaka at the beach? Theres wasnt much buildup to make her go all "caring" after you, and even throw away her so-called "Tsundere" attitude... Felt too rushed for that.\n\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nConsidering that this is an english-based indie game made by developers from all over the world, the gameplay is actually pretty good. Then again I have been playing games from some I guess the "most publicised" and (AAA?) companies like Pulotte and Sprite, my standards were kind of high...\n\nBut you need to work up the choices better in my opinion. How? Like you should have maybe, just maybe, given a chance to kiss her.. (I want kawaii~ The art works so well with this! Voice Actors aren't really that needed. Thought it will be a huge gain.)\n\nArt - 8/10\nNow, I'm pretty sure overall everyone came because of the art. I mean, it's the only thing that appealing to this game and mostly th reason why people want to see how to the story came out. The art is great. Real great. Tons of fanservice though, not exactly what I wanted. But it was to appeal to the main crowd here on Steam so I guess it's normal. Oh, and the enviroment was well animated. Why? Have you not notice the sunlight filtering down, literally, on the rooftop, and the animated sea on the beach? Now that was nice. Almost felt like NekoPara there. Hue.\n\nHowever, there was a few flaws tho. Scenes like the "Cafeteria being crowded" with a really empty cafeteria is kinda... not there. I get it that the alternative is to have some sort of imagination. But really, you should have draw people inside to really emphasize on this..\nTrue, it's pretty hard to draw, since I'm a Game Artist-in-study myself, and trying to get the poportions according to how far the perspectives are is pretty hard. Then again, maybe you devs should have taken more time to spread out your deadline for games and really work on each aspect of the game, then we might have gotten a better impression of  you guys.\n\n\nOverall Conclusion- 6/10\nWith all these fast games coming out so fast, and then patches for Voice Actors and all coming after, I really think your just looking to milk us of our money with this games. I mean, the story wasn't thought out well enough, none of the background art to be put together properly, It all points to fast deadlines and stuff.\n\nWhich makes me wonder why would you want to have fast deadlines? Why all the need for this? The only logical reason for all of this is basically to milk us of our money to have funds. But for what, I don't know. Maybe they need some base funds to have longer deadlines and good games, that might be a good thing. But why not make a kickstarter for that then? Your publisher is Sekai, you have of alot publicity there. They can help you with increasing publicity for your kickstarter. It dosen't make sense.\n\nThen again, if your just trying to make Steam-standard VNs for the others on steam to be introduced to Visual Novel scene, then I guess you kinda failed there. Flight Diary and the other actual VNs from Japan publishers that posted their games on Steam have it down pat.","June 25, 2015","false","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The story was much more interesting, the characters were more interesting, the MC was actually likeable, I actually felt myself caring for everyone in the story. This was soo much better than Spirit was, you could tell that they learned from the mistakes they had previously made. With Spirit it seemed like they were just adding filler story to get to the lewd pictures but with this one it really seemed like they focused much more on the actual story. There are quite a few more choices in this one too and they affect the story a lot more than the one choice in Spirit did. The music was also better and more varied. I was so into the story I kinda just glossed over the "nudity" bits [which again like Spirit aren't actually nude bits]. I really enjoyed this and will probably play through it again to see how the other choices affect the story.\n\nAnd yes, I understand I'm probably one of the very few people who actually took this game seriously. lol\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSakura Spirit Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonvytube/recommended/313740/","June 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters (while not entirely one-dimensional) feel rather lackluster and don't really have much personality to them. There were points in the story that I wanted to feel engaged or laugh at, but the story didn't really build itself up to where I wanted to care. It also incorporates some "choose your own adventure" bits, but there's only around 2-4 points where they happen and only one of them really matters. The ending to it was also very unsatisfying as the first time it happened, I thought that it would continue after I loaded the file.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/recommended/342380/","aka_candy","Candy-Sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_candy/","75 products in account","So I didn't really like the Sakura Series as a whole, but I got this game as a gift and might as well do a review on it. Let's get started I guess. Take note, where I might be saying some aspect is bad in an aspect of the game, I did not mostly take into account everything else. I was looking at each aspect individually.\n\nStory - 5/10\nThe "Plot" wasn't good. Really. There were a couple of cringy moments at the start of the novel that made me want to drop it instantly. For example, the overuse of the Protaganist thoughts during times like when they first met Yuzuki was really cringy and uneeded. The only reason I stayed was for the so called "romantic" choices with Sayaka or Hikari, and storyteller really butchered it. (I wanted a kiss scene. Why. ;~;)\n\nMost romance/(insert any genre here) has to have a kiss scene or at least something really... (kawaii? Moe?) to make up for it at the end or any kind of build up. Not to mention that the romance build up between Hikari and the MC, since I only played her route, not too keen on doing Sayaka's since I don't like her character (N-Not that I like Tsunderes okay! There wasn't any Dandere/Kuuderes...) was really bad...\n\nI mean, all you did was talk to her on the roof, even thought it wasnt much, then waltz in on her in bathroom and what, chose her over Sayaka at the beach? Theres wasnt much buildup to make her go all "caring" after you, and even throw away her so-called "Tsundere" attitude... Felt too rushed for that.\n\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nConsidering that this is an english-based indie game made by developers from all over the world, the gameplay is actually pretty good. Then again I have been playing games from some I guess the "most publicised" and (AAA?) companies like Pulotte and Sprite, my standards were kind of high...\n\nBut you need to work up the choices better in my opinion. How? Like you should have maybe, just maybe, given a chance to kiss her.. (I want kawaii~ The art works so well with this! Voice Actors aren't really that needed. Thought it will be a huge gain.)\n\nArt - 8/10\nNow, I'm pretty sure overall everyone came because of the art. I mean, it's the only thing that appealing to this game and mostly th reason why people want to see how to the story came out. The art is great. Real great. Tons of fanservice though, not exactly what I wanted. But it was to appeal to the main crowd here on Steam so I guess it's normal. Oh, and the enviroment was well animated. Why? Have you not notice the sunlight filtering down, literally, on the rooftop, and the animated sea on the beach? Now that was nice. Almost felt like NekoPara there. Hue.\n\nHowever, there was a few flaws tho. Scenes like the "Cafeteria being crowded" with a really empty cafeteria is kinda... not there. I get it that the alternative is to have some sort of imagination. But really, you should have draw people inside to really emphasize on this..\nTrue, it's pretty hard to draw, since I'm a Game Artist-in-study myself, and trying to get the poportions according to how far the perspectives are is pretty hard. Then again, maybe you devs should have taken more time to spread out your deadline for games and really work on each aspect of the game, then we might have gotten a better impression of  you guys.\n\n\nOverall Conclusion- 6/10\nWith all these fast games coming out so fast, and then patches for Voice Actors and all coming after, I really think your just looking to milk us of our money with this games. I mean, the story wasn't thought out well enough, none of the background art to be put together properly, It all points to fast deadlines and stuff.\n\nWhich makes me wonder why would you want to have fast deadlines? Why all the need for this? The only logical reason for all of this is basically to milk us of our money to have funds. But for what, I don't know. Maybe they need some base funds to have longer deadlines and good games, that might be a good thing. But why not make a kickstarter for that then? Your publisher is Sekai, you have of alot publicity there. They can help you with increasing publicity for your kickstarter. It dosen't make sense.\n\nThen again, if your just trying to make Steam-standard VNs for the others on steam to be introduced to Visual Novel scene, then I guess you kinda failed there. Flight Diary and the other actual VNs from Japan publishers that posted their games on Steam have it down pat.","June 25, 2015","false","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Your only decision is who you like more between 2 or 3 girls. The story is linear and resolves itself too easily. You end up turning the antagonist into a kind person without effort. Most of the story is just you being called a pervert and walking into bathrooms. Other than that the story is repetitive and you end up just reliving the day except with maybe one different event per day. The game also does not have any replay value because the story always ends up being the same.

The backgrounds are dull and there aren't enough of them; they get over-used. You're really just left with a handful of soft-core cartoon drawings of breasts. Most "players" would be better of browsing deviantart instead of paying for this, or reading a smutty manga.\n\nThe writing is the worst. It's unbearably tedious to read. If this game only took an hour to play it would still be an hour too much of such awful writing.\n\nThe story is a mass of tired cliches that do nothing to help that the text itself is over-wordy, repetitive drivel and the characters are worn-out tropes. The writer needs to seriously improve their skills.\n\nWithout some kind of story, and engaging text to give it some context, the artwork has no special value over any picture of breasts you might find. This isn't really a game, and the bad writing gets in the way and makes it worthless as as novel.\n\nThe English-language PC implementation is shaky too. The text runs off the bottom of the screen and goes over the top of the menu text items - a lot. Maybe it's a font problem, but Sakura Spirits doesn't have the same problem. And Japanese voice acting? It's probably the least bad part of the game, but I can't understand a word of it so... It doesn't make the bad writing go away.\n\nAs for porn? It's not that either, it's just mild smut, you might find in dozens of manga, but not as good. Give it a miss.","April 24","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
