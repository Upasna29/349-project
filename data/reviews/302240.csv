In practice, however, it's like an odd mix between actual old-school shooters, like the iconic Painkiller, and a realistic military experience, like Battlefield or Call of Duty.The result is a game with a wobbly first-person camera, realistic guns that have a hilariously bad accuracy, and enemies that are more or less bullet sponges.The actual shooting is also disappointing, as it seems that the only accurate weapon is the sniper one. Enemy AI is also erratic, as sometimes foes will just run in the middle of the battlefield, while other times they'll just shoot at you from huge distances.The actual levels are relatively well designed but, while they suggest the idea of an open environment, they're mostly filled with invisible walls.In terms of graphics, Chernobyl Commando is adequately bleak for the desolate environment, but its colors are a bit too washed out for its own sake. The soundtrack is utterly disappointing, not just because it's generic but because it consists of around 30-second clips that loop around in a disjointed manner. The voice acting is mediocre and relies a lot on military slang that doesn’t impress anyone.What's more, the game lacks any sort of multiplayer.Chernobyl Commando is an utter letdown. From the shooting to the movement, the actual content, or the visuals, the game disappoints in all sorts of ways. Overall 4/10.","September 29, 2014","false","4.9"," 124 of 146 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","124","146","2","0"

Yes, you can carry lots of guns, like 40 sniper-rifles and a silenced pistol that fires peas, and even if the bugs that haunt this game calm down, your super-soldier-friend-that-is-Rambo-and-Charlie-Sheen-combined-and-never-dies has killed all of the enemy AI, who, in most times, stands in the open because hiding in cover is too mainstream.

I'm far too INSULTED with how bad it is. I didn't expect much, especially given that I bought this game solely on the principle is was really cheap at the time and called "CHERNOBYL COMMANDO". I didn't say I was expecting much but holy ♥♥♥♥. This has to be the worst FPS I've ever played. For starters, the first thing I notice is the game is really bloody dark and you can't at all change that. The graphics settings aren't even an option, you have to back out of the game entirely and start the launcher if you want to adjust. What is this, 2001? The game's super laggy and runs like my computer is a toaster. Turning down the graphics didn't really fix this. 10/10 optimization; already off to a good start I see.\n\nThe next is; there is no run in this game. "Forward" is equate to a casual stroll through the park and the "SPRINT" (I dare call it) ups your speed by about 75% for LITERALLY 10 feet. I say again; LITERALLY 10 feet (about 2-3 meters)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441971769\n\nYeah, see this crap? I started on the closest edge of the shadow. THIS is where your guy tires out. And he takes about 30 seconds after that to catch his breath. Didn't know you could join the CHERNOBYL COMMANDOS now regardless of being an overweight asthmatic. I should also note; this is a game where you do A LOT of walking with A LOT OF NOTHING to do.\n\nThe third thing I notice after about 10 minutes of god awful game-play is when I go to look up at the sky.. For some reason I can't explain, THE SUN IS BLUE. What? Why? I'm not going to nitpick this WEIRD "aesthetic" choice but why?... So I go on for a ways, I'm in some weird middle-ground between "Oh god what am I doing with my life" and laughing my ♥♥♥ off with the friends I'm streaming this for, at just HOW BAD THIS GAME IS.\n\nSo I'm about 30 minutes into the game on like.. level 3 or 4 or something, and I climb a ladder. Now, this is a ladder I *have* to climb to progress the story. I get stuck inside the ladder about 3 different times. I'm forced to restart, play the first 3-5 minutes of the level again up to that point and try over and over until the game finally lets me climb it. Alright, I do some sniping bit then have to climb back down. Joy. So now we're near the end of the section and there sits a truck we escape in. Thank god, no more walking! The truck travels at about 5 miles per hour and is stuck to invisible rails. The turret in back I'm forced to man is hilarious, as it has no ammo, cool down, or reload. That's right, you can just hold the trigger down as long as you'd like until you get bored. Doing this causes the muzzle flash to break away from the gun and drift off the screen somewhere. I'm in tears by this point.\n\nThe next loading screen takes about 10 minutes like they all seem to, I get bored and turn the game off. Me and another friend joke about how this must be some piece of crap FPS from the early PS1 era, to which he jokingly tells me he'll look it up. A couple moments later he returns with dread in his voice. "It came out last year..." We stop laughing.\n\nTL;DR - A complete piece of crap, 2/10\n\n(1 point for the fact it ran\nanother for the laughs me and my friends still have to this day about it.)\n\n>"So you don't have anything good to say about it??"\n>Sure I can say something good about this game!\n>The main menu music was okay, but I wager it was probably stolen.","May 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 46 of 46 people (100%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","100","46","46","27","2"

Guns are all similar sounding and flat. Enemy AI is questionable at best. Enemies are all like the same guy in 4 different outfits. The AI buddy is a awful driver, goes like half a klick an hour, in circles around the area on one driving part. The aircraft are ugly, out of date, and the Yak-141 is being used as a low-alt level bomber, lol.\nIt's choppy and when it auto-saves the thing grinds to a halt. The music is all re-cycling 30 second clips, usually just when enemies are around, allowing you to never be ambushed, and always know when an area is clear\n\nWhat isn't garbage is generic. All the missions are pretty much the same go to checkpoint, killing everyone in the area, where you either get a radio message, or 'interact' with the same 3 faces, who don't blink and who's mouths don't move when they talk. Then, kill your way to the next checkpoint.   Had one sniper overwatch mission, which lasted 45 seconds before you had to move in.  Vehicles aren't destructable.

Lets be honest then, There was only 3 good things in this game, no long cutscenes, animated menu with perfect looking (in game is much much uglier) and game idea / plan, and of course Chernobyl and Pripyat. Well... first thing i noticed, Lada Samaras and 1960s Dodge Chargers rusting on Red zone? Never seen or heard before (They said "perfectly and carefully remapped Red Zone" ?). Bad and stupid Al, lot of bugs and lag. Map barely looks like Chernobyl and Pripyat... and textures etc are low quality. Also killing enemy is even hard with turrets, but they can kill you with few shots. Also, you wear all weapons with you all the time. (4 heavy sniper rifles, AK47 and SMG, and 9mm silenced handgun).

And no, it's nothing like STALKER, so don't get your hopes up.  It's better described as Call of Duty without money.  And really nothing more.  You go from waypoint to waypoint, using your guns to shoot people in the fashion we're all familiar with: iron sights, head shots, grenades, take cover to regenerate health, get insta-killed if you stray too far from the path.

But what Call of Duty has never done before is giving us the same game in less than a year. And that is what the developers of 'Chernobyl Commando' have done.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/302250/\n\nAbove is my review of Manhunter, and practically everything I said in that review applies here. Weapons (except for one), sounds, music, Enemies/NPC's, animations, and length are all exactly the same. This is one of the most blatant examples of reusing assets in any game I've ever seen!\n\nAll the negatives aside, if I were to pick which one is better, 'Chernobyl Commando' is my choice between the two. It has an actual story and an ending to that story. Easily the best part of the game is the setting of Chernobyl and they actually did a good job of how it looks. Run ' n gun segments are broken up with sniping or turret sections. It's still repetitious and practically every level has a turret section where you mow down 100 enemies within a few minutes.\n\nIs this a good game? Not even the slightest. But Chernobyl Commando does have some charm to it, and in a few places you can tell someone gave a damn when they made this thing. I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone though, the flaws far outweigh the few positives.","September 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugarypolecat/recommended/302240/","sugarypolecat","SugaryPoleCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugarypolecat/","832 products in account","I am not recommending this game,  and here’s why:\n(For those who don’t like to read, skip to the end for the summary.)\n\n\n\nAfter 5 minutes of adjusting the video settings, I've figured out that 1024x768 (on my screen at least) doesn't show the TEXT on the main menu buttons. I had to switch to the highest resolution possible to see them. That's about it when it comes to resolution, but what about the graphics? Well, they are not terrible. On max settings it looks like a decent game in 2005/2004. Well it  doesn't have the ‘UnrealCryChromeEngine 8’ graphics like in ‘Return to Dead Island: Boat Flipping Zombies’. I actually kind of appreciate that they’re not ‘ChromeUnrealCryEngine 9’ graphics, because right now this game’s graphics remind of the good old gaming days back in 2005. Right in my nostalgia…\n\nThe audio... is just ok. I tried to make the dialogs louder, but I can't. I have to come up to the guy that's talking to me and grab his genitals to hear what he's saying. Thank you gaming god for the subtitles. The gun sound are 'Meh' which means: Ok. Not great, not bad, just OK. The good thing about the audio is that you can clearly hear when your Commando is tired from bobbing his head around while sprinting for 7 seconds. More or less 7, I didn't count. The voice acting however is not bad. It’s good. Wish I could hear it a bit louder though. The music is not bad either, although you can hear the where it loops, because it pauses for a brief second or so. My only problem with the music is that it never stops or changes for almost an entire level.\n\nThe gameplay is boring. Shooting enemies is boring. Firing your gun is boring. Right after you start the game you get a driving cinematic. You are not the driver though, you are holding the gun at the back of the truck, standing there patiently, unable to do anything besides looking around, until you get off of it. It would be fine, a good way to introduce you to the setting/story/characters or whatever, if it wasn’t soooo ssslllooooowwwww. I think I saw a cat walk by us and he was moving faster than us. That slow driving though had one positive thing in it though: I was able to get my tea and toasts, pour ketchup next to my toast and take a quick leak in the bathroom, without hitting my ESC key to pause the game. An achievement nonetheless!\n\nThere are too many turret and driving sections. It looks like this: go around, shoot 50 guys (your ammo doesn't end by the way, feels like infinite ammo) then you have to get on a turret, becuase your companion has to do something, or as he says it: "Time to get serious". Sometimes though, you have to sit on A MOVING turret! YAY! The only downside to that is: the driver decides to take a leisure drive through a warzone. Last time I checked, you don't drive like that through a warzone.\n\nWhen you fire your gun it looks more like a Nerf gun for kids, rather than a real gun (I was at the shooting range and fired some guns with my dad, including the AK47 and the USP). The accuracy of ALL your weapons is terrible even if you aim with your sights, which seems to make it even worse (except for the sniper rifles). I had my sights on the guy that was ~25 meters away and missed. 5 times. With the handgun. Then 2 times with the scoped AK47. I finally killed him with the MP7.\nThe health indicator is there, it’s just very subtle. When you’re low on health the saturation goes down and makes your screen more black and white with more glare than the recent Star Trek movie. It’s basically blinding you, which doesn’t help considering how cheap the AI is. Oh yeah, we’re coming to it, but first: the head bobbing. It’s distracting especially when you’re moving while crouching or while you’re sprinting. It’s over exaggerated. Just a little too much.\n\nThe AI, at least for your friendlies is bad. Very. Bad. I stand in the open, ducking (thinking it would increase my accuracy, which it didn’t by the way), because my excuse for a companion took my cover. So I am crouched there, firing at a guy who is also standing in the open who is also firing at me and hits me a couple of times, whilst I my guy decides that the crosshair is a “restricted zone” and fires around him. Then my ‘companion’ gets out of his cover, ducks behind me and fires at a guy that I can barely see hiding behind a pipe. It would be ok if the ‘pipe-hiding guy’ was not behind the guy that I was firing, so of course, my ‘COMPANION’ had to fire through me. What. The. F.\nSeriously, I saw my ‘teammates’ fire THROUGH EACH OTHER, because some they saw some bloke which they can’t even hit. Oh, by the way, did I mention that the accuracy of your teammates is compared to yours? If not worse? Well now you know.\n\nBut what about the enemy AI? When coming to tactics, it’s just as dumb as your teammates, firing through each other to get you. The only difference is that their accuracy is DEAD PERFECT. They miss about 15% of their shots. Even if you are behind a bush, the enemy is 100 meters away also behind a bush, you can barely see his arm, HE STILL HITS YOU. How does he even see you? HOW? And that’s on Easy. On hard, it’s even worse, because you take less hits before you die. The good thing about Easy is that you feel like a ‘bullet sponge’. I only die, because I can’t see the enemy, but they can see me no matter where I go. You think you can stealth this? Well hold on to your pantaloons, because you can’t. Most of the time. You take one step, the enemy is not even facing you, and they don’t know you’re there, you take another step an- ohmahgawdthey’reallfiringatme!\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSo that’s my experience with the Chernobyl Commando. I had somewhat fun with it, but it was mostly boring. It looks more like a mod for Half-life 2 rather than a game from 2013 and it looks like it was made by one guy. The price is relatively cheap: 12$ or 9,99 Euros or 7,9 pounds and until October 20th 2014, this game is on sale for 75% off. The game itself is not THAT bad. It’s just boring. You only have what… 6 maybe 7 guns? I’m like past 4 mission (I think) as of writing this review and I’ve managed to fire a USP looking handgun, SMG, Ak47 both scoped and not, a sniper rifle and a Dragunov, so there’s not that much variety in the guns + they all feel alike. You also have grenades which are pretty decent. The game is not terrible, sure the enemy AI is a little bit unfair, but I had fun watching my teammates shoot each other. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there, but you can get easily unstuck and some of them are pretty funny looking.\nSo that’s it. The game is just making me sleepy and tired and not wanting to play anymore and if you feel like it’s a game for you, then buy it, especially since it’s on sale.\nIt is painful to play throguh this game and I had to edit this review TWICE. I really wanted to defend this game, but after playing it for 2hrs... I dried my tear canals, ate my toast, drank my tea, filled myself with biscuits and it didn't help me to feel anybetter.

Over the years games are trying to be more on Direct X versions and cutscene length along with how much story to cram in. There was a time when games did not do that, you played, there were one or two cutscenes and the story was on the back of the CD case or box. Voice actors where not actors, just voices for characters and f*ck was not said every other scentance in an M rated game.\n\nChernobyl Commando is just what it sounds like, the usual terrorist plot and you stop them. Gameplay is just as it sounds. Go to Point A while shooting everything that moves then repeat going to Point B. There are no Ragdolls or Ragdoll physics just simple plain (yet effective) laid out objects. There are no special effects, there are no special exclusive lighting effects and there are no DLC specials, just a pure game that leaves you, basic graphics and settings and your imagination to fill in the rest.\n\nIt's $10 ($5 now untill sale ends,) it's an Indie game developer, it's less then 5,000 megabytes, and it is pure linear unmodernized FPS arcade action and best of all, it's more then 40 minutes in length, (time ranges depending on how fast you are and difficulty from 90 minutes to 3 hours.) It's a throwback to early 2000's for how games where made then and now. Some people call this "shovelware." I call it a budget game that offers more then I thought it would and a game at its basic simple form. It is proof you do not need graphics, sounds or complex stories to have fun. Look for a demo, gameplay videos and the screenshots before purchase because as said before alot of people will not want to pick this up just because it is made so simple and basic.","June 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 152 of 298 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","152","298","4","5"

The pacing is perfect. The variety in level design is plentiful. The voice acting and musical cues are great. The scenarios you find yourself in are unique and groovy.\n\nYou start the game with four guns: An AK47 with a 10 round magazine and a scope that shoots semi-auto with bad accuracy, an AK47 with a scope with a 10 round magazine that's bolt action and has high accuracy, a silenced AWP that has bad accuracy and low damage, and a silenced P99 handgun. You'll quickly find an MP7 and regular automatic AK-47, so the weapon situation is nice and varied.\n\nMy favorite part of the game so far was when my framerate dropped from 60 FPS to 2, maxing out at 4. I played like that for over an hour, and when I restarted the program, the game was back at 60 FPS, so it kinda has a L4D dynamic gameplay thing going on, which is cool.\n\nThere are plenty of useful settings, too. For instance, in the video settings area, there's a checkbox that just says "Birds". Since I love birds, I keep them enabled at all times, even though it might make me lag.\n\nI bought it for $0.99, but even at its regular price of $9.99, it's a steal!

If you just want a simple FPS game to kill time, it is ok and fun enough (at least it was for me).\n\nThere is annoying graphics bugs and it would be nice if there would be more optimizations, but I have played much worse games. Bugs forced me to restart game couple of times, so that is a big minus.\n\nIn summary this is a mediocre game - it does not offer nothing new, story is basic and the ending is totally boring, but I didn't execpted very much from this and I was not disappointed. It was quite enjoyable.

You play as a man who is extremely fat and also has asthma I know this because you can only run about 30-40 meters before becoming out of breath, this could actually may be because of numerous reasons like the fact you pick up everything you find which would make the character very heavy and would also greatly restrict his movement, this brings me on to my next point, your character is the strongest person in the world as he can hold 3 sniper rifles and is still able to move and shoot with accuracy it seems like the weight of the weapons does not restrict his movements, on the other hand your friend has the greatest stamina in the world although as far as I am aware he is only capable of carrying one gun.\n\nWhat is Chernobyl commando about?\n\nChernobyl commando is about some evil terrorists who are from an unspecified area, they are plotting evil however to counter the evil terrorists the Russian government sends two soldiers to stop the operation however there are from what I know an endless amount of terrorists so why the government chose to send two people is beyond me. The terrorists never do anything towards there mission while you are there they only want to stop you, the terrorists are also very stupid because they never help their team mates this makes killing them extremely easy. The terrorists are also very weak because one shot of your gun will instantly kill them.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe graphics of this game are not all bad although it is poorly optimized, whenever you save the entire game lags but leaves you vulnerable for attack so you often find yourself dying after the game decides to save. The game is also extremely hard to play because no matter what difficulty you are on the terrorists will always be the best shot ever as 90% of their bullets hit you.","November 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 27 of 60 people (45%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","45","27","60","13","4"

There is a lot to like about this game. In particular, I really like the aesthetics. It does a fantastic job recreating what I imagine the post-fallout Chernobyl region must look like, (I've never been there). It gives off a neat atmosphere. The controls are good and the game is a lot of fun with a good variety of weapons. The hit detection is pretty bad, but I suspect that this was intentional because the developers were trying to recreate the feel of firing inaccurate weapons that perhaps were not zeroed in. I say this because I find it hard to believe that they would intentional program a FPS with hit detection this bad. It does not however take away from the fun of the game, (in my opinion anyway). The one glaring flaw that this game has is that the developers felt it necessary to include a a turret gun portion in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL! To me, this greatly reduces the enjoyability of the game. This game needed two turret sections tops. Having one in every level where you are completely immobilized and completely unable to dodge the bullets being shot at you is excessive. Fortunately they were relatively short. I don't think I would pay the full price tag of ten dollars for this, but for the five dollar sale price I got it at, it was perfect and I recommend it.","June 19, 2014","true","5.2"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/recommended/302240/","sharpincome","Sharp Income","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/","1122 products in account","Simple fun for a good price. It feels like (and somewhat looks like) playing a single player campaign for battlefield 2 modern combat - similar graphics, weapons, locations/setting. The differences would be no vehicle combat (which is a plus if you prefer a straight up FPS as opposed to practically requiring a vehicle to defeat your enemies) and also more enemies. Lots more bad guys to shoot at so it keeps you involved in action a lot more of the time vs. traversing the map.\n\nThe engine is custom built and it has its flaws. Possible compatibility problems (check forums). No vsync option in game. Lag during saving game/loading assets in the middle of levels and occasionally little bits of lag during combat. (But being single-player, the lag just freezes the game for a moment- the game doesn't go on and get you killed like in CS or BF.) It feels like the game struggles to pick up some of the controls- as for me, I have to crank the mousewheel quite a bit to get the game to change weapons for me. I don't know if the engine was designed this way (or just bad user-input design), but I'm able to use crouch and aim-down-sights as both a hold and a toggle in the game. Limited keys you're allowed to bind to. I generally use CapsLock to sprint, but can't in this game; mouse buttons 4 & 5 are not recognized (but use x-mouse to get around that). Specific weapons are hard bound to the number keys and you don't have the option to change/add binds to select a weapon. (for example, you can't bind Z to select your pistol, either press 1 or scroll to it). So with all those hiccups, I wouldn't say the game runs like it's supposed to or would be expected to. For some, that may be a deal breaker, but for me it was playable.\n\nDifficulty is not too bad. The hardest part so far was I think the first rail shooter segment, but after about 4 tries I got through it. Any other parts I died on, I only needed to replay once more.\n\nPersonally, I like the fact that its a simple FPS and sticks to that (vs. using vehicles). I enjoy the environments and weapons. If you can enjoy games that have flaws and aren't top of the line (again, think battlefield 2 modern combat) then the fun factor and quality, despite its flaws, make it worth the price when on sale.","June 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","7","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/302240/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Chernobyl Commando is one of those "budget" shooters that have you shoot through bazillion bad guys on your way to the objective, which usually just leads to another level. Other than the subject matter, it shows no innovation at all, and made no attempt to distinguish itself from the field. With that said, it is a decent FPS, but merely adequate.\n\nThe story is simple: you are Russian special forces and you're fighting the terrorists who went into Chernobyl attempting to obtain radioactive material to be sold to the highest bidder. Russians had the place surrounded, with gunships and planes overhead, but the ground situation is chaotic that bandits roam freely, and it's up to you and sometimes, your buddy Feodor, and sometimes, some allied units, to blast your way through the bad guys with variety of weapons... PDW submachine gun, AK-74 (or 47, can't tell), Saiga shotgun (with a scope?!), Dragunov sniper rifle, pistol (with silencer), sniper rifle (with silencer), and some grenades. Sometimes you get to ride in a technical and use a turret gun. At other times you get to play static gunner as you use a mounted LMG to mow down enemies attempting to retake your position. There's no lean, but there is crouch. This is a modern shooter so if you rest a moment from getting hit your HP will be restored. However, that's not possible on the "gunner" sequences.\n\nAny way, the story takes a turn later and let's say you'll get some glasnost help in a certain Middle Eastern country. But the mechanics doesn't change... You do what you do best... shoot hostiles.\n\nGiven the preponderance of scoped weapons you are meant to engage the enemy at range, and they don't really rush you on easy, so you can basically take a few hits, and hit them when they pop out and change positions. On the other hand, it's amazing how they can hit you with a piddly SMG from 100 meters away. Which is very annoying. Also, the game does often hide enemies behind foliage, forcing you to spot the muzzle flash, and that is quite realistic.\n\nGiven that this is taking place in Ukraine, next to Russia, the lack of RPG is inexplicable. It's guns, guns, and more guns. And nothing but guns. And you are carrying way too many guns, really.\n\nGraphics are actually quite decent, and the enemies are animated properly with good amount of polygons, though below the standard like MW or BF series. And it does support high resolution as I was able to run in 1680x1050 with no problems. There are also variety of graphics option to make sure you get the optimum frame rate. There are occasional kill cams but it seems enemies almost always die the same way. At least they usually die appropriately. If there were prone, they simply fall flat on their face when shot dead (In some games if you kill a prone enemy they pop back up, did a spin, THEN fall dead. This is NOT one of them).\n\nThe sound is actually quite good, with the various guns sounding "appropriate" except the shotgun, which sounds like a slightly thumpier regular gun.\n\nThe levels are a typical "rat maze" one way through, which appears wide open but you are prompted to return to mission area and you have like 5 seconds to step back in or DIE. Really.\n\nThe game did suffered one significant glitch. In the 2nd to final level the ground shown through and the vehicles were spinning like tops. Must be some memory corruption. Then the game crashed. However, reloading the checkpoint worked and there were no issues resuming the game. The checkpoints are quite appropriately placed, neither too long nor too short.\n\nOn easiest level I finished the entire game in 2 hours, and I played relatively slowly, instead of running forward and blazing through enemies. I think I had to reload ONCE when I screwed up one of those static gun position levels. But one easiest, it's a quick game. I imagine on higher difficulty levels it can be a bit more unforgiving.\n\nAll in all, Chernobyl Commando is a budget shooter albeit a "modern" one, and it's not bad, but it's very very mediocre. If you need something simple to occupy your time, and try something from the Russian / Ukranian perspective instead of the Western perspective this is not a bad game to try. However, there are better shooters out there, that are more exciting to play, better pacing, and so on and so forth, and are of even better value than this budget shooter.","January 16, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe too similar to City Interactive's many many "Sniper: [whatever]" games?) you'll notice a ton of reused assets to the point of absurdity. All the guns from Manhunter are there with only the arm textures changed, with one exception: The AK looking gun with the white camo and scope. While in Manhunter this had a 30 round mag and was essentially the best gun in the game, here it has only 10 rounds, the accuracy of someone with severe parkinsons holding a pistol gangster style, and takes many more bullets to do anything.\n\nThe sniping mechanics have been dropped (steady aiming, getting the "this is where your shot lands" dot, wind & bullet drop) and there's not much reason for there being 3-4 sniper rifles(!) in your inventory at the same time. The Dragunov becomes the best weapon in the game since it's got a faster fire rate than the suppresed AWP-like and is the most accurate shooter in the game, though the Barret you get when you leave the titular location (more on that later) may also count. So you're mostly left with the suppresed Walther P99 (technically your best non-sniper weapon, believe it or not), the AK-(47? 74? M? whatever) that's a disgrace to the AK in accuracy AND power, and the MP7 to deal with your absurd collection of soldiers (in very different armors), civilians with guns, gas mask dudes, and later turban dudes.\n\nFor about half the game, you get to "explore" (read: stay along a narrow linear path with no markers and make sure you simultaneously hit every star waypoint the way they intend you to and don't stray from the path or you'll be punished) the place listed in the title: Chernobyl NPP area. Expect this to involve "go to this place, shoot 50 dudes that show up out of nowhere, sometimes visibly spawning in, then do some stationary or mobile turret sections where 50 more dudes will show up, repeat". The one change-up here is later in this section some more heavily armored guys show up that take even more shots (that will miss most of the time) to put down.\nFor the second half, due to a vague statement or two (there's more story in the "About This Game" section on steam than in the game as a whole; most dialogue is basically "there are enemies ahead be careful, time to be serious, let's go")  you're in... Iraq, shooting terrorists in plain clothes that do much more damage than anybody in the Chernobyl area despite having the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and less armor. Many fewer turret sections thankfully, this time mostly on hummers with much more accurate guns.\n\nWhen you finish the game, you're treated to a long cutscene where you and your driver are invisible (seriously? There's very clearly a world model for "you" considering the main menu, and there's no reason the driver shouldn't be there) and the credits roll... and the game just closes when the credits hit the end. Like it became self aware and just gave up on existing. The AI, animations, and mission scripting are exactly the same as in Manhunter; not worth really mentioning.\n\nVisually, it's a slight improvement from prior Silden titles I guess? I mean, some models look like they're pretty surprisingly high-poly for a game with no AA options, but shadowmap resolution is still (estimating) like 256 and the draw distance for them is just as bad.\n\nTime for the real fun: The bugs. Much like Manhunter, you will occasionally need to restart your game after moving to the next level because the game will drop the framerate to unplayably slow, which can cause some hilarity if the level starts in a vehicle. It's even worse when going to the SECOND LEVEL, as the silos and buildings in the area? They all turn into some weird set of flat black rectangles.\n\nIn general it can be fun to run through in 2 hours on easy mode after dropping less money on it in a sale than what a fast food meal will cost you. Maybe someday Silden will get enough cash and attention to join modern City Interactive and Techland in the ranks of Polish developers that have the resources to make a much better title.","January 1, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/302240/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","The positive is that you can technically shoot people with a gun and they do actually die, so the basic premise of the game works on a technical level. The problems start with the game being literally just a reskin of their manhunter game, which is why these came out like 4 months apart (although this one actually works and opens up correctly). You are given three snipers (for some unknown reason, because the bolt action is just strictly worse) and a silenced pistol that you can't use because stealth isn't an option ever. The bad guys can shoot you with machine guns from 200 yards away while you miss them with a rifle, and they always know where you are, and can shoot you from behind trees and bushes where you can't see them. Every level you shoot the same looking guy, or do a turret section, nothing ever changes. You run through these open boring grey levels with 2006 graphics on a 2013 game.\n\nThis game loves turret section more than those old beachhead games, which were turret only. In one part I was on a stationary turret section, then you beat it and the immediately go to a truck turret section (I'm not kidding). Now I wanted to beat the game, because I secretly hate myself, but I was unable to. Because there is no saving besides the checkpoints, you are at the developer's mercy, and they don't apparently get how checkpoints work. In the back to back turret sections I mentioned before, the second one is super long, and as usual you get shot by guys behind trees and bushes from super far away, and you can't see them. Unlike running around however, you can't hide and keep taking damage. Well the genius developers chose that if you die during the second section you have to start the FIRST ONE OVER....... *collective facepalm*. Since I did not know quite how bad and poorly designed the game was, I played on the hardest difficulty. After having to redo both turret sections multiple times because I was getting killed by guys I couldn't see in the second turret section and couldn't do anything about it, I decided to give up. Oh yeah and there is no real story, although that's probably a blessing in disguise. Oh yeah and my favorite part, the explosive red barrels in the game don't actually blow up when you shoot them.

Technically playable but about as enjoyable as eye surgery. Speaking of eye surgery, I'll probably need one after finishing Chernobyl Commando. Not only does its style look awful it makes you strain your eyes every second of gameplay. Hundreds of enemies several hundred meters away shoot at you at the same time from several different directions. Most of them are barely visible WITH scopes... and they like to hide in grass.\nTelling enemies from allies is nearly impossible and battles instantly turn into chaos.

The driver didnt die, the truck didnt blow up, not even a mark on the windshield. So the truck hit me and just drove on and i took no damage so i pulled out my pistol and took one shot at the machine gunner in the leg with a pistol and he die and flipped off the truck and the driver just kept on his adventure. I am not impressed. This game is not the worst ive played but atleast the worst game i've ever played similar to this one you could atleast shoot through a windshield. Theres alot of things i could say in depth about how poorly designed this game is, not being able to shoot through the window of a vehicle comming at you is the worst.","December 29, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
