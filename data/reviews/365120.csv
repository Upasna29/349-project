"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/365120/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","This game is honestly not ready for primetime. I wanted to like it: a classic platformer built around picking up and throwing objects (like Super Mario Bros 2!), with visuals that look like 16-bit+, and a transplant from the defunct XBLIG store which holds a special place in my heart? Awesome.\n\nUnfortunately it's not there yet. The first thing you're greeting by when you get past the start screen is an ugly menu with an enormous font, and about 15 menu options laid out in a two column grid. Even though the menu is a two column grid, you can't push left or right to navigate it, just up and down. The default key bindings are very poor, so I highly recommend you play on a controller. The game features a password system, which sounds like a fun bit of retro nostalgia, but the password system has the letters of the alphabet laid out in a grid... that you can only navigate by pushing up and down. The main menu says "Press Start", perhaps a holdover from XBLIG. If you go to exit you get this hideous developer mode prompt asking you if you're sure you want to exit in huge poorly aligned text strings going across the screen.\n\nWhy do I fixate on the menu? Because it's emblematic of how the game feels unfinished. Enter a level and you'll see that the "coin" count (actually is are only one coin per level, a "hidden" collectible--this could probably be done differently in the UI) is poorly aligned with the heart counter, which is vertical like SMB2 to its detriment.\n\nWhen you move between levels, the map seems to load with the camera facing very far away and then whip across the level with blinding speed to get back to you--this is hard on the eyes and again feels unfinished. This wouldn't be a problem, except in a few levels the camera whips by enemies and plays their sounds, and many of the enemy sounds are very shrill and hard on the ears.\n\nWhen you die, the sound simply stops and the game pauses for a second before fading the foreground to black. The effect looks very strange, the lack of feedback is bad, and it's slow. Consider what happens when you die in classic Super Mario Bros--the little ditty plays, the screen cuts to a lives counter (not applicable here), but I'm saying it shows how visual and audio feedback is part of how you design a game. That's not present in CotCI DX\n\nText boxes, which appear when you talk to characters in the game, has insufficient spacing between words so when you try to read the text it's difficult to follow.\n\nThere's visible tile seams, as you can see in the screenshot. Some bricks look fine but often the tile textures seem unfinished. The backgrounds are wildly inconsistent: some backgrounds, like the one you can see in the screenshot above with the pig king, have a cool parallax effect. Others are static images but animated. Several levels just have pure black backgrounds.\n\nThe entire game the camera feels a little too zoomed in. An important part of designing a platformer is ensuring the right balance between your character being large enough to see and provide details, but small enough so that jumping and moving feels good. Several levels feature points where it's difficult to see far enough around your character to see what you're doing.\n\nMuch of the level design is oddly boxy. Many of the levels are enormous, particularly those that use the gravity-inverting powerup to send you flying through a vast expanse. Big maps are generally a bad idea when designing a game, but they're a temptation for every first-time game designer. Then, platforming or puzzles levels typically are very small and cramped and much of the platforming involves putting low ceilings so that you can't jump near your full height. Because the main mechanic of the game is carrying objects and the developers want to force you to drop the objects to get past certain sections, I understand why they did this kind of cramped design, but it makes the levels feel kinda janky.\n\nAt least two levels that I noticed make it possible to get stuck mid level. One is the puzzle level around mid-way through where you need to pick up an orange guy at the beggining, boost on top of a column, and then throw a icicle guy right. The other is the final boss level, where if you accidentally drop your weapon in the (?) second last phase, you can't kill him. You can restart the current level through the menu, but again it's just a frustrating experience.\n\nThe final boss is pretty annoying in general. If you die, which is somewhat likely as you're learning his patterns, you restart at the beginning of the boss stage. This is fine, except you need to walk a few seconds to get to the boss and then talk to him, and then sit through a cutscene. This is a mistake that many professional games make, but it's annoying regardless.\n\nThe ending is weird, there's a smash cut from the final boss (no effect to see him dying or fade out or anything) into the ending, which is a static image with some text. The text looked like it didn't end properly, but no buttons I tried moved on to the next part of the text, except Enter/Start which just booted me back to the menu.\n\nMy playtime above includes idling the cards, but the game actually takes about 60-90 minutes. For replay you're encouraged to play as a second character, play a boss rush, and play a speedrun mode. I think this is fine value for money, but you should know what you're getting into.\n\nIn general this is a fun game and if you bought it I don't think you'd regret it. My issue is that this is not ready for release on Steam. Playtesting should have called attention to these issues and more, especially the menu/UI stuff which is immediately apparent. If this were an early access title, I'd recommend it and trust the developers would fix these issues, but this has been out for a while and has had some updates. It's beyond me why many of the issues I've raised in this review would have escaped the notice of the developer, and so the result is a game that feels sloppy and unpolished even though the core is a good looking, good sounding, interesting idea for a retro platformer.","May 5","false","4.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Sure, SMB2 was much different from the previous game, but SMB was much different from Mario Bros., which was much different from Donkey Kong. We didn't know what to expect from a Mario game, so we didn't know just how much of an aberration SMB2 would turn out to be. Only later did we realize that SMB2 had strayed pretty far from the blueprint of a traditional Mario game, and although some elements of SMB2 turned up in subsequent games, the Mario series has never really gone back to that well.\n\nCurse of the Crescent Isle does, though. It expands on SMB2's primary mechanics -- riding, lifting, and throwing enemies -- by allowing you to hold enemies over your head or under your feet, and also by giving enemies unique powers you can activate. These new wrinkles lend themselves to some interesting puzzles.\n\nAnd the graphics? Completely adorbs.","August 26, 2015","true","4.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

Warning: the presentation might be a little rough, but it sticks to its 8-bit NES roots pretty closely.  Audio-wise, it transports you back to the magical days of Subcon with each leap and enemy lift then toss.  The musical tracks are also upbeat and cheerful, matching the game's asthetics perfectly.  Highly recommended for fans of Mario Bros 2, 8-bit games, or supporters or XBLIG developers who have moved to Steam.","August 28, 2015","true","5.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

It took some time to get used to the movement, but it works really, really nicely once you get the hang of it. Now, there are some glitches, but nothing major. I flew off the screen twice, but by picking up the enemy that put me up there I fell back into the world again.\n\nIt also has a password system (you get the passwords for each level by opening the pause menu) for easy access to levels you want to play around with.\n\nTwo characters to play with, one male and one female. I'm fairly certain they are identical gameplay wise, I didn't notice any difference at least.\n\nAll in all, this is a really fun (albeit pretty short) platformer that probably anyone who likes platformers can enjoy.

It's just not as polished as a true 16-bit classic, though it certainly has as much charm as the real McCoy. Absolutely worth it for $5 or less!\n----\n----\n"Curse of Crescent Isle DX" seems like it came straight from the Genesis/Mega-Drive. With it's closest cousins probably being Monster World IV and Super Mario 2 (with some Alex Kidd and Shantae resemblances to boot), and it's theme being a fresh take on some kind of loose Hindu-esque fantasy world, it absolutely demands attention from any fan of sidescrollers. Does it have the gameplay chops to back it up?\n\nThere are a few rough edges here or there and it sure is short, even with added modes like Boss Rush and Speed Run, but the answer is "Yes!"\n\nYour main character - you can choose between a guy and a gal - isn't armed with a weapon and doesn't find new items. All they can do initially is jump, and talk to people (there's not a lot of story in the game, but the dialogue on some of the townspeople is very fun), but they soon gain the ability to pick up & toss enemies, and then shortly after that gain the ability to "flip" whatever they picked up and ride them. It's very similar to Super Mario Bros. 2, except with added depth in the form of elemental abilities on the enemies you're manhandling.\n\nFor example, one enemy is a frosty element guy - toss him into another enemy (or water) and you'll freeze them in place to use as a platform. Even fireballs, in classic video game logic fashion. There's a few kinds of elements here - drills, frosties, gravity switchers, size changers, etc. - so for the playtime, they provide good variety throughout. There's also great variety from the level designs, with many areas themed around different gimmicks. Areas with loads of stalactites and stalagmites are designed to be navigated by gravity flippers, for example. There are classic gimmicks like wind blowing sections and ice sections too. It's classic through-and-through. The boss fights are also classically styled, 3-hit, pattern recognition stuff that shouldn't test your patience, but are well made nonetheless.\n\nThe only problem is that the game just lacks some polish. It's not mechanically unpolished at all though. This game *feels* right - the character control is great (which is expected since they can't do a lot). However, the design of some areas tends to break things a bit - you'll throw enemies around and they'll get stuck on collision. Sometimes you won't take damage by slamming into something hurtful from the right angle. Or sometimes you'll get an enemy stuck somewhere and need to restart the current room from the pause menu. It's all tiny things, but they can be annoying nonetheless (especially, I would imagine, during the "Speed Run Mode")\n\nFinally, for a game with good verticality to its levels, there's no way to look up or down. That's just obnoxious throughout. Blind jumps are always annoying, even if the game is super easy.\n\nOverall, "Curse of Crescent Isle DX" is well-made and fun to play; it's just not perfect. Still, it's soooo cheap! Buy it if you like classic action games and sidescrollers. And lets hope that the developer Adam Mowery here gets to make a "Crescent Isle 2" or something someday that's a little more polished and a whole lot bigger :)","December 23, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlazeHedgehog/recommended/365120/","BlazeHedgehog","BlazeHedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlazeHedgehog/","596 products in account","I had bought the original Curse of the Crescent Isle on Xbox Live Indie Games back in the day. It's a short, sweet, unpretentious retro-style action game and I had a lot of fun with it, so the "DX" update had me excited. The new "Monster World IV"-style graphics are definitely really nice, but as much as I hate to say it, it makes the game feel a little more... janky?\n\nThe controls retain the weird, almost sort of "sticky" momentum from the XBLIG version of the game, and the jump physics still take some getting used to. When layered with the new, more detailed animations, these problems stick out even more. It also feels like the game doesn't quite utilize the new animations as well as it could, like my character was playing the wrong animations at the wrong times. The overall "game feel" could use some more refinement, because things are just slightly "off." These are kind of nitpicks, but it's little stuff like this that separates the Marios from the competition.\n\nI appreciate that, while the original game was coded in XNA, this version of the game did not actually demand an Xbox 360 controller. I have one, of course, but I prefer to use my Playstation 2 Dual Shock through a USB adapter, and most games don't give me that luxury. Crescent Isle DX does, and I am thankful for that. That being said, it would appear that if I take more than two screenshots, the game screen disappears and I am left staring at a black window. It also crashes within seconds on my Windows 10 laptop. Neither of those things are great.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yeah, I guess. This new version exposes some flaws that the older graphical style hid a little better, and the game is rough around the edges in other minor ways, but it's still playable and offers up a charming game mechanic. Plus, the new graphical style is pretty great. That's worth the asking price.","April 25","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Looks great and reminds me personally alot of a Master System game with it's use of colors. Seems mainly inspired by Super Mario 2 along with drawing elements from the Wonder Boy/Monster World series. Fairly easy and simple to complete, which isn't really a bad thing. Some games tend to go a little to far trying to replicate that "Nes Hard" type of gameplay. Crescent Isle feels more natural in it's difficulty and more like something that's made to be casually enjoyed.\n\nDoes have a few flaws and bugs at times that can force you to restart the level. Mainly when dealing with losing a monster that you need to complete the level with and not being able to acquire another one. Controls feel very responsive and fluid. The musical tunes are fairly good and catchy. The extra modes and the music player are some nice additional touches. I also like that the game uses a password system, which gives it even more of an authentic retro game feel.\n\nYou probably already know whether or not you like these types of games. So if old school style platformers are your thing, you should get an enjoyable experience from purchasing this.","March 11","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/recommended/365120/","whatisarat","Dangerous Beans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/","407 products in account","Not bad for what it is. This a retro platformer that mimics the late NES, early SNES era, but not necessarily the best platformers of that time. There's some interesting and creative mechanics involving the way you interact with enemies - especially that you're not really supposed to kill them - and that actually deserves a significant thumbs up.\n\nThe disappointing part of the game is that the controls are not so great. It's been a long time since games like this were in the mainstream, and back then controls like this would have merited a 6/10 rating in a game magazine. You can get around, but everything feels "slidey" and a little goofy in places. There are also some unusual quirks to the jumping behavior and I'm not sure if they were intentional or if they were simply a lack of experience with the genre on the part of the developer.\n\nFor example, in most platformers you have to release the button while standing on something before you can jump again, but in this game you can release it for a split second while you're airborne and then you'll bounce (into another jump) when you hit the ground. Also, if you jump into a ceiling you don't start falling immediately, but you can hold the jump button and 'slide' against the ceiling until your jump force runs out. Usually these kinds of quirks are bugs, but there are several places in this game where they seem almost necessary, so... Who knows?\n\nOne thing that I DO know is a bug is that the game does not save my graphics settings when it closes. I set it to fullscreen 1080 and when I started it again later it was back to windowed 720.\n\nAnyway, despite these strange quirks and minor issues, it's a decent platformer for $5 and it's fun to play. If it looks interesting to you then go ahead and check it out.","August 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"
