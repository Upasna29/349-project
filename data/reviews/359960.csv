"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/recommended/359960/","dingledots","Dingledots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/","941 products in account","Before getting into the review, I'd like to state that I'm writing this  from the perspective of a smaller streamer. While streaming, I averaged about 10-15 viewers (with about 10 of them participating in chat regularly). Please keep in mind that I am not taking offline mode into consideration for this, but do know that there IS one.\n\nThe question I'm sure you're asking yourself is whether or not the game is worth it as a streamer. My answer for that would be absolutely, but you need to keep a few things in mind. Due to the nature of the polls for the game and the rather spammy need for your viewers to participate, your chat will be flying by. It may be hard to keep up and interact with chat, so if interaction is a main focus of your stream, you need to be aware. I value interaction highly, and I found interacting to be a bit harder to do, but it isn't impossible.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward for the game: kill everything and platform. That's basically it. The incredibly unique twist that this game provides, however, is that your viewers decide HOW you kill things and HOW you platform. Are you going to kill them with range, or melee? Are you going to smite them with thunder, or freeze them? Are you going to be constantly jumping, or will your jump height be higher? These things, and a ton more, are features that your viewers get to decide on. The decisions your viewers make do have a huge impact on how you play the game, and they can make the game much easier (I'm looking at any nice Captains that just spawn hearts) or a LOT harder (I'm looking at you, spikes and pogo).\n\nThe first few levels are incredibly easy, and it definitely does get harder as you get further. After being stuck in the first area (the first 25 levels) for the first few levels, I was starting to get a little tired of the repetitiveness. Once I unlocked the new area with new enemies and new obstacles, however, the newness was instantly refreshed and the game was exciting once more. As the progression gets further, I'm sure there are even new features for the game that will keep it just as fresh as the first hour. This is a sign of a very good game.\n\nAesthetically, the game looks charming. It isn't super high quality, but it looks nice enough and definitely has its own style. The music is alright, but it's nothing too great. I got tired of it after 3 hours or so, and put on my own music, but the music isn't bad. Technically... I did have issues. I had frequent (every 10-15 seconds) frame drops/screen freezing, and the audio kept making a strange popping noise whenever I killed an enemy, but I think that is less a fault of the game and more a fault of my computer which is starting to get a bit old. The screen freezing did impact my gameplay, sometimes causing deaths that I felt unfair, but it wasn't too much of a problem.\n\nOverall, Choice Chamber is a phenomenal game to stream and an absolute joy to play with viewers. It will help you determine which viewers want you succeed and which don't (just kidding, they'll all try and screw you over anyways). If you're a streamer looking for a game to play in which your chat can influence what happens, look no further. Choice Chamber is the choice to go with.","July 16, 2015","true","6.1"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","41","47","3","0"

I didn't want to stream it, I thought that I wouldn't reach to enough streamers.\n\nIf you are an streamer, just purchase this game. Choice chamber is open source for interaction and trolling. With votes of your community, it will become even more funny.\n\nIf you are not streamer, but curious as like me, you can still get it. Offline mode gives you random items, chances, possibilities. Still playable and enjoyable. Requires skills (for Pogo jump, lol).\n\nOnly the problem is singleplayer, the system doesn't choose every poll. Espicially gizmo one. I don't know if it's only me but still I'd like to hear something from devs and it is my feedback. I want to play offline mode without restrictions cause the game starts get harder harder :c\n\n84/100","January 24","true","4.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aazzdos/recommended/359960/","Aazzdos","Aazzdos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aazzdos/","695 products in account","This review is from the perspective of a streamer ( twitch.tv/aazzdos ) and someone that has reached Room 475.\n\nChoice Chamber is a platformer.  Your objective is to clear a room of all enemies in order to proceed to the next one.  The defining difference between this game and others in the same genre is that your Twitch chat votes on how the next level will be different, from the terrain to the enemies to your very own weapon.  Voting follows majority rule, and chat has almost full power over how a run will go.\n\nFor the sake of transparency I want to make that last point absolutely clear.  If the majority of chat wants you to fail, then you are very likely to fail.  If you're sensitive to being trolled then stay away from this game.\n\nThe game is very basic, but functional.  There are 25 levels of each 'theme', which have their own handful of unique enemy types and a boss at the end.  I'm quick to praise the variety of enemies as each of them have very different roles, becoming more specialist and co-operative with one another as the game progresses.  The bosses are entertaining and all of them allow your chat to constantly influence the fight in some way.  The last boss in particular is extremely creative, and the 'secret' boss is a fun change of pace between the player and the audience.  The game only 'ends' when you die or quit, but you restart the theme cycle every 100 levels.  From level 101 onwards, enemies are far more numerous and are no longer restricted to their theme.\n\nThere's not much to say about sound or story.\n\nPacing is strange in that the game is difficult at the start due to very limited lives, but becomes progressively easier as your stats increase.  I also find the later themes to have easier enemies than the earlier ones, though this is irrelevant after level 100.\n\nAs much as I want to criticise the glaring balance issues between the choices that can be made, this is probably a design choice to put more power in the hands of the audience rather than the player, and I can understand why.  Beyond that, my only real criticism of the game is that when you reach the higher levels, rooms take so long to clear that chat has far fewer opportunities to vote and participate which might make it dull to watch.\n\nThere are some bugs here and there, even some performance issues, but hopefully these will be fixed in time.\n\nI don't like platformers but I love streaming Choice Chamber for the sole reason that it allows chat to participate in your stream like no other game.  I really hope that future titles take this idea of audience participation and expand on it, especially in other genres.\n\nFor streaming I can easily recommend this game.  For any other purpose I really wouldn't bother.","September 1, 2015","true","95.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
