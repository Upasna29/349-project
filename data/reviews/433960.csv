It’s a game that has me very excited for its future. I haven’t really played an old school style point and click adventure that left me in awe for a very long time so to see this game having this effect on me is more than a little surprising. I honestly believe that this game, if development goes according to plan, make it onto our Steamified Select and then Steamified Countdown after its release. I’m a huge fan and thoroughly impressed.\n\nThus far there is about three to four hours worth of content here. The most important standard features of a point and click adventure game are very well represented here. The puzzles are logical and extremely well designed. The story itself is so far fascinating although I feel that I am not deep enough into it yet for it to even start pulling all of it together. The dialogue between characters as well as that between the game (main character) and the player is above average. The art work and the sound are strong enough to aide the immersion process. It’s just a very well rounded product. And that’s without ever considering the intelligent innovation that is, for me, the absolute highlight feature of Shadow of Nebula.\n\nIntelligent innovation in adventure games, especially point & click adventure games, do not come around often.  When they do the game captures my attention. I believe that is what Bisonia have absolutely accomplished with what they are billing as their CyberSpace parallel world game. Early on in the game you get to create the pieces of a CyberSpace scanner. With this scanner you can scan the various people that you meet. The people that you meet early in the game have all had their real life brains scrambled. They have become mentally handicapped due to overdosing on drugs. However, a miracle happens when you successfully complete the scanning mini game. You enter your portal and visit their scanned address. You are able to speak with them through CyberSpace. Imagine if someone was brain dead in reality and you were able to speak to them as if everything was normal in a physical Internet chatroom. That’s what the CyberSpace parallel world game allows you to do. Not only is it innovative but it’s a fantastic feature that really allows the game to push through important story elements.\n\nIt’s this feature and the way in which everything demonstrates that this is a passion project by gamers for gamers that has me thoroughly impressed at this stage of development.   At $4.99 Shadow of Nebula is an outright steal. When all of the content is added you’re going to be thankful for purchasing it during early access and if not then sorry that you missed out at this price point.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I stopped playing for many years, couldn't find good game for me, until now. This game brings back my memories and remind me my childhood. Beautiful art, a lot of very intelligent puzzels to solve, good music and addictive gameplay. Couldn't stop when started.\nGood work guys! Waiting for more!!! Hope You will not finish on this title. I'd like to see more advanture games from Your studio when I will finish with this one!","March 11","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
