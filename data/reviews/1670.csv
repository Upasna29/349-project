So if you're going to play this game then first you really should read the manual carefully (you can find it under the LINKS column in LIBRARY) and play two tutorial missions (which only cotains basic guides to drive and operate the turret, for advanced stuff you will have to read the manual) then practice with a mission to figure out how things work. Of course it will take time but if you can get used to it you'll find that it's actually a good game! However, please keep in mind that this game is old (a decade ago) and as I said it's a REAL tank simulator, so if you are interested in tanks but also a fan of fancy graphics or fast paced action or... both, try World of Tanks or something else!","February 25, 2014","true","4.3"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","72","82","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sad_baxter/recommended/1670/","sad_baxter","BAXTER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sad_baxter/","237 products in account","Pros - One of the few tanks sims that exists. Limited but fairly accurate and enjoyable, with high degree of customizability for realism settings. Includes mission/map/object editor. Co-op multiplayer allows up to 3 people to command a single tank.\n\nCons - Confusing and likely not enjoyable for anyone who doesn't like simulators or has no clue about tanks/armored warfare. General clunkiness and quite dated. Good luck finding any user maps.\n\nThere is a demo for this game, if you're on the fence track down a copy and give it a try.\n\nIt's one of the few tank sims that actually exists so it doesn't have much to be compared to. It's reasonably accurate and entertaining but is extremely clunky and poorly programmed, going by how many loading screens you'll go through switching from menu to menu. Customizing individual graphical/realism options (other than putting it to low/medium/high/etc.) requires you to close the game and run a cfg.bat in the game directory.\n\nDespite being old and with a questionable build quality I haven't had any mysterious crashes or other game breaking bugs or issues despite running it on windows 7 64 bit, which actually makes it more stable than other current titles I play. The only glaring bug I've found is that you cannot reload the coaxial machinegun at all, the only workaround being enabling infinite ammunition which also gives you infinite shells for your main weapon.\n\nIt's also quite challenging, and it's not helped by the default user settings having the enemy AI at quite a high level. You can't rely on your armor in the first few missions and will frequently have to restart due to your crew bailing out after a single hit. The AI will also spot you much earlier than your AI commander will be able to spot them. Thankfully there are a lot of options for realism settings and you can pick and choose until you end up with something you're comfortable with.\n\nThe manual has plenty of information but is missing one or two details like the penetration of munitions used in game, and it was probably also in color at one point and has not survived the shift to black and white.\n\nThere's nothing here for anyone who does not enjoy simulators, as while it is fairly streamlined compared to what it could be it still is a sim. It is only 5 dollars and there is not exactly a glut of other simulators to choose from. Find a copy of the demo if you're on the fence about it.","February 27, 2015","true","7.6"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

As of the game itself, you will probably like it if you're into tanks and/or simulators. I am. Overall, I am quite pleased with the game. However, this is heavily influenced by its price. For 1,2 Euro, it's a great deal. For 5 Euro, I'm not really sure. You decide.\n\nPros:\n+Terrain can be deformed (craters after explosions, you can dig tank trenches [UBER COOL] etc)\n+Ability to demolish buildings is interesting, reminds me of Frostbite :D\n+Spectator mode allows you to see where exactly did the shells hit the tank, which is both interesting and useful.\n+I like the thermal/nightvision scope :3\n+Rather easy to learn\n+Ability to issue orders to other squads/tanks (though clunky)\n+DAT PRICE\n\nCons:\n-Uninteresting mission design (go over there, kill a tank on the way, you win)\n-Only three (playable) tanks\n-No tank interior, only HUD\n-Bad functionality.. (the game menu and the game itself are separate programs, there are some issues with settings etc)\n-Does not support Steam Overlay (that is to be expected I guess)\n-MULTIPLAYER NOT WORKING!! (if anyone got it to work, PM me please)\n-Not too interesting, yet definitely original setting\n-I feel as if the controls are a bit clunky... Maybe you get used to it as time passes.\n-Physics seem broken if you happen to glitch it\n-Not too many missions (you can download some from the internet)\n-Translation from Russian is funny - why is there "Made in USSR" written on the speedometer? Also, the azbuka  abbreviations to English is weird. Manual covers the explanations though.\n\n\nOverall, the game feels like a low-budget title of some minor Russian developer, but it can be clearly seen they did their best.\nI'm not sure whether I can call this game a real "simulator". It's more of a really realistic tank game (which is maybe even better for me, since you learn the ropes faster, yet it keeps the satisfaction from realistic experience).\nSo, yeah. You decide. I don't regret getting this.","September 4, 2014","true","19.4"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

Then you get the joy of driving arcross an amazing landscape with stunning unique features such as trees, rocks, and grass. After that you get a taste of the action by shooting a bunch of angry dirt farmers who are armed with some never seen before rolling techinques which can evade high explosive tank rounds and machine gun fire. Then you get to engage in tank to tank combat, in which you battle it out against a tank crew with the skills of Helen keller. As you progress you get the opportunity to command soldiers that you found at the resource center and tanks that have stage freight.\n\n10/10 would shoot rolling dirt farmers again.","October 11, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","1","2","0"

I don't know if there's multiplayer and wherther you can crew with your friends.\n\nEven if you love tanks and are knowledgeable, the controls are horrible and the game doesn't do a good job of explaining them and aspects of your tank, or the controls for your other crew positions.\n\nDo you know the Russian abbreviations for different ammo types? What's "BPS", "OFS", "BKS", "UR", and "P" mean? If you don't know tanks, then you won't know the English of these and just what they are. (APFSDS, ATGM, HE Frag, HEAT, etc) What keys do you use to select these? Once you figure that out, how do you begin loading? That's done. Fire control? Manual or laser range adjustment? Now how do we fire the main gun :P\n\nI like this game but the controls are really bad and aren't good even after you've figured it out and fiddled with them. It would've been IMMENSELY helpful for things to just be labled on your UI, showing the controls and tool tips. edit: Having a second monitor might help but tabbing around windows is also slow, weird and odd.\n\nAnyone who thinks they'll have a hard time whether they don't like clunky controls in other games or don't know too much about tanks, won't have a good time.","June 5, 2015","false","24.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The first time I booted up the game I tried to skip the introduction, and immedately the entire game crashed. So I relaunched, still couldnt skip intro. So i waited the 2 minutes for the intros to be finished and then proceded to look for a tutorial. I could find no such thing. I later discovered that the game comes with a manual that you have to boot up independently. But not knowing this I figured I might just go ahead and give a level a shot. So I selected a level and clicked start and the game crashed. So I tried again and it loaded up. To put it simply it took me 5 minutes to figure out which position I could drive from and then another 5 to figure out how to go forward. The commands are not exactly user friendly and are not at all where you would expect commands to be. After much trial and error I managed to learn how to drive my tank. It took me an equal if not longer amount of time to figure out how to shoot the gun. And when i finaly did shoot the gun the game crashed.\n\nLong story short if i had a second chance I would not have purchased this game.","December 31, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

Other people have the same problem with no apparent solution.\n\n\nEnglish and Español\nOne of the few tank games in steam, is not perfect but is better than  nothing.\nThere are 18 missions with T-34-85, T-55 and T-72 tanks, you can adjust the difficulty and realism with the cfg file. I recommend to read the manual.\n\n\nDe los pocos juegos de tanques que hay en steam, no es perfecto pero algo es algo.\n\nEl juego consta de 18 misiones, usando tanques T-34-85, T-55, y T-72, puedes configurar la dificultad y el realismo en el archivo cfg, lo cual recomiendo pues este juego es dificil, ya que requeriria de multiples personas para jugarlo cada una en una posición diferente dentro del tanque ademas de que creo que la estadimetria no esta bien explicada.\n\nRecomiendo revisar los controles dentro del juego pues son mas claros que en el manual.","January 6, 2015","false","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
